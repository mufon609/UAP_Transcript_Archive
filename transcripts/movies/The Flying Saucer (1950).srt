1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:46,680
It's no laughing matter the way I feel this morning I shouldn't be laughing at anything

2
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,960
now look Hank one's fun but there's a limit you call me up in the middle of night you

3
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,360
tell me to grab a plane to Washington and now all this malarkey about flying saucers

4
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,520
of course most of these reports are obvious nonsense brother you said it a lot of highly

5
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,720
imaginative people some neurotic I'm just playing liars all swore they saw the flying

6
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,280
saucer we tracked down every report across examined every witness and found out it was

7
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,480
all about not all of it like some experts commercial and Air Force pilots also claim to

8
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,280
have seen it you're not trying to tell me you really believe there's a flying saucer I'm not sure

9
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,160
there must be a spark of fire somewhere under all that smoke well even if there is one hang

10
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,320
what good is it well if it's true what the expert witnesses say it'll outfly anything we can put in

11
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,920
the air they works on a revolutionary principle that we can't even guess at yes Mike it appears

12
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,840
it was designed for one purpose to carry the atomic bomb now the first country that learns

13
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,040
the secret of the flying saucer will control the skies of the world I don't want that country to

14
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,960
be Russia if there is such a gadget how do you know the Russians aren't the ones who already

15
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:02,000
plan because we have reason to believe they're looking for it too one of our undercover agents

16
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,800
has been working inside a communist group that's been operating around this district you know

17
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,600
huh used to be quite a town there still is a last report from our man said that some Russian Air

18
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,400
Force officers had slipped into the territory from Siberia he heard that they were trying to

19
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,040
locate the flying saucer somewhere near the Taku Glacier Russia apparently knows something

20
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,080
that we don't it certainly is a tip worth investigating don't you agree oh sure all

21
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,160
party a job I suppose but what's this all got to do with me because you're going to do the

22
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,120
investigating for us are you nuts or something if the whole intelligence service in the Air Force

23
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,360
can't find it just how do I figure because you were born and brought up in Alaska because my

24
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,000
old friend your father still owns most of the timber and the gold mines and the fisheries and

25
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,080
the part of the country we're interested in so that qualifies me as a bloodhound huh it qualifies

26
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,880
you as a native any of our men would be immediately suspected because they're strangers oh what about

27
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,560
that guy you already got planted up there well it's just possible that something may have happened to

28
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,480
him since we got his last report now when you get to Alaska I'm not going to Alaska I'm having too

29
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,800
much fun in New York besides my polo team starts practice tomorrow at Meadowbrook man of distinction

30
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:22,880

31
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,880
a good two-fisted drinker so we'll plant it in the Alaska papers that you're coming home to

32
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,640
recuperate from a nervous breakdown a nervous breakdown I feel fine you'll feel even better if

33
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,560
you take this job Oh look Hank it just won't work so why don't you get yourself another boy Mike I'm

34
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,160
not asking you to do this for me I'm asking you to do it for the country I gave my country five years

35
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,400
of my life that's enough how would you feel if tomorrow a flying saucer would drop an atomic bomb

36
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,960
on every key city in the United States would you feel you've done enough all right all right

37
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,640
stop waving the flag I'll go but I won't like it by the way I was talking to your father an hour

I was beginning to feel a little better when we were cruising up the inland passage I

54
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,840
almost forgotten there was such a thing as beautiful scenery outside of a nightclub

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:18,920
this little caper didn't help my disposition and the taco glacier in the end of our journey

63
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,640

80
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,520
it's a funny thing when I was a kid I used to think was wonderful up here in the wild

81

of course who all this wonderful fresh air and sunshine I never knew it could be so warm in

95
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,160
Alaska in summer yes sometimes it's as warm as today but the big ice that never melts well you

96
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,200
mean the glaciers I love them you think I'll freeze to death if I take a swim before you're

97
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,960
not pleased to death no but she will maybe yes morning babe oh good morning Mr. Trent she

98
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,280
ain't flying sausage yeah look mr. Trev we've got to be very careful what we do and say from

99
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,680
now on oh sure there's a Russian spy behind every rock and bush you may think it's a very funny

100
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,600
but we're here on a serious mission so you're going swimming who we're supposed to behave

101
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,760
naturally well I'm all for that hey hearts what's your breakfast I'm starving

102
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:22,280
during the next few days the Langley and I followed Hank Thorne's orders at least she

103
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,480
followed them and I followed her many Russian spies were watching us which I doubted very much

104
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,880
they saw only a patient and his nurse supposed to be enjoying the fresh air the sunshine and

105
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,440
the scenery it wasn't hard for me to take when he was a part of the same

106
00:21:33,880 --> 00:22:02,880
if Thorn's agent was still around he never showed himself to us while we were waiting

107
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,840
for him to appear well we weren't exactly standing still

108
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:14,160
hey gidget

109
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,720
Oh, did I make a face down?

110
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Baby, you scored.

111
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
You forgot your thermos, Mr. Prent.

112
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Red six on a black seven.

113
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
I saw it.

114
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Please, Mike, not now.

115
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,880
Oh, why not?

116
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Oh, I get it.

117
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
We're not human beings anymore.

118
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,880
We're still Hank Thorne's stooges.

119
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,880
For Pete's sake, V, how long does this go on?

120
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
I don't know.

121
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,880
I suppose until we finish our job.

122
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
What a job.

123
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
You still don't believe the flying saucer

124
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
really exists, do you?

125
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Oh, sure, like spots in front of my eyes.

126
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
It's a man.

127
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Hear something?

128
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
Yes, don't you?

129
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Jet plane, maybe.

130
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Or probably a meteor.

131
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Traveling in circles?

132
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
We certainly don't think it was...

133
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Of course.

134
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Oh, Hans.

135
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
Say, did you see anything falling in the sky just now?

136
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
Only the Aurora Borealis.

137
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
The Northern Lights, sir.

138
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
With sound effects.

139
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Listen, there was something up there in the sky

140
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
and it wasn't Northern Lights or any kind of airplane

141
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
I've ever heard.

142
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
It was a flying saucer.

143
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Yes, I guess perhaps it really was.

144
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
V, I'm going to Juneau.

145
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Oh no, Mike, you mustn't.

146
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,880
But honey, it's the only thing to do.

147
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
I'll look up some of my old buddies and find out all the dope.

148
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
There must be somebody in Juneau who knows something about these saucers.

149
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Mr. Thorne told us to stay here.

150
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
But we're wasting time.

151
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Mike, we've got to stay here until orders are changed.

152
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
You're prettier than my old top sergeant,

153
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,880
but baby, you talk just like him.

154
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Good morning, Hans. Is breakfast ready yet?

155
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
No, miss, but soon.

156
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
I think I'll take a little walk first.

157
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
Oh, Hans.

158
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,880
Never mind, I found it.

159
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Good morning, Hans.

160
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Miss Langley up here?

161
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
Yes, sir.

162
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
I believe she went for a walk in the woods.

163
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
Fine, I think I'll take a little exercise myself.

164
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Thanks.

165
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Oh, Hans, I just saw a bear.

166
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
They're dangerous, aren't they?

167
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,880
A man was killed by one near here not long ago.

168
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
Phew.

169
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
After this, I'd better stay out of the forest

170
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
when I'm alone.

171
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Where's Mr. Trent?

172
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
He's gone.

173
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Gone?

174
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
What do you mean?

175
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
He's gone.

176
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
He's gone.

177
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
He's gone.

178
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
He's gone.

179
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
He's gone.

180
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
He's gone.

181
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
He's gone.

182
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
He's gone.

183
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
He's gone.

184
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
He's gone.

185
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
He's gone.

186
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
He's gone.

187
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
He's gone.

188
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
He's gone.

189
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Gone?

190
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
What do you mean?

191
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
In a skiff to Juneau, I think.

192
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Isn't there another boat here?

193
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
No.

194
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,880
I must get to Juneau at once.

195
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
There's no way.

196
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Oh, yes, there is.

197
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
There's the barge from the Goldman.

198
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
It always stops here.

199
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
I better get dressed.

200
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
What'll it be?

201
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Scotch.

202
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Look, Mac, we recommend the ride.

203
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
See?

204
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Sure.

205
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
I'll play it safe.

206
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
OK.

207
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
It's a long time since I've been to Juneau.

208
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Looking up some old friends.

209
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
You don't say?

210
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,880
Chuck Thorpe used to come in here a lot.

211
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
You know him, don't you?

212
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
No.

213
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
Spike Ainsley?

214
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Well, you must know old Matt Mitchell.

215
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
He's quite a character.

216
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
Never heard of him.

217
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
Say, uh, what's his name?

218
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Mike.

219
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Mike.

220
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Mike.

221
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,880
Mike.

222
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
Mike.

223
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
Mike.

224
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Mike.

225
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Mike.

226
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Say, uh, did you notice anything funny around here last night?

227
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
You see a lot of funny things in a joint like this?

228
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
No, no, are you?

229
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
I mean, up in the sky.

230
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Oh, sure.

231
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Angels.

232
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
They fly over Juneau every night.

233
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
In flocks.

234
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
So long, joker.

235
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Anybody here seen Matt Mitchell?

236
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
No.

237
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
You seen old Matt Mitchell?

238
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
Not tonight.

239
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
Oh, sure.

240
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,880
There was a guy like that in here a little while ago.

241
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Regular screwball, you know what I mean?

242
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Kept talking about angels flying around at night.

243
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Thank you.

244
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
Anybody here know Matt Mitchell?

245
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
No.

246
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Give me a ride.

247
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Hey, honey, I'm looking for old Matt Mitchell.

248
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
You seen him?

249
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
He just left.

250
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Double ride.

251
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Where's old Matt Mitchell?

252
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
How should I know?

253
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
Old Matt Mitchell around here.

254
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
Right.

255
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
Leave the bottle.

256
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Saves time.

257
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
You're a busy guy.

258
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
I can see that.

259
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,880
You still have a lot of friends in Juneau.

260
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,880
I've been looking all over for them.

261
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
And they're gone.

262
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
They're all gone.

263
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
Is that a fact?

264
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
No.

265
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,880
It's a sad thing to lose all your friends.

266
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,880
It's a sad thing to lose all your friends.

267
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,880
A very, very sad thing.

268
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Sure tough.

269
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,880
How'd you like to make a new friend?

270
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Who are you?

271
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Just a friendly sort of girl.

272
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
You can call me Nanette.

273
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,880
Right, Nanette.

274
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Maybe you know some of my old pals.

275
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
Oh, sure I do.

276
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
I know everybody in Juneau.

277
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
And everybody knows me.

278
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Let's go sit down while we can talk.

279
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,880
That's a good idea.

280
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Not now.

281
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
I just caught me a big fish.

282
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Mike Trent.

283
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Millionaire Playboy?

284
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
That's the guy.

285
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
I spot him from his picture in the papers.

286
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Champagne, the best.

287
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Of course I know old Matt Mitchell.

288
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,880
He always drops in around this time.

289
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
You just stay here with me.

290
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
We'll wait for good old Matt together.

291
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Good old Matt, you said it.

292
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
You tell me the truth.

293
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Everybody else lies, but good old Matt won't lie.

294
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
And tell me what goes.

295
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
What goes where?

296
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Up there.

297
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Way up there in the sky.

298
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Hi, V. What are you doing here?

299
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Looking for you.

300
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Well, that's fine.

301
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
That's fine.

302
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
I want you to meet an old friend of mine.

303
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
What's your name, honey?

304
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Honey, this is V.

305
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Well, sit down, V. Have a little drink.

306
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
You've had enough.

307
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Mike, why don't you do it?

308
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Oh, you think I can't do it?

309
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
I can't do it.

310
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
I can't do it.

311
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,880
I can't do it.

312
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
I can't do it.

313
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,880
I can't do it.

314
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
I can't do it.

315
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Mike, why don't you do it?

316
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Oh, you think I can't sit down for things, don't you?

317
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
And that's where you're going.

318
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
I'm here to find out things.

319
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,880
Very important things.

320
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Mike, we're going back to the lodge right now.

321
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
No, no.

322
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
I've got to wait for a friend.

323
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Old Matt, he'll know all the answers.

324
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Where?

325
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
Near the bottle of wine.

326
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
You're not well, Mike.

327
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
So you need a nurse, do you, Mike?

328
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
Who said I need a nurse?

329
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
I do as I please, eh?

330
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
That a boy.

331
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,880
Better come along with us, Mr. Trent.

332
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Won't take you long to find a boyfriend, did it?

333
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
Oh, Mike, don't be that way.

334
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
I'll be anywhere I want to be, see?

335
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,880
Listen.

336
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
I don't want this job in the first place.

337
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,880
And furthermore, let me tell you that I...

338
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
And furthermore...

339
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Well, I'll be right here if you need me.

340
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
I won't be needing you anymore.

341
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
Goodbye.

342
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Goodbye.

343
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
Hey, V.

344
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,880
Hey, V, wait.

345
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
Hey, Mike.

346
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Let's have some laughs together.

347
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
I better go pretty up.

348
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,880
No cigarette.

349
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Mike!

350
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
Hey!

351
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Hey!

352
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Mike!

353
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Hey!

354
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
Hey!

355
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Hey!

356
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Hey!

357
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Hey!

358
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Hey!

359
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Mike, well, hey, my old friend.

360
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,880
Matt Mitchell, you old walrus, you, how are you?

361
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
Fine.

362
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
See, I heard about you.

363
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,880
You were up at your papi's lodge.

364
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
You know, I was going to look you up.

365
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,880
But you know, I've been so busy entertaining and...

366
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
Celebrate.

367
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Yeah, that's it.

368
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Why do you got to celebrate, you old walrus, you?

369
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
Oh, I'm getting rich, Mike.

370
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Oh, I'm getting rich, Mike.

371
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,880
I got to learn how to spend money.

372
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,880
You sure look like you're in the chips, all right.

373
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Ah, plenty more where this comes from.

374
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
You got yourself a gold mine or something?

375
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
I'm better than that.

376
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,880
See, do you remember that old broken down trowel mine?

377
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,880
Sure, you taught me how to navigate when I was a kid.

378
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Yeah, that's right.

379
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Well, you know, the other day I was ready to junker.

380
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,880
And a couple of the foreigners come in and they write her.

381
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,880
And they're paying me $100 every day.

382
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,880
What are they using her for, Matt?

383
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
I don't know.

384
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
They ain't using her for fishing.

385
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,880
Well, at least not fishing her for fish.

386
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
Matt.

387
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Yeah.

388
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
I got to go back to the lodge and find V.

389
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,880
Go on.

390
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
You still having that old fishing check up the river?

391
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Yeah.

392
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
All right, I'll be up there first thing in the morning.

393
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
There's a lot of questions I got to ask you.

394
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Very important questions, Matt.

395
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
So long, Matt.

396
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
So long, Mike.

397
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Hello, Mitchell.

398
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Let you and I have a little chat.

399
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
Sure, Mr.

400
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
I'd say I'd have a little drink.

401
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
Come on.

402
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Perhaps we'll have better luck tomorrow.

403
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,880
We'll cover this area along the edge of the Taku glacier.

404
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
That's Alex.

405
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Open the door.

406
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Why have you brought him in here?

407
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
I had to, Colonel.

408
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
He was shooting off his mouth in the bar.

409
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Don't push me.

410
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,880
I don't like to be pushed.

411
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
That drunken old fool is harmless.

412
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
He knows nothing of our plans.

413
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,880
Excuse me, Colonel, but he knows too much for our own good.

414
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
How can he have learned anything?

415
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
We hire as both, that is all.

416
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,880
If we let him keep on talking, even to a drunken playboy like Mike Trent,

417
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
someone may start guessing.

418
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
He will not talk anymore.

419
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
It's all right, Colonel.

420
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,880
He'll stay quiet for a while.

421
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
But he's got the thickest skull I ever cracked.

422
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
As long as you didn't overdo it.

423
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
He must be able to walk when we want him.

424
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
He can stay out under his own.

425
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
See that there are witnesses when he does.

426
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
We can dispose of him later from the trawler.

427
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Why, please, won't you.

428
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
Your boyfriend took it on the lam.

429
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,880
He's gone.

430
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:46,320
on the land good riddance if you ask me. Turner Dr Lotton's mechanic at last he's

431
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:53,480
come to us bring him in. Mr Turner I've been expecting you for some time you've

432
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,760
been away I presume flying around here and there very exhilarating air travel it

433
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,080
ought to be two thousand miles an hour as much as that.

434
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:08,920
Sit down. So at last you've come to talk business with me.

435
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,080
Depends on how much you're willing to pay. Depends on how much you're prepared to deliver.

436
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,320
It works. Flying disc itself. Money's right.

437
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,280
I understood you were a believer in our cause.

438
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,280
So I wanted to give you a chance to bid on it before I took it to some other party.

439
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,280
You're a shrewd businessman. Are you dealing in Dr. Lotton's name Mr. Turner?

440
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Dealing for myself. But the goods are in my hands. Dr. Lotton's gone to Seattle to make a deal with the Americans.

441
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,280
How fortunate. Then his experiments are finished?

442
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,280
Everything's perfect or he wouldn't be trying to sell it to the U.S.

443
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,280
And just where do you keep the flying ship Mr. Turner?

444
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Let's talk money first.

445
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Oh let us not quarrel over money. We will pay what is just and reasonable.

446
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,280
A million dollars cash? Agreed.

447
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,280
And now perhaps Mr. Turner you will tell us where Dr. Lotton has hidden his famous flying saucer.

448
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,280
Twin lakes. The other side of the ice cap.

449
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,280
Are you prepared to fly it to Russia?

450
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
He's gone out the window. Wait Alex.

451
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
We'll take care of him tomorrow.

452
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Alex, we'll take care of him tomorrow on our way to Twin Lakes.

453
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,280
We'll take care of him tomorrow.

454
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,280
We'll take care of him tomorrow.

455
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,280
We'll take care of him tomorrow.

456
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,280
Thanks Matt. Saved my life.

457
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,280
Thanks Matt. Saved my life.

458
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,280
Thanks Matt. Saved my life.

459
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,280
Thanks Matt. Saved my life.

460
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
Thanks Matt. Saved my life.

461
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,280
Thanks Matt. Saved my life.

462
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,280
Yeah all right young fella. Take it easy.

463
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
Thanks Matt. Saved my life.

464
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,280
Matt.

465
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,280
Thanks Matt. Saved my life.

466
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,280
Come on there's a boat coming.

467
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,280
Come on there's a boat.

468
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,280
How do you feel old Thomas?

469
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,280
Fine Matt. Just fine.

470
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,280
Fine Matt. Just fine.

471
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,280
It'll take more than one bullet to finish me off.

472
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,280
It'll take more than one bullet to finish me off.

473
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,280
Sure. Sure you're too tough to die.

474
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,280
Sure you're too tough to die.

475
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,280
Why those fellas trying to kill you?

476
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,280
Cause they do what? They take us.

477
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,280
Cause they do what? They take us.

478
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,280
They take us.

479
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,280
They take us.

480
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,280
They take us.

481
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,280
They take us.

482
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:05,880
the dinkus where the saucer was where is it to the side ice cap how do I get

483
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:14,240

490
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,080
invented it what is that

491
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,960
a how this group all called himself Dr Carl Lawton he said he flew down from

492
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,760
Alaska just to see me he offered to sell me the whole works for only ten million

493
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,560
dollars where is he now I'm fighting off the squirrels I suppose you actually let

494
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,680
him get away I'm running

495
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,320
an airplane company not in that house look Fred I've got to find that man you

496
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,880
really think he's got something I know he has and we've got to have it haven't you

497
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,400
any idea where he went to he was sorry when he left he said he was going to fly

498
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:56,480
right back to Juneau immediately and I'd be sorry well I am sorry Hank all right

499
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,360
so long

500
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:23,780
the

501
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,780
Poor old Matt said that no one had ever flown over the ice cap before.

502
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,780
I wasn't anxious to be the first one to try it,

503
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,780
but Twin Lakes was on the other side and I had to get there in a hurry.

504
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,780
I wasn't sure just what I expected to find when and if I got there,

505
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,780
but whatever it was, I had to find it.

506
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,780
Hey, what can I get a plane?

507
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,780
Inside the hangar.

508
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,780
Thanks.

509
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,780
I didn't outline my flight plan to the officer in charge.

510
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,780
His plane was more valuable to him than my neck,

511
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,780
so I kept it a secret that I was going to risk both of them.

512
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,780
Come on, let's keep moving.

513
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,780
Come on, let's go.

514
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,780
Come on, let's go.

515
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,780
Come on, let's go.

516
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,780
Come on, let's go.

517
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,780
Come on, let's go.

518
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,780
Come on, let's go.

519
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,780
Come on, let's go.

520
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,780
Come on, let's go.

521
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:56,780
What made it to Twin Lakes?

522
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,780
From the air, I spotted a solitary cabin in the wilderness,

523
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,780
a place where someone who wanted to hide something might live in safety.

524
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,780
Perhaps I'd find there a place where I could hide my things.

525
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,780
I'll do it.

526
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,780
I'll do it.

527
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,780
I'll do it.

528
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,780
I'll do it.

529
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,780
I'll do it.

530
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,780
I'll do it.

531
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,780
I'll do it.

532
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,780
I'll do it.

533
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,780
I'll do it.

534
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,780
Perhaps I'd find there the secret I was looking for.

535
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:26,780
Perhaps I'd find there the secret I was looking for.

536
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:48,180
I decided to fly back to Juneau immediately and get in touch with Hank Thorn and the nearest

537
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,540
Air Force base.

538
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:54,340
It wouldn't take long to put the flying saucer in the bag with Uncle Sam pulling the strings.

539
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,700
But I soon found out that my gap was running low.

540
01:01:54,340 --> 01:02:12,780
Yes sir, I'm going to Juneau.

541
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:13,940
Are you in a hurry, sir?

542
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,540
Yes, I've got to send a message to Washington right away.

543
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,900
Who were those fellows you were talking to?

544
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,220
What fellows, sir?

545
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,580
The ones you were talking to when I was landing.

546
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,300
Oh, they were just some fishermen, sir.

547
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,460
Asking directions.

548
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,780
Where's Miss Lang?

549
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,500
In the lodge, I believe.

550
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,420
I'll get the gas, sir.

551
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:42,700
Dr. Lawton, the Russians will stop at nothing to capture you and your flying saucer.

552
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,100
They'll never find the disc, young lady.

553
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,340
It's too well hidden underground.

554
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:48,260
Well, that may be true, but you're out in the open.

555
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,500
And if they get their hands on you, they may be able to persuade you to tell them where

556
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,500
the disc is.

557
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,500
Perhaps you're right.

558
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,500
They're quite skillful in such matters, I believe.

559
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,540
Now where was this place you suggest we stay until your chief arrives?

560
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,980
A hunting lodge up the river.

561
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,780
You'll be perfectly safe there.

562
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:03,780
V!

563
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:04,780
Hey, V!

564
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,540
Hey, V!

565
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,340
V!

566
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,860
Kick her over.

567
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:35,860
Kick her over.

568
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,860
Kick her over.

569
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,860
Kick her over.

570
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:05,860
Kick her over.

571
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:55,860
Put him in the chair.

572
01:06:55,860 --> 01:07:04,060
Mr. Trench, you've given us a great deal of trouble.

573
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:06,940
Why didn't you stay in New York with your drunken friends of the night clubs?

574
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:07,940
I sobered up.

575
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:17,940
Mr. Thorn of Washington sent you up here on a mission, is it not so?

576
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:18,940
Never heard of the guy.

577
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,940
He came up here for my health.

578
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:21,940
A mistake, Mr. Trench.

579
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:24,940
Your health will not benefit, I assure you.

580
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,940
Where's the woman who called herself your nurse?

581
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:27,940
I sent her home.

582
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,940
I didn't need her anymore.

583
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,940
She'll be back soon, I'm sure.

584
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:35,020
Like you, she's curious about things that don't concern her.

585
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,020
There's a plane landing now.

586
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,020
Ah?

587
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,020
That must be Miss Langley.

588
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,020
Come in, my dear.

589
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,020
We've been expecting you.

590
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,100
And this is Dr. Lawton, I believe.

591
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,100
Always a pleasure to meet so eminent a scientist.

592
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,100
Turner, what are you doing here?

593
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,100
Mr. Turner is now my valued collaborator.

594
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,100
Oh, don't look so distressed, my dear doctor.

595
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:14,100
Instead of being used to further the imperialistic designs of America,

596
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,100
your invention will now be employed for the good of the entire human race.

597
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,100
Russia will never get it.

598
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,100
I don't see how you're going to prevent it, Dr. Lawton.

599
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,100
And now I think it's time for us all to go.

600
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,100
Where?

601
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,100
For a little trip underneath the glacier.

602
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,100
There's a most interesting passage goes through the ice.

603
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,180
We shall part company on the other side.

604
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,180
Even the so clever Mr. Thorne of Washington

605
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:35,180
will wonder what happened to his friends.

606
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,180
Turn to your left up there.

607
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,180
Come on.

608
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,180
Come on, come on.

609
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,180
Don't shoot!

610
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,180
Don't shoot!

611
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,180
Don't shoot!

612
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,180
Don't shoot!

613
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:29,180
Don't shoot.

614
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,180
Don't shoot!

615
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:24,180
It was only a small bomb, but Turner didn't know it was there.

616
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:25,180
It was only a small bomb, but Turner didn't know it was there.

617
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,180
It was only a small bomb, but Turner didn't know it was there.
