1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Attention, projectionists. Adjust the lens so that your picture will be focused properly before the show starts.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Flying saucers have invaded our planet. Washington, London, Paris, Moscow are key targets. The whole world is under attack.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
People of Paris, attention.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Attention.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In 1952, the Central Intelligence Agency, faced with a huge public interest in flying saucers, brought in a panel of scientists, very senior scientists.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We know it now as the Robertson Panel.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They concluded that there was nothing to these flying saucer reports as objective devices of some kind, but that nevertheless, the government had to exercise great care to debunk the stories and individual civilians who expressed an interest in flying saucers ought to be carefully watched, said the Robertson Panel.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And I believe that to be the founding document, the document giving the long-range strategy that has been followed by the U.S. government.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The general feeling amongst people who have devoted a big chunk of their life to studying UFOs, I think is fear that they have been taken for a ride.

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That these cases are hoaxes, but sophisticated hoaxes carried out by their own government.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What do you want with me?

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's take one step at a time.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We are looking at Richard Doty, the professional disinformer, trained to lie.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm Richard Doty.

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's probably about 80% of false information being presented, about 20% of factual information.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Unfortunately, the UFO community doesn't know which is which.

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And that's your job to keep it that way?

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That was my job before.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm a private citizen now, but back in the early 80s, it was my job to confuse the UFO community.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Doty was representing himself, as I recall, as basically this sort of deep throat.

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Doty had this wonderful way to sell it.

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm with the government, you cooperate with us, and I'm going to tell you what the government really knows about UFOs.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Doty found a lot of gullible people in the UFO community that would easily believe what he said without any type of scrutiny.

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My commander told me, well, there's this guy, Special Agent Doty, and you've got to be careful,

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
because the impression I got was he had made the Air Force a little nervous, maybe.

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
They didn't say, you know, egg on their face or anything, but they were just very cautious.

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The main reason that we in the UFO field recognize the name Richard Doty is that a man named Paul Benowitz,

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
a self-made man, a very successful businessman, was systematically driven insane, wound up in an insane asylum,

29
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
under treatment for a long time, lost his business, had to turn it over to his family,

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and was destroyed by the efforts of Richard Doty.

31
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You hear about the ones that something goes wrong.

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You hear about the ones where there's an unfortunate incident or, in some cases, there are failures.

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It was unfortunate what happened to Mr. Benowitz,

34
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but they were supposed to protect something, and they did their job.

35
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's the part of the base that Paul Benowitz could see.

36
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You can see the Manzano Mountain here, where all the nuclear weapons were stored.

37
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The second Air Force base is the perimeter fence.

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Paul Benowitz's house is right over here,

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and his excellent view was afforded from this exclusive area of Albuquerque.

40
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You basically have a front row seat.

41
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
August, September of 1979, Paul was standing up on his deck and looking out over the roofs towards the base,

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and these lights he saw would probably be about half a mile away.

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There was two of them. They'd lift up from the ground rather quickly,

44
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and then very quickly go around, shoot that way around the side of the mountain,

45
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
then drop down behind it, and they did the same thing every time.

46
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
For anybody, that would pique your interest. What the hell is that?

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He had an interest in the UFO subject.

48
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It was about the only thing he was interested in besides his business.

49
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He had a company called Thunder Scientific.

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It was one of the main instruments for high-profile people like NASA and even the Air Force.

51
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
A lot of people said he was a genius with electronics,

52
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and he decided that he was going to listen in on what was going on at the base.

53
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Maybe he could pick up some radio signals about what this thing was,

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and he knew about where to start looking,

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and he started picking up these bursts of information.

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
When he started to decode the signals, he thought that it had a connection to whatever these lights were.

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He decided it was something to do with technology that wasn't ours.

58
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He was a good American, so he called up the Air Force base.

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They connected him with Richard Doty eventually.

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Paul didn't know initially what he got.

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He didn't analyze it.

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
When he had gotten the first series of transmissions,

63
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
he recorded them, and then he contacted the security officer for Kirtland.

64
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I began a dialogue with Paul, trying to find out everything he had,

65
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and as I did, then I learned that a lot of the information he had

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
wasn't anything to do with a Soviet threat or some kind of hostile threat against Kirtland.

67
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It was information that he had gathered because of the fact he was a scientist,

68
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and because he had sensitive and sophisticated equipment.

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He was collecting emissions coming from the base,

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and we had to decide on what we were going to do then.

71
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Were we going to allow this to happen, or were we trying to convince him otherwise?

72
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They sent Doty and a physicist.

73
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Paul was being occupied with the other guy.

74
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Rick was taking pictures of all of Benowitz's equipment in his house.

75
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The more he had contact with me and others within the intelligence community,

76
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the more he started analyzing the information.

77
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So we kind of planted the seed in Paul that what he was seeing and what he was hearing

78
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and what he was collecting was, in fact, probably maybe UFOs.

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It was very easy to convince Paul.

80
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Paul was a World War II veteran.

81
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He was very patriotic. He always flew his flag.

82
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Those type of people you can convince that, listen, just tell him, Paul,

83
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
you can't tell anybody else about this because it could get in the wrong hands.

84
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So immediately Paul became a cooperating source,

85
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and he held everything that he had gotten in secrecy.

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Doty was feeding this man all kinds of lies about UFOs

87
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and aliens being kept underneath a mountain nearby and so on and so forth.

88
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And Benowitz, of course, was believing all of this.

89
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He had two films of an object flying.

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
One picture depicted an object that looked like it was flying out of the mountain,

91
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and it looked like some kind of saucer-shaped object.

92
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He immediately then thought that there were UFOs coming out of Manzano.

93
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The second film was of an object that was something experimental that the government was doing.

94
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When he filmed that, then again the flag went up that he just filmed a classified project.

95
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Paul made a presentation to the Air Force officials on what he had been doing

96
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and about what he had been collecting.

97
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He showed some of his film. He showed some of his pictures.

98
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He had an audio recorder that was playing the sounds that he had collected from the base.

99
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The highest-ranking person in the room, which was a burgadier general, said,

100
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you have some very convincing information, Paul.

101
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And that kind of set everything in motion with Paul to let him think that, yep, he does.

102
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
From the point he came in and gave that meeting,

103
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
they decided all his perceptions were going to be directed

104
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
exactly the way that the intelligence organizations wanted.

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We'd briefed everybody in the room, so they knew what we were doing, basically.

106
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And so after the meeting, there was a number of questions asked to him,

107
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
what do you want the Air Force to do?

108
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And Paul says, I'd like a grant to investigate UFOs on the base

109
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and a grant to continue this contact that he claimed he had with some of these aliens,

110
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
which, you know, that's a different story.

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
At one point, another agency was conducting an investigation,

112
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and they set up a surveillance across the street from him.

113
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And Paul's son contacted me and said, leave my father alone.

114
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You guys are across the street, and you're bothering my father.

115
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He's getting to the point that he's being paranoid.

116
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, I knew it wasn't us.

117
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He said he saw people coming in and out of the house

118
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and looking out from the curtains and things like that.

119
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And as it turns out, the NSA had some people in this house.

120
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They were watching him and actually beaming messages

121
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
straight across the street into his antenna setup.

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He had started picking up these signals,

123
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and the NSA was scared that anybody could figure that out.

124
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They decided to just take complete control of what he was seeing

125
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and give him exactly what he thought he should be getting.

126
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They replaced his computer with their own computer.

127
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The computer had software that would decode the messages he was getting

128
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and the way they wanted him to see them.

129
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And if you look at the transcript of it, it seems like almost gibberish,

130
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
but because people want to pull out content from a random order,

131
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
it starts to make some kind of sense.

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They said that they were from a planet with no water

133
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and they were trying to find a new place to live

134
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and they wanted to take over the Earth and they can only trust Paul.

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They were going to have some kind of agreement with him,

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
but he said, you can't trust anything they say.

137
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
These aliens are evil and served to make him look silly,

138
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
which is exactly what they're trying to do.

139
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Paul actually thought that these UFOs had to be coming from some other place.

140
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Paul, on his own, went up to Archuleta Peak,

141
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
which is up in northern New Mexico, around Dulce, New Mexico,

142
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and he did his own investigation, basically.

143
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Dulce and Archuleta Peak area had a superstition for many years,

144
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
way, way before we were ever involved.

145
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
There were strange lights and strange stories about that area

146
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
coming from the Indian tribe that lives up there.

147
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If somebody wanted to hide something here, it'd be pretty easy.

148
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's very remote.

149
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's supposedly the site of an underground alien base.

150
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That rumor got started in the early 1980s

151
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
because of what was told to Paul Benowitz

152
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
by the Air Force Office of Special Investigation.

153
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Paul is a pilot and he had a plane and he flew around those areas

154
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and he saw things and he filmed things up there,

155
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that again presented a problem for us,

156
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
because what he was filming up there

157
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
was actually a secretive military installation

158
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that was training commandos.

159
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So then we had to convince Paul that what he was seeing up there was again UFOs.

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The Air Force actually put him in a helicopter

161
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
with Rick Doty the first time

162
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and flew him up to a place above Dulce called the Archuleta Mesa.

163
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And before they took him up there,

164
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
they dumped a bunch of props up there.

165
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
They flew him up there, flew him over the Mesa

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and said, you're right, Paul, there's stuff here.

167
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
There's some evidence of what's going on.

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why don't you check this out for us?

169
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So I would go with Paul up there,

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and we actually camped out there a couple times,

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and we actually saw some things that startled me,

172
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
which were fully explained later,

173
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
but one of the things of interest was lights coming out of the ground,

174
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
but the way the lights, these beams, were coming out of the ground

175
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
in a pulse kind of manner

176
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that it looked like there were saucers flying out of these mountains.

177
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And I actually saw this,

178
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and I was somewhat concerned that maybe Paul stumbled onto something.

179
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Paul was flying what he called his missions up around Archuleta Mesa

180
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and would send back fascinating letters,

181
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
five, six, seven, eight pages long,

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
handwritten with pencil sketches of what he'd seen,

183
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and finally he started sending large format 8x10 photographs

184
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
taken with his Hasselblad in which he'd say,

185
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
well, here's the black atomic-powered ship that crashed last week,

186
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and he'd circle it, and oh, I'd look at that,

187
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and bless his heart, I couldn't see anything that resembled

188
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
or crashed anything.

189
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Something actually did crash near Dulce on the Mesa in the late 1980s.

190
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Benowitz just happened to be flying over and took some pictures of it,

191
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and so the disinformation campaign had to be ratcheted up even more.

192
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The Air Force, they knew it was something that they were testing up in this area

193
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and that had gone off course and crashed.

194
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Of course, they told Paul Benowitz that it was some sort of alien craft

195
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that had been given to the humans to use

196
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and that they had shot it out of the sky as some sort of a lesson.

197
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Agents would break into his house to see what he had,

198
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and at one point he had these pictures of whatever had crashed up there,

199
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and they were very interested in getting these pictures, so they did.

200
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
From then on, he went up and just took pictures of where it had crashed.

201
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What probably crashed there was some sort of unmanned aerial vehicle,

202
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and now they're over in the Middle East,

203
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
controlled, killing people in cars as they drive across the desert.

204
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
In 1985, they didn't really want anybody to have any knowledge of this kind of thing.

205
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They took great pains to explain to him that it was this atomic-powered aircraft

206
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
that the aliens had helped us with and, you know,

207
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
bring down that laughter curtain again so people just wouldn't pay attention.

208
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They'd think it was another UFO nut.

209
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Somebody gave him a satellite picture of the landing area.

210
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
In 1983, he went up there with me and the chief of police for the Hikari Apache Tribe.

211
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
They had made a landing pad, and he took us right to the spot.

212
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
They were giving him this information, some of it was true, some of it wasn't.

213
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And I think that was the biggest problem that he had,

214
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
coping with why this, why not the other, see?

215
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He thought that this was the place where the aliens were getting together

216
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
to take over the world, and he wanted to trap them all there,

217
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
kill them all in one fell swoop and save the Earth.

218
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
By the mid-'80s, he was getting to the point where he had written all these letters

219
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
to congressmen, senators, TV stations, even President Reagan saying,

220
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
this is what's going on, the Air Force is cooperating with me.

221
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
These are the people who are cooperating with me and giving me this information,

222
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Ernest Edwards, Richard Doty, all this.

223
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He would put their names in these letters.

224
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He'd get answers back saying, we're not interested in the UFO subject.

225
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And there was this kind of cognitive dissonance.

226
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Here are people in the government telling him, yes, you're right,

227
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
this stuff is going on, let's keep an eye on it.

228
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And then elected officials and other people in the media saying,

229
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
we don't know what you're talking about, this isn't very important.

230
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And nobody seemed to care what he was talking about except the Air Force.

231
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So many people knew ultimately about Paul Benowitz and that sad, strange,

232
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,000
horrible story that it got way out of the realm of just a cute flying saucer story.

233
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Paul was convinced that everything he was doing was UFO-related.

234
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I actually sat down with Paul and told Paul, listen, Paul,

235
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I think you ought to stop.

236
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I think you've gone as far as you can go.

237
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And this is a friend.

238
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is Richard Doty, a friend.

239
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It wasn't Richard Doty, a special agent with OSI talking to him.

240
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I said, this is a friend talking to you, Paul, because I became a friend with him.

241
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He was a very wonderful person.

242
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And I didn't want to see him harmed.

243
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And I said, Paul, stop it.

244
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Listen to your son, listen to your wife, end it.

245
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Get rid of the equipment, lock the stuff away.

246
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Go on with your life.

247
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Go back to your work, your business, and stop this.

248
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Paul listened to me, and I thought maybe he was going to take my advice, but he didn't.

249
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He continued and continued and continued.

250
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And at that point, we ended the investigation.

251
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We ended every involvement with Paul Benowitz.

252
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
By 1988, things were so bad that his family decided that he was going to go back to work.

253
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
By 1988, things were so bad that his family decided to take him to a psychiatric facility

254
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and see if they could try and save his life.

255
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And he said that aliens would come at night through his wall

256
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and inject him with something that would make him get in his car and drive out into the desert.

257
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And he didn't remember what he was doing or why he went.

258
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The scary thing was there actually were injection marks on his arm.

259
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is a friend talking to you.

260
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Years later, I sat down with Paul at dinner and told Paul

261
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
exactly that everything we did was a sanctioned counterintelligence operation

262
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to convince him that what he was seeing was UFOs

263
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and that what we didn't want him to know was that he tapped into something on the base

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and we didn't want him to ever disclose that.

265
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Paul looked at me and said, you don't have to lie to me, Rick.

266
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I know it's UFOs related.

267
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He was caught right in the middle of it.

268
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And then he was used.

269
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If he hadn't been for Paul Benowitz, I would have never known.

270
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
70% of the stuff that was going on.

271
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What kind of stuff did you find that would make you think that there was something underground there?

272
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Well, the entrance to...

273
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I mean, a big enough entrance to get a truck or a plane or something through?

274
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes.

275
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You saw this?

276
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But it wasn't where Paul said it was?

277
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No.

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No.

279
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Well, the first case of a catamolation in Dulce, it was June 14th, 1974.

280
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
People do kill animals and steal the meat and it's different. It was different.

281
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Why did they just take the udder and the lymph nodes and the tongue at the base of the throat and remove the tonsils?

282
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And we were finding the evidence at the mutilation of the gas masks that were made by the military.

283
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Radar shaft and the tranquilizers that were in them. Atropine. They were injecting them with atropine.

284
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I was up front with the ranchers.

285
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
They were losing cattle and nobody was compensating them.

286
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I wasn't hiding anything. I never did.

287
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm established as somebody who is doing all of this news and documentary.

288
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So I start getting newspapers. People are sending in, Linda, what is the answer?

289
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Okay, this is what I'm going to do next.

290
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm going to get to the bottom of this animal mutilation mystery.

291
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And finally, in October of 79, Lou Giroddo was the head of the district attorney's office in Trinidad says,

292
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
with our cameras running, finally.

293
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, investigators and I have come to the conclusion we're dealing with creatures not from this planet,

294
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
is the way he put it, which is in my film, A Strange Harvest.

295
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And to set all the reasons why.

296
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The orange lights that he and a deputy had seen go into the ground, come out, split in two,

297
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
go into the ground, come out, split in two, in pastures where they had mutilated animals.

298
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
We did follow one and it stayed there.

299
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It was hovering on top of the cattle, Manuel Gomez's cattle.

300
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And when I was going to try to intercept it myself, it flew over me.

301
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But this looked like a saucer type aircraft.

302
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But you could see lights in it blinking.

303
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Why do they put lights here?

304
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
If they're from outer space, they don't need any guidance with lights.

305
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I was an analyst in the agency responsible for chemical weapons analysis.

306
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So the embassy would always give me security escort and bodyguard.

307
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Special Forces guy came and I said,

308
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
hey, what do you know about these crazy stories about these helicopters that are taking and mutilating cattle?

309
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh, he says, you know, my real job is I'm in a special group in New Mexico.

310
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We've been doing something that is really, really interesting.

311
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He said, it just blows my mind.

312
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We got these helicopters that I'm flying, he says.

313
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
These helicopters are all fixed up.

314
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
First of all, we got no markings on them.

315
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Second of all, they're really fast.

316
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Third, they're really quiet.

317
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And they got a lot of lights.

318
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
We got red lights.

319
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
We got white lights.

320
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We got strobe lights.

321
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I said, what are you talking about?

322
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He says, we pretend we're UFOs.

323
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
What the hell is that?

324
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Do you know anything about this?

325
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Where did all that information come from?

326
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Why do you listen to those people?

327
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
They lie.

328
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's like, yes, but they talk.

329
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And if they talk, once in a while you're going to get a piece of something in that huge pile of crap

330
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
that will actually connect to what you want.

331
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And if you don't let them take you somewhere like they did with Paul,

332
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
kind of keep an even keel, I think you're okay.

333
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You just have to listen.

334
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That's the thing.

335
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So are you saying the Dulce base or the Dulce architecture, let's call it,

336
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
exists or doesn't exist?

337
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Have you investigated the RAND Corporation's involvement in tunneling in that area?

338
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh, yeah.

339
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I actually put some of that in the book.

340
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Nuclear waste facility there.

341
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
No, not waste, but they exploded an atomic bomb underneath about 10 miles from Dulce

342
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
to try and get gas out of the ground.

343
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
A stupidest idea.

344
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They couldn't use the gas because it was radioactive.

345
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
New programs of the Atomic Energy Commission and other agencies

346
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
are designed to expand the usefulness of nuclear energy.

347
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Before work is begun on any of these programs,

348
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
the government thoroughly evaluates the health and safety factors, often for several years.

349
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Project Gas Buggy was an underground nuclear detonation

350
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
that took place in 1967 in Dulce, New Mexico.

351
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It was an attempt to release natural gas reserves from the subterranean environment

352
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
in a severely version of what we would now recognize as fracking.

353
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Some people have suggested that the cattle mutilation program

354
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
was actually a covert monitoring program for assessing the radiation leakage levels

355
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
into the environment, into the ecosystem, and into the food chain.

356
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Senator Harrison Smead had a conference here in 1980

357
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
because the ranchers were asking for help, and I met Paul Benowitz there.

358
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
He was taking a bunch of pictures of the aircraft that was coming out of the Kirtland area,

359
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
but we were watching the same aircraft fly in the Dulce area.

360
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Everybody's looking at this sophisticated aircraft,

361
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and of course they say, well, they're the ones that are mutilating the cattle.

362
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
One agency was doing the cattle mutilations,

363
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
but the people that were doing the research on the aircraft

364
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
used the cattle mutilations to test their aircraft so that people think it was a UFO.

365
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And it helped the cattle mutilation things.

366
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's a wonder they didn't crash into each other, you know.

367
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Would we use perception to help shroud what we're trying to protect?

368
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Absolutely.

369
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
If you've got an aerial platform that is highly advanced

370
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and the public who happens to get a glimpse of the thing from time to time,

371
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
if they're convinced that it's from Venus and there's no way it could be our military,

372
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
well, hey, you know, that's awesome, hell yes.

373
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
If I'm the agent running the protection for that particular program,

374
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and that's helping me cover something for years, I might even feed the fire.

375
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Doty and others would probably defend their counterintelligence efforts as being patriotic.

376
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
They are carrying out work assigned by people who have decided

377
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
that there must be a policy of denial in the interest of national security.

378
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
They're working for my government.

379
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
They're working in agencies of the government

380
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
that is supposed to be protecting of the people, by the people, for the people.

381
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
How did it all turn upside down?

382
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
At the core, there is something that they want to keep people away from, a real truth.

383
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm Richard Doty.

384
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm here at the UFO Congress in Laughlin, Nevada, as a private citizen,

385
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
just enjoying the sights and sounds.

386
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Disinformation is designed to appeal to the person that it's operating on.

387
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The more dramatic you can be appealing to that prejudice,

388
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
the better you're going to get your hooks into the person you're trying to get.

389
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
In Paul Benowitz's case, he was talking about UFOs,

390
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and so if the Air Force wanted his full and undivided attention,

391
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
they would talk UFOs with him, which is exactly what they did.

392
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Benowitz was filming really highly strange craft.

393
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The counterintel's job is to come in and muddy the waters

394
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
to make him look like a fool and one of the cover jobs.

395
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's been a cover story in the U.S. for a long time.

396
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Tell the media, tell anybody who will listen,

397
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
that they're using UFOs to cover up advanced technology,

398
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
when the truth is exactly the opposite of the words.

399
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
In spades?

400
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah, however, within that arena,

401
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
there have been points at which disinformation has entered the stream, you know, and there's no...

402
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
From FDR, huh?

403
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It became seen as necessary to create an active disinformation program

404
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
in the late 1970s and early 1980s,

405
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and the reason for this is twofold.

406
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
One was the American Freedom of Information Act.

407
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's curtain time.

408
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
An ingenious printing element that works faster than the eye can see.

409
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Watch it in action.

410
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Thousands of pages of documents were released from places like the CIA, the FBI, all the military agencies.

411
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Documents proving the lie that agencies across the board were interested

412
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and were tracking the UFO phenomenon.

413
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Right there.

414
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
During the late 1970s, a variety of leaks started to occur.

415
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Now, they're just stories, right?

416
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But the problem is that there were many of them,

417
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and they seemed to have a coherence about them.

418
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Researchers at the time were in a very optimistic mode.

419
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I wouldn't say they were giddy so much as just hopeful

420
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
that if they got the right leak or the right document,

421
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
that they just might be able to smash the wall of secrecy.

422
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Then what happens?

423
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Then we get entrance into the field

424
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
by individuals who start leaking documents of dubious origin,

425
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
whose provenance was basically unknown,

426
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
that cause now 25 years worth of dissension in the research field.

427
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And it's the same within the mainstream media.

428
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Serious media never in their news coverage

429
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
truly seriously promoted the extraterrestrial hypothesis.

430
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What they did do is move that to the realm of entertainment.

431
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Any time someone brings up such ideas seriously,

432
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
what you find is the serious media says,

433
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
well, you've been watching too many movies.

434
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So in a sense, you could argue that the movies are used

435
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
to inoculate the public against these truths.

436
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So that these demonstrably false UFO stories become inoculations.

437
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
When the doctor inoculates you from a disease,

438
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
he gives you a little bit of it,

439
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and then your body's immune system recovers, deals with it,

440
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and now you're kind of immune to it.

441
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Look at the UFO conferences.

442
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Where are they held?

443
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Usually in small, dingy hotels

444
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
with rather limited numbers of people participating.

445
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I mean, there has to be a reason why it's perpetuating.

446
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You don't see conferences on leprechauns,

447
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
so why do we still have conferences on UFOs?

448
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
One of the keys to a disinformation campaign

449
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
is to have a feedback loop,

450
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and you need people on the inside to feed back to you

451
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
the results of the operation.

452
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Probably, Doty's first success

453
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
in rounding up a useful asset,

454
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
as they say in the intelligence field,

455
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
or a useful idiot,

456
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
as they also say in the intelligence field,

457
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
was his recruitment of a man named William Moore.

458
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Now, William Moore, I think very significantly,

459
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
was the co-author of the first book,

460
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
about Roswell.

461
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I was given the task of making contact with Bill Moore

462
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
and basically finding out what he knew and who he knew.

463
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Bill was a little reluctant to disclose everything to me.

464
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
For obvious reasons, here I am a government agent

465
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
coming in and introducing myself

466
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and wanting to know more about Roswell.

467
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But there's techniques that we use,

468
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
that we're trained to use,

469
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
in gaining that person's confidence,

470
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
and I used those techniques against Bill Moore,

471
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and they worked,

472
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and Bill Moore took me into his confidence,

473
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and we had a professional relationship

474
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
as far as him providing us information

475
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
about the UFO community

476
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
and agreeing to say things that we wanted said

477
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
regarding the UFO community,

478
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
or within the UFO community.

479
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The process of studying this phenomenon

480
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and the people involved with it,

481
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
of assessing the claims and the counterclaims,

482
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and of dealing with the question of how we as Earthlings

483
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
will react to the discovery of a race

484
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
of extraterrestrial visitors

485
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
and how they will react to us.

486
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
All of this and more,

487
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
one finally looked at in perspective,

488
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
leads us to the inescapable recognition

489
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
that in studying the UFO phenomenon,

490
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
we are at the same time becoming more aware

491
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
of ourselves as individuals.

492
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Moore was singled out

493
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
because he had achieved considerable celebrity

494
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
within the UFO field

495
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and a certain authenticity

496
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
that would recommend him to politicians and journalists.

497
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And remember, it's the politicians

498
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and the journalists who are the ultimate target

499
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
of all of this disinformation.

500
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I went to visit Bill.

501
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
He had a bad back.

502
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
He was lying flat in his back.

503
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
He couldn't move.

504
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
He was like in traction.

505
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And I remember him very dramatically saying to me,

506
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
aliens do exist.

507
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
UFOs are real.

508
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I know that now for a fact.

509
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Just seems kind of almost like a bad science fiction movie.

510
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But that's kind of what was going on at the time.

511
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
He was very invested in the science fiction world

512
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and invested in maintaining these contacts

513
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
that he had supposedly inside the government.

514
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
At one point, Bill Moore had played me

515
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
an early tape recording of a conversation he had with Doty.

516
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And Moore was telling me, you know,

517
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
this is a huge breakthrough

518
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
and this guy is like on the inside

519
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
and he's going to give a lot of stuff away.

520
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And I just remember even back then

521
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
that I was kind of suspicious

522
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
that it just sounded a little too good to be true.

523
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But I was kind of curious as to why somebody

524
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
who supposedly was in Air Force Intelligence

525
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
was speaking so openly

526
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
about some of these incredible things.

527
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
William Moore was using his position

528
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
as an executive of an outfit

529
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
that was called the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization.

530
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And in fact, Moore admitted

531
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
that he paid off the secretary of that organization

532
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
to send him reports at once when they came in.

533
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And they went directly to Doty.

534
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Bill didn't believe everything I was telling him.

535
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And obviously, he's a very smart person

536
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and a lot of the information I was telling him wasn't factual.

537
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
If you're a UFO researcher

538
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and you were offered documents that nobody had ever seen

539
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that pointed the way to what the government might know about UFOs

540
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
and in exchange you basically had to report

541
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
on what people were thinking,

542
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
what rumors were making the rounds.

543
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
That's what he was offered

544
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and in exchange he was offered something

545
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
that nobody else had gotten up to that point.

546
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Pure, unadulterated information

547
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
that would lead him to the center of the answer,

548
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the answer to the question, you know,

549
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
what does the government know

550
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and are there actually some sort of non-human intelligences

551
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
interacting with the human race?

552
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Moore later was part of the series of break-ins

553
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
into the Benowitz House

554
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and the Psychological Warfare Program.

555
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Again, self-admitted by Moore.

556
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Moore was not working alone.

557
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Others, I'm convinced, went for the same deal

558
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
and the deal was very simple.

559
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You cooperate with us

560
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and we will give you the information

561
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
that the U.S. government has deep down in those vaults.

562
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Now, this is the Faustian bargain

563
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
that William Moore went for

564
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
and he came up short on it.

565
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It became apparent to me

566
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
that my supplying information to the government

567
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
through Doty, on the activities of Paul Benowitz,

568
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Apo, and to a lesser extent several other individuals

569
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
was to be a part of this equation.

570
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I also discovered that whatever it was

571
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
that Benowitz was involved with,

572
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
he was the subject of considerable interest

573
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
on the part of not one, but several government agencies

574
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and that they were actively trying to defuse him

575
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
by pumping as much disinformation through him

576
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
as he could possibly absorb.

577
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Being a very small part of that process

578
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
gave me, I thought, something of an advantage.

579
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It became my intention to play that advantage

580
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
for all the information I could get out of it.

581
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Benowitz, for his part...

582
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Frankly, I'm a little ashamed

583
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
of some people in this audience

584
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
regardless of what you believe, what you hear, or not.

585
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
They had to stop the talk about four or five times

586
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
just because of all the yelling.

587
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
People got mad, ran out of there.

588
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I saw a woman start crying and leave.

589
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
People kept saying,

590
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Where'd you get that crap from, Bill?

591
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And one guy said,

592
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm gonna get a fire hose

593
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and ran out the back.

594
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Very dramatic.

595
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Bill's admission to working with government agents

596
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
was the first acknowledgement

597
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
to the degree to which our government would go

598
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
in an attempt to keep the cover-up going.

599
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And I think people were angry,

600
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
maybe not so much at Bill,

601
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
but at themselves for only naivete

602
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
as allowing that to happen and refusing to acknowledge

603
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
that they could have been just as easily duped.

604
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's scary to think,

605
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
gee, somebody I trusted

606
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
might be playing me for the fool.

607
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Bill Moore, I think, probably believed

608
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
what he was preaching.

609
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I think he was one of these people

610
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
that wanted to believe

611
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
that he was one of the chosen few

612
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
to spread this information,

613
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
to be the Moses of mythology, UFO mythology.

614
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Moore's book was well received

615
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and, in my opinion, well done research,

616
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
but very troubling because the thesis was

617
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
that Roswell was a real spaceship that crashed

618
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and that the U.S. government has the parts.

619
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I believe that he was singled out

620
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
precisely to ultimately discredit him and Roswell

621
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
to keep the press and the politicians off of Roswell.

622
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
July 8, 1947.

623
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The Army Air Forces has announced

624
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
that a flying disc has been found

625
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
and is now in the possession of the Army.

626
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Army officers say the missile, found sometime last week,

627
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
has been inspected at Roswell, New Mexico,

628
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and sent to Wright Field, Ohio, for further inspections.

629
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The key thing to remember about the alleged crash

630
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
of a UFO at Roswell in 1947

631
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
is that by the time of Paul Benowitz's involvement

632
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
in the UFO field,

633
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
it had been entirely forgotten by the UFO community.

634
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And it was only with the publication in 1980

635
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
of the Roswell incident by William Moore and Charles Berlitz

636
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
that the elements of the Roswell story,

637
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
the crashed spacecraft, the recovered alien bodies,

638
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
the pact between the American government

639
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and the extraterrestrials to back-engineer their technology,

640
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
all of these things have eventually become

641
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
the core story of the American UFO mythology.

642
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Their craft crashed somewhere

643
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
after coming all these 50 light years, they crashed,

644
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and then they sent another one that crashed again

645
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and sent another one that crashed.

646
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
There were about nine crashes in the Southwest

647
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
in the late 40s.

648
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And that would indicate to me, or at least suggest to me,

649
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
that we were testing something that was crashing.

650
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Roswell happened.

651
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Two crashes, one in Roswell and one in West.

652
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
They didn't find the craft for a couple years.

653
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It was all one crash, but it took them a couple years

654
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
to find the second crash site.

655
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Things are getting weird, man.

656
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Now, Doty played a massive role

657
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
in the perpetuation of the Roswell myth,

658
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
many of the ideas prominent in the UFO subculture,

659
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
for two decades.

660
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And it was completely avoided.

661
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Rick Doty is certainly a fascinating character

662
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
and clearly a trickster.

663
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
A man who probably has trouble figuring out

664
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
whether he's lying or not these days.

665
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It would not surprise me if people were selected

666
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
so disinformation.

667
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It would also not surprise me if some of the people

668
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
were selected because they were not very bright.

669
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
They lacked certain critical judgment,

670
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
but were very energetic in putting out certain messages.

671
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And I do often think that some of the people

672
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
in the government agencies who have been involved

673
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
in the UFO field were kind of pushed

674
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
or nudged in that direction.

675
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
They just go into the field and muck it up automatically

676
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
by themselves without any external controls.

677
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Rick is not the man you're after.

678
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's the person in the control position

679
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
that's important here.

680
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
In my opinion, he was simply a pawn

681
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
in a much larger game, just as I was.

682
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
What we are hearing today about malevolent aliens,

683
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
underground bases, secret treaties with the U.S. government

684
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
has its roots firmly planted in the Benowitz affair.

685
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
The entire story of a secret treaty

686
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
between the U.S. government and the aliens

687
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
of exchanges of technology between us and the aliens,

688
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
of battles between aliens and American armed forces,

689
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and of aliens allegedly having implanted

690
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
hundreds of thousands if not millions of human beings

691
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
for the purpose of taking over the world

692
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
and using us as cattle or slaves

693
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
came about as a result of the disinformation process.

694
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I know because I was in a position to observe

695
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
much of this process as it unfolded,

696
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and I was providing regular reports on its effectiveness

697
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
to some of the very people who were doing it to Paul.

698
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
There wasn't a whole lot that we did.

699
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
There was just a simple, really, really simple nod

700
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and statement to Paul that what he was seeing

701
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
was probably UFOs.

702
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It's generally assumed that the counterintelligence operation

703
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
conducted against Paul Benowitz was designed

704
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
to throw him off the scent of some kind of classified

705
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
experimental technology that he was accidentally filming

706
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
over Kirtland Air Force Base.

707
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
But when you stop to think about it,

708
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
this doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

709
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
If the Kirtland-based personnel really had wanted him

710
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
to stop his investigations,

711
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
they could have ordered him to do so.

712
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Instead, they encouraged him to continue his research

713
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and indeed facilitated his growing delusions

714
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
about an extraterrestrial invasion.

715
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
What this suggests is that rather than a campaign

716
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
directed against Paul Benowitz,

717
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
this was an information war on the American UFO community.

718
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And there are a number of reasons why Air Force intelligence

719
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
might have wanted to use Benowitz as a conduit

720
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
for disinformation.

721
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Psychologists were constantly seeking evidence

722
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
for the extraterrestrial conspiracy and the UFO cover-up.

723
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
They were digging through documents,

724
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
they were hanging around secret air bases,

725
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
and quite likely stumbling upon genuine military secrets.

726
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And a more serious possibility was that Soviet intelligence agents

727
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
may have been infiltrating the UFO field

728
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
in order to extract this kind of information

729
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
about new technologies.

730
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It's no coincidence that the timing of the operation

731
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
against Paul Benowitz dovetails with the development

732
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
of the stealth program.

733
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And at the time, this was the absolute pinnacle

734
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
of global aviation technology.

735
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And that's exactly the sort of thing

736
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
that Soviet agents would be looking for.

737
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
If you guys are doing a film,

738
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I do not want to do an interview in a film

739
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
in which you're going to try to communicate

740
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
that there's nothing to the UFOs,

741
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
that advanced technology is being used to cover...

742
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I mean, that all you're doing is...

743
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
That's not what we're doing.

744
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It's just playing into the government,

745
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
absolutely what they want people to do.

746
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That's absolutely not what we're doing.

747
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
People trying to put out documentaries on UFOs

748
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
seem to be teased over and over

749
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
and then have the rug pulled out from under them

750
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
at the last minute.

751
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
In the late 70s, a rumor started circulating

752
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
that there was a film of a UFO landing

753
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.

754
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And apparently, a UFO came and landed

755
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
at the Air Force Base on the tarmac.

756
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
A group of people went up to meet him.

757
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
There was some sort of exchange of information.

758
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Then the alien got back in his ship and took off.

759
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I have wondered that that film,

760
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I think as many people have wondered,

761
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
was an abortive attempt at some kind of disclosure.

762
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
We began with an invitation

763
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
and met with Paul Shartle,

764
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
who was head of security for the depository.

765
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
That's where all the films from the military are sent,

766
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
all out at Norton.

767
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
We talked about possible programs

768
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
such as three-dimensional moving holography,

769
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
atomic fission, a dog program

770
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
where they trained shepherds to do reconnaissance,

771
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
and a lot of laser work at Wright-Patterson.

772
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Then he said,

773
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I want you to come with me into this studio.

774
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
We went into a studio, which was a clean room.

775
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
He said, what would you think if we told you

776
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
that in the early 70s,

777
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
there was a landing of an alien craft

778
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
at Holloman Air Force Base

779
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and our TDY, temporary duty guys, had filmed it.

780
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And I was just sort of scratching my head thinking,

781
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
UFOs? What are we talking about?

782
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So he said, look, if you're interested,

783
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
you should bury that under the other projects

784
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
because a UFO sends up a red flag.

785
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So he said, if you're interested,

786
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
go talk to Captain Somebody

787
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and he'll start a liaison with the Pentagon,

788
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
which we did.

789
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I was told that there was footage,

790
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and that was sort of like a carrot.

791
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You know, you'll be provided with a film

792
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
that we have 900 feet of Ektachrome.

793
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And off we began our project.

794
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
We had a legal contract with the Pentagon

795
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
and an agreement on everything that we were going to be doing

796
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and their total cooperation.

797
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
They fulfilled every one of our requests.

798
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
They vetted our information and gave sanction to it.

799
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
They really did not influence the content at all.

800
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I was quite surprised.

801
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Even the people at Holloman did not say,

802
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
what are you doing? What are you talking about?

803
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
They seemed to confirm that something had happened.

804
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And the film was not forthcoming,

805
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
but I knew where it was and what it was

806
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and was told by one of the people we worked with

807
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
that it was confiscated at the last minute

808
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
because it didn't seem appropriate.

809
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So we ended up having to go to animation.

810
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
But everything else was documented,

811
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
as I recall it happening.

812
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It was a daylight shot of a light ascending

813
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
on Holloman Air Force Base.

814
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And then with that little clip,

815
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
that's all that I can tell you that was genuine.

816
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
A landing of a craft at Holloman, it was film.

817
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Very brief.

818
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
That's all I can tell you. It's genuine.

819
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Just that snippet?

820
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Just a light coming down from above.

821
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It was very not that distinguishable.

822
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It was just among other footage.

823
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
That's all I can tell you.

824
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And just to say on camera,

825
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
you never saw the Holloman landing footage?

826
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Not really.

827
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Okay. Can you elaborate?

828
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Can we just wait for the car?

829
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Saved by the car.

830
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I'm trying to think how to answer that.

831
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I knew what the film was about, all the details of it,

832
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
but I never saw a real projected version.

833
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Is there a still of it?

834
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yes.

835
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
What is your bottom line, beginning, middle and end?

836
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Our bottom line is that there is a UFO phenomenon

837
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
that's genuine and needs to be studied and taken seriously,

838
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
and that one of the things that makes that difficult

839
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
is the muddying of the waters by people like Rick Doty,

840
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Walter Bosley and others who are working for FBI, OSI,

841
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
whoever else they're working for, CIA, NSA,

842
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
and that they are making the work of people like yourself

843
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and us and others who want to understand

844
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
what's really going on very, very difficult.

845
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Okay, and thank you for your attention.

846
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
We're ready to roll here in just one turn.

847
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
If you believe it's true,

848
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
you have to buy in to this fantasmagorical,

849
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:31,000
conspiratorial, bizarre, nonsensical, ridiculous story.

850
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And you know, when I sat down with Rick,

851
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
his response to me is, you know, it's really all true.

852
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
He was scared.

853
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Rick's great strength is he's a wonderful storyteller.

854
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
He's a very friendly guy.

855
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
He builds relationships easily.

856
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
My immediate instinct is to trust him.

857
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I saw him.

858
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
He was a human only.

859
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Not a human.

860
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I think it's very easy to mislead people in the UFO community.

861
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You get them going down a certain trail.

862
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
You give them certain leads,

863
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
and you just watch people chase their tails

864
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
over and over again looking for the truth.

865
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I was living and working in New York when Linda Howe

866
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
actually came and stayed with me for a few days,

867
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
and it was right in the midst of her working on this HBO project.

868
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Linda sort of was, I believe, on the track at the time

869
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
of thinking that this was the film

870
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
that was going to, again, expose everything.

871
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And I believe she was in touch with Doty at the time.

872
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I think, in fact, she had even gone to meet him face to face.

873
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And that was very curious to me

874
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
because I'd known about this guy through Bill, you know, Bill Moore.

875
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And so I thought, hmm, now he's kind of hooking Linda in the same way.

876
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Doty says that he has names of people who are witnesses.

877
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
A security guard has a gun melted in his hand.

878
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
There's a disc. Beings.

879
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I want to investigate that story.

880
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
The original plan, Linda Howe, was to obtain everything she knew,

881
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
as much information as she knew,

882
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
and try to find out what she was going to air in this documentary to HBO

883
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
and whether we wanted it aired or not.

884
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So I drove her out to Kirtland, to the OSI office.

885
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I took her into a special room.

886
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I told her it was the commander's office,

887
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
which wasn't really necessarily true.

888
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
The first thing that shifted this from being

889
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
what I thought was going to be a five-minute meeting,

890
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
get these names and addresses and phone numbers and go on,

891
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,000
because I had already set up other things to do,

892
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:45,000
that documentary that you did broadsided the government.

893
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
How do you mean?

894
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Nobody ever expected that a credible journalist

895
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
would ever take on the animal mutilation story.

896
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It was like something was shifting in the air.

897
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Where is this going? What is happening here?

898
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
He narrowed gave me a list of names, phone numbers.

899
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Instead, he said,

900
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
my superiors have asked me to show you something,

901
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
pulled out this manila envelope, pulled out these pages,

902
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
and as he's handing them to me, he says,

903
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
you can read these. You cannot take notes.

904
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You can ask me questions, but I want you to move

905
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
from the chair you're sitting in to that chair.

906
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Everything that was done there was being filmed

907
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
by other agents in another room.

908
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It was a two-way mirror.

909
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And I'm looking at the top page in its all-caps briefing paper

910
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
for the President of the United States of America

911
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
on unidentified aerial vehicles.

912
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And I'm trying to read what is the most remarkable series

913
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
of letters in words that probably has ever been handed to me,

914
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
because this was new. I was innocent.

915
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And it started out about all these places

916
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
that the government of the United States had retrieved

917
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
disks that were identified as extraterrestrial.

918
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I knew some names, like Roswell.

919
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
There was Aztec, Magdalena, south of Laredo,

920
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and down in Arizona, there were...

921
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
My mind was kind of reeling at how many places

922
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
this is saying because all of us had only heard of Roswell,

923
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
really. And eventually it came to paragraphs

924
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
that are as indelibly emblazoned in my mind

925
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
sitting here today as they were then,

926
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
and the one that probably is the one worth sharing

927
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
for all of this.

928
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
These extraterrestrials manipulated DNA

929
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and already evolving primates to create Homo sapiens.

930
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And I remember reading that sentence over

931
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
several times trying to absorb

932
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
the implication of its meaning.

933
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Because if Homo sapien

934
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
is a genetically constructed species

935
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
by extraterrestrials,

936
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
we are then by definition a planet

937
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
of six and a half billion androids.

938
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
If we are androids, what purpose are we serving?

939
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
All of that hit me reading that sentence.

940
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Then on the last page,

941
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
paragraph, paragraph, paragraph, paragraph,

942
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
project garnet all caps.

943
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
All questions and mysteries about the evolution

944
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
of Homo sapien on this planet have been answered

945
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
and this project is closed.

946
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
The plans that I showed her came from our special office

947
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
in Washington with the operational plan

948
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
and what I was supposed to do

949
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and the plans to show her these.

950
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I'd read them before, I knew what was in them

951
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
and I realized that some of the information contained in there was real.

952
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
But then I realized that you have to give real information

953
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
in order for a person to think you're credible.

954
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So I knew what was in there and I gave them to her

955
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and I did what I was told to do.

956
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
When you look back at it, they must have had meetings

957
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
about how do we stop

958
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
a persistent and dogged reporter

959
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
who has already demonstrated

960
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
that she's going to go after a really, really difficult subject.

961
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
How do we stop her?

962
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
When you look back,

963
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
it all makes sense.

964
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
She wanted me to tell her things

965
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
that I couldn't tell her

966
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
and at one point then she went public with my name

967
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and she did what Paul Benowitz and Bill Moore didn't do.

968
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
She publicized the fact that she had a...

969
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
she was deceived by a government agency

970
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
named the OSI

971
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and although there were many other people

972
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
involved in operations, she named my name

973
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
and I became a public figure.

974
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
We actually played a trick on Linda

975
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
that kind of paid her back, so to speak.

976
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Not anything that harmed her in any way

977
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
or anything like that, but we kind of

978
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
planted something that she ran with

979
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
which wasn't factual and I think she realized

980
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
that maybe she should keep her mouth shut after that.

981
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
The forged documents shown

982
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
to Linda Moulton Howe by Richard Doty

983
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
would form the basis for the Majestic 12 papers

984
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
which expanded upon the story of the Roswell UFO crash

985
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
and provided the foundations for the future

986
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
UFO mythology in America.

987
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
And over three decades later,

988
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
these documents are still dividing

989
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
the international UFO community.

990
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Before, it had always been inferred

991
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
that a cover-up was underway.

992
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
There was talk about who was involved and so forth,

993
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
but there was never any paperwork.

994
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Here's the paperwork.

995
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
A package showed up at the home of Jamie Chanderay

996
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
who was Bill's sort of writing and research partner.

997
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
What it contained was a canister

998
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
of 35-millimeter film. They developed it

999
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and what was on it was photographs of this document

1000
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
saying that there was a group that had been controlling

1001
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
UFO information, how it was released to the public

1002
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
and how the government should deal with it.

1003
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Regarding the MJ-12 documents that were released

1004
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
to Jamie Chanderay or Bill Moore, I had absolutely nothing to do with that.

1005
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
The document could be real

1006
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and because of the nature of it,

1007
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
it was a perfect perception management device.

1008
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
People have to realize that these things

1009
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
may not be to cover up the truth about flying saucers.

1010
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It may be more to gather information

1011
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
about how the public responds to manipulation.

1012
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
When I print off the sum total of all of those documents,

1013
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
you get a stack about this thick.

1014
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
When you read them through,

1015
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
as one day I decided this is what I'm going to do,

1016
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
it's very impressive.

1017
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
To have faked it would have required a team,

1018
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
a high-level team of very, very expert individuals

1019
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
who know everything about document creation,

1020
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
science and technology of the 1940s and 50s

1021
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
and a whole bunch of other things.

1022
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I looked at them and initially I thought they were good forgeries

1023
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
but over time my opinion of their quality has gone downhill.

1024
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
The use of a zero in front of a date,

1025
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
the use of an extraneous comma,

1026
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
the obviously photocopied signature,

1027
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
they just keep getting worse and worse.

1028
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
If they were faked, the only thing that one can say is

1029
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
the UFO topic was considered important enough by these people

1030
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
to create the most elaborate,

1031
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
incredible, detailed series of papers

1032
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
and one would have to ask if they're faked.

1033
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Why?

1034
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
There were some investigations conducted by FBI,

1035
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
OSI,

1036
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
regarding the MJ-12 documents,

1037
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
extensive investigations just to determine

1038
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
whether these things were legitimate,

1039
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
whether they had any information,

1040
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and then who released them?

1041
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I was interviewed as a suspect.

1042
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Did I do these?

1043
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
But it was proven that I didn't do them.

1044
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
But somebody outside the government created it

1045
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and in that particular instance, I don't know if the government

1046
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
would prosecute them.

1047
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Doing that would lend credence to the document itself

1048
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
and the only other thing to do is just say,

1049
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
we end investigation and not tell anybody what the outcome was.

1050
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I like to think of UFOs as weapons of mass deception

1051
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and the role of the intelligence organizations

1052
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and the military in propagating the UFO mythology

1053
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
as somewhat analogous to what evolutionary biologists

1054
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
call a punctuated equilibrium.

1055
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The UFO mythology develops of its own accord

1056
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
and the Mirage Men will just drop

1057
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
a new piece of data, a new meme,

1058
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
some new faked documents into the mix as and when

1059
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
it's expedient for them to do so.

1060
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And there's no real need for a sustained

1061
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
UFO deception campaign because

1062
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
the folklore is just perfectly capable

1063
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
of sustaining itself.

1064
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
The US government had

1065
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
a one secret program

1066
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
in which 12 astronauts

1067
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
were sent to an alien home world

1068
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Serpo, 38.4 light years away

1069
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
from the years 1965 through 1978.

1070
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
When the returning astronauts

1071
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
came back, I believe there were seven,

1072
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
that report was finalized into

1073
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
a report called Project Serpo in 1980.

1074
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Rumors about this kind of thing have been

1075
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
flying around since the 1960s or 70s

1076
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
so it's got some kind of historical provenance.

1077
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
In November of 2005, Project Serpo

1078
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
was sent to my UFO thread list.

1079
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I received an email from someone,

1080
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
he requested to be anonymous.

1081
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
When I first read

1082
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
that bombshell email,

1083
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
it was far different than anything

1084
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I'd ever received and

1085
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
even though it was a version that was

1086
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
different than what I was familiar with,

1087
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
it had the ring of truth. Somebody within the

1088
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
government would have to be cooperating because I can tell you

1089
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
that a lot of the information,

1090
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
not all the particular details,

1091
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
but a lot of the information is factual.

1092
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I believe that it is

1093
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
a disinformation campaign to lead people astray.

1094
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
That said, a good disinformation campaign,

1095
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
a good perception management campaign,

1096
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
will always include nuggets of fact and truth.

1097
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And some of those nuggets of fact and truth should be,

1098
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
if you're going to do it effectively,

1099
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
not for extreme facts or truths.

1100
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
They brought back

1101
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
thousands of soil samples,

1102
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
samples from the even civilization,

1103
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
and I believe all these artifacts are now ensconced

1104
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
at bowling air force base, and photographs too.

1105
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
There's always a possibility that the Serpo story

1106
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
was created for disinformation

1107
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
to present to the Soviets back

1108
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
in the Cold War and somebody stumbled onto it.

1109
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
That's always that possibility, but I don't think so.

1110
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
It's not a professional job.

1111
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Myself and three others

1112
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
were working as a research team

1113
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
looking into the Serpo story.

1114
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
We really wanted to get to the bottom

1115
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
of Rick's involvement in it.

1116
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
People within the UFO community immediately said,

1117
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
hey, is Richard Doty involved in this?

1118
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Did Richard Doty do this?

1119
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I never had anything to do with the Serpo story.

1120
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
We were adamant at this time that Rick Doty

1121
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
was the person sending the information,

1122
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
but we didn't have any proof, and the only way

1123
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
we could get that proof is if we could see

1124
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
an actual copy of the original emails

1125
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
is one of the greatest novelists and writers

1126
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
of the 21st century, it's not him.

1127
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
We came up with a plan. We'll use the same name

1128
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
and just contact Victor and let him think

1129
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
that his anonymous source was back in touch with him.

1130
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
We asked Victor to send us copies of the emails

1131
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
that we allegedly had sent him, which meant

1132
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
we could look at the headers of these emails

1133
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
to determine where they actually came from.

1134
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
We asked one Rick Doty to compare against

1135
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
that it was indeed Rick Doty's IP address

1136
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
on the request anonymous emails, and as it turned out later,

1137
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
he was also several other people in the story,

1138
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
all contacting Victor, and Victor thinking

1139
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
he's been contacted by a multitude of different people

1140
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
when in fact it was all one person, it was all Rick Doty.

1141
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I didn't create it. I didn't conspire

1142
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
with anybody else to create it.

1143
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I didn't create it by somebody else,

1144
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and those people I don't know.

1145
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
How do we ever know what we know?

1146
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Apart from Victor Martinez, who really started this thing off,

1147
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I'm the only name who's known.

1148
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
We've got this anonymous storyteller

1149
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
who's a brilliant campfire who's entertaining us

1150
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
with this incredible tale, and we're sitting here

1151
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
with bright eyes, with the flickering flames,

1152
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
thinking, wow, tell us some more.

1153
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
The idea of disinformation is it's meant to be believed.

1154
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
With Serpo, the first response is,

1155
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
well, this is fascinating, but it's ridiculous, you see.

1156
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Of course there's an aspect to me that wants to believe

1157
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
this wonderful story. I had no idea where this would be.

1158
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Richard Doty came to the Loughlin Conference in 2006.

1159
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
He presented himself as somebody

1160
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
being given information to reveal to the public.

1161
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
He didn't quite know why, but thought it was very important.

1162
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
What's strange about the Serpo thing and Richard Doty

1163
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
was that he denied continually and vociferously

1164
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
that he had anything to do with it,

1165
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
yet he came to the Loughlin UFO convention

1166
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
to see what was going on there, to hear Bill Ryan talk

1167
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
in person rather than just on the radio,

1168
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and basically had his hands in a lot of things that were going on

1169
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
or at least looked like an interested bystander.

1170
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Why should he be interested in this silly story?

1171
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Wonderful question. We don't know whether

1172
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Anonymous got this from the movie or whether

1173
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Spielberg had the tip off that this was one of the ways

1174
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
as many people in this community suspect

1175
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
that over the years the public have been

1176
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
gradually acclimatized to the possibility

1177
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
of this contact with an extraterrestrial race

1178
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
by seeding little parts of the truth here and there in movies.

1179
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
It's the best way to get ideas to the general population.

1180
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
This might have been one of the ways of doing it.

1181
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I think the information should be

1182
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
should be brought out to the public.

1183
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Let the public decide whether this is real or not.

1184
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Whether you think the information is real or not

1185
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
or whatever proportion of that might be the case,

1186
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
this is a government operation. If it's a government operation,

1187
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
these guys wouldn't be doing their job if they weren't following me every step of the way.

1188
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Ever since the middle of November, I've been assuming that

1189
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I'm being monitored. If they're not doing that,

1190
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
they're not doing their job. It's like I'm one part of a team,

1191
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
but I don't even know who the other team members are.

1192
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
That I'm being bugged.

1193
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I mean, this may be paranoid. Whatever's going on,

1194
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
it's happening at a government level

1195
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
and, therefore, everything that I do is being watched.

1196
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I have to assume that I'm being tested.

1197
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
You know the whole war more stuff. I wasn't around then.

1198
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
But they ran him around ragged just to see whether he would make a good scoop.

1199
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Just to see whether he was willing to obey orders.

1200
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I have to assume that there's something more at stake.

1201
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
You see...

1202
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
You also have to have a very good bullshit protector as well, though.

1203
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Yes, I know.

1204
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Since 1985, I've talked to

1205
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
18 people at the cabinet level or above,

1206
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
including four presidents.

1207
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
About a third of them have said,

1208
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
it's true. About a third of them have said,

1209
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I've heard it. And I think it's true.

1210
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And about a third of them have said, I don't have a clue.

1211
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I do think, though, Dr. Green,

1212
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
that this is important for you to investigate.

1213
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Turn that off for me.

1214
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
The trouble with the whole UFO thing

1215
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
is there are so many people who make up BS stories

1216
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
that no one can check.

1217
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
You know, somebody can step forward and say,

1218
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I'll tell you what's going on in UFOs.

1219
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
And they can say, I briefed the president.

1220
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I've done this. I know what's going on.

1221
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I don't know. I think there's too much BS in that field.

1222
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Part of the problem

1223
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
that UFOs created

1224
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
was that there were people within the government,

1225
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
within the Air Force, within the CIA,

1226
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
that existed.

1227
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And because they had stature, because they had rank,

1228
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
their opinion was considered proof.

1229
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Unless we understand

1230
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
and work effectively for the principles

1231
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
upon which our American way of life is founded,

1232
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
the structure will crumble.

1233
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Well, before going to Norton Air Force Base,

1234
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
going into a clean room and being told that we had had a landing

1235
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
and that we needed to be respectful.

1236
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
His name was all over the wall as head of security

1237
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
and his boss and everything agreeing to it.

1238
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I didn't believe it then.

1239
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
But then when confronted with the information,

1240
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I now realize after working with intelligence people

1241
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
that it's a reality.

1242
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And they stand behind the idea that they don't disbelieve it.

1243
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
It's just so far it's not proven to be a threat

1244
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
and that's the way they got out from under it.

1245
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
In the intelligence community,

1246
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
there are definitely people

1247
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
that are interested in extraordinary phenomena,

1248
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
particularly UFOs, definitely believers in that,

1249
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
because you don't work in that profession

1250
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and it's not just a profession, it's a world unto itself

1251
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
without learning some things.

1252
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
How many pictures do you need? How many eyewitnesses?

1253
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
This is something that controls possibly even this program.

1254
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
What is known of the truth of them, these other beings?

1255
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
What if the truth is bad?

1256
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Could be. What if we're their farm animals?

1257
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
What if they eat us psychically?

1258
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I don't know. There's a lot of possibilities here that are not good.

1259
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I think that we are surfing on the wave

1260
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
of a huge adventure,

1261
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
of the opportunity of humankind

1262
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
rolling into a totally new era.

1263
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And that wave might break one of these days.

1264
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Even the Vatican recently has come out in preparation

1265
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
saying, hey, listen, you know, there is anybody out there

1266
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
that are all God's creations and they're our brothers and sisters, really.

1267
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I mean, what a setup that is for what might be coming next.

1268
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
We're really a byproduct

1269
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
of extraterrestrial intervention.

1270
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
We're really, I mean, this is my view,

1271
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
that we've been genetically altered

1272
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
by maybe not one,

1273
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
maybe perhaps several extraterrestrial races.

1274
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
The government obviously doesn't want to tell us.

1275
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
They don't want it, otherwise they'll disclose everything they know.

1276
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
And the most important players, the aliens don't want disclosure

1277
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
because they could disclose any time.

1278
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I mean, they control most of the cards.

1279
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I don't have any files, any photographs, anything to show you.

1280
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I just have a lot of personal research.

1281
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I have my professional experiences

1282
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and I have the bona fides, the tested bona fides of the sources,

1283
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
and I have my intuition.

1284
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And those things all fit together

1285
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
and you kind of get a picture.

1286
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
There is a planet

1287
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
that orbits Sirius, the dog star system.

1288
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
They are human.

1289
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
They are very much interested in us

1290
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
and they have been key to our survival.

1291
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And they are capable of coming here.

1292
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Certainly others have come here.

1293
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Now, could that be

1294
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
part of disinformation?

1295
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Absolutely.

1296
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I read things even today that we'd fed to Paul Benowitz

1297
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
or to Alin Howe or to Bill Moore

1298
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
that I'd fed to him.

1299
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And I see that today and it's surprising that that stuff's still there,

1300
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
but it just shows that we were a professional organization

1301
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
and we did our job and that information is still out there.

1302
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
The people whose job it was

1303
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
to make the subject look ridiculous over the last 50 or 60 years

1304
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
have done a very good job.

1305
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I don't know where they're from.

1306
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I don't know. I don't know where they're from.

1307
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I know they're not, like, from Detroit, you know?

1308
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That's as far as I can take it.

1309
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
So again, when somebody starts saying, well, here's who they are

1310
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and here's why they're here,

1311
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I was selected to participate

1312
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
in a special access program within the counterintelligence community.

1313
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
My supervisor just selected me and said,

1314
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
you're going to be briefed into a program

1315
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
and you're going to be responsible for investigating

1316
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
everything associated with this program.

1317
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
The first part of the briefing dealt with

1318
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
the United States Air Force

1319
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
who were countering unauthorized disclosure of technology to the public

1320
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
by using the UFO phenomena as a cover.

1321
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And then the second part of the briefing

1322
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
was where we were actually shown

1323
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and briefed about

1324
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
the United States government's

1325
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
involvement with extraterrestrials

1326
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
since the late 1940s,

1327
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
which was obviously the most interesting part of the briefing.

1328
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Well, they showed us a lot of things.

1329
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
They showed us a film, which was late 40s or early 50s film

1330
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
of a recovery operation, which they talked about

1331
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
as being in Roswell.

1332
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
They showed crash debris, they showed extraterrestrial bodies,

1333
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
and then there was also a briefing showing a live alien

1334
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
sitting in a room talking to people.

1335
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
The director of this film talked about the continuation

1336
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
of a connection between the United States government

1337
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
and extraterrestrial civilizations.

1338
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
After viewing this, I was not sure

1339
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
if it was real,

1340
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
if they presented it to us for some reason,

1341
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
maybe some kind of psychological conditioning.

1342
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I don't think I initially believed any of it.

1343
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
But after the film was over with,

1344
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
an Air Force colonel in uniform

1345
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
then started talking about the operation, the program,

1346
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
and how the United States government,

1347
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
and it was always the United States government,

1348
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
it wasn't Air Force or Army, it was the United States government,

1349
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
how they progressed from the early days,

1350
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
meaning the crash retrieval operations

1351
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
in the late 40s until now,

1352
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
which was the late 70s.

1353
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And then the more he spoke, the more I realized

1354
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
that what I saw was real,

1355
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
that this guy wouldn't be standing here talking to us

1356
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
with the people in the room

1357
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
briefing into this high-level program if it was hoax.

1358
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
A fractured hall of mirrors

1359
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
with a quicksand floor

1360
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
that nobody knows exactly what the truths are,

1361
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
and everybody has found themselves

1362
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
completely suspicious of the motives

1363
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
of any human being,

1364
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
because counterintelligence in England

1365
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
and the United States and a lot of other countries

1366
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
have worked overtime to misinform

1367
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
and to tell the public and the media

1368
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
there's nothing to the UFO phenomenon.

1369
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
It's a lie.

1370
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I have a question about it,

1371
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
and my work is to try to shed some light on

1372
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
what could be so threatening

1373
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
out of some other intelligence

1374
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
from some other part of the universe

1375
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
or it's been here for two billion years

1376
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
and it's not extraterrestrial,

1377
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
we're the new ones on the block.

1378
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
What is it that is considered so threatening

1379
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
that governments would kill people to keep it silent?

1380
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
They can't come forth and say,

1381
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
yeah, okay, we had contact in 1947 and all this is real.

1382
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
What would that do? That would open up the Pandora's box

1383
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
because there would be millions and millions and millions

1384
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
of people asking questions that somebody has to answer.

1385
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
The easiest thing for the government to do is to say

1386
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
no comment or not. It didn't happen.

1387
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
But there are so many people,

1388
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
so many people within the government

1389
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
that have come forth with information saying

1390
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
it did happen, it's real.

1391
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And the reason I'm doing it is because

1392
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I asked the government a long time ago,

1393
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
hey, what am I supposed to say? And they're going to say

1394
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
you stick with the fact that it's not real.

1395
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Then I went to them and said, listen,

1396
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
you're telling everybody that it's not real,

1397
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
and I know it's real, and you know it's real,

1398
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
and all these other people know it's real,

1399
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
so I'm going to tell the public what I know about it.

1400
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
And the government basically said, do what you've got to do.

1401
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Let's take one step at a time.

1402
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
You're looking at Richard Doty.

1403
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
You're taking a glimpse into

1404
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
a whole machine

1405
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
that now has a life of its own.

1406
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Well, I was a young man,

1407
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
and I had heard about UFOs, but you know,

1408
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I didn't believe it was even possible

1409
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
to have a UFO.

1410
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
But then I went to an Air Force base,

1411
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Air Force base.

1412
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
They took me aside and said, you know what, guess what?

1413
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
We have an alien among us.

1414
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And I said, you've got to be kidding.

1415
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And they said, would we kid anybody?

1416
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
So I went up to the Air Force base,

1417
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
went up to the Air Force base,

1418
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
and now I stand before you

1419
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
saying that I am a true believer

1420
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
in UFOs.

1421
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
UFOs.

1422
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Give me a UFO.

1423
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
UFOs are real

1424
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
indeed.

1425
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
That is so dumb.

1426
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I didn't even make any sense.

1427
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Music

1428
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Music

1429
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000

1430
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000

1431

1432

1433

1434
