1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,960
Everything that we know and have learned about mankind and its place in the universe,

2
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:09,120
suggests that we are a part of the norm, we are not the exception.

3
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,840
Within the last month, a planet was identified that has water a mere 110 light years away from

4
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:26,360
Earth. We need to begin to prepare to accept and understand that we are not alone in the universe,

5
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:35,560
have not been at all throughout this time. The same year that life-giving water was discovered

6
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:45,480
on a distant planet, the US Navy made a startling announcement. Images captured by its pilots of

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:57,800
objects exhibiting a vastly superior technology were authentic. We can start to finally at long

8
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:04,800
last after all these decades begin to answer these questions about the origin of these vehicles,

9
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,480
where they're from, how they're made, how they function and why they're here.

10
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,440
People need to know there is something else out there.

11
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:29,800
To fully understand, we must examine a body of evidence long suppressed,

12
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:36,840
a parallel history to the one we think we know, stretching back at least 70 years.

13
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:52,120
On a clear sunny day in 1955, William Coleman, a decorated World War II pilot, took off from

14
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,320
Miami on a routine flight to deliver a B-25 bomber to an air base in Mississippi.

15
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,080
My co-pilot said, look at that bright spot up there. I think it's just a reflection of the

16
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:13,480
sun, a craze probably in the windshield. He and his passengers, two aviation engineers,

17
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,560
realized it was a strange object making a rapid descent right across their flight path.

18
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,080
My God, look at that thing. I opened it up to max continuous power. Here we're clipping right

19
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,000
along at over 300 miles an hour, right on the treetops. I'm right on the tail of this thing.

20
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,320
As we got closer, I said, it doesn't have a tail. It doesn't have any wings.

21
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,520
Look at the shadow on the ground. The shadow is perfectly round. That's not an airplane.

22
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:59,800
And I said, I'm overtaking it. So I said, hang on. So I'll make a hard turn. There it was, a disc,

23
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,960
going across the field with two big swirls.

24
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:14,840
What I didn't see was any exhaust, propulsion, no rivet lines, a rounded edge about that size

25
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,880
where it all came together. A true flying saucer.

26
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,840
Then it seemed to vanish until they spotted it thousands of feet above them.

27
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:39,160
Bright, yellow, sunish looking object. It went like a bat out of hell.

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,680
After they landed, the stunned witnesses were separately debriefed by Project Blue Book,

29
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,200
the Air Force investigation of the UFO phenomenon.

30
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,320
Ironically, a little over a decade later,

31
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,360
Colonel William T. Coleman became public spokesman for Project Blue Book.

32
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,000
Probably what we saw may have been from somewhere else.

33
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:27,000
Look, the Air Force is a very deadly being when it comes to intercepting an unknown.

34
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,080
If it proves hostile, we're going to shoot it down. Other than that, no problem.

35
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:46,680
In the late 1940s, America seemed impregnable to military threat.

36
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,600
It had just emerged from World War II, masters of the air, the only nuclear-armed superpower in

37
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:03,400
the world. But in 1947, something appeared in the sky and everything changed.

38
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Every newscaster and every newspaper across the nation has made headlines out of it.

39
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,240
And this afternoon, we are honored indeed to have here in our studio, this man, Kenneth Arnold,

40
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,800
who we believe may be able to give us a firsthand account and give you the same on what happened.

41
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,200
I kept looking for their tails. They didn't have any tails. I thought, well, maybe something's wrong

42
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:32,280
with my eyes. They seemed to flip and flash in the sun just like a mirror. I'd be glad to confirm it

43
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,000
with my hands on a Bible because I did see it. And whether it has anything to do with our army

44
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,280
or our intelligence or whether it has to do with some foreign country, I don't know.

45
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Arnold had sent this sketch to the Air Force following his sighting. He was later invited

46
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:55,080
to California's Hamilton Field Army Air Base. Where he was handed what he was told were authentic

47
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,160
photos of a similar craft. At the request of Lieutenant Colonel Donald Springer, commanding officer

48
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,360
of the 4th Air Force Intelligence and was given the above prints as a courtesy for the assistance

49
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,880
he had given military intelligence. The photo was taken in Arizona just two weeks after his own

50
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:24,600
encounter. They said that my father's sighting of flying saucers got more attention than the

51
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,600
ending of World War II. He was besieged by newspaper reporters from all over the world.

52
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:40,680
Mm-hmm. Reporters interviewed United Airlines pilot E.J. Smith who also flew the Northwest

53
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:48,920
route. He joked Arnold had likely been fooled by a cockpit reflection until he too became a witness

54
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:56,920
a few weeks later. He and his stunned crew had watched as nine disks maneuvered in formation

55
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:05,320
for a full 45 minutes. And from there it just exploded. The first few days in July of 1947 had

56
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:13,400
a very large level of exciting activity. These unknown objects barnstormed across the country,

57
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,680
sometimes in fleet-like formations that looked like a deliberate show of force.

58
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,080
Hundreds of people told Air Force investigators they'd seen the saucers with their own eyes.

59
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,640
Bright shiny things that wish through the air at incredible speeds. Even airline pilots who seldom

60
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,760
indulge in fantasy reported sighting them. And Air Force flyers told of chasing them

61
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,720
or something all over the sky. The Air Force called them unidentified flying objects

62
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:50,360
but people went right on calling them saucers and seeing there was something in the air.

63
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,200
Well the Air Force has the best brains in the country working on it.

64
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:30,760
But a then secret memorandum by the same general suggested that the highest military echelons

65
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,920
thought there was plenty to worry about.

66
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,600
The memo states quote the phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.

67
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,560
It described metallic disks circular in shape with domes on top often traveling in formations

68
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:59,000
of three to nine craft. It also listed aerodynamic capabilities with disturbing implications

69
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,120
for national defense, extreme rates of climb, dazzling maneuverability, and the superior

70
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,200
capacity for evasive action. A lot of people expected that the United States government was

71
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,880
about to confirm okay they're ours. This is an exciting new technological advance that we've

72
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,080
we were testing and now it's time to tell people about it. Occasionally eyewitness testimony

73
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,720
included compelling photographic evidence.

74
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,800
Evelyn Trent was feeding her rabbits when she spotted a metallic disc shaped object

75
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,520
floating over their farm. She alerted her husband Paul to grab his camera

76
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,440
and he managed to get two shots.

77
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:03,640
They described the object slowly hovering before it abruptly sped away. Life magazine

78
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,960
picked up the story and the McMinnville UFO became a global sensation. There's no chance

79
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,680
of this being weather. There's no chance of this being a star or an aircraft. This is either some

80
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,520
kind of structured object that we don't know what it is or it's a hoax. Paul Trent and his wife they

81
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,120
were honest, simple, hard-working people who never made a dime off the photographs that they took.

82
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,360
They never tried to make a dime off of it. It just come up like that and tipped and just

83
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,000
I mean really went. It went fast.

84
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,640
I've never seen anything go so fast in my life as that thing went. Yeah.

85
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:53,160
In 1951 future astronaut Gordon Cooper while training in Germany chased a large formation

86
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:59,240
with his squadron of fighter jets. Unlike fighters they would stop almost stop in their forward

87
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,360
velocity and change 90 degrees sometimes in their flight path and within the next two to three days

88
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,680
we'd had practically all the fighters we could muster on the base up climbing as high as they

89
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,120
would climb with guys with binoculars in them still trying to spot these strange devices flying

90
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,800
overhead and we never could get close enough really to pin them down but they were round and

91
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,640
shape and very metallic looking and they would come over and do the same maneuvers that we make

92
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,080
except everyone's while one of them goes to his hip and you just can't do that in a fighter.

93
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,800
Like two saucers one inverted over the other they seemed to be made of some kind of polished metal

94
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:54,280
when I first saw the objects they were almost overhead by the time I had the camera ready to

95
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,680
go they had moved to a considerably greater distance.

96
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,520
But the unknowns showed no signs of hostility

97
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,920
an otherworldly power on its own mysterious mission.

98
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:25,800
Commercial pilots William Nash and William Fortenberry former Navy aviators with thousands

99
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,800
of hours of flight experience saw eight huge disks fly in a stack formation over Chesapeake Bay,

100
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:41,400
Virginia just a stone's throw from Washington DC. When they came out over the blackness of the

101
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:49,240
bay they're distinct six red coins when they got closer we could see that you were it looked like

102
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:56,120
you were looking down into it like a hot coal. They reported the glowing red objects had approached

103
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:04,280
them head on at a speed they estimated at six to 12 000 miles per hour. They came in like this and

104
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:11,640
went out like this there would be no way of making complete reversal or a 90 degree turn

105
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,200
12 000 miles an hour or greater without making the occupants juice on the wall.

106
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,160
They kind of really shook us up looking at the things shook us up nothing could have gotten to

107
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:33,080
that degree of scientific progress without some of the intermediate steps

108
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,440
having become public knowledge. We just knew that they were not from this planet.

109
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:50,600
The next weekend the unthinkable happened the nation's capital was invaded from the skies.

110
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,040
Seven unknown blips suddenly appeared on radar at Washington National Airport.

111
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,520
Air traffic controllers at both Andrews and bowling air force bases confirmed the objects

112
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,040
as they danced through restricted airspace.

113
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,400
The Capitol building, the White House where the president lived, these were some of the most

114
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,840
important places in the country when it comes to national defense.

115
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,400
And there were ufos violating this airspace and there was nothing that the air force could do

116
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,880
about it. F-94 interceptors were scrambled.

117
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,120
Pentagon press liaison Al Chop was in the radar room that night. We could see the planes coming

118
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,000
in on this radar scope the minute we saw the beginning of these guys ufos disappeared.

119
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,280
Ufos disappeared they just left. Obviously whatever these things were had intelligence

120
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,040
enough to get out of the area when we had an intercept going in.

121
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:03,400
But the next weekend it began again. Pilot William Patterson pushed his starfire jet

122
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,800
to maximum speed to try to intercept one of the glowing objects.

123
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:16,120
It flew right into the middle of three or four of them. Al Chop recalls the pilot's panicky air to

124
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,360
ground transmission as he streaked at 600 miles per hour into a group of unknowns.

125
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,960
He actually said they're closing in on me. What do I do?

126
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,880
It was frightening.

127
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:43,800
The air force had just issued orders to shoot down the unknowns if quote they can't talk them down.

128
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,920
I'm not going to tell an air force pilot to fire at the damn thing or anything.

129
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,720
What? I didn't say anything. Nobody said anything.

130
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,440
And then all of a sudden things began to move away from here and he said they're gone.

131
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:07,080
I'm convinced they're solid objects. I'm convinced that they're probably from another planet

132
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,480
or from outer space somewhere. I've always felt that way since that night.

133
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,320
The very next day the air force's top brass hastily prepared the largest

134
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,600
Pentagon press conference since World War II.

135
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,720
Seen here in the last-minute huddle, General Roger Ramey, Air Force Director of Operations at the Pentagon.

136
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,360
Captain Edward Ruppelt of Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official UFO investigations arm

137
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,600
and Director of Air Force Intelligence General John Samford.

138
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,760
And Director of Air Force Intelligence General John Samford.

139
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,640
Since 1947 we have received and analyzed between one and two thousand reports

140
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,920
that have come to us from all kinds of sources. Of this great mass of reports we have been able

141
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,720
adequately to explain the great bulk of them. However there have been a certain percentage

142
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,680
of this volume of reports that have been made by credible observers of relatively

143
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:21,080
incredible things. We can say that the recent sightings are in no way connected

144
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,560
with any secret development by any department of the United States.

145
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:34,680
In the Q&A with reporters, Samford suggested a 50-50 chance it could have been radar waves

146
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,760
bouncing off temperature inversions. The point that Samford put across all too

147
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:48,200
effectively was that they were not real. They were just tricks of the atmosphere.

148
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:56,040
An atmospheric phenomena can't be a threat to national security. You don't shoot at clouds.

149
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:06,040
The public was pondering the implications of possible extraterrestrial contact.

150
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,520
Robert L. Farnsworth, President of the United States Rocket Society,

151
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:17,000
urged defense officials not to permit our planes to fire at any flying saucers. He says this might

152
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,040
alienate mankind from beings of far superior forces. Farnsworth feels that friendly contact

153
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:32,920
should be fought as long as possible. Behind the scenes, the CIA had other concerns.

154
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:42,040
A secret internal memo urged immediate attention to unexplained objects in the vicinity of major

155
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:49,160
U.S. defense installations. I would dare say if anything happened that we thought was a threat

156
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,640
to our national security, somebody out there, one of the services, would respond to it.

157
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,000
Remember, this is the height of the Cold War. There are bombers on both sides loaded with

158
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,240
nuclear bombs. Dr. Jacques Vallée was the inspiration for the French UFO researcher

159
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,080
in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

160
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Have you recently had a close encounter? In real life, Dr. Vallée conducted sober scientific

161
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,560
research on the phenomenon. We know now that there is no simple answer. For decades, he met

162
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:42,680
with witnesses and traveled the globe gathering evidence, ultimately creating the first database

163
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:50,280
on the UFO subject. Mr. Chairman, all the great nations of the world are represented

164
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,800
on this committee. Let us keep in mind that the UFO phenomenon may represent an even greater

165
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:03,400
reality. Vallée also consulted with scientific, military, and government officials including

166
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,280
Project Blue Book's top science advisor, Dr. J. Allen Hynek.

167
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,400
I began my work as scientific consultant to the United States Air Force as an open skeptic.

168
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,120
Hynek was a university astronomer with a high security clearance when the Air Force recruited

169
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,520
him to investigate UFOs. And it so happened when the Air Force got the job of trying to figure out

170
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,040
what some of these strange flying saucer stories were about. Well, they needed an astronomer to see

171
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,520
how many of the reports could possibly be explained as meteors and twinkling stars and planets.

172
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:48,120
The two scientists became close colleagues, with Hynek entrusting Vallée to index the reams of

173
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:55,800
Blue Book files scattered throughout Hynek's home. It was there that Vallée made a chance discovery

174
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:02,360
of a letter so secret he had to appeal to the chief counsel of the Senate Defense Appropriations

175
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:09,080
Committee to get it declassified. That document changed my life. It taught me that the subject

176
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:17,000
had been taken much more seriously than anybody thought. The document revealed an ultra-secret,

177
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,440
highly funded scientific investigation working parallel to Blue Book, unknown to all,

178
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:34,520
but a select few. The letter was signed by H.C. Cross, director of exotic metallurgy

179
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:41,080
at Battelle National Laboratories. These were the people who had analyzed the files

180
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,400
with a large budget, with highly competent physicists and computer scientists.

181
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:55,080
Who are these people? What information did they have?

182
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,640
Good evening. Tonight we go after a fantastic story. The story that flying saucers from other

183
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,800
worlds are visiting our planet just as we are exploring outer space with our own rocket satellites.

184
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,800
Our guest is former Marine Air Corps Major Donald Keyhole in his campaign to prove that

185
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,240
flying saucers exist. My name is Mike Wallace. The cigarette is Parliament. Why will the United

186
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,200
States government withhold information from United States citizens? For what reason?

187
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,040
The Air Force is simply treating the American people like children. They don't trust them with

188
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:41,560
the facts. During the 50s and 60s, it wasn't just the Americans who were seeing flying saucers.

189
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,960
At the Westall School in Australia, several hundred students saw an object hovering over

190
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:55,720
this power line tower on their athletic field, an event they vividly recall 50 years later.

191
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,720
A student came into the classroom, you know, there's flying saucers in the in the oval,

192
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:06,120
there's flying saucers, and everybody ran out. And I remember the fear and the hysteria of all the

193
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,520
students. I couldn't believe it because what I was seeing wasn't possible. It was vertical,

194
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,720
horizontal, move away from us, back towards us, appear somewhere else, somewhere else.

195
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:25,080
My god, you know, but it was exciting. It was like that and then all of a sudden it just turned

196
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:33,080
on its side and I could see that it was a round disk. The children saw the disk begin to descend

197
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,160
into this wooded reserve at the end of the school's running path. I ran towards the corner of the

198
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,440
school, jumped the fence and ran towards where it looked as though it went down into the trees

199
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,880
and then stopped dead because it was right in front of me on the ground.

200
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,520
Like a disk with a slight rise in the middle,

201
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,480
I also heard a low sort of a humming noise and I felt a bit of a heat coming off it as well.

202
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,280
And it started to take off pretty well straight away. It had all bluey-purple lights around the

203
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,320
bottom. I don't remember seeing any windows and it took off to about probably four or five meters

204
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:22,440
in the air and then turned on its side and just went zoom straight up so fast that there's just

205
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:29,640
nothing, even now, day that could go that fast. Shortly after the object departed,

206
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:37,640
the authorities converged on the school. We had army, air force, police down there cordoning off

207
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,880
the area to prevent any of us entering the area or disturbing anything. We got called to assembly,

208
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,800
the headmaster said you have not seen this, you do not talk about it, you'll be in trouble if you do.

209
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,800
For the first time ever, the school science teacher agreed to describe what he saw that day,

210
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,200
providing we concealed his identity. It was not a mirage,

211
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:10,360
there was something physical in the sky. It was silver, it could hover, it could move slowly,

212
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,840
it could move very rapidly. Eventually it moved away to the other side of the oval and down behind

213
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:24,840
some pine trees. I was not then, nor ever have been, able to use my knowledge of the world,

214
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:32,520
nor my scientific training to provide a rational explanation. What he said next sheds light on why

215
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:38,920
the school staff have remained silent all these years. I was a knock on the door one night,

216
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:45,880
two older men, one in uniform, asked for my description of what I'd seen. I was then told

217
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:52,360
that I hadn't seen anything but I'd made it all up, possibly because I was drunk and that they

218
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,800
would have to report that fact to the education department and I would lose my job. After that I

219
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:05,400
was told that I would be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act and I was told that there

220
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,720
wasn't anything there when I knew there was and that I had to keep quiet about it.

221
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,400
Why did I have to keep quiet?

222
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:21,560
The Westall landing may not have been an isolated incident.

223
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:29,560
Four days prior, a then young engineer in nearby Baldwin was taking photos in his mother's garden

224
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:35,640
when something caught his eye. This tremendous flash of light and I looked up and I saw this

225
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,360
object and I pulled, I had a Polaroid camera and I pulled this up, hit myself on my face

226
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,040
and I took the picture and I thought the photograph here. This is the original Polaroid.

227
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,120
It looked like it was made out of some form of metal and it was engineered and being an engineer

228
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:09,080
I was sure it was and this when I took the photograph and it tipped around I could see

229
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:15,320
the bottom and it looked like it was rotating to me and that was it and then after that it

230
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:21,560
sort of gave a bounce and it rocketed away to the north very high speed. Can you describe

231
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:27,640
the acceleration? It was like almost insane, it's like it had been shot out of a gun. Wham!

232
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:36,440
Air Force officers showed up at his doorstep asking for every detail of his experience.

233
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:42,840
And they also had some photographs of similar things and they also had a book

234
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,640
which had pictures of things in which they didn't leave with me but at least I had to look through

235
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,400
but they said it was an unidentified flying object so that was it.

236
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,720
What was the implication? That it didn't come from anywhere on earth.

237
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,800
Project Blue Book with a skeletal staff continued publicly collecting thousands of cases.

238
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,960
Despite efforts to explain them away hundreds were still filed as unknown.

239
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,120
Several reports of a strange egg-shaped object about 200 feet long landing on farms and highways

240
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:35,160
last night in the vicinity of Leveland. Sheriff Glenn says he even himself got a glimpse of the

241
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,480
thing which somehow turned off lights and auto engines when it came near.

242
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,120
Within 24 to 36 hours after these sightings in Leveland, Texas at the White Sands Proving

243
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,600
Ground, very close to the Trinity Test Site where they first detonated the first atomic bomb,

244
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,840
military personnel witnessed a glowing egg-shaped object that apparently landed.

245
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:43,720
Well, I was chasing a car up Park Street. It was reckless driving.

246
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:52,120
I saw this big cloud of smoke so I decided to let go of the car and go up there and investigate.

247
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,640
By the time I got there I could see a big white object sitting in the arroyo.

248
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,440
I couldn't tell what it was at first.

249
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,240
My radio was dead. It didn't work at all.

250
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,160
I could see some figures.

251
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,200
Looked like they were walking around the craft there.

252
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:27,720
They appeared to be dressed in white coveralls and were child-like, that is, small.

253
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,240
Zamora added that one of the two persons turned his head and looked straight at him.

254
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,280
When I got out of the car, about 50 feet from it,

255
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:53,320
I guess they saw me because they started their motor or whatever it is.

256
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,920
I could see a big blast of fire coming from right under it.

257
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,920
So I was behind some bushes there behind my car. I could see it and I could feel that heat.

258
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,600
That really got me scared, you know. A lot of people say why don't you take your gun out and

259
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,640
shoot at it, you know. They weren't doing nothing to me, so.

260
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,240
It just took a little while to get airborne.

261
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,920
Came up a little bit, about 20, 30 feet, and it stayed there a little while.

262
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,080
And it stayed just as quiet as it could be.

263
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,080
And then just flew away, that's it.

264
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:51,480
Lonnie was very, very scared. He was as white as a sheet from here.

265
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,320
Went directly to the church to talk to the priest, okay.

266
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,280
Pablo Lopez was among the first to arrive at the landing and takeoff site.

267
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,880
The ground was still smoldering, some of the weeds that were around it.

268
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,760
This rare footage gives us a glimpse of the scene shortly after the incident.

269
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,040
Patrolman Zamora stoops to point out one of the landing gear imprints

270
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,760
where officers had just placed rocks to protect the fresh ground traces.

271
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,080
And then there was a set, two sets of footprints, two sets of footprints like so.

272
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
That was about the approximate size of them.

273
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,920
And in comparison to the quarter, that's pretty small, okay.

274
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,200
That's about the size of them.

275
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:41,640
Within an hour and over the next several days, officials from the FBI,

276
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,120
military, and Project Blue Book documented the evidence at the scene.

277
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,920
Were there any prong marks on the ground or anything like that where

278
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,280
you can see where it had landed?

279
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,920
There were four.

280
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,240
Very unusual footprints.

281
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,440
How many were there?

282
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,840
Two footprints on one side and two footprints on the other side.

283
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,640
Of course, the burn area there.

284
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,840
I was behind my car.

285
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
I could see it and I could feel that heat.

286
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,440
They told me that all over the state they had been seeing some of those flying saucers,

287
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,640
whatever you call them.

288
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,040
They gave me a book on it, you know, and they told me to go ahead and read it.

289
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,160
Well, it says not to say nothing.

290
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,000
Keep away from it.

291
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,200
Don't say too much, you know.

292
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,360
It was the middle of the night by the time Lonnie came home.

293
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,400
Oh, he was real pale.

294
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,120
And I thought he was sick.

295
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,800
I said, are you sick or something?

296
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,440
He said, no.

297
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,800
He said, I was just working.

298
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,080
He was like, like he was angry.

299
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,760
What I knew about it was when I started reading the papers, you know,

300
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,760
started coming out and coming out and everything.

301
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,840
I said, well, what's this that you said?

302
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,400
I don't know.

303
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,840
He said, it's just a headache.

304
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,320
He said, everybody's after me and some believe me and some don't.

305
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,520
Dear Mr. Zamora,

306
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,520
Dear Mr. Zamora,

307
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,320
Dear Mr. Zamora,

308
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,040
I'm interested in UFOs.

309
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Sure, I believe you saw an egg-shaped spacecraft that had passengers.

310
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,840
I saw a UFO myself in the summer of 1910.

311
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,080
I'd go on for a week telling you what I'd seen.

312
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,200
One in our school science fair had three pictures in that book,

313
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,080
just like the one that I saw in the spacecraft.

314
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,440
I thought I should write to you to tell you that you are not alone in your sighting of this object.

315
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,960
As I have pictures of a couple of egg-shaped ships taken when I was little.

316
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,280
I read about you seeing a flying saucer.

317
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,480
Well, you have a friend.

318
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,520
The saucer phenomenon has changed my life and ideas.

319
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,840
Mama said when it took off, he said his long teeth bite.

320
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,480
1960, a red bluff officers and dozens of people saw it.

321
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,080
Can you tell me how long it stayed on earth and other things like that?

322
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:16,360
And then people started making fun of him that he had seen little man from outer space or this and

323
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,280
that and all my sister's dirty stuff.

324
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,680
A lot of people ask me, is that the reason you quit the police force?

325
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,640
No, the reason I quit the police force because I was going into,

326
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,320
you know, a lot of publicity and stuff like that and I didn't want to hurt the town.

327
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,760
The level of inquiry went all the way to the office of the president.

328
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,360
To this day, the Socorro close encounter remains unexplained.

329
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:54,600
Socorro was very similar to the French cases that I had brought to Hynick's attention.

330
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,320
Checked by the police, checked by the French Air Force,

331
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:07,560
where there were also occupants who were seen short beings in connection with the object.

332
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:17,000
I think that's what convinced him that there were UFO landings in the United States.

333
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,240
It looked like a toy top, somewhat upside down.

334
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,640
So this is the diagram in which we've come up with.

335
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,960
It's more from the beginning.

336
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,840
This is the diagram in which we've come up with.

337
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,480
It's more flat here other than round, but it does have the hump up in here.

338
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,360
It seemed to move off the ground if it was down.

339
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,880
And then we saw three lights that went from yellow to red.

340
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,720
When you got right up to it, it lit up.

341
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,600
I mean, it needed to come bright and we could see it, the outline of it real good.

342
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:02,440
Blue Book's Dr. Alan Hynick investigated one of the alleged landing sites with the local sheriff.

343
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,640
At an overflow press conference later that day, the world held its breath

344
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,320
for an historic revelation about the landings in Michigan.

345
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,600
Hynick, by now privately convinced of the UFO reality,

346
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,680
struggled to follow the Air Force policy of tamping down public excitement.

347
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,320
Are you saying that the sightings of the Ann Arbor and Hillsdale areas

348
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,800
definitely were caused by marsh gases?

349
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,400
I'm saying that the two cases that I investigated most deeply were most likely.

350
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,600
I said in a statement that I couldn't prove it in a court of law.

351
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,480
Otherwise you're saying then that you don't know what caused it.

352
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,960
No, that's not quite right.

353
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,400
I think that a person can be pretty sure about something

354
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,040
without being able to convict somebody of a murder.

355
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,640
Can you say, can you say?

356
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,880
Yes, I do, honestly, in this case, in this case.

357
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,840
But you can't say without question that this is what happened.

358
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:06,680
Hynick's strained explanation, which he later called his greatest regret,

359
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,080
ignited a public furor.

360
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,320
Mr. Ford, what about flying saucers?

361
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,200
You've had some in Michigan in the past week.

362
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:22,120
Dave, we've had several incidents that many felt were sufficient to justify

363
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,520
some action by our government and not the kind of flippin' answer

364
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,360
that was given by the Air Force where they passed it off as a swamp gap.

365
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,320
It seems to me that this mystery does require

366
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,200
that the Congress take a good look at it.

367
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,680
Let them put their record on the line.

368
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,080
On April 5th, 1966, congressional hearings were held

369
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:54,680
with Dr. Hynick and Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown both giving testimony.

370
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,120
Mr. Ford has come out.

371
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,000
He has a pretty good size stature in the Congress.

372
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:10,920
And so, Mr. Secretary, see if you can shed some light on these highly illuminated objects.

373
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:18,040
Mr. Secretary, there have been charges that the Air Force is hiding something in the UFO field.

374
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,520
We have not been hiding anything.

375
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,360
The investigations have been made public.

376
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,320
The hearing this morning was public for just that reason.

377
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,280
There has never been any evidence presented to the United States Air Force

378
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,080
or discovered by the United States Air Force,

379
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,200
which would indicate that the UFO phenomenon

380
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,960
represents any interplanetary space vehicle of any kind.

381
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,200
Amid growing pressure, the Air Force commissioned an outside panel of scientists

382
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,920
to analyze select cases and settle the matter once and for all.

383
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,920
It was headed by physicist Edward Condon.

384
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,720
Dr. Condon, do you hope to find people from outer space here on Earth?

385
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,040
Well, I don't know for sure, but we'll try to just study the reports

386
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,800
and get as much additional information as we can to see.

387
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,120
Would you like to have us being visited by these little or big things?

388
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,720
Well, that'd be fine with me if I hope they're friendly.

389
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,960
How do you propose to go about?

390
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,560
After the project was launched, Condon remarked to an audience

391
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,160
that he thought the UFO subject was nonsense,

392
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,880
but, quote, I'm not supposed to reach that conclusion for another year.

393
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,800
After a two-year investigation, the panel submitted a massive 1,400-page report

394
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,600
showing that many cases were radar and weather anomalies,

395
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,040
but confirming a number as truly unexplainable.

396
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,880
Among them were the famous McMinnville photos taken on the Trent family farm,

397
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,320
as well as film footage of UFOs in Great Falls, Montana.

398
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,040
As I looked up, I saw two silvery objects moving swiftly out of the northwest.

399
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,720
No sound, except I thought I heard a whooshing sound when I first saw them.

400
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,360
The disks appeared to be spinning like the top and were about 50 feet across.

401
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,520
Which was much slower than the jets which shot by shortly after I filmed the disks.

402
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,800
I could not see any exhaust, wings, or any kind of fuselage.

403
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,480
They appeared to be of a bright, shiny metal, like polished silver.

404
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,880
There are cases that are not explainable in conventional terms.

405
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,440
There is the assumption of intelligence or intelligent control,

406
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,320
but not necessarily the assumption of direct communication.

407
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,040
Why are they here? What are they doing? What do they want from us? What are their motivations?

408
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,920
But it was Dr. Condon who wrote the final word.

409
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,720
There appears to be no verified and fully satisfactory evidence of any case

410
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:13,400
that is clearly outside the framework of presently known science and technology.

411
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:21,400
I would kind of wally on that one. You'd have to conclude that what we were looking at

412
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,520
was beyond our current state of the knowledge.

413
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,640
But it began to hit me that Dr. Condon has apparently not read his own

414
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,640
material very carefully. You do an actual tabulation, which he doesn't seem to have done,

415
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,720
and you find his percentage of unexplained is five to six times larger than the Air Force.

416
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,800
And yet, what is his principal recommendation? The principal recommendation that Dr. Condon

417
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,240
has come through with is there's nothing of scientific interest that warrants further

418
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,360
attention on the part of the federal government here. In any major way,

419
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:54,840
he recommends dropping the whole problem. Nobody could get funded. Nobody would look at the data

420
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:02,680
seriously because of the prestige of the academy saying that the problem had been solved.

421
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:09,880
The Air Force closed their reporting system so that if the public wanted to report something,

422
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,200
they would report it to the local police, but it would never get to the attention

423
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,040
of scientists really examining the phenomenon.

424
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:26,360
In 1969, the Air Force officially ended its public investigations.

425
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,920
Which would suggest what? That they knew what it was?

426
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,440
Or didn't know what it was.

427
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Also, the other way, they did know what it was.

428
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:41,800
That's why.

429
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,600
One aspect of the phenomenon that was swept under the rug

430
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,600
was the pervasive reporting of UFO intrusions

431
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,940
at the world's most sensitive military facilities.

432
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,580
Details did not come to light until decades later

433
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:25,620
at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

434
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,320
Declassified U.S. government documents

435
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,620
and witness testimony from former or retired

436
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:36,220
U.S. military personnel confirm, beyond any doubt,

437
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,920
the reality of ongoing UFO incursions

438
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,020
at nuclear weapons sites.

439
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,460
What you have heard here today is evidence of a phenomenon.

440
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,300
It sounds fantastic, and it is fantastic.

441
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,140
In 1967, I was a missile launch officer

442
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,900
stationed at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana.

443
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,740
Malmstrom was America's first line of nuclear defense.

444
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,780
Its silos packed with Minutemen missiles,

445
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,300
each one nearly a hundred times more powerful

446
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,740
than the bomb that devastated Hiroshima.

447
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,120
Launch officers could, within minutes of confirmation,

448
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,520
send their birds arcane 6,000 miles

449
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,280
to incinerate key Soviet cities,

450
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,920
triggering a war that would end our civilization.

451
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,920
The U.S. military is now in the hands of the Soviet Union.

452
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,360
I was the chief of party, I was the observer.

453
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,960
Basically, what I was doing was the star observation

454
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,460
to provide precise latitude and longitude

455
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,460
on our small three-man team.

456
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,240
Came from the north and stopped right over us.

457
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,460
And it had a white light from the center,

458
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,160
looking down into the silo.

459
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,940
I just said to myself, what if this thing beams us up

460
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,240
and takes us off to some distant place

461
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,840
and never returned to Earth again?

462
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,480
I mean, this is going through my head here

463
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,740
while this thing's above me.

464
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,420
And then from this dead stop, it shoots off to the east.

465
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,980
It's just like, now you see it, now you don't.

466
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,820
It just...

467
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,820
The strike team that went out claimed that they saw something.

468
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:22,980
How did they describe that?

469
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,640
He just had a large round object.

470
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,480
Directly over the LS?

471
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,320
Directly over the site.

472
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,180
Lieutenant Salas was stationed

473
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,060
in his underground launch control capsule

474
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,460
when he received a frantic call from one of his topside guards.

475
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,300
Screaming into the phone saying,

476
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,860
they're looking for a target,

477
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,340
Screaming into the phone saying,

478
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,480
they're looking for a red glowing object

479
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,180
hovering just above our front gate.

480
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,520
Our missiles began going into what's called

481
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,900
a no-go condition or unlaunchable.

482
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,460
Essentially, they were disabled.

483
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,700
In fact, 10 missiles began going offline

484
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:11,160
in a matter of seconds, one after the other.

485
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,880
Firstly, I'm never aware of any two missiles

486
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,280
going down at the same time, let alone 10.

487
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,080
I was a top secret control officer

488
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,520
and I passed out nuclear launch authenticators.

489
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,280
I can clearly recall a message

490
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,360
coming through my communication center,

491
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,760
which basically said that a UFO did in fact

492
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,360
shut down several missile silos in Montana.

493
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,800
I was on duty at Echo, which is our squadron command post.

494
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,480
We had strike teams respond to alarms from the missiles.

495
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,300
They were three to five miles away.

496
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,880
And they said, sir, lack of a better description,

497
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,380
there's a flying saucer hovering over that missile.

498
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,180
And there's a beam of reddish light going down to it.

499
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,680
It had to be a data collection thing.

500
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,920
I'm sure they scanned the warhead or something.

501
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,920
In 1980, I was reassigned from the Pentagon

502
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,240
to RAF Bentwaters as a deputy base commander.

503
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,120
At that time, Bentwaters was one of the largest

504
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,920
tactical fighter planes in the world.

505
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,480
It was also the largest American nuclear bomb storage depot

506
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,600
in Europe.

507
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,320
In December, 1980, early in the morning,

508
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,360
several of our security policemen discovered

509
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,200
strange lights in the forest.

510
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,560
Expecting to find a crashed aircraft,

511
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,720
they came upon an unrecognizable object

512
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,800
resting on the forest floor.

513
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,880
They observed it for a period of time

514
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,140
and it very quickly and silently vanished.

515
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,400
Two nights later, Colonel Halt received an urgent visit

516
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,480
from the base security commander.

517
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,200
He was white as a sheet.

518
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,840
He said, it's back.

519
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,960
He said, what's back?

520
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,260
He said, the UFO.

521
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,160
I took several security policemen with me.

522
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,160
I also had my small cassette recorder

523
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,400
I carried everywhere when I was on duty.

524
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,240
What is it?

525
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,080
We don't know, sir.

526
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,560
Do you have a tag or something?

527
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,480
Yeah, it's a strange, small red light.

528
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,240
And all the barnyard animals have gotten quiet now.

529
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,440
Definitely calm.

530
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,840
This is weird.

531
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,080
One object approached us at very high speed.

532
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,280
Here, here he comes from the south.

533
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,880
He's coming towards us now.

534
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,640
I'm sure everyone appears to be a beam

535
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,920
coming down to the ground.

536
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,280
We stood there in awe.

537
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,760
Was this a warning?

538
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,200
Was this an attempt to communicate?

539
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,720
Was this a weapon?

540
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,320
Or just a probe?

541
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,520
Just as suddenly as it appeared, click, disappeared.

542
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,360
We stood there.

543
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,400
About that time, we noticed the other object

544
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,360
to the south was sending down beams

545
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,160
about a mile, mile and a half away over Woodbridge base

546
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,440
when we had great difficulties communicating.

547
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,080
But we were able to discern that some of those beams

548
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,880
were either falling into or near the weapon storage area,

549
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,520
and there's a great deal of concern.

550
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,520
I also found out later that both the tower operators

551
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,480
at Bentwaters saw an object and picked it up

552
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,200
on their bright two radar and watched it.

553
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,080
I was just sitting there and I happened to see

554
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:25,120
a dot come on the scope, and it just went like

555
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,280
one dot at the beginning, then another dot,

556
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,720
and another dot, and it was gone.

557
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,120
And then it made the immediate right hand turn

558
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,160
towards the base, just absolutely phenomenal.

559
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,400
It's not like any radar target I've ever seen

560
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,800
traveling at an extremely high rate of speed.

561
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,560
It passed over the control tower, and then it stopped.

562
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,280
It was an orangish color, sort of popped into my mind

563
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,840
at the time that somebody's flying a basketball out here.

564
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,880
There were lights around the center of it.

565
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,080
It was more like portholes, and then you were seeing

566
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,280
the light from the inside, but it hovered momentarily,

567
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,520
reversed its course, and went back out

568
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,000
at a high rate of speed.

569
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,000
Even more alarming incidents took place

570
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,040
on both sides of the Cold War.

571
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,560
According to one secret Soviet documents,

572
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,400
a UFO hovered over a Ukrainian nuclear base

573
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,800
for nearly an hour.

574
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,280
Inexplicably, several missiles suddenly switched

575
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,320
to full combat readiness and began a launch sequence

576
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,920
without any authentication codes.

577
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,640
After 15 heart-stopping seconds, the countdown

578
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,280
to a potential Armageddon ceased as abruptly

579
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,600
as it had started.

580
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,280
As this object passed over the missile site,

581
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,680
we would start getting erratic indications on that missile.

582
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,160
The bad thing was we also got a launch indicator.

583
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,800
Does that mean that the launch sequence has been triggered?

584
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,200
That means that the missile has received a launch signal.

585
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,920
The countdown had to be manually aborted.

586
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,200
We have UFOs in the air.

587
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,640
These witnesses are some of the most highly vetted military

588
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,280
officers in charge of the world's most

589
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,200
devastating armaments.

590
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,720
If what they're reporting is accurate,

591
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,320
then the pattern is hard to avoid.

592
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,440
UFOs have been making incursions into top security nuclear

593
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,920
facilities decade after decade.

594
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,400
To me, it's pretty clear.

595
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,280
This is just we're shining a light on this.

596
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,240
We're pointing it out.

597
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,440
What are you people doing with nuclear weapons?

598
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:30,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

599
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,000
As the 90s dawned and the walls fell down,

600
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,720
it was as if humanity itself was demanding

601
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,920
to be seen as one people and one world.

602
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,560
The Soviet Union had dissolved, and history's spotlight

603
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,160
began to shine on long, darkened corners.

604
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,440
Different officials were looking for ways

605
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,120
to open dialogue with the West and embrace all the changes

606
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,320
that were underway in their country at the time.

607
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,800
This is George Knapp in Moscow, the city many are

608
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,920
Knapp's team was invited to Moscow

609
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,520
by government and military officials

610
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:12,400
who were willing to share decades worth of UFO files.

611
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,160
General Igor Molchev, for seven years commander

612
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,480
of the entire Soviet air defense system,

613
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,840
recalls a UFO flap over Moscow in 1990.

614
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,280
Hundreds of visual and radar observations

615
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,040
by military personnel.

616
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,720
Molchev confirmed his standing order was, don't fire on the UFOs.

617
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,880
March 1991, radar at the Leningrad Airport

618
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,880
detects first one, then two, then three unidentified objects

619
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,640
hovering over a nuclear plant.

620
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,360
From a dead stop, the UFO zipped away at 2,000 miles per hour.

621
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,760
Jacques Vallee was one of few Westerners

622
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,400
to personally investigate the case by meeting

623
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,120
with Russian sources firsthand.

624
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,240
An object hovered near a nuclear power plant in Voronezh

625
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,040
and a beam from that object melted the asphalt there.

626
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,560
The intention was maybe we would be able to find out

627
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,200
from the Russians more about what the American government

628
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
knows about UFOs than we will ever learn

629
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,160
from the American government itself.

630
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,080
Governor, are you ready to take the oath?

631
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:09,960
I am.

632
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,000
When a young open-minded president was sworn in,

633
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,760
one of America's most highly placed civilians

634
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,840
saw a chance for a new government transparency

635
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,040
on the phenomenon.

636
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,520
As a means of access to people, to the wonders of nature.

637
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,360
Heir to the power and influence of one of the world's

638
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,800
wealthiest families, Lawrence Rockefeller,

639
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,760
philanthropist and conservationist,

640
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,640
also had a passionate interest in UFOs.

641
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,640
His idea was to approach the president

642
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,640
with a plea for making available the data

643
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,440
that the government had on the subject.

644
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,440
The first inclination by particularly people in government

645
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,320
is, you gotta be kidding me, you want me to risk my career

646
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,680
by getting deeply into the rabbit hole

647
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,560
of talking about UFOs.

648
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:14,680
And so there's a tremendous resistance.

649
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,800
Rockefeller met with President Clinton's science advisor,

650
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,200
Jack Gibbons, at the White House

651
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,280
and persuaded him to take action.

652
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,200
Rockefeller was then asked to pick a case

653
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,200
that the White House should attempt to declassify.

654
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,800
He chose the 1947 Roswell incident,

655
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,440
noting, quote, many are convinced that Roswell

656
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,800
marks the beginning of government secrecy about UFOs.

657
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,840
Jack had actually gone to the Air Force,

658
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,000
asked then Secretary Widnall,

659
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,120
who was the secretary of the Air Force,

660
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,680
to take a look particularly at the records

661
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,920
around Roswell, New Mexico.

662
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,520
Dear Colonel Cavett, the General Accounting Office

663
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,120
seeks to fully explain the claim

664
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:08,520
that the U.S. government recovered an alien spacecraft

665
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,560
near Roswell, New Mexico in July, 1947,

666
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,920
and since that time has covered up that fact.

667
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,920
The Army Air Forces has announced

668
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,920
that a flying disc has been found

669
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,960
and is now in the possession of the Army.

670
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,000
According to my dad, there was a bad thunderstorm

671
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,640
the night before, and the next day he was out

672
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,280
on the ranch and he found this debris.

673
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,440
This landed at a ranch at Corona, New Mexico,

674
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,440
and the rancher turned it over to the Air Force.

675
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,960
Roswell was then home to the world's only nuclear air wing,

676
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,520
including the B-29 that had dropped

677
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,200
the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima.

678
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:57,520
The base's chief intelligence officer, Major Jesse Marcel,

679
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,200
was dispatched to the ranch to investigate.

680
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,560
We had to follow the rancher out there.

681
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,800
It was just verbal directions. We know where to find it.

682
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,520
Marcel and another officer were the first military

683
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,880
to arrive at the crash site.

684
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,760
They came upon an expanse of unrecognizable debris

685
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,040
strewn across an area the size of a dozen football fields.

686
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,200
There was so much of it.

687
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,760
It was scattered over such a vast area.

688
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:34,200
We found a piece of metal about a foot and a half

689
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,760
to two feet wide and about two or three feet long.

690
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,200
It felt like you had nothing in your hands.

691
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,560
It wasn't any thicker than the foil out of a pack of cigarettes.

692
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,600
The thing about that got me is that you couldn't even bend it.

693
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,320
You couldn't embed it.

694
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,760
Even with a sledgehammer, it would bounce off of it.

695
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,320
Marcel was ordered to immediately transport

696
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,240
the strange wreckage to Fort Worth Army Airfield.

697
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,400
There, Marcel was met by the commanding general

698
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,880
who told him to keep silent in the face of what was becoming

699
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,360
a media frenzy.

700
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,000
They had a whole flock of microphones there.

701
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,520
They wanted me to...

702
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,000
They wanted to stop comments from me,

703
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,320
but I wasn't that good, but they didn't do that.

704
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,880
Marcel was instead ordered to pose with wood, foil,

705
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,840
and rubber debris from a conventional weather balloon.

706
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,960
All I could do is keep a mouth shut.

707
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,200
And General Raimi is the one who told the newspapers

708
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,120
what it was and forget about it.

709
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,960
It was nothing more than a weather observation balloon.

710
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,160
Of course, which we both knew differently.

711
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,440
Colonel Thomas DeBose, who was also ordered to pose

712
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,080
with the fake debris, describes how an iron curtain

713
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,840
of secrecy slammed down.

714
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,280
This is the highest priority you can exhibit,

715
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,720
and you will say nothing.

716
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,880
More than top secret, he said.

717
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,720
Beyond that, this is the story we're gonna tell the public.

718
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:09,200
It was a cover story, the balloon part of it.

719
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,200
In order, we don't have any more inquiries

720
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,800
about what we picked up on the desert.

721
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,560
Congressman Schiff, what got you interested

722
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,600
in this subject per se?

723
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,440
I started receiving letters a little over two years ago

724
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,000
from constituents stating that they believed

725
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,720
the government was covering up what happened at Roswell.

726
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,320
Many of them clearly believed that it was, in fact,

727
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,120
an extraterrestrial crash.

728
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,040
The weather balloon story never made sense

729
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,120
because there was clearly an undisputed, in my mind,

730
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,160
extra military attention to this matter,

731
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,560
from extra security around the crash scene

732
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,240
to special handling of whatever the debris was.

733
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,680
That could fit a classified project.

734
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,320
It doesn't fit a weather balloon.

735
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,760
In September 1994, the Air Force issued its response,

736
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,720
the Roswell Report, Case Closed.

737
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,720
The Air Force claimed it was a secret project

738
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,720
of weather balloons hung with box kites and microphones

739
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,720
to spy on Soviet nuclear tests.

740
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,720
Please roll the video.

741
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,720
There's a famous box kite that became the famous flying disc.

742
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,920
Became the famous flying disc.

743
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:23,080
The weather balloons that were on the balloon train.

744
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,400
Same rubber balloon, same foil box kite

745
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,800
as the original cover story.

746
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,760
Only many of them strung together

747
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,120
with microphones dangling beneath.

748
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,000
That's the tinfoil paper, rubber, and sticks

749
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,680
that they recovered in the desert near New Mexico in 1947.

750
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,360
The Air Force, nearly 50 years later,

751
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,840
was basically telling the same tale,

752
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,080
that the top security personnel

753
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,400
of the world's only atomic bombing wing

754
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,600
really had mistaken this rubber, wood, and tinfoil

755
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,760
for a crashed flying saucer.

756
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:02,960
Being an intelligence officer,

757
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,720
I was familiar with just about all materials used

758
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,160
in aircraft and in our air travel.

759
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,960
This was nothing like that.

760
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,320
It was not anything from this earth

761
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,480
that I'm quite sure of.

762
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,480
My suspicion is that the Roswell incident did happen

763
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:26,080
and something maybe not from our universe went down there.

764
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,400
And we should allow the American people to make a judgment

765
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,480
on what that might've been by disclosing.

766
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:39,200
I mean, this is probably the most blatant case

767
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,720
of overreaction to what is national security.

768
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,440
The public has a right to know.

769
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,920
Rockefeller put together a briefing document

770
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,480
intended for world leaders with a sobering observation.

771
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,040
It is conceivable that even the president himself

772
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,720
is not fully briefed on matters classified

773
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,680
as above top secret.

774
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,800
I did attempt to find out

775
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,520
if there were any secret government documents

776
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,880
that reveal things and if there were,

777
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,440
they were concealed from me too.

778
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,560
I wouldn't be the first president

779
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,920
that underlings have lied to

780
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,720
or that career bureaucrats have waited out.

781
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,600
But there may be some career person

782
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,200
sitting around somewhere hiding these dark secrets

783
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,640
even from elected presidents.

784
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,200
But if so, they successfully eluded me

785
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,840
and I'm almost embarrassed to tell you

786
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,240
I did try to find out.

787
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,520
I did try to find out.

788
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,360
Ha ha ha.

789
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,640
Three feet per second contact now.

790
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,920
That was a beautiful one.

791
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,120
Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell,

792
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,600
who had grown up around Roswell,

793
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,600
was an aerospace insider with deep Pentagon connections.

794
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,480
He became convinced there were UFO secrets

795
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,720
concealed from normal government channels.

796
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,200
Well, if the accounts had been believed,

797
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,720
yes, there have been ET visitation,

798
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,680
there have been crashed craft,

799
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,600
there have been material and bodies recovered.

800
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,600
And there is some group of people somewhere

801
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,240
that may or may not be associated with government

802
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,200
at this point, but certainly were at one time,

803
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,640
that have this knowledge.

804
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,200
No one has proven there's nothing to it.

805
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,280
No one's had the opportunity to prove there's something to it.

806
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,120
And that's what I did.

807
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,000
And every passing day...

808
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,520
In 2007, the most powerful man in the Senate,

809
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,880
Majority Leader Harry Reid, persuaded two colleagues

810
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,880
to go to the United States to discuss the matter.

811
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,720
And they did.

812
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,560
And they did.

813
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,400
And they did.

814
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,240
And they did.

815
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,480
Majority Leader Harry Reid persuaded two colleagues,

816
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,880
Senators Ted Stevens and Daniel Inouye,

817
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:10,240
to secretly allocate millions in Defense Department funds

818
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,320
to investigate UFOs.

819
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,680
The covert program operated from the tail end

820
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:20,640
of the Bush presidency through the Obama administration

821
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,920
and into Donald Trump's first year in office.

822
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,320
In December of 2017, the lid blew off.

823
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,200
At long last, the government was admitting

824
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,200
a modern day program to investigate UFOs

825
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,400
and released startling official evidence,

826
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,400
including videotapes from the cockpits of military aircraft.

827
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,840
One of the key authors of the Times' report,

828
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,600
One of the key authors of the Times' story

829
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,200
was investigative journalist

830
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,440
and bestselling author, Leslie Kane.

831
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,880
She went to Washington to meet with Luis Elizondo,

832
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,520
who had just resigned from his position

833
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,680
as head of the secret Pentagon UFO program.

834
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,080
I was invited to this meeting.

835
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,960
They wanted me to meet up Mr. Elizondo

836
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,560
to see what could happen.

837
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,440
Objects that are moving so fast,

838
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,120
and yet we don't see an ionization trail in the air,

839
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,840
and you don't hear a sonic boom.

840
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,280
How is that possible?

841
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,120
Another one is-

842
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,320
Elizondo's colleagues took her aside

843
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,320
to reveal some extraordinary documentation

844
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,960
related to the program.

845
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,080
I wasn't allowed to take anything with me.

846
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,440
I mean, the most important evidence

847
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,160
that was shared with me at the meeting

848
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,320
regarding the phenomenon itself were the videos.

849
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,320
Check on 6-1-10.

850
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,560
Roger, roger.

851
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,400
Yes!

852
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,240
Yeah!

853
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,080
Yeah!

854
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:45,920
Woo-hoo!

855
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:46,760
Woo-hoo!

856
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,600
Woo-hoo!

857
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,440
You got me!

858
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,280
You got me!

859
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,120
You got me!

860
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:50,960
You got me!

861
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,000
I knew this was breaking news

862
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
for the front page of the New York Times.

863
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,920
The whole fleet of them are looking on the airspace.

864
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,760
My gosh!

865
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,920
Do you hear that thing?

866
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,840
It's hurting!

867
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,200
My co-author, Ralph Blumenthal and I,

868
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,360
set up a meeting with Mark Mazzetti

869
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,160
and said we have this explosive story.

870
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,880
Sat down with him in the New York Office

871
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,320
of the New York Times and we brought in all the documents.

872
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,280
These are the videos.

873
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,560
Here's other documents that show the existence

874
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,000
of the program and here's what they've studied

875
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:22,920
and here's what they've learned

876
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,960
and here's a letter from Harry Reid about the program.

877
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,680
Elizondo's colleague,

878
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,160
the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense

879
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,920
for Intelligence, Christopher Mellon,

880
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,000
managed to obtain the tapes from the Pentagon

881
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,120
and chose the New York Times to break the story.

882
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,160
I received the videos, the now famous videos

883
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,160
in the Pentagon parking lot

884
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,160
from a Defense Department official.

885
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,000
I still have the originals and the packaging.

886
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,400
This is a case where somebody bent the rules a little bit

887
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,000
and they did so for the larger good

888
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,600
and we're absolutely all better off because of it.

889
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,840
In the end, I have to say,

890
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,560
I was still extraordinarily disappointed

891
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,720
with the New York Times

892
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:14,800
because they focused on this small ATIP program

893
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,320
and the real story in my mind, at least,

894
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,440
should have been these things are real,

895
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,560
they're here, this is happening now.

896
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,560
One of the Pentagon cases reported by the New York Times

897
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,240
was an encounter by naval aircraft

898
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:37,800
about 200 miles off the coast of San Diego, California.

899
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,280
5,500 people that were on the Nimitz in 2004

900
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,840
when this happened and I guarantee every single one of them

901
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,800
knows that this event happened.

902
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,560
That's a whole air wing, that's Mount Fuji, that's Japan.

903
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,280
Commander David Fravor was leading a training exercise

904
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:55,560
from the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group

905
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,240
when he was abruptly ordered to investigate

906
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,560
an unknown target that had appeared

907
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,640
on one of the ship's radar scopes.

908
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,760
We're gonna suspend the training,

909
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:08,040
we have real-world tasking, so we're like, okay, cool.

910
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,920
He and another F-18 Super Hornet,

911
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:15,560
each carrying two airmen, zoomed toward the coordinates.

912
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,440
That's myself and my whizzo and the other pilot

913
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,000
and the whizzo in the back seat of that airplane,

914
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,200
so there's four of us.

915
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,680
When they arrived, they first saw

916
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,160
what appeared to be a large object

917
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,840
slightly below the surface of the ocean

918
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,560
with a strange oval-shaped craft

919
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,600
darting around in the air just above it.

920
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,800
If you picture a tic-tac that's about 40 feet long,

921
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,360
you know, round on both ends, no rivets, no metal,

922
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,640
smooth white, it was white.

923
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,280
It was just smooth, no wings, no propulsion, no windows.

924
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,600
It didn't matter which way it was pointing

925
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,440
because as it was moving over the water, it would go,

926
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,680
you know, it never turned,

927
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,560
it never changed its longitudinal axis.

928
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,840
It went four, aft, left, right, it was just doing this.

929
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,480
And I said, hey, I'm gonna go check that out.

930
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,080
All of a sudden, you just see it turn its body and go whoop

931
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,480
and start coming up at you and you go,

932
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,560
that was rather interesting.

933
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,760
We're just looking at it, we're doing this,

934
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,800
we're looking at it, we're looking at it,

935
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,840
we're looking at it, we go around,

936
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,360
all the way around the outside was circle 180 degrees.

937
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,120
Well, I know where he's going, so I'll just go over there.

938
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,200
And this thing goes poof and it's gone.

939
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,920
I mean, literally that fast, gone.

940
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,040
You can think about what we're saying like,

941
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,200
holy shit, what the is that?

942
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,080
You know, and then there's a lot of, dude, what the?

943
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,160
Did you guys see that?

944
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,000
Do you guys see it?

945
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,760
And they're like, it's gone, we don't see shit.

946
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,560
Nothing accelerates that fast.

947
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,240
You're talking, you're talking, you know,

948
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,600
something that not only accelerated beyond anything

949
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,000
that we had seen, but it just was poof.

950
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,440
The controller comes up and says,

951
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,760
hey, you're not gonna believe this,

952
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,920
but that thing is back at your cap point.

953
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,080
Meaning the object had instantly reappeared

954
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,440
at the precise secret coordinates

955
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,400
of the fleet's critical aerial defense zone.

956
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,000
It obviously had some awareness,

957
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,560
see it knew where we were going.

958
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,440
Gotta make the hair on the back here next stand up.

959
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,680
And I actually told my back here,

960
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,800
I said, I don't know about you, I'm pretty weirded out.

961
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,520
More jets equipped with the Navy's

962
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:38,640
most advanced radar visual tracking systems were scrambled.

963
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,880
This time, capturing the object on video.

964
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,720
First thing he gets is a little blip on the radar.

965
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,240
He puts his cursors over it

966
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,240
and he tries to grab a lock on it.

967
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,560
Basically, when you take a lock,

968
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,520
you tell the radar, look at that location

969
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,840
and stare at it and put all your energy on that point.

970
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,280
Well, as soon as it does it,

971
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,640
the radar gets indications that it's being jammed

972
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,320
by the object it's trying to lock.

973
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,920
The infrared sees differing temperatures,

974
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,320
so the tic-tac is actually hotter than the air around it.

975
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,120
It doesn't have to be by much, but it's gonna appear white.

976
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,800
They're driving straight at it.

977
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,760
It's just kind of hovering there.

978
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,440
And then it goes, poof, and it takes off off the side.

979
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,520
I just don't know, I doubt that we

980
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,040
have developed that technology.

981
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:42,000
I interviewed three of the four aviators

982
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,120
who were with Dave during that encounter.

983
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,080
And it was readily apparent to everyone involved

984
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,920
that that vehicle had what they call

985
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,600
dominant battle space awareness.

986
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:59,240
It was in control of that engagement from the outset.

987
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,520
There was no question that it completely outmatched

988
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,680
our frontline fighters.

989
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,440
I served on the Special Access Program Oversight Committee,

990
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,520
so I had access to all of the black programs in those days.

991
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,960
We know perfectly well there's nothing like that

992
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,520
behind the scenes or even on the drawing boards.

993
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,920
Senator Harry Reid, who instigated the secret

994
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:27,840
Pentagon UFO program, confirmed what nuclear launch officers

995
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,600
have been reporting for decades.

996
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,080
There's more than one out there.

997
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,320
UFOs have interfered with our country's most powerful weapons.

998
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:42,040
If it had been called upon by the president to launch,

999
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,240
we couldn't have done it.

1000
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,040
Did you have anybody in the Defense Department,

1001
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:52,760
the Pentagon, pull you aside, bend your ear, and say,

1002
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:53,840
why are you doing this?

1003
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,800
They did everything they could to stop the program

1004
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,080
from going forward.

1005
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,760
They gave the person that came to me initially such a bad time.

1006
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,760
He's fortunate to have hung onto his job

1007
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,720
because people tried to get rid of him

1008
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,000
because they wanted nothing to do with this.

1009
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
The Defense Intelligence Agency was one of the worst.

1010
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,640
They drugged their feet, even though there

1011
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,560
was one of their senior scientists

1012
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,040
thought they should look at this.

1013
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,560
And remember, all we're saying, nobody

1014
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,040
has to agree why it's there.

1015
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,320
But shouldn't we at least be spending some money

1016
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,080
to study all these phenomenon?

1017
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,480
Shouldn't we study the stuff?

1018
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,840
The answer is yes.

1019
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,360
And that's all this was about and why the federal government

1020
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:43,960
all these years has covered up, put brake pads on everything,

1021
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,480
stopped it.

1022
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,800
I think it's very, very bad for our country.

1023
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,560
I interviewed Gordon Cooper, Mercury astronaut Gordon

1024
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,000
Cooper back in the 90s.

1025
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,400
Cooper said on camera that there was a landed

1026
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,400
UFO at circa 1957 at Edwards Air Force Base.

1027
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,600
His camera crew captured the filming of this object.

1028
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:12,760
And he presented this to the higher ups.

1029
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,600
And eventually, a courier jet came in from Washington.

1030
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,280
He handed the footage over, which was good.

1031
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,080
He viewed it.

1032
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,080
That's the last he saw.

1033
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:19,960
Exactly.

1034
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,120
Did you know where that footage went of the flying

1035
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,040
saucer that landed on the tournament?

1036
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:24,960
Went to Washington.

1037
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,200
That's all that I know.

1038
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,640
Did you ever keep in touch with anybody about it or discuss it?

1039
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,840
How would I keep in touch with anybody about it?

1040
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,560
There's no way within the military

1041
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:36,040
or within the government of keeping track of something

1042
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,520
that is classified.

1043
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,200
Did you try to go after stuff like this?

1044
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,720
We did.

1045
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:42,640
It's there.

1046
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,840
Are you saying that there's some evidence that still

1047
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,320
hasn't seen the light of day?

1048
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,400
I'm saying most of it hasn't seen the light of day.

1049
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,400
Astronaut Cooper had spoken with the president

1050
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,640
at a cabinet meeting.

1051
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,240
He raised this with Secretary Cohen.

1052
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,800
And then Cohen's office called me

1053
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,440
and asked me to pursue this and chase it down.

1054
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,600
The Air Force colonel that I spoke with got very frustrated.

1055
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,040
And when I asked him what happened

1056
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,960
to all of these records, he said, well, that was all

1057
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,040
cleaned up or thrown out to save space, something like that.

1058
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,840
That sounded ludicrous, but that's what he told me.

1059
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:37,800
If there is some recovered debris, say,

1060
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,560
it is so deeply buried and squirreled away

1061
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:46,760
that it's outside of those normal oversight processes.

1062
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,520
And that's where there's a problem in this area.

1063
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,400
Dr. Jacques Vallee has collected purported metal debris

1064
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:05,520
from UFO cases dating as far back as 1947

1065
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,560
that experts are analyzing in a state-of-the-art laboratory.

1066
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:13,280
The breakthrough has come with the invention of a machine

1067
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,920
that enables us to look at the atomic structure.

1068
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,840
And at that point, the atomic structure

1069
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,680
is impossible to fake.

1070
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,880
This device is a multi-parameter ion beam imager.

1071
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,560
Dr. Gary Nolan, a Stanford microbiologist,

1072
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,720
is using a revolutionary three-dimensional imaging device

1073
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:39,400
to analyze the samples right down to their individual atoms.

1074
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,960
When Dr. Nolan placed some of the fragments

1075
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,480
in the vacuum chamber of his instrument,

1076
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,440
he was astonished to find their composition

1077
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,680
was unlike any known metal.

1078
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:53,840
Just one spot, and the isotopic composition all the way

1079
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,040
across the

1080
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,920
No matter where he looked in the sample's jumble of elements,

1081
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,760
whether magnesium, iron, nickel, or titanium,

1082
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:07,000
the ratio of isotopes didn't make any sense.

1083
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,400
If you're talking about an advanced material

1084
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,720
from an advanced civilization,

1085
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:15,280
you're talking about something that I'll just call it an ultramaterial, right?

1086
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,920
It's something which has properties

1087
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:23,080
where somebody is putting it together, again, at the atomic scale.

1088
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:28,840
So we're building our world with 80 elements.

1089
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:34,560
Somebody else is building the world with 253 different isotopes.

1090
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:41,240
I intend to use the information to try to build something,

1091
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:45,000
to try to understand a physical principle that we don't know today.

1092
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,400
This material was manufactured.

1093
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,040
It's not natural.

1094
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:53,440
It's not natural to the materials that we have around us

1095
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,840
in the lab or on the Earth.

1096
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:01,760
It does not mean that it was necessarily made some place in outer space.

1097
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:07,120
It just means that it was manufactured specially for a particular purpose

1098
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,440
that we don't understand, and we want to understand it.

1099
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,880
There is an immense array of unanswered questions.

1100
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:26,760
What we observe some of these craft doing,

1101
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:31,840
think about the possibilities, what we may discover technologically,

1102
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,120
how we might solve the energy crisis,

1103
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,440
how we might raise our standards of living.

1104
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,960
There is an urgent need, in my view, to get to the bottom of it.

1105
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,440
We don't know the origin of these vehicles,

1106
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:49,240
nor do we understand the intent of whoever is controlling them.

1107
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:57,760
There are cases that seem to go beyond encounters with an advanced technology

1108
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,880
to contact with an engaged intelligence.

1109
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,840
Papua New Guinea, June 1959.

1110
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,680
An Australian missionary spots a large disk

1111
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:12,720
hovering just 200 feet off the ground,

1112
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,800
while standing with 38 other people.

1113
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,400
This solid-looking object,

1114
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:23,720
and can you imagine what it's like to look up in the sky

1115
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:28,000
and see some figures up there?

1116
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,320
All were amazed to see four small occupants

1117
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,960
dressed in what looked like black diving suits.

1118
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:39,720
Figures walking about on top,

1119
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:43,560
and not the slightest noise whatsoever.

1120
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:47,280
And so we waved.

1121
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:52,600
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get this object down onto the playing field?

1122
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,560
And as we waved,

1123
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,640
wondering whether we'd get some recognition

1124
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:01,120
and whether perhaps they would understand what we wanted,

1125
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,120
they waved back.

1126
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:10,360
The encounter lasted several hours before the object abruptly departed.

1127
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:14,520
There was this amazingly incredible speed

1128
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:20,760
that the whole craft disappeared to nothing across the bay

1129
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,760
in a matter of a second or so.

1130
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,800
In 1994, three days of sightings across Zimbabwe

1131
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,760
culminated in what some believe is the most significant close encounter

1132
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,520
in modern history.

1133
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,080
Hundreds of people today phoned the ZBC and the BBC

1134
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,800
correspondent in Harare,

1135
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:50,160
saying they sighted an unidentifying flying object last night

1136
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:53,440
with some eyewitness reports.

1137
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,040
It almost seemed to be under the clouds,

1138
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,120
and it came past and notices no noise,

1139
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,880
and that's when I thought, well, there's something very odd here.

1140
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,320
It was quite amazing. It was beautiful.

1141
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:07,200
They are saying that Jesus is passing through Africa.

1142
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,200
That's what they are saying.

1143
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:17,200
We interviewed about 64 children in front of the camera.

1144
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,200
UFO story that happened.

1145
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:22,200
Just say exactly what you want to say, OK?

1146
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,600
Well, I was running and playing,

1147
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,600
and then I saw this maroon colour in the sky.

1148
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,600
Why don't we follow it?

1149
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,600
We saw this, like, silver thing down there.

1150
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:37,600
It was a silver oval thing that flew past us.

1151
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:40,120
I saw the bigger one and the spaceship,

1152
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,120
like, four or five of them.

1153
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,120
It was red, green and yellow.

1154
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,120
There was this big ship, it had these lights,

1155
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,120
these petals, and it flew.

1156
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,120
I thought, no, it's not a UFO,

1157
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,120
and then I looked carefully at it,

1158
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,120
and I thought, maybe.

1159
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,120
Dozens of children said that one or more of the children

1160
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,120
who saw the UFO,

1161
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,640
dozens of children said that one or more of the disc-shaped objects

1162
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:12,640
landed just beyond the far edge of their playground.

1163
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,640
The next thing they knew,

1164
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,640
something was standing next to it.

1165
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,640
We saw him standing by the silver thing,

1166
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,640
and he had big eyes.

1167
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:33,160
He had a big head and big black eyes

1168
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,160
and was dressed in a black bodysuit.

1169
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,160
They were wearing pure black.

1170
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:41,160
And I came down, and I saw the funny man with his eyes here,

1171
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,160
and I saw a spaceship,

1172
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,160
and there were a few little ones around him.

1173
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,160
How far away were you when you saw him?

1174
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,160
Not very far, not very far.

1175
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,680
About a metre away.

1176
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,680
A metre away, that close?

1177
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,680
Yes.

1178
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,680
And how big was the figure?

1179
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,680
It was about as big as a grade 6.

1180
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:12,680
I believe that the children did see something.

1181
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,680
I believe them,

1182
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,680
because normally children don't lie.

1183
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,680
I've always taught my children seeing is believing.

1184
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,680
Unfortunately, I didn't see, so...

1185
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,680
It's a myth!

1186
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,200
This alleged encounter caught the attention

1187
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,200
of Pulitzer Prize-winning Harvard psychiatrist

1188
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,200
Dr John Mack.

1189
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,200
It seemed that he was looking at all of us.

1190
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,200
What did it feel like when he was looking at you?

1191
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,200
I felt scared.

1192
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,200
It felt scary? What was scary about it?

1193
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:48,200
I felt scared because I've never seen such a person like me.

1194
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:54,720
I felt scared because I've never seen such a person like that before.

1195
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:58,720
And I saw this person,

1196
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,720
and it had big eyes.

1197
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,720
That's all I saw about it, big eyes.

1198
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,720
They had short legs and quite a long top.

1199
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:11,720
With a big head and eyes that are bigger than ours.

1200
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,720
How much bigger than ours?

1201
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,720
Four or five times the size.

1202
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,720
Four or five times the size of ours.

1203
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,720
So then I was looking at him, right?

1204
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,720
Then he was looking at me back.

1205
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,720
How could I just keep on looking at him

1206
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,720
so I had to stop and look aside?

1207
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,720
But I was looking straight into his eyes.

1208
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,720
Well, he never said anything.

1209
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,720
It's just that the face is the eyes.

1210
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,720
Maybe they're trying to communicate with us,

1211
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,720
show us something which we don't know about.

1212
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:46,720
I think they want people

1213
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:50,720
to know that we're actually making harm on this world

1214
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:53,720
and we mustn't get too technology.

1215
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,720
We don't look after the planet.

1216
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,720
All the trees will just go down

1217
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:03,720
and there will be no air and people will be dying.

1218
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:07,720
Is this an idea you have had before

1219
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,720
or did this idea come to you

1220
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,720
when you had this experience?

1221
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,720
When I had this experience.

1222
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,720
For the first time in nearly 20 years,

1223
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,720
the Ariel School children gathered

1224
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,720
from the four corners of the world

1225
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,720
to talk to each other about the experience

1226
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,720
they shared that September morning.

1227
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,720
I remember something there.

1228
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,720
One they all still struggle to understand.

1229
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,720
You know that it's moving, but you...

1230
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,720
I stand by what I saw.

1231
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:44,720
There was no reason for any of us to make that up.

1232
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,720
I've not spoken to anybody about it.

1233
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,720
Not because I'm not proud of it,

1234
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,720
but because I don't want the stigma.

1235
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:58,720
So it's something that I've had to deal with

1236
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,720
for 19 and a half years.

1237
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,720
I don't want to say I felt like I knew it,

1238
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,720
but I knew that I didn't have to be afraid of it.

1239
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:09,720
They took us back to the moment of contact.

1240
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,720
Exactly how I felt, exactly.

1241
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:14,720
The details still seared into memory.

1242
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,720
I was with one of the other girls

1243
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:20,720
and saying to her, this is amazing.

1244
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,720
We all were just stopped in our tracks.

1245
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:29,720
A little man appeared on top of the actual craft,

1246
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:32,720
and that moment for me was very distinct

1247
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,720
because I was like, that's not human.

1248
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:37,720
I was just completely engulfed in these eyes.

1249
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,720
The eyes, and in that moment, however long it was,

1250
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,720
because I have no idea of the time frame,

1251
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,720
it was mesmerizing.

1252
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,720
There was no talking.

1253
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,720
It's all just images in the head.

1254
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,720
Telepathic communication.

1255
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,720
They were trying to communicate,

1256
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,720
trying to tell us something

1257
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,720
with something to do with the environment.

1258
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,720
I kept getting these thoughts and ideas

1259
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,720
in my mind of technology.

1260
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,720
Technology is not helping, technology is bad.

1261
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,720
And we're going down a wrong path,

1262
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,720
and we have to start recognizing

1263
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,720
that what we're doing is detrimental,

1264
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,720
and we need to make changes,

1265
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,720
and I don't know what to do with that.

1266
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,720
They were reaching out to us.

1267
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:30,720
It was as if they wanted us to go with them.

1268
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,720
At that moment, that was kind of when

1269
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:37,720
I snapped right out of the trance.

1270
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,720
As soon as I broke contact,

1271
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,720
all of those feelings, technology, the fact,

1272
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,720
the horribleness that was happening

1273
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,720
and going around my body at the time, went.

1274
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,720
It's making me a bit anxious being back here.

1275
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,720
I can feel it right now.

1276
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,720
I was scared.

1277
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,720
They came running up here in such a panic,

1278
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,720
screaming, screaming,

1279
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,720
and they were here, you know,

1280
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,720
and a child can't make that up.

1281
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,720
So I was there when they were interviewing them

1282
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:09,720
and saw the way they were.

1283
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,720
It was just a huge, big mess

1284
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:14,720
and muddled up and just people everywhere.

1285
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,720
Just ask them questions straight off

1286
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,720
without explaining to the children

1287
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,720
what they were doing and why they were doing it.

1288
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,720
It was chaos in terms of the media frenzy

1289
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:28,720
that was going on and us being so young

1290
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,720
and not even being allowed time

1291
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,720
to comprehend what we had seen.

1292
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,720
Our teachers certainly didn't believe us,

1293
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,720
so that was a big deal because we had to continue

1294
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,720
going to school there.

1295
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:46,720
We went back one last time to the aerial school

1296
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,720
to meet with Judy Bates,

1297
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,720
a teacher at the time of the incident

1298
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,720
and now the headmistress.

1299
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,720
Something was weighing on her

1300
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:57,720
that she wanted to tell the children.

1301
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,720
Yeah, I said I wanted to apologize.

1302
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,720
I should have taken more notice,

1303
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:02,720
but I didn't.

1304
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,720
I was more concerned about me and not them

1305
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:09,720
than what was going on in my own sort of experience.

1306
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,720
And that's what, yeah.

1307
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,720
And if you could summarize in just one sentence

1308
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,720
what took place September 1994

1309
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:25,720
here at aerial school, Rua Zimbabwe,

1310
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,720
what would you say?

1311
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,720
Aliens visited us.

1312
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,720
And that's about it, yeah.

1313
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,720
And that's where if you believe it,

1314
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,720
you believe it if you don't.

1315
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,720
We find ourselves confronted with something

1316
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,720
that challenges our very understanding of reality.

1317
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:50,720
We may be sharing this fragile blue-green oasis

1318
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,720
with an unknown other,

1319
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:57,720
one with a mysterious relationship to humanity

1320
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,720
and its own interest in our world.

1321
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,720
And if you saw him again, what would you do?

1322
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,720
I'll ask him, what is he doing on Earth

1323
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,720
and what does he want with us?

1324
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,720
What do you think?

1325
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,720
They were well-observed UFO cases

1326
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:52,720
just like modern cases in the 18th century,

1327
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,720
In the 17th century, there was science.

1328
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,720
There were astronomers. They had telescopes.

1329
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,720
And they were very good observers,

1330
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,720
because their life depended on being good observers.

1331
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:08,720
And these observations come from all over the world.

1332
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:11,720
They just have been forgotten.

1333
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:27,720
I like to think of anomalies, mysteries as opportunities.

1334
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:30,720
And we'll go after those mysteries,

1335
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:33,720
take the torch away from the campfire

1336
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:36,720
and out of the cave into the darkness

1337
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,720
and make some amazing discoveries.

1338
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,720
And I think that's the way to do it.

1339
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,720
I think that's the way to do it.

1340
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,720
I think that's the way to do it.

1341
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,720
I think that's the way to do it.

1342
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,720
I think that's the way to do it.

1343
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,720
Well, I'd like to go out and do it.

1344
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,720
I'd like to go out and do it.

1345
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,720
and make some amazing discoveries.

1346
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,720
The UFO phenomenon,

1347
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:22,720
bespeaks the action of some form of intelligence.

1348
01:35:48,720 --> 01:36:08,120
These objects gave the impression that they wanted to be seen. With these enormous spotlights,

1349
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:17,120
there was no way that they were trying to hide. So why? That is the main question. Why do these

1350
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:47,080
objects want to be seen? Later on I was so sorry that why I did not call on the

1351
01:36:47,080 --> 01:37:13,400
radio, ask them, who are you? Please make communication with us. I figure if they're

1352
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:19,320
smart enough and capable enough to come into our airspace, the technology that they have,

1353
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:23,960
if they wanted to do us in, they could have done us in a long time ago. So I'm not fearful of this at all.

1354
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:49,960
I think as long as we don't change the world, it will greatly promote the development of the

1355
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:54,800
scientific and technological level of the world. It will be beneficial to human progress. This is a big

1356
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:47,360
thing. I've never seen anything go so fast in my life as I think. Incredible speed disappeared

1357
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:53,600
to nothing. And just went zoom straight up so fast. It's like it had been shot out of a gun.

1358
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:57,200
Now you see it, now you don't. It just, but it just was.
