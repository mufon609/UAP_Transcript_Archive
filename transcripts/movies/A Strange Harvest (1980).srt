1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,080
The program you are about to see concerns the mysterious deaths and mutilations of animals

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,620
in the United States and other parts of the world.

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:26,740
Due to the graphic nature of some scenes, parental guidance for children is advised.

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:33,420
The film you are about to see, called A Strange Harvest, was first broadcast in May 1980.

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,380
The subject is a mystery which has haunted ranchers and law enforcement for the past

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,740
decade, the mutilation of animals, especially cattle, throughout the United States and Canada.

7
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,340
Since the first broadcast, mutilations have continued, but with little or no media coverage,

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,140
perhaps because it's easier to accept the usual explanation of predator attack.

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:01,020
However, in the past few months, since September of 1982, I have received 12 mutilation reports

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,600
from sheriff's offices, all relating to bizarre cuts, not predators.

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,180
One of those happened right here in this field on September 16th, 1982.

12
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,780
Bill and Linda Desouris grew up on this ranch land about 30 miles east of Colorado Springs.

13
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,420
Raising cattle has been their life, and neither had seen anything like the dead cow they found

14
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,940
that September day.

15
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,580
About noon, we went out to check the cows.

16
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:39,860
We had some cows that were about to calf, and everything was okay.

17
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,860
So we went back to the house, had lunch.

18
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,460
About, oh, all afternoon, we'd worked out on the truck all afternoon.

19
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:58,660
It was a pretty day, and we hadn't seen or heard anything.

20
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:04,740
Went about five o'clock, had to go to Kremlin after low to hay, so I was in a semi and the

21
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:12,140
cow was over a little ridge, but I could see off a sweet road the cow laying there dead.

22
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,420
I got the bait, and I called my wife and told her to go check on it.

23
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,020
Half of the udders were gone.

24
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,460
You could see into the stomach cavity.

25
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,540
The rectum had been partially removed.

26
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,780
The eyes were bulging out.

27
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,820
I was horrified at the thought of what could do this in broad daylight when we had checked

28
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,940
the cows only a few hours before.

29
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,100
That cow was the Desouris' third mutilation.

30
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,260
In the fall of 1979, they found two of their year-old heifers lying 100 feet apart in a

31
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,260
pasture.

32
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,780
Both were dead, and their rectums had been cored out.

33
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,380
Cause unknown.

34
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,420
One deputy sheriff in Wyoming is so frustrated with the mutilation mystery that he has gotten

35
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:12,760
his local crime labs cooperation to investigate mutilations as they would human murders.

36
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,460
This fall, we had 10 mutilations, eight in Sweetwater County and two in Daggett County.

37
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,740
And in 1975, we had 16.

38
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:29,580
From everywhere I go, they tell me that it's predators, which I do not believe.

39
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,240
Why do you feel differently?

40
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,140
Because I don't feel a predator can do these things.

41
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,620
I don't feel a predator can come up and chew a half of a bag off of a cow or the end of

42
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,220
the penis off of a bull and not touch any of the rest of the cow.

43
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,900
I've been around predators, and they'll go inside the abdominal cavity first and eat

44
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,180
the insides, which is easy eating.

45
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,500
What would be your own personal feelings about who or what would be doing these mutilations

46
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,660
and why?

47
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,660
I wished I knew.

48
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,780
I don't have any idea who is doing it.

49
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,940
We have investigated several things, cults, different things like this, but we haven't

50
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,340
come up with any answers to any of our questions as of yet.

51
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,940
Treating it like a human murder would give you what kind of different information than

52
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,540
you've had in the past?

53
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,820
Well, treating it as a human murder, I feel that we can get the crime lab in Cheyenne

54
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:29,740
to help us with our analysis of the animals, of what may cause the death, maybe even if

55
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,100
it was some kind of a poison or something that they're using to kill them or how they

56
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,580
are using it to kill them.

57
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:41,300
It will just give us more answers to a lot of the questions that we have on mutilations.

58
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,220
Two of the Wyoming mutilations were like the one in Colorado on the Desuris Ranch.

59
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:52,740
Half the udder removed, teats cut, and rectums cored out, all without signs of blood.

60
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,100
The Wyoming state veterinarian said about one of those cows, quote, it was dead before

61
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,180
it was mutilated with a cutting instrument.

62
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,500
The mutilation was not done by an animal.

63
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,380
And in a carpenter Wyoming case, the veterinarian wrote in his necropsy report, right front

64
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,820
and rear mammary glands missing, left front and rear teats missing, vulvular area missing

65
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,540
approximately five inches into pelvis, leaving rectum intact, hole in center of skull approximately

66
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,180
two millimeters in diameter on the surface of the skull and one millimeter in diameter

67
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,900
on the inside of the skull.

68
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,460
No evidence of gunshot.

69
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,620
Cause of death, possible injection of material into brain with unknown object.

70
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,380
Lab analysis found nothing.

71
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,380
Who or what is killing and mutilating these animals and why?

72
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,180
Most everyone in the western United States heard about cattle mutilations in 1975.

73
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,180
And a couple of years later in 1977, most people thought cattle mutilations had gone away.

74
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,180
The number of newspaper articles declined.

75
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:21,180
And ranchers, many of them, stopped reporting their dead and mutilated cows to law enforcement.

76
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,180
But the cattle mutilations never did stop.

77
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,180
And by the spring of 1979, United States Senator Harrison Schmidt of New Mexico

78
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,180
was concerned enough to call for a conference in Albuquerque on April 20th

79
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,180
to talk about cattle mutilations.

80
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,180
And I began wondering again, what was going on?

81
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:48,180
In the past few months, I've traveled through Wyoming, New Mexico, and Colorado exploring this mystery.

82
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,180
I've talked with journalists, law enforcement people, ranchers, and scientists.

83
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,180
They have shown me their photographs, their reports, and their files.

84
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,180
In this program, you will hear the testimonies of many of these people

85
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,180
who have been involved with this puzzling phenomenon over the past decade.

86
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,180
Some of their statements might shock you,

87
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:17,180
but they're all part of this amazing story that I call A Strange Harvest.

88
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,180
A Strange Harvest

89
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,180
A Strange Harvest

90
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,180
In September 1967, on the King Ranch in the San Luis Valley of Colorado,

91
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,180
an Appaloosa mare called Snippy was found dead and stripped of flesh from the neck up.

92
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,180
Some said this was the work of flying saucers.

93
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,180
Who or whatever did it, no one knows.

94
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,180
Since that time, and perhaps even earlier in this century,

95
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,180
thousands of cattle, horses, and other animals have been cut up in strange ways

96
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,180
throughout the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Panama, the Canary Islands,

97
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,180
and possibly other South American and European countries.

98
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,180
Some people call it cattle mutilation.

99
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,180
Whatever it's called, it's a strange harvest.

100
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:05,180
Parts missing are usually an ear, an eye, the tongue, the lower jaws stripped of all flesh,

101
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,180
the sexual organs are cut out, the rectum is cored out,

102
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,180
and in some cases, the blood is gone.

103
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,180
Adding to the mystery is lack of tracks or other evidence.

104
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Mutilated cattle have been found on wet sand or rain-soaked ground with no tracks around them,

105
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,180
not even their own.

106
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,180
And the mutilations continue.

107
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,180
Between May 1979 and January 1980,

108
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,180
over 30 cattle in Canada have reportedly suffered this strange fate.

109
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,180
Iowa had eight reported mutilations in the last months of 1979.

110
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,180
Other states that had reported mutilations in 1979 were

111
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:57,180
Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arkansas, Kansas and Nebraska, and Texas.

112
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Who or what is killing and mutilating these animals?

113
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Could it be cults, predators, helicopters, UFOs, deranged individuals,

114
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,180
secret government project?

115
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,180
Is any of these the answer?

116
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,180
Are all of these part of the answer?

117
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Some ranchers believe that whoever's doing the mutilating must be using some kind of aircraft.

118
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,180
The Greenhorn Mountains in southeastern Colorado rise above the sagebrush cattle grazing lands

119
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,180
that stretch for thousands of square miles around Walsenburg.

120
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Here in July of 1979, rancher C.E. Potts found one of his prize bulls dead and mutilated.

121
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,180
We were passing down this road and there was a thunderstorm coming up behind us

122
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,180
and we were rushing down by to smelt this animal as we went by.

123
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:51,180
So we come back to check on it and found it had been mutilated.

124
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:59,180
Then we examined it and its sexual organs were all taken out and everything

125
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:05,180
and one of its eyes was taken out and its eyelashes was taken out.

126
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,180
What about the idea that it's predators?

127
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:16,180
Well there wasn't no predators and not a predator bothered it since it's been dead even.

128
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:25,180
It couldn't have been killed by a predator because all the surgical work was done by an expert.

129
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:31,180
I really didn't think there was anything to it until it come home to me.

130
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Now I know there's bound to have been mutilated or anybody who can see good could see it was.

131
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,180
The strange thing about it is that we have never found any blood on them.

132
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,180
No blood?

133
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,180
No blood, no.

134
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,180
Tracks?

135
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,180
The only tracks that we found on the first one were some tripod tracks

136
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,180
and they formed something like a triangle.

137
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,180
I didn't know what to think.

138
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,180
It was kind of strange because we had never seen anything like that before.

139
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,180
It still remains a mystery.

140
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,180
In all the states it's happened, it's a mystery.

141
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,180
It goes on to turn what I read and hear about.

142
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,180
I got called this summer from Canada on two mutilations.

143
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:27,180
They called me and the way they described this, it's just typical of our mutilations we had in 75.

144
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,180
If it goes into Canada and there have been reports that they've come up out of Puerto Rico

145
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,180
and some other parts of the world, if it goes on to an international scale,

146
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,180
do you think that would exclude satanic cults and a military operation in our country?

147
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:47,180
Well, yeah, it'd be inclined to, my way of thinking.

148
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,180
And if they're excluded, what is left?

149
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,180
I don't know. I don't know that either.

150
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:01,180
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation received 203 reports of suspected mutilations

151
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,180
in a nine-month period between April and December of 1975.

152
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Colorado State University's diagnostic laboratory received 35 carcasses.

153
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,180
Only 19 were in good enough condition to perform lab examinations.

154
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,180
Of those 19, nine or about half were considered to be cut with a sharp instrument.

155
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:27,180
The rest were generally described as the activity of predators.

156
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,180
It's true cattle in Colorado are going to die each year from hard winters, disease,

157
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:39,180
lightning strikes, predator attacks, and other natural causes.

158
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,180
But in northeastern Colorado, another favorite spot for the mutilators,

159
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:49,180
Tex Graves, former sheriff of Logan County, insists the 93 mutilated carcasses he investigated

160
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,180
were not natural deaths.

161
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,180
The very first one we had was southwest of Sterling.

162
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,180
When we first looked at it, it was just unbelievable that you could take an animal

163
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:09,180
and do this too without leaving some kind of track, some kind of evidence behind,

164
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:18,180
such as cigarette butts, matches, handprints, footprints, but there was nothing.

165
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:26,180
The animal looked almost horrible, and it was something that I didn't really want to believe then.

166
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:34,180
We probably had five or six others before I really did believe something strange was going on.

167
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:42,180
We had one up north where we believed the animal was paralyzed and was alive when it was being mutilated.

168
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:50,180
An eye and an ear, the tongue, the rectal area was taken out, but the animal dug a hole with its head,

169
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:57,180
but none of the other parts of the body moved, not even the legs.

170
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,180
What force could hold down a 900-pound steer while its ear, tongue, rectum, and sex organs were removed?

171
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,180
I asked Dr. Albert McChesney, pathologist and coordinator of the diagnostic laboratory

172
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,180
at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado.

173
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:17,180
His lab did all the analysis work on the 35 carcasses sent in from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.

174
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,180
Well, I would, of course, surmise the animal was dead before they were removed.

175
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,180
But how would the hole be dug where its head is? It's been moving to dig that hole.

176
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:33,180
Many times when an animal dies, they go through an agonal phase just before they die,

177
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,180
and they will paddle their legs or they will beat their head or swing it back and forth,

178
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,180
or they might even have some central nervous system involvement,

179
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,180
which would make them be in coordinate, make them lie down and to struggle for some little time,

180
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,180
and this would dig the hole where the animal's head is.

181
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,180
I'm not trying to discredit the fact that there can be mutilations,

182
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,180
but I just want to show that there is a very good chance that something else could have caused it.

183
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,180
Here is the very first cow that Sherrick Tech's Graves and Sterling ever went out on.

184
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,180
Would a natural predator ever strip a jaw clean like this one?

185
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,180
I cannot tell you whether this would be from a sharp instrument or from scavenging.

186
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,180
Many times when an animal dies again, the pressure will cause their tongue to extend,

187
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,180
and this will allow animals to start eating on the front end of the animal.

188
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,180
And if so, this cleaning of the jaw and the cheek muscles

189
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,180
would be just a natural extension of that entry into the body tissues.

190
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,180
Doesn't that look like a nice clean curve of a cut around there in that lower jaw?

191
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,180
It does. It looks quite clean.

192
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:44,180
But once again, we have to have all of our facts together before we can draw a conclusion.

193
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,180
If I could see whether hair was cut or if there were deeper incisions,

194
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,180
perhaps I could tell you specifically.

195
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,180
But to look at one like this, I would say it's within the realms

196
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,180
of either scavenging or sharp knife mutilation.

197
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,180
It could be either way.

198
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:07,180
One other place in 1976 north of town on a very hard pasture, almost like hard brick.

199
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,180
We found tripod marks 12 inches across.

200
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,180
The tripod marks were 14 feet apart.

201
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,180
We found one set that had gone in the ground roughly 8 inches.

202
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:25,180
And it would take a good post hole digger or shovel to dig in like this.

203
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,180
It indicated something very heavy had sat down in this area,

204
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,180
yet there was no tracks leading from it nor to it.

205
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Almost nightly when this was going on,

206
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:43,180
we could pick out a very brilliant, huge, brilliant light in the sky.

207
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,180
We had a newsman take pictures of it with a very high powered lens.

208
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:55,180
But all we got out of this was the movement of it and the light showing very brilliant.

209
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:02,180
Several times we observed smaller lights come out of this aircraft

210
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,180
and then come down toward earth.

211
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,180
This huge, brilliant light would hang in the air and then when it would move,

212
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:14,180
it could move up and down, backwards, forwards, travel very rapidly.

213
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:22,180
And after a while, these smaller lights would join up with the larger one and then they'd disappear.

214
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:29,180
Another law enforcement officer who saw strange lights back in 1975 and 76 is Bill Waugh.

215
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,180
Bill was the under sheriff in Elbert County for 8 years working with Sheriff George Yarnell.

216
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,180
He retired in 1979.

217
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,180
A policyman and I were sitting out there one night.

218
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,180
The sheriff was up in a plane and I happened to look in the rear view mirror

219
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:50,180
and I saw this orange ball of light come up from the ground.

220
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,180
So I nudged the policyman with me.

221
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,180
We jumped out of our car and this light came at us.

222
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,180
It was up then, up off the ground, flying higher than the car.

223
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:09,180
They get up just about to the car and then make a complete 90 degree right angle turn.

224
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:16,180
And in the cockpit I could see three little lights, a red one and what looked like a white one,

225
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,180
and either a green or a blue.

226
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:24,180
One man looked out of his window at night just before he went to bed and the horse was standing out there.

227
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,180
He got up the next morning, sat down to breakfast and happened to glance out

228
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
and the horse had been mutilated right there.

229
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
It was in the summertime.

230
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,180
They had three, they had a house and two trailers where people lived in.

231
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,180
And they all had their windows open.

232
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,180
They had dogs around the place.

233
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,180
No one heard any dogs barking.

234
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,180
No one heard a thing.

235
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,180
And that was right up by the house.

236
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:54,180
A Colorado man named Drexel Lawson has a livestock removal service.

237
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:00,180
He's been working a nine county area around Denver and Colorado Springs since 1977,

238
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
picking up dead livestock.

239
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,180
He's been working for a long time.

240
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,180
He's been working for a long time.

241
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
He's been working for a long time.

242
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,180
He's been working for a long time.

243
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
He's been working for a long time.

244
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,180
He was a mother of 6 children.

245
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,180
He worked around Denver and Colorado Springs since 1977,

246
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
picking up dead livestock.

247
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,180
Over a two-year period, he hauled off about 4,000 dead animals,

248
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:32,180
including several mutilated cattle.

249
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,180
My first mutilated pickup was in 1977.

250
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,580
And frankly scared the hell out of me because I wasn't I wasn't used to seeing things like that

251
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,820
I think it scared me and it's down to me so much was when livestock die they normally will

252
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,380
Lay in thrashing the grass or in the dirt this cow

253
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,140
looked like she'd just been

254
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
actually just picked up or

255
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
or turned over and

256
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,940
None of the grass or the dirt anything around her was

257
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,140
Was disturbed or destroyed in any way from from her dying

258
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:19,180
She had had had any blood the blood was completely drained from I would say that it would be

259
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
virtually impossible to withdraw

260
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:29,560
Not even all of the blood but just significance amount of the blood from an animal without leaving some telltale mark that

261
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,400
Blood vessels had been cut or that some the animal had been killed in this manner

262
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:41,560
Probably closer examination would have shown that in the dead animals body the blood had gravitated to the deeper organs or to the downside

263
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:50,520
Do you know of anything on the earth today in medicine or military that could drain the blood from an animal I?

264
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Have no knowledge of it if it's there

265
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,440
all the

266
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Mutilated cattle that I've gotten

267
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,040
Where the rectum tissues been taken or the muscle tissues been taken it's been a very very precise

268
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,400
surgical type

269
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,320
incision and it's been cleaned not

270
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,720
Not hacked like an animal the animal has to grab you by it has to tear in order to remove that tissue

271
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
And this has all been smooth

272
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
What's your own personal?

273
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,960
Theory or feeling about who or what is doing the mutilations

274
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,240
well, I feel strongly about UFOs the

275
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,360
Incisions a lot of times looks like some type of burn or laser

276
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
the eyes on

277
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,400
particular cattle that I picked up that's had a

278
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,280
Marbly clear look which looks like it's a flash burn or

279
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
some type of a laser burn

280
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,280
the

281
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,840
The term laser burn came up in several conversations with ranchers and law enforcement people

282
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,600
So we decided to see how laser surgery is done

283
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:11,600
This instrument is called a co2 laser. It will be used to remove scar tissue from a woman's vocal cords

284
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:20,680
This mobile laser unit stands about eight feet high and weighs about 400 pounds in the hospital

285
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,160
It is powered by AC current from a wall plug

286
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,360
Experienced medical technicians need 20 minutes to get the laser unit ready for surgery

287
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,480
Clearly, it's not a convenient tool to drag around remote ranch lands

288
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:40,680
but because of the alleged burns found on some mutilated animals a few people have jumped to the conclusion that maybe lasers are involved

289
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,200
It is true that lasers seal off blood vessels as they penetrate tissue

290
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:53,000
So there is little or no bleeding the depth of penetration is controlled by the power of the beam and length of time

291
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,600
It is on when the laser beam hits tissue heat is generated which turns cell water to steam and vaporizes away

292
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,480
Could a laser do the strange cuts found on mutilated cattle

293
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,800
We asked dr. Arlen Myers an experienced laser surgeon at Rose Medical Center in Denver

294
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
I

295
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,160
Have been examining two photographs of alleged cattle mutilations in Logan County and

296
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:28,040
They showed two quite distinct pictures. One is a large hole that has surrounding burns and charred material

297
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,320
The other is a very nice clean cut and has relatively normal underlying tissue

298
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,560
the first picture I think

299
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,720
Conceivably could have been caused by a burning or lasing type instrument

300
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,280
Although I think it would be very difficult given the state of the art today

301
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:52,680
At least to my knowledge to bring a device to a field and inflict this sort of damage on a piece of livestock

302
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,280
In more reality, it would be easier to bring the animal here

303
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,840
We asked dr. Myers to use the laser and try to make a perfect 1 eighth inch deep circle in a chicken

304
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,760
You can see the red aiming dot and we're going to begin to remove some of this tissue

305
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,280
And you can see as it's as it's removing this tissue

306
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,080
That the burn is fairly flush notice the dark

307
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,880
scab that forms

308
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
around it and we can

309
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,680
continue to

310
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,880
Remove this tissue in deeper and deeper levels the laser

311
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,560
Evaporates water and that's why we're seeing all the smoke

312
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,120
This piece of flesh that we're using has no blood in it

313
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,960
But even if it did it would have the same bloodless sort of charred appearance after the tissue was removed

314
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,960
In trying to duplicate what I saw in the pictures if I were to try to deepen this hole

315
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,900
there are some limitations with the instrument that I'm using the

316
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,900
Maximum point of focus of the beam is at a certain length and in order to make this hole deeper

317
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,200
I would need to move the instrumentation deeper toward the flesh and just continue to burrow the hole

318
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,780
Okay, we're going to go to the scaffold

319
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,060
And try to demonstrate what sort of

320
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,100
Let's leave this here for some contrast and we'll take this second

321
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:39,620
Piece of flesh and I'm just gonna make a similar size circle and try to duplicate this wound over here

322
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,660
Simply with a with a knife when I remove this

323
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Piece of skin

324
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,340
That there's in contrast to the laser

325
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,020
No

326
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,800
Surrounding scab or blackness

327
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,300
And this is just a clean a clean wound the edge is

328
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:19,180
Nice and smooth and the underlying tissue is unaffected of course by the knife

329
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,620
Compared to the laser burn the surface of the removed tissue was darkened and somewhat burned

330
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,020
Here is the scalpel cut again

331
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,980
not perfectly round a few angled edges and

332
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:38,700
Here's a perfect oval cut on a steer. We filmed in San Luis, Colorado on October 6th

333
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,540
1979

334
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:47,340
There was also a perfect circular cut around the eye. The tongue was gone and the lower jaw had been completely stripped of flesh

335
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:55,700
Two deputies from the Castilla County Sheriff's Office took us to the mutilation site five days after they had first examined the fresh carcass

336
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:03,700
Well, I don't look it's changed a little bit hey, but look at this now, this is still very very evident here. Look at this

337
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:11,460
Of course, you know our photos will show a complete circular clean cut, but you can still see it here now. Look

338
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,620
Now this looks kind of dry

339
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:21,500
But if you'll recall when we first spotted this that was just like if you've taken a pair of scissors and cut out a round

340
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:27,820
Piece of paper, you know, like you might do a kid might do in school. That's how good it was and if you'll notice something else

341
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,060
Say that an animal had

342
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,340
Taken that piece of skin

343
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:39,340
How can you explain the fact that if he's out to eat and out for flesh that he wouldn't bore right through that

344
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,700
soft portion of the stomach and get into the entrails, which is typical of the way that

345
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,740
Animals attacked dead while carcasses

346
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,260
That just doesn't make sense to me

347
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,320
That mutilation in San Luis, Colorado happened around September 29th, 1979

348
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:04,780
Two weeks later. There was another one in Chama, New Mexico and by December there had been more scattered mutilation reports in Kansas

349
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:12,540
Nebraska Wyoming and Iowa and the number of mutilations being investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had climbed above 30

350
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,180
Lou Girardo is the chief investigator for the district attorney's office in Trinidad, Colorado

351
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:27,060
It's not difficult to tell a predator kill I mean a coyote or a bobcat or a lion, of course will grab and tear

352
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,980
It wasn't that way with any of the mutilations I covered and the first two were amazing

353
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,180
The others had been completely removed with a very clean

354
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,340
Apparently a surgical cut

355
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:46,620
No blood were around the wounds. No blood were around any of the either the animals no tracks

356
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:52,460
Checking the area where the two cows were laying. They were underneath some tall oak

357
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:58,380
We checked the upper branches just in case we had heard of the mutilations in other parts of the country

358
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:06,300
Or the possibility of the animals being dropped removed from where they were killed and dropped in the area where they were being found

359
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,620
There were no broken branches

360
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:15,500
No tracks of any kind human or otherwise led to or from the animals the sheriff stayed away from the animals

361
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
The sheriff stayed away from it

362
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
after he saw what he did see and

363
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,580
There was no explanation of what had happened to the animals according to the rancher the night before they had been seen in good health

364
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,660
I

365
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,620
Think was wrong with them the next day. They showed up dead and mutilated

366
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,780
another interesting fact a few days after

367
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:41,100
We usually see the report from a woman who lived in the area of a real dark colored helicopter with a sling attached underneath

368
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:49,100
Flying near the area where the mutilations that had taken place with the bodies of the carcasses of the animals were found

369
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,300
And that's not the only time

370
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,380
helicopter had been reported prior to

371
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,740
or immediately after

372
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,460
The mutilation there seemed to be in the area one time or another

373
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,180
none of these choppers had been

374
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:11,420
Identified no identifying marks all the reports come in that the choppers were silent

375
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,980
And I have never heard of a silent helicopter. They were always making some type of noise

376
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,700
But these reports were that there was no noise

377
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,700
You

378
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:45,540
Descriptions of dark and silent helicopters as well as unidentified bright lights came up in almost every conversation about the cattle mutilation mystery

379
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:51,680
Some people suggested that the Cobra helicopter developed for air attacks in Vietnam was a quiet helicopter

380
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:01,100
We went to Fort Carson an army base in Colorado to film a Cobra in operation

381
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,700
We

382
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,680
Asked the pilot to go out one mile circle and fly back over us at 500 feet

383
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:33,260
The Cobra was definitely dark, but never silent especially on takeoffs and landings

384
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,180
when

385
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,020
We first started hearing reports about the cattle mutilations here at Fort Carson, Colorado

386
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:55,860
We often wondered ourselves what type of helicopter had the capability of lifting such an animal from one side to another

387
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,940
It's there's not too many helicopters in the local area that had that capability that I've seen

388
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:09,220
Around here. There's certainly are not any here at Fort Carson except for the much larger helicopters and

389
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,660
Because of the noise that would generate from these helicopters

390
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,540
No animal is going to sit still to allow these these helicopters to get within any close proximity

391
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:26,020
Of them as they make their approach or land to the area. Is there such thing as a silent helicopter?

392
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,220
No

393
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Not a completely silent helicopter

394
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:37,220
No, the helicopter will always make some sort of noise that will scare an animal away that is not used to that type of noise

395
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:46,020
From the reports that we've read and heard on news and newspapers it would require somebody of great ability to perform

396
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,020
These acts and anybody that I know of in this particular area

397
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:57,020
Certainly not the military if I had to choose between aliens of some sort coming down and

398
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:06,020
Doing these things to the animals and lifting the animals as compared to having a helicopter of our size

399
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:14,020
Or smaller helicopters doing these things. I would probably be more apt to choose the alien

400
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Aspect of the cattle problems in the military or any other type of small helicopter

401
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,020
Now just here this late summer for the early spring

402
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:43,020
One of the investigators I've been working with for five years dropped in the office and we discussed what was new

403
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,020
And he said well the thing is now I'll tell you he says and I'm inclined to agree with him

404
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:55,020
That who is doing this now is very possibly creatures not of this planet

405
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:00,020
Now that you know that shakes you up a little bit creatures not of this planet you know you're thinking of Buck Rogers and things like this

406
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,020
But that's the way it is seriously right now

407
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:09,020
That it's very very possible that these mutilations are being done by creatures from outer space

408
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,020
There's a state patrol officer in Dulce, New Mexico who has not only seen UFOs

409
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:18,020
But received a substance that dropped from a strange craft that hovered over Taos, New Mexico

410
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,020
Gabe Valdez has been investigating cattle mutilation since 1976

411
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:34,020
It's got to be a highly sophisticated agency that has total secrecy and the money and technology or something else involved

412
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:43,020
But as far as an occult group being involved in it I think it would have been broken a long time ago

413
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,020
So what's left?

414
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,020
Either government or extraterrestrial

415
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:55,020
You first have to operate under the premise that you believe that some government agency would be responsible for that

416
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:01,020
To me it's ludicrous, it's almost ridiculous to conceive that that would be a possibility

417
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:07,020
You're dealing with, if you're talking about the CIA or you're talking about some government spy agency

418
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:16,020
It just doesn't make sense to me that they would be involved in at random mutilating cattle on individual ranches or farms

419
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:21,020
If they were involved in something like that they would have the resources to do it under controlled conditions

420
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:30,020
So I've never even entertained that thought even though it's one of the theories that has been thrust into this investigation

421
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:45,020
North West of Laramie, Wyoming lives a rancher farmer named Pat McGuire

422
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,020
His father and grandfather were Wyoming ranchers

423
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,020
He settled down here in 1972 with his wife and eight children

424
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,020
In September 1976 on a ridge about two miles from his trailer house

425
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:04,020
Mr. McGuire, his brother and his cousin Mark Murphy found two mutilated cows

426
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:14,020
The following hypnosis session with Dr. Leo Sprinkle, director of counseling and testing at the University of Wyoming in Laramie

427
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:21,020
is Pat McGuire's effort to recall more details about an extraordinary incident that happened to him at the time of the mutilations

428
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:28,020
Dr. Sprinkle is one of the world's leading authorities in cases involving UFOs and human abductions

429
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,020
He has personally worked with 47 people since 1967

430
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:38,020
Pat McGuire was his 28th case and the first concerning cattle mutilations

431
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Whenever you're ready just go right ahead, you can talk and describe your experiences

432
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,020
It was Sunday

433
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,020
Me and Marks

434
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,020
We were driving around checking the cows

435
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:18,020
Come upon a cow that was dead

436
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:26,020
They cut the nose off, tongue was out, the sex organs were gone

437
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:33,020
One brother said it must have been from a sex cult from the university

438
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:42,020
Out here messing around, I said, probably was, I said, we'll catch him yet

439
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:51,020
Okay, Pat, you're doing fine, I'd like to have you now turn your attention to the evening that you and Mark were looking at that craft

440
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,020
You were looking through the scope

441
00:39:54,020 --> 00:40:00,020
I said, Mark, let's get the hell out of here

442
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:09,020
I said, let's get the hell out of here, I said, that star's coming, I said, either that or my eyes are bad

443
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:19,020
He said, it's coming, it changed from a pure white to an orange

444
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:26,020
I said, Mark, I don't know if it's picking up a cow

445
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:31,020
I said, yeah, hear that cow?

446
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,020
Hell, she's bawling

447
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
And it seems to be hovering there over the ridge

448
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
Right, hovering, picking up the cow

449
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,020
Can you see the cow?

450
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,020
No

451
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,020
But you can hear the cow?

452
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,020
Right, terrible

453
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,020
Terrible, bawling?

454
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,020
Terrible, worse than I ever heard a cow

455
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,020
I've heard a few

456
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,020
Okay, then what happened?

457
00:40:51,020 --> 00:41:00,020
Then all of a sudden, like they threw a valve or a switch, everything stopped

458
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,020
The craft is still there

459
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,020
The cow wasn't no ball

460
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,020
No sound from the cattle?

461
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,020
No, it's like they threw a switch

462
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,020
It was weird

463
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Back of my neck, hair on the back of my neck was straight up

464
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,020
The next day, you said you drove over there?

465
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,020
Right

466
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,020
What do you find when you drive over?

467
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,020
We didn't go over there until 10 o'clock in the morning

468
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:33,020
We waited until it was damn good daylight

469
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,020
We weren't taking a chance

470
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:43,020
We went and looked all over, along the side of the hill

471
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:49,020
All we found was another cow in two miles, just a lone calf, bawling for its mom

472
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,020
I said they took her

473
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:57,020
We never found her, never did find her

474
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:04,020
I've drawn a picture of the spacecraft that I'd seen that night

475
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,020
The ridge was 300 feet

476
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:15,020
The tip stuck above the ridge, and that would give you a size of a football field

477
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:26,020
As it proceeded down from the sky, it was a pure white with the flashing red and yellow and blue lights

478
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,020
Then it turned to a 4S orange, the whole ship did

479
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:36,020
It stays this color, and of course it'll glow the whole area up right around where the cow was

480
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:43,020
The area was deep red, and that's where you could hear that cow bellowing

481
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,020
You can feel yourself even going deeper

482
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:03,020
What you are about to hear is perhaps the first and only known eyewitness account of a mutilation

483
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:11,020
Because Dr. Leo Sprinkle is recognized as one of the world's leading authorities on cases involving UFOs and human abduction

484
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:18,020
He was contacted by the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization in Tucson, Arizona to do hypnosis work with this woman

485
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,020
Her name is Judy Doherty

486
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:28,020
On a clear moonlit night in May 1973, Judy was driving back from a bingo game in Houston, Texas

487
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:36,020
She and her mother, daughter Cindy, and brother and sister-in-law watched a strange bright light hover in the sky

488
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,020
After that night, she suffered terrible headaches and anxiety

489
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:47,020
In 1978, she underwent one hypnosis session which brought out part of her unusual experience, but not all of it

490
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:54,020
She also had several psychiatric and personality evaluations, all with results in the normal human behavior range

491
00:43:54,020 --> 00:44:00,020
The second hypnosis session with Dr. Sprinkle occurred on March 13, 1980

492
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:06,020
Now you're standing outside your car, now you're looking up, you can describe your impressions

493
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,020
What are your impressions?

494
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:19,020
It's like a spotlight that's shining down on the back of my car

495
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:25,020
And it's like it has substance to it

496
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:35,020
I can see an animal being taken up in this

497
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:42,020
I can see it squirming and trying to get free

498
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:47,020
And it's like it's being sucked up

499
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:53,020
It's taken into some sort of chamber

500
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:59,020
It's a little round, tiny room

501
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:12,020
And I get nauseated at watching how they excise the parts

502
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:25,020
It's done very quickly, but the calf doesn't die immediately

503
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:35,020
For some reason, the calf's heart isn't taken, and I don't know, it seems like it's still living, and that upset me very much

504
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:42,020
And then I can see the calf being lowered, it's like it's being dropped back down

505
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:49,020
And when it's on the ground, it's dead, I can see that it's not moving

506
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:53,020
But I feel very sick to my stomach, what I witnessed

507
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,020
You see the animal being cut up?

508
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,020
Yes

509
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:03,020
How is it being cut up?

510
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:08,020
Dissected

511
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,020
With knives?

512
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,020
Instruments of some kind

513
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:19,020
Can you describe the instruments?

514
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:24,020
They're like a knife, but they have different kind of handles

515
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:32,020
More like a razor that doesn't have movable parts, but like a straight razor type

516
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:39,020
There's tissue, it's laid out, flat and smooth, it glistens

517
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:46,020
And then needles, there's needles in it, or what appears to be like needles, it may be probes, I don't know

518
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:53,020
But it has a tube connected to it

519
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:59,020
And the same thing with what appears to be testicles, can't tell

520
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:05,020
There's a probe or a needle or something inserted

521
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:12,020
And the tube leaving

522
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,020
The same with the eye

523
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,020
Is anybody else around you?

524
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:28,020
I feel the presence of other things, but I don't know what they are, I can't see them

525
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:36,020
Do you feel you're standing by the side of the road, by your car now, or are you standing someplace else now?

526
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,020
I feel in two places at once

527
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,020
Ok, describe how you feel

528
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:52,020
I feel like I was able to see what was going on in the craft, but I was also standing beside the road

529
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:59,020
Ok, just let yourself focus on what is happening inside the craft

530
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:07,020
Be aware of who is around you, it's ok, you'll be able to describe who is standing around you

531
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,020
It appears to be two little men

532
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,020
Two little men, how do they look?

533
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:36,020
They look, their hands look funny, they have long claw nails like

534
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:41,020
They have very large eyes, they're very hypnotic

535
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:47,020
Like they're so big that, and they don't blink, their eyes do not blink

536
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,020
It's almost like a snake

537
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:56,020
They were very snappy about their movements, and they knew exactly what they were doing

538
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:02,020
And I felt a little better, because for some reason they projected that it was necessary this be done

539
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:08,020
That it was for our betterment, for the betterment of mankind that this was done

540
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:13,020
That they were more or less watching out for us

541
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:25,020
So you felt better when you had that impression of not only precision but also a benevolent or a kind attitude toward people

542
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,020
I can't say that they were kind

543
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,020
But concerned?

544
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:40,020
I can't even say that they were concerned, they were just like doing a job that evidently it affects them too

545
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:47,020
And it has to do with somehow nuclear waste or testing

546
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:57,020
They've been here for quite some time and they test the soil as well as our water, as well as our animal life, our vegetation

547
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:19,020
When I question why they aren't saying more, and why they can't stop it if they're so knowledgeable

548
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:25,020
And they get angry, I don't know, I don't understand that

549
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:29,020
You don't know why they get angry?

550
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:35,020
I don't know why they get angry and I don't know why they can't stop it if they're so knowledgeable

551
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:44,020
At one point in the hypnosis session, Judy doesn't understand why she can see her daughter Cindy in the car one minute and gone the next

552
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:52,020
Breathing deeply and easily, let yourself relax, you can be aware of yourself standing by the side of the car, you can be aware of yourself standing in the craft

553
00:50:52,020 --> 00:51:00,020
And now let yourself be aware of where Cindy is

554
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,020
I know I have a feeling of fear

555
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:09,020
Okay, let yourself go on through the experience

556
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,020
Let yourself go on through the fear

557
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,020
What impressions come to mind?

558
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,020
I just visualize her on a table

559
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:22,020
Okay, what happens next?

560
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:27,020
I'm afraid that it's going to happen to her, what they did to the animal

561
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,020
Just let yourself relax

562
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,020
Forget it, no, I don't want to

563
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,020
You can tolerate it, you know it's alright

564
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:42,020
Just let yourself go on through, just relax deeply

565
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:46,020
You know that everything is going to be okay

566
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:54,020
You see Cindy on the table, what happens next?

567
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:59,020
I'm just afraid that they're going to hurt her

568
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:11,020
Yeah, you're afraid, but you let yourself go ahead and let yourself go on through the experience, you can be aware

569
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:16,020
Just let yourself relax deeply

570
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,020
You can be aware of what happens next

571
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,020
They put her to sleep, I guess

572
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,020
Okay, they put her to sleep

573
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,020
Okay, what's happening now?

574
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,020
They're just examining her, I guess

575
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:49,020
But I'm so afraid that they're going to cut her or something

576
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,020
Do you say anything?

577
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:02,020
They don't listen, they just ignore me and just go back to work like it's nothing

578
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:07,020
They don't seem to have any emotions, they don't seem to care, I thought they were going to harm her

579
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,020
I thought they were going to do what they did to the animals

580
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,020
But they don't harm her? No

581
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,020
Okay, what does happen?

582
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,020
They just take some samples from her

583
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,020
What kind of samples?

584
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:26,020
I don't know, just scrapings, like they go inside her mouth

585
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:31,020
I can see them, they just kind of scrape little pieces off

586
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:36,020
Any other samples?

587
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,020
That's all I can remember

588
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:42,020
The preceding scenes were taken from a four-hour hypnosis session

589
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:50,020
Dr. Sprinkle stated afterward that Judy Doherty is, in his professional opinion, a sincere, honest, and credible person

590
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:58,020
What happened before our camera was her first complete and vivid recall of her 1973 experience in Texas

591
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,020
They would listen, they just went about their work

592
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,020
They didn't have any emotion or feeling

593
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:09,020
They couldn't seem to understand why I would even be upset

594
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,020
Just like it was routine business for them

595
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,020
Like a laboratory animal or something

596
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:24,020
If extraterrestrials are the ones mutilating animals, what do you think the implications are then for this planet?

597
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:32,020
Throughout the mutilations, all of us involved have been concerned with the possibility of the mutilations going from animals to human beings

598
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,020
Understandably

599
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,020
Thank God to this point it hasn't happened

600
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:43,020
Whatever they're doing with the portions of these animals they are taking, I haven't the slightest idea

601
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,020
There's a reason for it, it's not haphazard

602
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,020
There's a pattern to it

603
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,020
I don't know, I think it's a wait-and-see game

604
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:57,020
What else can we do if we do have beings from outer space doing this

605
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,020
With the capabilities to do things like this

606
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,020
What can we as a human race do?

607
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:11,020
If they have the knowledge and the technology that it looks like they have, we're powerless

608
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:16,020
So maybe it's a wait-and-see game, I can't see anything else to do

609
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:25,020
If a secret probe was being conducted either by our own intelligence agencies or by UFO entities

610
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:35,020
Then they shouldn't be leaving a mass of carcasses all over the states because this only invites investigation and speculation and wondering

611
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:51,020
I would suspect that the carcasses are being left by design to stimulate our particular culture to wonder as to what is happening, who is doing this

612
00:55:51,020 --> 00:56:04,020
If we are dealing with surreptitious, covert, highly cautious culture contact between highly developed extraterrestrials and our Earth planetary civilization

613
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:13,020
Then one of the primary considerations that we must deal with is the problem of culture shock

614
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:21,020
In any possible contact between civilizations such as I've described

615
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:31,020
I think that the superior civilization would be very careful to slowly condition the subject culture to its presence

616
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:37,020
So as not to induce what we label as culture shock

617
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:53,020
Which is a very profound psychological, sociological, philosophical disturbance among a people when exposed to a culture which shocks their traditional values, their institutionalized concepts, etc.

618
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,020
This is speculation of course

619
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:12,020
But an overview of the UFO phenomena leads most of us who have been in the field for a long period of time to view it as cautious, reconnaissance, conditioning of the planet Earth

620
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:32,020
Thank you for watching
