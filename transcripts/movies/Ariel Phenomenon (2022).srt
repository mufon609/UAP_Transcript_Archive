00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,400
You're tuned to the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, Radio One, and here is a special

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
announcement.

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,040
If anyone has video footage of the meteorite showers, or whatever they were, please get

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,000
in touch with Tim Leach of BBC Television very urgently.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,120
BBC Television News.

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,200
I was not so frightened in the war zones of Angola or Rwanda as I was when this story

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
hit.

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,600
Hundreds of people today phoned the ZBC and BBC correspondent in Harare saying they sighted

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,640
an unidentified flying object last night.

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,680
These things were flying in a pattern and there was no sound.

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
No wings, no nothing.

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Shiny over thing.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
Hello.

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Hello.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,960
My name is Tim Leach from BBC Television News.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,960
I understand that you had some strange experience.

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,600
Yes, that's right.

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
It was a bright, radiant light.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
It was the absence of noise I didn't like.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
There has been much excitement after how many times I've seen it.

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,680
There has been much excitement after hundreds of people reported seeing a mysterious bright

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
object.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,400
We suddenly looked up and we saw this thing coming over the top of the hill.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,400
As it sort of came at the breast of us, it suddenly changed from this glow to let's say

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
two big red orange balls.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
No sound.

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Look.

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
It's going.

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Is that what a meteorite does?

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
No way.

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
That's incredible.

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Eyewitnesses say it had a bright light at the front and flew at great speed.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,200
The object was also seen by two international airline pilots who reported it to air traffic

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
control at Johannesburg airport.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,200
There were three of us that saw it.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Myself, the copilot and the pilot in the other aircraft.

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,200
South Africa's top meteorologist says there's no rational explanation for the bright light

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,200
and it could be one of the most widely reported unidentified flying objects.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
None of it made sense, so I phoned the BBC in London and I said, what is this meteorite

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
show?

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And they said, no, no, no, no.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's got nothing to do with Africa or Zimbabwe.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The meteorites come down in an arc.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They don't fly parallel to the earth.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What about this Russian debris that's coming down?

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No, that doesn't work either.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Sorry.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, what is this?

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Viewers with more information can either contact the ZBC or BBC in Harare.

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,800
For at least three or four days, people from all over Zimbabwe were phoning us at the BBC

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
to say, we've seen something weird.

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
It was a helicopter or what?

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,800
No, no, it was just a big round wall.

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,800
The bottom was flat, but it was round like on top of my wall on my house.

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,800
And then I got this call from Aerial School Rua that the children had seen a CFO landing

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,600
and these funny men in body clean suits, black suits, weird.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I went roaring out there in the car with my sound man.

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Aerial School, 19th September, 1994, 12.12 local time.

60
00:03:51,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Can you tell me what you saw on Friday?

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Well, it was just glinting in the trees.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,200
And it's like there was a man and he walked towards us and he walked back again.

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
What does he look like?

64
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,200
His face was like this and his eyes were down here.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Like, what, further down his face?

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, much further down than us because I was here.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You don't think it was somebody in fancy dress doing a prank or something?

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And how tall about?

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
About, say there, sitting on the spaceship.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How do you know it was a spaceship?

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Wasn't it a helicopter or something like that?

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, it looked like it was like a disk, like a round.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And whereabouts was it?

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In the trees over there, between the third pole.

76
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
And did you girls see that as well?

77
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Yes.

78
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,800
We asked them to draw pictures of what they saw on Friday.

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,800
And after looking at those, I definitely feel that they did see something.

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
What do you think that was?

81
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,800
I agree that it could be something that we are not common with.

82
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,600
But to actually say that it was a UFO, I would be reluctant to make a decision like that.

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
All the other journalists in Harare were not taking this seriously.

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,600
But I took it seriously because this story got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
And I needed to know what was going on.

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Who do I talk to?

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,600
And then I spoke to some contacts and they put me in touch with Cynthia Hind,

88
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,600
a person for UFOs in Zimbabwe.

89
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Cynthia Hind's coming up and I believe she's being a Geiger counter.

90
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
She did mention it on the telephone.

91
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Well, I think we'll wait and see what happens then.

92
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Just come and sit on these chairs along here.

93
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
These are the grade 7s for the oldest children here at the school.

94
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
They say they saw something.

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Did you all see something?

96
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Yes.

97
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
What's your name?

98
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm Danielle Mandy and I saw this silver thing in amongst this clump of trees

99
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:15,200
with this one thing sitting on the side and another thing sort of like running up and down the top.

100
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,200
It had a long top and a flat top around the sides.

101
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
What was around the side?

102
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Just saw like a platform coming down the side.

103
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Did you see anything else?

104
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Yes, we saw a black man running around.

105
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
A little man or what?

106
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,200
From where we looked he was about this small but we were quite way away so he was about our size.

107
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
What did you see?

108
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I saw something silver on the ground amongst the trees and a person in black and that's all I saw.

109
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
You saw a person alongside the silver thing?

110
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Yes.

111
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Have you heard about UFOs before this?

112
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
No.

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
You didn't know anything about it so it was something quite new to you?

114
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Yes.

115
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Were you afraid?

116
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Yes.

117
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Because nobody should panic, we don't know what it is and it could be just something.

118
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:17,200
There was a Russian satellite that went up on the 27th of August and it's a possibility something came down

119
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,200
but it would not account for the figure you saw.

120
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:33,200
I think for the moment you should keep everybody away until we've had some analysis of what's going on.

121
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,200
It was in between the gap of this one thing behind the pile of wood.

122
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Yes, I can see that.

123
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Where do they think it was?

124
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,200
They told us it was in between these two poles here.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
In between these two poles?

126
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Yes.

127
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Can you try to guide us though?

128
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Yes.

129
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
What equipment have you brought with you?

130
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Gunter is a highly technical chap.

131
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Because it's difficult and very expensive in this country, he's made his own Geiger counter.

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,200
We're going to check it out and see if there's any radioactivity there.

133
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,200
He says really some changes, the Geiger would be going faster.

134
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
So this is just normal background radiation?

135
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Yes, this is about normal.

136
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
I was helping Cynthia out more in technical terms.

137
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,200
So Cynthia found me quite useful in maybe explaining in a way certain phenomena.

138
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Maybe it was a certain time of the year where certain meteorological events occurred

139
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,200
like the Leonard meteor shower or the Perseid meteor shower.

140
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,200
So we used to try and eliminate all the natural events that might be happening in the sky

141
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,200
before we thought maybe there might be something more to it.

142
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
How sceptical are you?

143
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Well, I would like to see some evidence.

144
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
But you don't think you've got the equipment at the moment?

145
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
No, I haven't.

146
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,200
But from what I see from some of the children, I do believe that something happened.

147
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,200
I'm not all that gullible, but this to me is a very typical case.

148
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
And I've handled several hundreds in southern Africa.

149
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I certainly believe the children have some extremely interesting pictures

150
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
and there's certainly some of the things they've told me they couldn't have known about.

151
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Impossible.

152
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,200
I can remember it like it was yesterday.

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
It was easy to put down because that's exactly what I'd seen.

154
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,200
So, you know, something that I'll never, ever forget.

155
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
In 94, I was in grade two at the time at Ariel.

156
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
My teacher was Mrs Cheeple.

157
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,200
What I can remember was we were playing around in the playground area.

158
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
It was one of those rare occasions where the teachers were having a staff meeting,

159
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
so it was quite a long break.

160
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,200
We were happy to have them because it was more playtime.

161
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,200
And there was like a flash of light and it was bright silver.

162
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Everything shot past.

163
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
At the time, I mean, I remember it well.

164
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,200
We were on the field playing our football and a friend of mine came by and said,

165
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Luke, Luke, do you see that in the sky?

166
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
What is that? What is that?

167
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
So I was looking up and I saw it.

168
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
And it was, for one of a better word, you know, a UFO.

169
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,200
I wasn't sure what it was, but it was a silver object that was in the sky.

170
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
And we were both, like, looking at it.

171
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,200
And I only saw it for possibly a few seconds.

172
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,200
And it seemed to move off a bit and then suddenly vanished.

173
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,200
And we were both sort of standing there looking up saying, you know, jeez, what was that?

174
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,200
But didn't put too much thought to it and obviously went straight back to playing our football match.

175
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
A few minutes later, there was a whole sort of commotion going on

176
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,200
and there was a whole bunch of kids down at the bottom of the playground.

177
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,200
We were sitting on one of the logs that we always sat on eating our lunch.

178
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,200
And I noticed that people were pointing at this one thing or something in the bush.

179
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:25,200
And I got up to see what was going on because one person actually started crying.

180
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,200
And, you know, like I said, because we were the older group on the playground,

181
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:38,200
we all, people in my year, just were kind of concerned about what was going on with everyone else.

182
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,200
There was a big group of kids all sort of gathered right at the bottom of the playing field,

183
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
pointing and making noise and shouting and screaming.

184
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,200
And I went up to them to sort of see what was going on and try to, you know, calm everybody down.

185
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,200
My initial thought was somebody had hurt themselves or something.

186
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:01,200
OK, so if I was there, sort of say a couple of hundred metres up, it was right there.

187
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
So it seemed to be right on the cross-country course.

188
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,200
I remember seeing two flashing lights and I saw like a big silver,

189
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:18,200
like a saucer kind of thing that was hovering and then it landed or hovered on a stone.

190
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:26,200
And I saw two figures come out, really black, but their face,

191
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,200
you could actually see not much of their face, but it was really, really white in colour.

192
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Skin pigmentation was very, I don't know how you can, pale doesn't even, it looked plastic.

193
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:44,200
You know, it looked like someone who had had too much botox.

194
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Now when I think about it, I'm like, that's exactly what at the time I didn't have a colour or a word for it.

195
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
But that's exactly what it looked like.

196
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,200
It was very smooth and soft looking.

197
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,200
It looked like you'd slide right off if you tried to touch him, he'd just, yeah.

198
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,200
I suddenly realised that he's not quite normal.

199
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,200
I didn't actually know about UFOs and aliens at the time, so I just thought he was a strange person.

200
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,200
But it was the eyes that made him.

201
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:29,200
So that kind of shape, I think the eyes were obviously a lot more fluid, round, shiny, protruded.

202
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Almost like rugby balls or American footballs, huge eyes on the side of his face.

203
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,200
And so I looked over and sort of thought I could see something unusual going on in the bushes as well.

204
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,200
And I was like, yeah, yeah, there's got to be something, it looks like there's something there.

205
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:51,200
And the realisation that there was something moving, and it appeared to be coming towards us as well, I felt scared at that point.

206
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,200
The panic spread. I was looking for my brother and sister to make sure that they were okay.

207
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,200
And when I did have them, then we continued to look onward.

208
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:08,200
They just seemed confused, like, what is going on? One moment we're playing, next moment everybody's looking, pointing, and everybody's in a panic.

209
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
That was a little bit scary.

210
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,200
I'd just turned 28.

211
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I ended a relationship. I was engaged for six years.

212
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,200
You know, this whole topic definitely weighed on our relationship.

213
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,200
So I moved in with my folks.

214
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I'm thankful that I'm here right now and with my family, who supports me.

215
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:52,200
As for future goals, plans, work, I have no idea.

216
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,200
But I feel alone.

217
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Dear Emily, I hope this finds you well.

218
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,200
As you may have seen on our Facebook page,

219
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,200
next month we will be celebrating our 25th year as a school.

220
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,200
I know it's short notice coming from Canada, but we'd love to have you join us.

221
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,200
If you can't make it, know that you are always welcome to visit your old home.

222
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Love, Judy.

223
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Okay.

224
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:10,200
It brings up a lot for me.

225
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:19,200
It's a reminder of pain, of holding something inside.

226
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:45,200
I don't want to hold on to those feelings anymore.

227
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Hi, everybody. My name's Nicky, okay?

228
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
And that's Ivan with the camera.

229
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,200
And we're going to actually speak to a few of you who did see something that day

230
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:00,200
and ask you what happened, what you felt when you saw it, and that sort of thing.

231
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
You know, so very, very casual.

232
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,200
You must just say exactly what you want to say, okay?

233
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
What were you doing on the day?

234
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Well, I was looking, and I saw this maroon colour in the sky,

235
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,200
and me and my friends were following it.

236
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,200
And then we saw this light in the Massasa trees.

237
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Then I saw something shining, and somebody sitting on it,

238
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,200
and they were wearing pure black.

239
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,200
We saw the light in the sky.

240
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,200
We saw something shining, and somebody sitting on it,

241
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,200
and they were wearing pure black.

242
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,200
We saw this black figure running in a slow motion.

243
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,200
The strange thing was it seemed to be in very slow motion,

244
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
which to us seemed very interesting,

245
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,200
because Cynthia had come across this kind of event in some of our other cases

246
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,200
around the world where she had reports of, you know, alien encounters.

247
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Cynthia, how long have you been investigating UFO phenomena?

248
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
About 17 years.

249
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,200
I'm the continental coordinator in Africa for MUFON.

250
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,200
MUFON has over 5,000 members, most of whom are scientists.

251
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,200
You interviewed the children. What was your conclusion?

252
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
I believe them.

253
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
I believe they saw what they said they saw.

254
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
I think that perhaps some have been influenced by others,

255
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,200
and they've added a little bit here and a little bit there,

256
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,200
but basically they drew in their drawings many things

257
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,200
that I don't think that they could know about.

258
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
And how big was the figure?

259
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,200
It was about as big as a grade 6.

260
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
How tall would you have said?

261
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Maybe about three and a half feet.

262
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,200
There's another one. He was a bit short.

263
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,200
As an investigator, I've learned that if they tell exactly the same story,

264
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,200
then there's corroboration. They've got together and they're doing it.

265
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,200
But if they tell a similar story, but from different viewpoints,

266
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
to me, that's the truth.

267
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,200
We saw two of them. One was standing in front of the ship,

268
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
and then the other one had long hair,

269
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,200
but the one was standing in front. He didn't have any hair at all.

270
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Tell me with your hand how big the arms were.

271
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
They were shaped like something like that.

272
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Big head and big black eyes, and he was dressed in a black bodysuit.

273
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
What did you think it was?

274
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,200
I don't know. I just thought it was some kind of alien from a different planet.

275
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
What are they talking about?

276
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,200
I had no experience of UFOs or anything like that,

277
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
apart from seeing Steven Spielberg's film,

278
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or whatever it was.

279
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
You're all bonkers.

280
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,200
I was just a hard-ass journalist, sceptical as everybody would be.

281
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,200
What is this? I want to know. I mean, the BBC want to know.

282
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,200
What is going on here?

283
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,200
There's a truth behind your environment shaping who you are.

284
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,200
For me, growing up in Africa was normal. It was just home.

285
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,200
You're growing up in an area where you need to be aware of your environment.

286
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
This is not living in America.

287
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
You're in Africa. You're in Zimbabwe.

288
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
We didn't grow up around TV.

289
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
People liked to joke about, oh, do you have running water?

290
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Yes, that was luxury, actually.

291
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,200
That's something you were lucky to have, or electricity.

292
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Because the places that we went to, a lot, I mean, they had nothing.

293
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
You live in a mud hut. That's true.

294
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
You live every single day to live and hope you can.

295
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Yeah, so it's completely different.

296
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
This place...

297
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Okay, Mom, Dad, do you remember this place?

298
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
We used to stop here all the time.

299
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
This is really, I feel, at home.

300
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,400
To go back to Ariel means I get to go back to the spot where it happened.

301
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,000
I don't know how I'm going to feel.

302
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,800
I don't know what it's going to bring up,

303
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,000
but I feel really blessed to be able to do that in my life.

304
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,600
My family's religious, and they came to Africa for mission work.

305
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,000
My brother and sister also attended Ariel.

306
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,600
They were very traumatised about the event.

307
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,200
Talking about it in a religious environment

308
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,800
wasn't something that was allowed to be done.

309
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,800
I was very quickly removed out of the situation,

310
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,800
so it was... you know, it was a very difficult situation.

311
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,800
I was very sad, because I didn't know what I was going to do.

312
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,000
I was very quickly removed out of the situation,

313
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
so it was... it was packed up, everything,

314
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,600
and we flew into Canada.

315
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,000
I didn't get to have the opportunity of growing up

316
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,800
with the friends in that environment who had had that occur to them.

317
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,600
I'm looking forward to reconnect again.

318
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,400
I haven't been back to Ariel for just over 20 years.

319
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,600
Oh, my gosh.

320
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,400
Holy...

321
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,800
I have the class rest.

322
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,400
Hi.

323
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,000
How are you doing? Good, how are you?

324
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,400
Good. Emily.

325
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
How are you? How are you?

326
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm good. Yeah, and you?

327
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Good. I'm really glad to be back.

328
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,400
Back. Yeah.

329
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,600
Come on, what is that? Home.

330
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
It is home. It is.

331
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,800
It is. Home.

332
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,400
Always. Yes.

333
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,400
It's good to see you. Thank you. Oh, my goodness.

334
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,800
That's Rachel.

335
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,400
This is Paul, my brother, who also attended the school.

336
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
So, we're family three here.

337
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,000
So, will someone be able to show me around the school?

338
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
They're just going to show you around. Oh, hi.

339
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,000
How are you? It's nice to meet you, too.

340
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm walking where I used to step. Yes.

341
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,800
It feels incredible.

342
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,200
OK, we've got a special visitor in our midst.

343
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,800
It's Emily Trim, and she was here at Ariel's school 21 years ago.

344
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Was Mr Mackie here when you guys were here? Yes.

345
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,400
Do you remember Mrs Wacha? Yes.

346
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,800
Yes.

347
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
She was, I think, my grade three teacher.

348
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Was she? Yes.

349
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,600
And then she came, sort of like stalking me in the supermarket

350
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,400
as far as you were following me.

351
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,600
And I told you, it was full of you guys, and I was like...

352
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,600
You know, I really loved her, but I knew she was going to hate me

353
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
and do that to me.

354
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Jeanette doesn't live in this country.

355
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
It really doesn't matter much.

356
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,600
Hiya!

357
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
You having a good day? Yes.

358
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Yes? Is it lunchtime right now for you?

359
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Yes. Yes, wonderful.

360
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,600
There were the boundary logs here. OK.

361
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,600
And that field wasn't there. Yes.

362
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
It was all brush, you know.

363
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
And you guys went down to go look?

364
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Well, I was right on the log when it actually happened.

365
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
You were there? Yes, I was here.

366
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
And you saw them?

367
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
You are the ones who drew those funny pictures.

368
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Yes. OK, nice to meet you.

369
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
And where are you staying now?

370
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
OK, OK, OK.

371
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
You have the shower down there.

372
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
And this is your room.

373
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Everyone's got a fan.

374
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
I don't have mosquitos on the floor.

375
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
You don't have which? Mosquito nets.

376
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
It's OK.

377
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Music

378
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
And what did your other friends say?

379
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
They were scared.

380
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
We wanted to tell the teachers, but some of us were too shy to.

381
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,800
We ran down to the teachers and we went into the office

382
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and we started telling the teachers.

383
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And then they said maybe there's nothing.

384
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And how did that make you feel when they said maybe there's nothing?

385
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Well, we felt very sad because we did see something.

386
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Cheryl, what was your reaction when Candice and Tegan told you

387
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
about the UFOs and the aliens that they saw on Friday?

388
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I don't know really.

389
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I find it very hard to believe.

390
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I've always taught my children seeing is believing.

391
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Unfortunately, I didn't see, so I don't know if I believe.

392
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,200
We always joke with the children, all these little green men come out

393
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
and they say, no, Mummy, but we did see.

394
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
So I don't know.

395
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
I do believe Candice to a certain extent.

396
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
What did the man look like?

397
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Why would they make up such a story?

398
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,200
And kids of that age, 6 to 9, 10, they wouldn't be able to sustain such a story

399
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
for such a long time and one of them's going to crack

400
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
and then it would be like unrolling a ball of string

401
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,200
and all the rest of them would crack as well.

402
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
So would you want to talk about it to friends

403
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
or people you meet in the future when you get older?

404
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Or would you want to just forget about it?

405
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
No, I don't want to forget about it.

406
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
I want to keep it in because I knew that it was true

407
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
and I want to talk to other people about it.

408
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
They were fascinated.

409
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
They accepted it and they're full stride.

410
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
They knew what they'd seen.

411
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
They weren't stupid.

412
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Children are so much more open than adults.

413
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I've always kept an open mind about the life of the universe

414
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,400
and everything, God, Buddha, whatever you want to call it.

415
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,600
My story was something I hadn't encountered before.

416
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,600
In October 1983, I went to Zimbabwe,

417
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
which was just going through massacres

418
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
and I went all over Africa being a cameraman,

419
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,600
doing what's called bang-bang, which is serious war zone.

420
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
I'd done a lot.

421
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,600
I'd done Angola, Rwanda, Liberia, Nigeria.

422
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
I'd done lots of war zones.

423
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,600
A lot of my friends and my crew were killed.

424
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
I survived.

425
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
That was my job.

426
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
But this was a bolt out of the blue

427
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,800
and I wasn't expecting it because I was a realist.

428
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,800
It was totally out of my remit.

429
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,800
I could handle war zones, but I could not handle this UFO thing.

430
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
It just didn't make sense.

431
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,800
And that's when I had to call in extra help.

432
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Cynthia Hine put me in touch with Dr John Mack

433
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,800
and I got his number at Harvard University.

434
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Jim Leach from BBC Television News in Harare, Zimbabwe.

435
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Message for Dr John Mack.

436
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,800
This concerns a UFO sighting over a school

437
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,800
where it hovered, landed, a black man got out.

438
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,800
But of course, we're having difficulty being taken seriously

439
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
in spite of being the BBC.

440
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Please call me as soon as you can.

441
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Thank you.

442
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
I said, listen, I don't know what's going on,

443
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,800
this is way outside my normal ball game.

444
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
What do I do?

445
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
And John Mack said, as soon as I can break away,

446
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
I'm coming over.

447
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
And he did.

448
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
With his credentials

449
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,800
as head of the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard,

450
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,800
I sat up and took notice.

451
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
That took it to another depth.

452
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
And the stories are consistent.

453
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
There's some details that are not consistent,

454
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
like that boy saying the two different days.

455
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Do you think it's possible that one imaginative child

456
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,800
had a story and kind of stirred the rest of them?

457
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
No, I don't believe.

458
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I honestly believe they saw something,

459
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,800
but for me to actually draw a conclusion as to what it is,

460
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,800
I don't think I could do that at this point in time.

461
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,800
How many of them reported seeing the craft?

462
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Something in the region of about 60.

463
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
More of them could have seen it,

464
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
just too embarrassed to talk about it,

465
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,800
or we actually haven't had the grade 1s and 2s involved,

466
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,800
which are the old 6 and 7-year-olds.

467
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,800
How long would you estimate that the scene actually lasted?

468
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
It took over about 10 to 15 minutes.

469
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Really, that long?

470
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Did they describe any other sensory experiences,

471
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
like smell or sound?

472
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I don't think at all.

473
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,800
I don't think anybody's actually asked them that question.

474
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,800
You've talked with the BBC people and with Nikki Carter here before, right?

475
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Yes.

476
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,800
But the experience is still fresh in your mind, is that right?

477
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Yes.

478
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,800
What were you doing at the time?

479
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,800
I was playing in the playground,

480
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,800
and then we saw something silver,

481
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,800
and then we quickly ran to the logs

482
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,800
and we saw a silver thing,

483
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
and we saw a man standing next to it.

484
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
And what did he look like?

485
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Well, he had big eyes that, like, pointed.

486
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
Pointed big eyes.

487
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Yes.

488
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Maybe you could just draw the head.

489
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Do you like to draw?

490
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Yes.

491
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
OK, put the chair up a little bit.

492
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
These are what? What are you drawing here?

493
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
The eyes.

494
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
And I couldn't see his nose and his mouth,

495
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
but his nose was pretty small.

496
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
So the eyes were large, is that right?

497
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Did you look into the eyes?

498
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Did you have a sense that you were...?

499
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
No, all we saw was his eyes. They were black.

500
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Black, but, like, were they looking at you,

501
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,800
or were you looking at him?

502
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Seen that he was looking at all of us.

503
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,800
Have you ever seen a UFO?

504
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,800
I never have, no.

505
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
And I didn't see anything of me.

506
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
No nose, you didn't see a nose?

507
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
No.

508
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,800
I just, my heart kind of went faster and then slower

509
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,800
and then faster and then slower all at the same time.

510
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
Was that, that was excitement?

511
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Yeah, excitement and scariness.

512
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
And scary, and happy, you said happy too.

513
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Yeah.

514
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Happy because...?

515
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Because I saw something strange and something peculiar

516
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,800
and something nobody had ever seen.

517
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Hayley, something scared you, is that right?

518
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Yes.

519
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
What scared you?

520
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
The noise.

521
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,800
The noise that we heard in the air.

522
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
You heard a noise in the air?

523
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Yes.

524
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
What was it like, like a roar or a buzz or a hum

525
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
or what kind of a noise?

526
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
It was like someone was blowing a flute.

527
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
And that scared you?

528
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Yes.

529
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,800
And what did you do when you were afraid?

530
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,800
I ran away from it.

531
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,800
We told the teacher, but she said just forget about it.

532
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,800
So people who have these experiences are very serious about them.

533
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,800
I think that generally speaking when something powerful, important, exciting, scary has happened

534
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,800
that it's useful to talk about it, to have open discussion.

535
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,800
And it doesn't mean you have to impose a point of view.

536
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
But it's not about what we believe, it's what their experience is

537
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,800
and how they find the adults around them being receptive to that experience.

538
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,800
And you said that you saw two, what would you call them?

539
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Aliens.

540
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Aliens you call them.

541
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,800
And where were the aliens in relation to the craft?

542
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:34,800
I saw one over here and I saw one of these men by the spaceship.

543
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Looks like it was guarding by the big spaceship and there was another one running.

544
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Running in the grass.

545
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,800
And how did he run compared to the way a kid would run?

546
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,800
He ran normally like us, but bouncy as if a human would run on the moon.

547
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,800
You mean as if there were less gravity, seemed light?

548
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Yes, but not as much as a human on the moon.

549
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Not that extreme?

550
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,800
When he ran his distance he stopped and he looked at us for a while and then he ran back again.

551
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
The one thing I've told everybody is we are dealing with children here.

552
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Sometimes the imagination can get carried away with them.

553
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,800
How many of you still think they were just making it up?

554
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,800
The thing that caught me was that there were no adults outside.

555
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,800
None of us thought we just happened to be in a staff meeting.

556
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I totally believed the children.

557
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,800
They came running up here in such a panic and even if we had staged it

558
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
they could not have run all together like that.

559
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,800
We just heard them screaming, screaming, and they were here.

560
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,800
And a child can't make that up.

561
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,800
And children know when other children are conning them.

562
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,800
And they were like, about a hundred of them just came here.

563
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
They didn't see anything.

564
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,800
I think they made a belief story that they actually created.

565
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,800
What do you think started the story?

566
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Since during that time they talk about meteorites and all that.

567
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:09,800
I suppose somebody created the story and they sort of thought maybe

568
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
he had seen something.

569
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,800
You think that the children's imaginations are getting carried away with them.

570
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,800
But I became convinced when I saw the drawings,

571
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
because so many of the drawings were similar,

572
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,800
and also when they wrote their stories in their storybooks,

573
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
they definitely seemed genuine.

574
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Because they all wrote completely different stories,

575
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
but they had seen the same thing.

576
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
And I think that's what convinced me

577
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,800
because I think I was as skeptical as everybody else.

578
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
It wasn't just aerial school.

579
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
There were a lot of different occurrences that happened

580
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
over probably that whole week.

581
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,800
I live here at the school, so I try not to think about it at all.

582
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Because if I do, I have sleepless nights.

583
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Then you have sleepless nights.

584
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
I do.

585
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
I've had a lot of sleepless nights since it happened.

586
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
So I try to put it out of my mind.

587
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,800
What do you think about the reality aspect of it?

588
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Seeing is believing, I don't know.

589
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
And I'm also scared of the unknown.

590
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
So it's something that I block off

591
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
because I'd rather get on with school.

592
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Do you think the kids are telling the truth,

593
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
or do you think they're kind of...

594
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
I think they are.

595
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I'd rather not think about it again,

596
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
because now if I think about it tonight,

597
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
I'll have another sleepless night.

598
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Because I'm waiting for an alien to come through the walls.

599
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Some of the kids in my class are so frightened,

600
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
I actually can see that.

601
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,800
It must have affected them so much that they sort of imagine

602
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
something will happen to them.

603
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,800
They're still young and you don't know how to act

604
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
and how to speak to them.

605
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
You're a bit careful.

606
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
If we're going to keep discussing this,

607
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,800
the parent is going to be knocking on my door every single day.

608
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
I don't think you can generalise

609
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
when it comes to something like this.

610
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
You've got to be extremely careful

611
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
in which way the parent is going to jump.

612
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
If you're going to jump the wrong way,

613
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
you've caused a problem.

614
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
You've caused a problem.

615
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
You're not solving it.

616
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
You're probably all aware of this caution

617
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
that Colin is talking about.

618
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,800
We had one child who was very upset by the whole thing.

619
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Unfortunately, he's not at the school anymore.

620
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
He's actually gone back to Canada.

621
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
He was having sleepless nights

622
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
and this was a 12-, 13-year-old child.

623
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Basically, the cause of that was his parents refused

624
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
to discuss the situation with him.

625
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
His parents were very religious

626
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
and, according to them,

627
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
this sort of thing doesn't happen.

628
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Just down that road, yes.

629
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe I'm going to see Mrs Wacha.

630
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
And shit, her name suits her, too.

631
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Yes, it does. Mrs Wacha.

632
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Exactly.

633
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
I remember she was very strict.

634
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
She was very, very strict.

635
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Everything was done by her.

636
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
There we go.

637
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Judge Wacha.

638
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Oh, Mrs Wacha's coming.

639
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Mrs Wacha's coming out now.

640
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Oh, he's here.

641
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Do you remember?

642
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Yes, Mrs Wacha.

643
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Mrs Wacha.

644
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
I'm now old.

645
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
I'm now old, I know.

646
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
You don't see me to be old?

647
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
No.

648
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
I missed you.

649
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
I missed you.

650
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
You missed me?

651
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
I was a little bit difficult.

652
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Wasn't I?

653
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
No. You?

654
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Oh, you were...

655
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
you were strict.

656
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
You were strict.

657
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
That is exactly what I want to hear.

658
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Yes.

659
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
You were strict.

660
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
But you were fair, you know?

661
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
You were fair.

662
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I was very fair.

663
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Yes, strict.

664
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
And it was beautiful.

665
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
Beautiful.

666
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
There's this business of

667
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
us being

668
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
asked about the aliens

669
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
up to this end.

670
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Because you saw

671
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
those things, you saw those people.

672
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
We asked the

673
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
school children

674
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
then

675
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
to draw.

676
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
You remember?

677
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
You also drew.

678
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
So Mr

679
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Maki asked us

680
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
we put all the papers

681
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
according to the classes,

682
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
finished this class,

683
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
drew the other,

684
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
drew the other,

685
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
drew the other.

686
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
All the same.

687
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
We ended up

688
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
concluding that

689
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
certainly we saw

690
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
people.

691
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
They're going

692
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
where to?

693
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
How did they come there?

694
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Who are they?

695
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
The people.

696
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
We couldn't tell.

697
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
That's what the story is.

698
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
That's what you saw also.

699
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Yes.

700
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
I had kept those

701
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
papers myself.

702
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
You did?

703
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
I don't know what happened to them.

704
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
I'm looking for mine.

705
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
You can't find it.

706
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,800
I can't find mine.

707
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Because I had thought

708
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
it was something I must also

709
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
hold onto.

710
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
I didn't know

711
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
what that meant.

712
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
These eyes, did you look at them?

713
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Yes.

714
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
What feeling did that give you when you looked in the eyes?

715
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
It made me shake a little.

716
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
It was a terrifying feeling.

717
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,800
A terrifying feeling.

718
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
What made it terrifying?

719
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
How did he look at you?

720
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Like an old what?

721
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
An old woman who hasn't seen a kid before?

722
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
I'm going to ask you to do something.

723
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
Try to

724
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
just be in that feeling for a moment.

725
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
Try to remember that terrifying feeling.

726
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
Can you do that?

727
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
I know it's unpleasant but nothing bad will happen.

728
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
Just try to tell me

729
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
what's in the terror?

730
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,800
See what you find

731
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
in the terror.

732
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,800
What it might be about.

733
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,800
It was making me

734
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
all scared.

735
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
My heart was starting to pump faster

736
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
and it was making me all woozy.

737
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
Like woozy, losing.

738
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
Like you were going to faint?

739
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
Did you faint?

740
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
No.

741
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
Then I was looking at him, right?

742
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
Then he was looking at me back.

743
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
I had to stop and look inside you.

744
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
It kept on making me feel faint.

745
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
But you kept looking?

746
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800
Why did you keep looking?

747
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Something attracted me to look at you.

748
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
Something attracted you?

749
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,800
The other man, his eyes

750
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
looked at me as if I want to.

751
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Things like that.

752
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
I want to what?

753
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
I want you.

754
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Like I want you to come with me?

755
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
I want you to come with me.

756
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I want you to come.

757
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
Did you go with him, do you think?

758
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
No.

759
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
Only my eyes went with him.

760
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
And my feeling.

761
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
And your feeling went with him.

762
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
So was there a part of you that wanted to go with him?

763
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
That felt drawn to go with him?

764
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,800
Yes.

765
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,800
Can you say what that felt like?

766
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
It was scary and

767
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
a little excited.

768
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,800
And a little

769
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
I shouldn't go.

770
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,800
And yet I want to go.

771
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
Yes.

772
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
John Max seemed to have brought out that information.

773
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,800
Because we just took it

774
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,800
in a very analytical way.

775
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
We just said what did you see?

776
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
And what did the aliens look like?

777
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
What did they do?

778
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
But we never thought there might be

779
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,800
some kind of emotional

780
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
deep effect.

781
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
It really gave you goosebumps

782
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
if I may put it that way.

783
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
There's something more going on here

784
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
at the eye.

785
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
What made you scream?

786
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
I was just getting very

787
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
scared.

788
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
What were you scared would happen?

789
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
Don't be afraid to say

790
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
even if you think it's not

791
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
sensible.

792
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,800
Just tell me what you were afraid might happen.

793
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
I thought the aliens

794
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
would attack me.

795
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Would attack you and do what?

796
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
Hurt you? Yes.

797
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
How did you do that?

798
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
It looked evil

799
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
because it was just staring at me.

800
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
With what?

801
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
Staring at you as if what?

802
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,800
As if to do what?

803
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
As if I wanted

804
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,800
to come and take us.

805
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
I know this is hard.

806
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
I know it's hard.

807
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Try to...

808
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,800
It's hard to put in the words

809
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
what you felt, I'm sure.

810
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
John did this

811
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,800
public meeting

812
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
in Harare.

813
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
He did an incredible

814
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
performance.

815
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
He did an incredible performance.

816
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,800
He did an incredible performance.

817
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,800
He did an incredible performance.

818
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,800
He did an incredible

819
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,800
service to the community

820
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,800
who were worried

821
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
and just wanted answers.

822
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
Dr John Mack is a

823
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
true academic.

824
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,800
He's a professor of psychiatry

825
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,800
at Harvard University.

826
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
I think we're very, very lucky

827
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
in this country to have somebody of his caliber

828
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
so can we have a big hand

829
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,800
for Dr Mack?

830
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,800
I'm thrilled to be here tonight

831
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
and have a chance to talk with you about

832
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
this phenomenon.

833
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
I'm trained in adult and child psychiatry

834
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
and adult and child psychoanalysis

835
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,800
and

836
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,800
I'm a relative newcomer to the UFO

837
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
field

838
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,800
and the reason for this trip is

839
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
the incident that took place in

840
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,800
Rua at the Ariel

841
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
School.

842
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,800
A number of you, I'm sure, know something about

843
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
what took place there.

844
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,800
The children we talked with

845
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
clearly were talking about

846
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
a phenomenon that

847
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,800
occurred in physical

848
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
reality. The stories were consistent

849
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
and the way they talked about it

850
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,800
left virtually no

851
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
question in our minds

852
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,800
that what happened was

853
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,800
just about what they

854
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
said happened.

855
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,800
I know it was strange. It was very weird.

856
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
It got so scared.

857
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
If I had to describe that day

858
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
the first thing that I remember is

859
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
the light and the sound is the main thing that

860
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
just strikes me and then

861
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,800
the two shadows, but

862
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,800
especially the sound and the light.

863
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
The light because it was so bright, the sound because

864
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
it scared me.

865
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,800
Yeah, we heard a sound in that

866
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,800
direction. It was sort of like a

867
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
buzzing noise. It was a very, you

868
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,800
know, it was like a buzzing.

869
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,800
The buzzing of what you would hear

870
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
at an electric station or

871
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,800
anywhere close to that.

872
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,800
Like something's

873
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,800
being zapped almost.

874
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,800
It kind of sounded like bees but more like

875
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
a

876
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
yeah, like a machine

877
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,800
bee sound. Just very

878
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,800
strange. At first I thought maybe it was just

879
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
me that heard it but the other kids

880
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
around me had heard it. It sounded like it was coming from

881
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,800
everywhere. It went louder and louder

882
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
and then it stopped and we ignored it like, okay,

883
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
I don't know what that is. And then

884
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,800
a couple of minutes later it started again and it

885
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,800
was much, much louder, like

886
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
really, really loud, like a swarm of bees and that's

887
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
when I started getting scared and everybody started getting scared

888
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,800
and then we started running away

889
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,800
from there.

890
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
I noticed

891
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
that there was a large

892
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,800
shape amongst the trees which we

893
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
couldn't really figure out what it

894
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,800
was. It

895
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,800
looked like a big

896
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,800
rock. It looked

897
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
like water was trickling over

898
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,800
it and the sun was reflecting in

899
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,800
that water.

900
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
That's the best way I can describe it. It didn't

901
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,800
look like a

902
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,800
smooth metallic object as

903
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,800
you would think

904
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
when you were looking at a UFO on

905
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,800
TV as we depict them.

906
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,800
It looked natural. It didn't look

907
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,800
like anything manmade.

908
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
You saw it again

909
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,800
appearing in

910
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
kind of like in spots. You saw it and you didn't

911
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,800
see it, you know, and then you saw it again

912
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,800
in the same general area, but

913
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,800
it was, that kind of was

914
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,800
like I said, what made you think

915
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,800
twice, like, okay, did I see it? Didn't I

916
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,800
see it? But when everyone, you know, then

917
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,800
everyone else started saying, yes, I see it. And it

918
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,800
was the same thing when we

919
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
saw whatever beings were

920
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
there, you know, it wasn't like

921
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
they were just standing and looking at you.

922
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,800
You would see them in

923
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,800
various places

924
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,800
at various times, so

925
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
you didn't know if it was one, if it was more than one.

926
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
He moved kind of strangely,

927
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
I'd say.

928
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Almost like a

929
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
very graceful sort of moment.

930
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
You know, not like you're

931
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
stumbling around or anything. You don't like sort of

932
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,800
like glided

933
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
while he was walking.

934
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
There wasn't any gravitational

935
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
pull. It was a very fluid.

936
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
So when he

937
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
was moving, it was very

938
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
fluid and flowy and

939
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,800
it wasn't kind of jerky or

940
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,800
slow.

941
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
The strange thing was

942
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
it was running in slow motion.

943
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
As if you would watch a replay

944
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,800
in a football match, it was running

945
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
in slow motion diagonally

946
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
down the field.

947
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
And then suddenly it would reappear in the corner

948
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,800
where it started and do the same

949
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
thing. And then it would reappear

950
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
and do the same thing.

951
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
And that was

952
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
frightening. More frightening

953
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
than seeing what these

954
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
things actually were was

955
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
not being able to see them long enough, I guess.

956
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
It

957
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
really ripped

958
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
my socks off.

959
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
It was unbelievable.

960
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
I've got to justify myself

961
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
to the BBC and

962
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
how am I going to explain to

963
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
a serious BBC editor

964
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
in London that this is not

965
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
an April Fools joke in September?

966
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
The BBC always have

967
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
this policy that you don't

968
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
run with one source.

969
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
You've got to get two or three, preferably

970
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
three. And I had

971
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
twenty, thirty, forty.

972
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
Now, I put a

973
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
lot of stake on the physical evidence

974
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
but I don't

975
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
primarily

976
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
emphasise that, not because I don't think

977
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
it's critically important. I think the physical evidence

978
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
is very valuable.

979
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,800
But for me, my strongest

980
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
institute is my

981
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
clinical investigative

982
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
approach to create trust,

983
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
to bring forth

984
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
whatever it is, and the memories

985
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
and experiences come flooding back.

986
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,800
Now, the fact

987
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
is that people aren't threatened when

988
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,800
they come forward about this.

989
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Children, very reluctant

990
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
to tell their parents. And a mother

991
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,800
or father may say to a child,

992
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,800
oh, you must have been making it up.

993
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
Your imagination is too

994
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
lively. And then the child sort of

995
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
grumbles and they go inside and they do

996
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
what I call going underground.

997
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
They know

998
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
what happened to them, but they don't

999
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
tell anybody.

1000
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
I mean, you just felt nobody really

1001
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
cared.

1002
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
Who do you talk to?

1003
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800
How do you understand it?

1004
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,800
The people in my life that were supposed to

1005
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,800
be the closest and

1006
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
the support system.

1007
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
It didn't feel like

1008
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
it was there.

1009
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
There was nobody there to say, now it's okay

1010
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,800
to talk about it. So we never did.

1011
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
And as children, you have a huge imagination.

1012
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
So you see those sort of things and not know

1013
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
what they are. And you're left with

1014
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
this, well, where am I?

1015
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,800
Limbo state of, am

1016
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,800
I safe or am I not safe? So it

1017
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,800
was, I think, as a protective mechanism,

1018
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,800
block it out, turn it

1019
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
off, don't go back to it.

1020
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
I haven't really

1021
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
talked to anyone about it.

1022
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
I usually kept it quiet.

1023
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,800
Because most people probably

1024
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
think I'm

1025
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
nuts.

1026
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,800
You're not exactly going to bring up

1027
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
this kind of conversation at a

1028
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
bar or a restaurant

1029
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
or, you know,

1030
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
people think you're crazy.

1031
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
It's very hard. It's kind of strange, I guess, because they don't believe you.

1032
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
Some of my close friends

1033
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
know about it, but it's more like

1034
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,800
not a joke, but they're like, oh, you crazy type of thing, like

1035
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,800
laughter type of like, it's something funny to

1036
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,800
something to laugh about.

1037
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,800
If this had been ten years ago,

1038
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
I wasn't in a place where I really wanted to talk about it.

1039
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,800
I just didn't want to be associated

1040
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,800
with that. It's very self-conscious.

1041
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,800
Yeah, it's kind of hard to talk about it.

1042
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
It is.

1043
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,800
Because it's not something that I bring

1044
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
up to anybody.

1045
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
Ever.

1046
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,800
My husband

1047
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,800
doesn't even know about it.

1048
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,800
...

1049
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,800
...

1050
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,800
...

1051
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,800
...

1052
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,800
...

1053
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,800
...

1054
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,800
True expression of how

1055
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,800
it felt at times.

1056
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,800
It's really, really difficult to face yourself.

1057
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,800
That's a scary time.

1058
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,800
Very, very scary time.

1059
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,800
A lot of this was done in black

1060
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,800
at first, because I think that's how

1061
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,800
it's really feeling.

1062
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,800
This is

1063
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,800
me, with my hands

1064
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,800
over my eyes, trying to

1065
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,800
hide away from

1066
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,800
everything that's been going on.

1067
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,800
It got really,

1068
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,800
really dark.

1069
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,800
I love this piece.

1070
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,800
That's why I started

1071
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800
using color. It's still a stern

1072
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,800
face, but

1073
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,800
I think it's more confident.

1074
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
Yeah, this one.

1075
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,800
So, here.

1076
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,800
This is the

1077
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,800
mouth being zipped up.

1078
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,800
This was like

1079
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
when all you want to do

1080
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,800
is just talk.

1081
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,800
And you feel like you have no one to talk to.

1082
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,800
I didn't realize that I affected

1083
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,800
children that much.

1084
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,800
But it obviously has.

1085
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,800
It was quite difficult, wasn't it?

1086
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,800
My mum and dad would not have believed.

1087
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,800
They believed that something had occurred,

1088
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,800
but it was very difficult to integrate.

1089
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
It's very difficult to put your religion

1090
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,800
and see the Christian side of it

1091
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,800
with that happening.

1092
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,800
Sorry, Mr. Satoli. Yes, come in.

1093
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,800
Hi. How are we doing?

1094
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,800
How are you? Yes.

1095
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,800
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

1096
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,800
It's good to see you too.

1097
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,800
Absolutely.

1098
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,800
Connecting and

1099
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,800
seeing the school again.

1100
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,800
The event that occurred here

1101
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,800
in 1994.

1102
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
That's what I'm here for.

1103
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,800
That's wonderful.

1104
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,800
Maybe, if you want more,

1105
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,800
if you don't mind,

1106
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
we can do the tradition thing. Do you mind?

1107
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,800
I would love to do that.

1108
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,800
Because culture is a huge part of this.

1109
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,800
I'll walk you out and then you can

1110
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,800
visit all these sacred places

1111
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,800
and you can talk to them.

1112
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,800
So when you go up there, you're like...

1113
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,800
Yes!

1114
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,800
Good to see you, isn't it? Good to see you too.

1115
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,800
Later. Miss Pitts? Thanks, Mr. Satoli.

1116
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
You're welcome.

1117
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,800
I saw these beings

1118
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,800
and they have

1119
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,800
black eyes.

1120
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,800
We got those ones and we

1121
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,800
experienced them.

1122
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,800
Quite a lot. A lot? Yeah.

1123
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,800
And is it the same description

1124
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,800
as how I describe it with

1125
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,800
that? Yes.

1126
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,800
They come in different versions.

1127
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,800
They come in different versions.

1128
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,800
I don't know what you've heard.

1129
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,800
We just heard that the aliens

1130
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,800
came and they landed

1131
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,800
at Ariel.

1132
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,800
What you are seeing

1133
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,800
and what you are experiencing

1134
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,800
is, I can

1135
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,800
conclude that

1136
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,800
they are spiritual messages

1137
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,800
that you have to

1138
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,800
deliver to them.

1139
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,800
That they are

1140
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,800
spiritual messages.

1141
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,800
That they are

1142
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
spiritual messages that you have to

1143
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
deliver.

1144
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,800
I'm supposed to talk about this

1145
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,800
with...

1146
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,800
You don't have to keep it

1147
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,800
for yourself. Yes.

1148
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,800
You have to share it.

1149
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,800
By sharing

1150
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,800
then you can be able to change

1151
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,800
people's hearts and minds.

1152
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,800
So you have to speak

1153
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,800
out.

1154
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,800
If they don't hear

1155
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,800
speaking, maybe you have to shout.

1156
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,800
You have to shout.

1157
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,800
The significance

1158
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,800
of children is that they are not

1159
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,800
yet exposed to the world

1160
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,800
and they communicate

1161
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,800
better with the spirits

1162
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,800
and the nature. So

1163
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,800
it's always good to have children.

1164
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,800
If you want a message to be delivered

1165
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,800
it has to be delivered to children

1166
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
because the child grows

1167
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,800
with the message.

1168
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,800
We are now going to

1169
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,800
the burial sites of the chiefs.

1170
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
This is the grave

1171
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,800
of the royal chief.

1172
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,800
The Arios landed on the

1173
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,800
center of the grave.

1174
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,800
The sacred shrine.

1175
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,800
Yes. So it's very important.

1176
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,800
It's very important. The Arios landed on

1177
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,800
the center of the sacred shrine.

1178
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,800
Which means they were entangled

1179
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,800
by the chief's graves.

1180
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,800
The grand sisters of Zimbabwe.

1181
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,800
The ministerial

1182
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,800
abbeys have been here for decades.

1183
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,800
Did you hear about it?

1184
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,800
Yes.

1185
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,800
I was quite informed.

1186
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,800
Can you point to us where the

1187
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,800
Arios school is from here?

1188
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,800
This is Arios school.

1189
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,800
This is where it happened.

1190
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,800
This is where they landed.

1191
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,800
Oh my gosh.

1192
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,800
Had you had those thoughts before this

1193
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,800
experience? No.

1194
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,800
How did those thoughts

1195
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,800
come to you?

1196
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,800
Did they come to you from

1197
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,800
the craft or from?

1198
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,800
From the man.

1199
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,800
And the man

1200
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,800
did the man say those things to you?

1201
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,800
How did he get that

1202
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,800
across to you?

1203
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,800
Well, he never said anything.

1204
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,800
It's just that the face

1205
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,800
is the eyes.

1206
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,800
What do you imagine

1207
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,800
is his reason for visiting Earth?

1208
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,800
I think it's about something

1209
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,800
that's going to happen.

1210
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,800
Like what?

1211
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,800
Pollution or something.

1212
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,800
Pollution? Yes.

1213
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,800
And how did he get that idea of

1214
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,800
pollution across to you?

1215
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,800
The way he was staring.

1216
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,800
The way he was staring? Yes.

1217
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,800
Somehow there was a message about

1218
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,800
pollution from the way he was staring?

1219
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,800
Yes. I think they want

1220
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,800
people

1221
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,800
to know

1222
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,800
that we're actually

1223
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,800
making harm on this world

1224
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,800
and we mustn't get too

1225
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,800
technology. How did that get

1226
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,800
communicated to you? I don't know.

1227
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,800
But somehow it did? Yeah.

1228
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,800
It came through my head. Through your head?

1229
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,800
Did it, like

1230
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,800
through words? My conscience I think.

1231
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,800
Your what? My conscience.

1232
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,800
It came through your, your conscience told you?

1233
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,800
Yeah. I mean while you were

1234
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,800
in contact with the being you mean?

1235
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,800
While the thing was looking at me.

1236
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,800
While it was looking at you.

1237
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,800
It was like this lake of calmness

1238
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,800
in his eyes. I was

1239
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,800
compelled to look at him. It wasn't like

1240
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,800
I wanted to look away

1241
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,800
from him. Time became

1242
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,800
very

1243
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,800
still and very bizarre.

1244
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,800
In my mind, technology

1245
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,800
and not, not good

1246
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,800
feelings about technology either. It was like

1247
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,800
technology was a bad,

1248
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,800
dirty word. I think that he

1249
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,800
was saying to me, beware of the technology.

1250
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,800
Don't go into it too heavy

1251
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,800
because it's not going to be good for you.

1252
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,800
It was only when I was

1253
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,800
looking at him and his face and his

1254
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,800
eyes that I got that.

1255
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,800
As soon as I looked away from him, that's

1256
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,800
when all of reality and

1257
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,800
everything that was happening came back to.

1258
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,800
And that's when I realised that

1259
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,800
something really strange

1260
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,800
is happening here.

1261
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,800
It was fascinating.

1262
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,800
This was imagery

1263
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,800
coming through for them

1264
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,800
communicating, but it's

1265
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,800
done through right in your brain.

1266
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,800
You were saying that

1267
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,800
you thought that maybe they were trying to tell us

1268
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,800
something about the future.

1269
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,800
Can you say more what your thought is

1270
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,800
or what was it like?

1271
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,800
It was like in the world, all the trees

1272
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,800
would just go down

1273
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,800
and there

1274
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,800
would be no air and people would be dying.

1275
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,800
I think that

1276
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,800
in space there's no love

1277
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,800
and down here there is.

1278
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,800
There is love? Yes.

1279
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,800
Is there anything we can do with that love

1280
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,800
as far as taking care of the Earth?

1281
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,800
You talked about

1282
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,800
the message that we don't

1283
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,800
take care of the Earth.

1284
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,800
No. Why not?

1285
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,800
Several of them talked about

1286
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,800
a message being transmitted

1287
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,800
through the eyes, that the beings were

1288
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,800
trying to tell us something.

1289
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,800
What gave that a certain edge of

1290
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,800
sincerity was they weren't offering

1291
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,800
solutions, like we've got to become environmentally

1292
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,800
conscious and do something about the Earth.

1293
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,800
I'd say, well, what are we supposed to do?

1294
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,800
And they would say, well, no, that's not

1295
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,800
what they were conveying.

1296
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,800
They were simply telling us that this is

1297
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,800
what's going on and they felt very upset

1298
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,800
about it, but it wasn't like

1299
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,800
an ecological

1300
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,800
political program or something.

1301
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,800
So that gave it a kind of authenticity.

1302
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,800
But first,

1303
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,800
no news coverage took it seriously.

1304
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,800
And I leave you to check for

1305
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,800
little green men and flying saucers.

1306
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,800
And then when Reuters got hold of it,

1307
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,800
it got very serious.

1308
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,800
There was a bit of a buzz and it was all in the news

1309
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,800
and everything. You had people that knew

1310
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,800
about the school from all over.

1311
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,800
Not just in Zimbabwe,

1312
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,800
but it was all over the world.

1313
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,800
Ariel School

1314
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,800
in Roua,

1315
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,800
on the other side of the world,

1316
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,800
an unusual visitor called it

1317
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,800
to a Zimbabwean playground.

1318
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,800
Unexplained mysteries.

1319
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,800
Something major has happened in Africa.

1320
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,800
A unique mass encounter

1321
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,800
between aliens and school children.

1322
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,800
Hello, welcome back. Someone who started off

1323
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,800
as a skeptic, a Pulitzer Prize winner

1324
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,800
and all the rest of it, have actually been convinced

1325
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,800
that the people you interviewed at great length

1326
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,800
and talked to you about their encounters with aliens,

1327
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,800
that they were actually telling the truth.

1328
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,800
There is something out there.

1329
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,800
There's some kind of authentic mystery here

1330
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,800
which my training in psychiatry

1331
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,800
just hasn't prepared me for.

1332
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,800
With all the skill that you have, you're a top American psychiatrist

1333
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,800
at Harvard, you would be able to tell

1334
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,800
when people were telling fibs.

1335
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,800
That's what I'm supposed to be trained to do,

1336
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,800
is to distinguish between fantasy, dream,

1337
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,800
psychosis or authentic experience.

1338
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,800
And this has all the marks

1339
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,800
of authentic experience.

1340
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,800
We just stared at it and we heard this flute,

1341
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,800
sort of like a flute noise.

1342
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,800
Then I saw this

1343
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,800
black figure running in slow motion

1344
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,800
and then I didn't want to see it

1345
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,800
so I looked away and I looked again

1346
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,800
and I wasn't there anymore.

1347
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,800
When you looked at those children,

1348
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,800
they were absolutely credible.

1349
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,800
And you can look at their faces,

1350
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,800
even on television you can look at their faces

1351
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,800
and know if they're bullshitting or not.

1352
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,800
And they weren't.

1353
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,800
We came away convinced

1354
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,800
that an extraordinary event occurred here,

1355
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,800
one of quite unique,

1356
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,800
I think, in UFO history.

1357
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,800
If there's anything that could

1358
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,800
convince a skeptical,

1359
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,800
closed-minded public

1360
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,800
that some kind of intelligence

1361
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,800
that is not, as the headmaster said,

1362
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,800
of this world, then this event

1363
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,800
should persuade people.

1364
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,800
And I believe

1365
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,800
overall, this is a phenomenon

1366
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,800
of enormous complexity,

1367
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,800
meaning, and value for understanding

1368
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,800
of ourselves, who we are,

1369
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,800
in the universe, and we're just beginning

1370
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,800
to grasp what this is about.

1371
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,800
Meet Dr. John Mack,

1372
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,800
a believer

1373
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,800
in aliens from outer space.

1374
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,800
What would the academics up at Harvard University

1375
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,800
think about all of this?

1376
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,800
We started to hear

1377
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,800
that John was getting to be in trouble.

1378
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,800
His practice was beginning to be

1379
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,800
largely about the investigation

1380
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,800
of these strange phenomena.

1381
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
He had started support groups

1382
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,800
so that the various people

1383
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,800
who had reported

1384
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,800
these strange phenomena

1385
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,800
could hear the stories

1386
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,800
from each other and begin

1387
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,800
to feel a little bit normal.

1388
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,800
No matter how I looked at it,

1389
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,800
they were talking the way people

1390
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,800
talk about something that's

1391
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,800
happened to them.

1392
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,800
I was stuck with this dilemma.

1393
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,800
What do you do at that point?

1394
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,800
Do you say, well, I'm sorry,

1395
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,800
there's got to be some kind of mental illness

1396
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,800
I never heard of before?

1397
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,800
Or do you say, maybe what I thought was possible

1398
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,800
wasn't complete?

1399
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,800
I've been humanly more honest

1400
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,800
to say,

1401
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,800
there's something I don't know here

1402
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,800
and to follow your clinical instincts.

1403
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
What did you say?

1404
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,800
What did you tell your mom?

1405
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,800
This is Kaylee talking now.

1406
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,800
Go ahead.

1407
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,800
I said, mommy, I saw an alien at school

1408
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,800
and then my mom said

1409
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,800
my mom never believed me.

1410
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,800
Yeah?

1411
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,800
Did it upset you when your mom didn't believe you?

1412
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,800
Yeah, sometimes.

1413
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,800
Kaylee!

1414
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,800
Hi!

1415
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,800
How are you?

1416
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,800
It's so nice to see you.

1417
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,800
How does it feel?

1418
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,800
It's crazy.

1419
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,800
Do you want to take a little walk?

1420
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,800
I know, we have to look.

1421
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,800
Let's look.

1422
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,800
I was trying to find mine

1423
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,800
and I've been looking to find all my pieces

1424
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,800
because I don't have my drawings as well.

1425
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,800
See, like these ones you can't see.

1426
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,800
I know, that's why I'm like...

1427
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,800
Right?

1428
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,800
It's not here.

1429
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,800
Well, we could keep going.

1430
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,800
Tell me what you remember.

1431
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,800
See, I was playing rugby over here

1432
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,800
in this open part over here

1433
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,800
with the little boys.

1434
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,800
Yeah.

1435
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,800
And then all the logs were down there.

1436
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,800
We're all here.

1437
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,800
And then, I don't know why

1438
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,800
I remember a huge tree like this down there.

1439
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,800
Because that field wasn't there.

1440
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,800
This is where I kind of...

1441
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,800
Yeah.

1442
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,800
...remember it happening.

1443
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,800
Like standing over there

1444
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,800
and then ran.

1445
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,800
I must have run there closer to...

1446
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,800
I remember being close to the tuck shop.

1447
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,800
Well, that's what I remember right here.

1448
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,800
And I remember Liesel and I right there.

1449
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,800
So it must be there.

1450
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,800
Yeah.

1451
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,800
And...

1452
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,800
Yeah.

1453
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,800
Yes.

1454
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,800
Miss Bates found some of the drawings.

1455
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
Miss Bates found some of the drawings?

1456
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,800
And an envelope on her desk.

1457
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,800
Up in the office there.

1458
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,800
But I think it's been such a run around

1459
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,800
this morning.

1460
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,800
They tried to do things.

1461
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,800
So they just let us know they're there.

1462
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,800
Oh, how exciting.

1463
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,800
I hope mine's there.

1464
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,800
I really hope mine's there too.

1465
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,800
They both there. I haven't opened anything.

1466
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,800
I haven't looked.

1467
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,800
Oh, my gosh.

1468
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,800
You must be kidding me.

1469
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,800
I'm scared.

1470
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,800
I'm kind of scared too.

1471
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,800
Okay, you open it with me.

1472
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,800
We're together.

1473
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,800
We're here together.

1474
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,800
Let's take a peek.

1475
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,800
Oh, my gosh.

1476
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,800
Oh, my gosh.

1477
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,800
I can't see it very nice, but I'm sure

1478
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,800
this

1479
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,800
was a tree.

1480
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,800
I've drawn this again.

1481
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,800
Exactly.

1482
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,800
Like this.

1483
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,800
You see, it's still shining

1484
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,800
as well.

1485
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,800
I saw like a crazy light.

1486
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
Oh, my gosh.

1487
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,800
With this

1488
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,800
coming down.

1489
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
I

1490
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,800
think I blocked out a lot,

1491
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,800
man.

1492
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,800
You remember, like we keep saying, like

1493
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,800
I think we blocked out a lot.

1494
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,800
Yeah.

1495
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,800
Holy

1496
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
shit.

1497
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,800
Wow.

1498
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
I know. I think a lot of people

1499
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,800
didn't believe us.

1500
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,800
It's

1501
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,800
beautiful.

1502
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,800
It's

1503
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,800
so peaceful.

1504
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,800
I have the best memories

1505
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,800
here. Me too.

1506
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,800
With us.

1507
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,800
I've been so terrible.

1508
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,800
Well, Miss Bates, she wants

1509
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,800
to see you.

1510
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,800
She's a little hurt because she feels

1511
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,800
like the students have avoided this place

1512
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,800
for such a long time. Well, you see, that's

1513
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,800
the thing is like. I know. What

1514
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,800
happened. I know.

1515
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,800
I think that's why I've never come

1516
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,800
back. I didn't want to deal with

1517
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,800
coming here and remembering

1518
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,800
all the stuff. I think that's

1519
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,800
the honest God's truth that why I didn't come.

1520
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,800
Yeah.

1521
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,800
So 20 years later.

1522
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,800
We still have the same

1523
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,800
story.

1524
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,800
But that's the funny thing is like I'm adamant about

1525
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,800
this tree and the

1526
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,800
right and there on my picture, which I don't

1527
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,800
even remember drawing.

1528
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,800
It's there.

1529
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
And I drew that.

1530
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,800
I can't wait to show my mom.

1531
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,800
You have to see it to believe it.

1532
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,800
If somebody's a staunch believer that it's not,

1533
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,800
how's me

1534
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,800
telling them my experience

1535
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,800
going to change what they think. It will change

1536
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,800
what they think about me. It's not going to change

1537
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,800
what they think about the universe. And I don't

1538
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,800
like that. But

1539
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,800
with 60 of us all saying

1540
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
it together, that will change

1541
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,800
what that one person thinks of the universe.

1542
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,800
Many of you are going to

1543
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,800
think my guests today have lost

1544
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
their minds. To be honest,

1545
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,800
their stories do sound

1546
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,800
really crazy. But

1547
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,800
we were intrigued by this man.

1548
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,800
He is Dr. John Mack, who does

1549
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,800
believe their stories.

1550
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,800
The president's lawyer said

1551
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,800
what do you think it's like for the dean of the medical

1552
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,800
school to see

1553
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,800
one of his professors on Oprah Winfrey

1554
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,800
saying that men, women and children are

1555
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,800
being taken by little green men.

1556
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,800
It does reflect

1557
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,800
I think the

1558
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,800
anxiety that this caused.

1559
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,800
Well, doctor, is the profession embarrassed

1560
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,800
when one of your colleagues puts forward theories

1561
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,800
like this? Oh, yes, we're very

1562
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,800
embarrassed and embarrassed for the profession

1563
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,800
and a little worried about John

1564
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
himself. What has gone off the rails

1565
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
a bit? Well, John is a man

1566
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,800
of great gift and great

1567
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,800
intelligence, but he's also a man of

1568
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,800
who tends to take on enthusiasms

1569
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,800
and this time he's gone

1570
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,800
too far.

1571
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,800
We're worried about him. We hope he'll

1572
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,800
pull himself together

1573
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,800
and come back.

1574
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,800
I sensed

1575
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,800
that I ought to try to get ahead

1576
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,800
of the curl on the high exposure

1577
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,800
that I had, but I was too late.

1578
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,800
There was

1579
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,800
something afoot.

1580
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,800
They were putting together a committee

1581
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,800
to look into

1582
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
the work and see if I had

1583
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,800
maintained the standards of

1584
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,800
the Harvard Medical School.

1585
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,800
I am

1586
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,800
Arnold Relman. I am

1587
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,800
a physician.

1588
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,800
I was asked by the dean of the Harvard Medical

1589
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,800
School to look into John's

1590
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,800
activities in view of

1591
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,800
all the publicity and the fact that

1592
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,800
John was using the Harvard Medical

1593
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,800
School's name quite liberally

1594
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,800
and applied that the Harvard Medical School

1595
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,800
was somehow sponsoring what he was doing.

1596
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,800
The dean wanted to know

1597
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,800
what is he doing?

1598
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,800
His research is shattering preconceptions

1599
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,800
about alien abductions.

1600
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,800
He's studied over 100 people

1601
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,800
and is convinced they are telling the truth.

1602
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,800
John, you have a very high profile

1603
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,800
and the fact that you're a professor at Harvard

1604
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,800
tends to make people believe you. Do you think

1605
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,800
you could be seriously misleading people about what's going on here?

1606
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,800
The concern

1607
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,800
is what

1608
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,800
is his relationship to

1609
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,800
the subjects? Is their

1610
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,800
psychological welfare

1611
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,800
being protected?

1612
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,800
And is this

1613
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,800
a violation of

1614
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,800
medical standards?

1615
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,800
Woo!

1616
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,800
I miss this place so much

1617
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,800
and, you know,

1618
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,800
just after talking to Mrs. Watcher

1619
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,800
and, you know,

1620
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,800
the kids and the school

1621
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,800
and the music.

1622
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,800
I'm like, what's going on?

1623
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,800
It's a horrible feeling

1624
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,800
to feel alone.

1625
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,800
Come on, you've got us now.

1626
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,800
You've got the whole Ariel family.

1627
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,800
Like, everybody's there.

1628
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,800
Like, look out for you.

1629
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
Trace and...

1630
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,800
Everybody's there for you.

1631
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,800
Everybody's looking out for you.

1632
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,800
God, I needed that, you know?

1633
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,800
So badly.

1634
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,800
They forget that there's a human being

1635
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,800
behind all of this

1636
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,800
and nobody asks

1637
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,800
for it to happen.

1638
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,800
Music

1639
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,800
There's Liesl.

1640
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,800
Liesl fungi.

1641
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,800
Graham.

1642
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,800
I remember her too.

1643
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,800
I remember the face

1644
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,800
but I can't remember the name.

1645
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,800
There are many people

1646
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,800
who probably are not going to believe

1647
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,800
certain things until they happen to them.

1648
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,800
Period.

1649
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
That probably is

1650
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,800
even more pronounced in the West

1651
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,800
compared to many other cultures

1652
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,800
because we have

1653
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,800
advanced so far technologically

1654
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,800
because our technology

1655
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,800
which is based in science

1656
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,800
is so dramatically powerful

1657
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,800
that people start thinking

1658
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,800
that must be all there is.

1659
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,800
A lot of the criticism

1660
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,800
about John and John's work

1661
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,800
presupposed

1662
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
that it was simply

1663
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,800
impossible that people

1664
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
could be visited by aliens,

1665
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,800
that aliens even exist.

1666
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,800
To reduce knowledge of reality

1667
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,800
to purely the physical world.

1668
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,800
What about the

1669
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,800
whole emotional world,

1670
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,800
the spiritual world?

1671
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,800
When you go into subatomic reality

1672
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,800
there is no material world.

1673
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,800
There's only possibility and probability.

1674
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
The new findings in physics,

1675
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,800
if you take them seriously,

1676
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,800
are just as undermining of the dominant worldview

1677
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,800
as anything I'm talking about.

1678
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,800
Baloney.

1679
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,800
Old-fashioned physics, new-fashioned physics,

1680
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,800
quantum mechanics, string theory,

1681
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,800
you gotta have evidence,

1682
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,800
you have to be able to measure something.

1683
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,800
I am morally

1684
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,800
and virtually certain

1685
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,800
that what we're dealing with

1686
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,800
is some kind of

1687
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,800
internal psychological phenomenon.

1688
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,800
It is inconceivable to me

1689
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,800
that these people

1690
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,800
are being abducted by aliens.

1691
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,800
If they were, then the whole

1692
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,800
world as we know it

1693
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,800
is upside down.

1694
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
Harvard University was

1695
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,800
the kind of global champion

1696
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,800
of the classical liberal

1697
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,800
worldview.

1698
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,800
And he was trying to propose

1699
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,800
an alternative worldview

1700
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,800
with the reality of extraterrestrial

1701
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,800
intelligence.

1702
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,800
A worldview

1703
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,800
is a kind of psychic glue.

1704
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,800
It sort of orients you.

1705
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,800
It's what allows people to think

1706
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,800
they know who they are

1707
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,800
in the worlds that matter to us.

1708
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,800
Family groups that we're in,

1709
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,800
institutions, schools.

1710
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,800
What's possible is

1711
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
a matter of worldview.

1712
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,800
A culture decides what's real.

1713
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,800
What's real in this culture is completely different

1714
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,800
than what's true in other cultures.

1715
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,800
I really think

1716
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,800
human egoism in the broadest sense

1717
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,800
is what is at stake.

1718
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,800
Our sense of value,

1719
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,800
our sense of who we are.

1720
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,800
Are we powerful? Are we

1721
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,800
in charge of our own fate?

1722
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,800
Freud said there's three big blows to human

1723
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,800
egoism.

1724
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,800
And the first was the

1725
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,800
discovery by Copernicus

1726
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,800
and Galileo that the

1727
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
Earth was not at the center

1728
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,800
of the cosmos. Second was

1729
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,800
Darwin's finding that we're

1730
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,800
not particularly different from

1731
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,800
the other animal species.

1732
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,800
Freud claimed his was a third, that

1733
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,800
we're not really in charge of our own

1734
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,800
individual lives. And this

1735
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,800
I think could be a fourth.

1736
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,800
We're far from being the most intelligent

1737
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
or advanced

1738
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,800
creatures in the cosmos.

1739
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,800
I think in the broad

1740
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,800
scheme of things,

1741
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,800
it's not a socially good

1742
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,800
thing to do. It promotes

1743
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,800
the cult of mysticism

1744
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,800
and magic

1745
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,800
and superstition.

1746
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,800
You know, the ex-file kind of mentality.

1747
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,800
They're out there and the government

1748
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,800
won't let us find out

1749
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,800
about it.

1750
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,800
It's childish. And it's

1751
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,800
not good for the American public.

1752
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,800
Why should this be so remarkable

1753
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,800
when we claim to believe

1754
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,800
in God and all kinds of spirits

1755
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,800
and yet there's something about this

1756
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,800
one which takes a form that

1757
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,800
is particularly disturbing to us?

1758
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,800
There's a lot of perumphing

1759
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,800
that goes on. Well, we don't

1760
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,800
really want to be identified

1761
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,800
with this kind of science. It's okay

1762
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,800
to be identified with other

1763
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
bizarre views that

1764
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,800
might emanate, but

1765
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,800
we have our limits too.

1766
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,800
Remember, we're a university that has a divinity

1767
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,800
school. We know

1768
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,800
the boundaries. Theology

1769
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,800
is okay, but extraterrestrials

1770
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,800
no. Angels, yes.

1771
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,800
Extraterrestrials, no.

1772
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,800
Let's just sit

1773
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,800
down and rationally

1774
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,800
objectively talk it through

1775
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,800
because there's a lot we don't

1776
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,800
understand. There's

1777
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,800
a lot we worship in our

1778
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,800
various religions

1779
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,800
that's meaningful and

1780
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,800
inexplicable.

1781
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,800
You can't just rule

1782
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,800
stuff out willy-nilly because there

1783
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,800
is a magical

1784
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,800
side of life that is very

1785
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,800
precious.

1786
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,800
I'm a Christian

1787
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,800
in my beliefs, but

1788
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,800
that doesn't mean to say that I think

1789
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,800
there's no other types of

1790
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,800
forms of life that exist in the universe.

1791
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,800
There is a God,

1792
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,800
but there's also

1793
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,800
other things around

1794
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,800
that can't be explained,

1795
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,800
you know.

1796
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,800
It's another

1797
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,800
creature.

1798
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,800
They teach you there's no such thing as

1799
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,800
aliens because, I mean, God created just

1800
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,800
human beings. That's what I was taught to, that's what

1801
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,800
I grew up thinking.

1802
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,800
The universe is so big so I can't

1803
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,800
completely say it's a fact that there's no such

1804
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,800
thing as life outside of

1805
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,800
Earth's solar system.

1806
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,800
The universe is a beautiful, strange place and we're just human

1807
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,800
beings and we can't

1808
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,800
know everything.

1809
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,800
Maybe we don't have the capacity

1810
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,800
to understand it.

1811
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,800
We may be just exploring

1812
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,800
the limited

1813
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,800
reaches of space.

1814
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,800
Beyond that, we

1815
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,800
absolutely know nothing in terms

1816
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,800
of life or how life

1817
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,800
exists elsewhere.

1818
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,800
Maybe

1819
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,800
it's too disturbing.

1820
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,800
In the beginning of

1821
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,800
my going public with this,

1822
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,800
I received absolutely

1823
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,800
no general acceptance.

1824
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,800
There were no particular

1825
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,800
advantages to be gained and every

1826
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,800
disadvantage. There were assaults

1827
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,800
from every direction in

1828
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,800
terms of the main part of my profession.

1829
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,800
If it was an opportunity, it was an opportunity

1830
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,800
to commit professional suicide.

1831
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,800
It's a dirty subject.

1832
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,800
If you want to sustain a career in

1833
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,800
the BBC after having been in

1834
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,800
many war zones, you don't

1835
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,800
suddenly come up with a UFO

1836
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,800
story, which was

1837
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,800
absolutely waterproof.

1838
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,800
Then they just said,

1839
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,800
Tim's suffering from the

1840
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,800
stress and strains of all the war zones

1841
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,800
he's done. He's lost the plot.

1842
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,800
He's gone bonkers.

1843
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,800
I think that's what my career

1844
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,800
with the BBC

1845
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,800
end.

1846
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,800
Gone.

1847
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,800
I think I

1848
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,800
lost my credibility

1849
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,800
because you don't talk about

1850
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,800
these things.

1851
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,800
When I was in residency,

1852
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,800
John's office was on the

1853
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,800
main floor of the

1854
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,800
psychiatric wing.

1855
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,800
When I came back in 2004,

1856
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,800
his office was off-site

1857
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,800
and I actually took that

1858
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,800
as a sort of metaphor for him being

1859
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,800
pushed out and extruded

1860
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,800
in a certain sense.

1861
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,800
Finally, the dean

1862
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,800
of the medical school wrote

1863
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,800
a letter to John

1864
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,800
basically apologizing

1865
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,800
and saying that

1866
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,800
it was unfortunate that he had

1867
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,800
misconstrued what it was

1868
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,800
that they were trying to do

1869
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,800
and reiterated this

1870
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,800
totally foolish position

1871
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,800
that they had that all the

1872
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,800
dean was trying to do was to get some information

1873
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,800
so he could respond to

1874
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,800
calls that he was getting.

1875
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,800
And so they ended up dropping

1876
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,800
the entire thing and

1877
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,800
letting him go back into doing his

1878
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,800
normal work at the university.

1879
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,800
I accept

1880
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,800
Dr. Mack's statements at face value.

1881
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,800
He is inquiring and probing

1882
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,800
and he has the right to be wrong.

1883
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,800
The most fundamental right

1884
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
that any academic has

1885
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,800
is the right to be

1886
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,800
wrong. Prove

1887
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,800
that he's wrong. That's the job of other

1888
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,800
academics.

1889
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,800
He became the iconic figure

1890
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,800
of someone from inside

1891
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,800
a major institution

1892
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,800
who was willing to take the risks

1893
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,800
and pay the consequences

1894
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
for what he believed in.

1895
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,800
My

1896
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,800
respect for John Mack, for his

1897
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,800
courage, the difficulties

1898
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,800
that he's undergone.

1899
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
I think any human being

1900
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,800
would have to admit

1901
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,800
that if the UFO phenomenon

1902
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,800
is occurring, as the report

1903
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,800
suggests, it's the most important

1904
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,800
event in human history.

1905
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,800
Are you going to miss me when I go?

1906
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,800
Oh my gosh, I'm going to miss all of you.

1907
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,800
I really thank you for everything.

1908
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,800
I know

1909
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,800
I felt so welcome here.

1910
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,800
Too obvious.

1911
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,800
Yeah.

1912
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,800
Good evening, process.

1913
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,800
Come on, you'll be fine.

1914
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,800
I will.

1915
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,800
You'll be fine.

1916
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,800
Music

1917
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,800
music

1918
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,800
music

1919
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,800
music

1920
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,800
music

1921
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,800
music

1922
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,800
music

1923
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,800
music

1924
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,800
music

1925
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,800
music

1926
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,800
music

1927
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,800
Having

1928
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,800
a good time

1929
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,800
having a good time

1930
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:25,240
It's a very precious thing to me to be able to have this drawing again and look at it

1931
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:33,360
and say after 21 years I'm still depicting it exactly the same way and I can put it with

1932
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:44,120
The rest of them I have probably over 300 pieces and it started here.

1933
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:51,000
I don't know what it means for me further down the road but I feel more confident.

1934
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:57,560
It's a stepping stone forward to go out, show my art, share my story and feel good about

1935
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:01,040
it.

1936
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:05,360
With my family they've been extremely supportive throughout this whole thing and they've understood

1937
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:09,000
that this is something that I've had to go through.

1938
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,240
My mother has started speaking a bit about it.

1939
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:21,880
My father for the first time at the dinner table brought it up but I don't know if this

1940
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:29,080
is something that they'll ever be able to accept completely but I know that they love

1941
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:31,760
me and they trust me.

1942
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:36,080
They know because they were there that something happened.

1943
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:59,920
I'd like to introduce Emily Trent, one of the witnesses at the Louisa and Bob Way in

1944
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,920
1994.

1945
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:17,440
That was the day my world shattered and my outlook on the world became something completely

1946
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,760
brand new to me.

1947
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:24,720
I'm thankful for going through such a process and a journey in life which has led me to

1948
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:30,760
discover, look deeper into the meanings of things and become more self-aware.

1949
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:36,640
And I appreciate you taking the time to allow me to speak and thank you for your understanding

1950
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:56,840
in something so very personal.

1951
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:03,760
I don't know why it had to be Rua, small rural farming town.

1952
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,200
I truly don't.

1953
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,440
But for whatever reason it did.

1954
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,440
It happened.

1955
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:21,280
I'd like to know what we've seen and find out what it wanted.

1956
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,280
Why us?

1957
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,280
Why us kids?

1958
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,280
You know.

1959
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:32,880
It was a wonderful experience actually because I know definitely I'm not going to see something

1960
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,640
like that ever again.

1961
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,200
Maybe, who knows?

1962
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:41,520
It's something that I will pass on to my kids one day.

1963
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:47,120
They might be just here as observers.

1964
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:51,880
We're just an interesting part of the local community.

1965
01:33:51,880 --> 01:34:06,000
Like we go to safari in Africa, see this other creature which is unique to that world.

1966
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,920
For some people it is scary, very scary because it kind of makes them feel humanity is not

1967
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:18,840
in complete control of their destinies and we think we are the dominant species on the

1968
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,840
planet.

1969
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,120
But maybe we are the dominant species on the planet but maybe not the dominant species

1970
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:28,000
in this corner of the universe.

1971
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,400
I think it's left me open-minded, I think it's a bit arrogant to say that we are the

1972
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:36,320
only life in the galaxy or the universe.

1973
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:40,080
Yeah, I think it's good to speak about it, speak about it.

1974
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:47,080
If there was one experience I'd like to relive it would be that particular experience.

1975
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:51,720
I don't really say I swear man it was there, that sort of thing, you don't have to believe

1976
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:52,720
me.

1977
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:56,620
I'm sure a lot of people who have seen it barely believe themselves.

1978
01:34:56,620 --> 01:35:00,560
I don't think that the answer is out there, I don't think that I'm going to find an answer

1979
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:05,240
from Googling it or from talking to others about it.

1980
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:09,880
I think it's a long story is the answer.

1981
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:16,760
I think the answer will come maybe in this lifetime, maybe in the next, I don't know.

1982
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:28,000
I'm glad I was there, it really stretched my mind and gave me a new perspective on life

1983
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,640
the universe and everything really.

1984
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:36,640
I would not have missed that for the world, that's all I can say.

1985
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:42,360
Would you like to see him again?

1986
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,360
Yes.

1987
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,920
