1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The UFO animations in this broadcast have been seen and approved by eyewitnesses.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you believe in flying saucers?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's coming this way. It's definitely coming this way.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There is no doubt about it. This is weird.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's other life out there, and there's also intelligent life.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That doesn't mean it's easy to find.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's quite a wonder about our place in the universe.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
To suggest that we're alone is inexcusably egocentric.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The federal government knows fully well what is taking place with regard to the UFO phenomenon.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
They're not sharing that with the American people.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I believe that the object that I saw was extraterrestrial.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
These objects would hover and would dart very quickly one way or the other.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I've never seen anything like that. Haven't since then.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If even one of these sightings is correct, it's perhaps the greatest event in all of human history.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Flying saucers? I don't know whether to believe it or not.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello, I'm Peter Jennings.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We begin this program knowing from the research that most of us believe that we're not alone,

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that there is other intelligent life in the universe.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
NASA is searching for evidence of life in our solar system.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Recently, NASA and the European Space Agency landed a probe on Titan,

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
one of Saturn's moons, looking for signs of life.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The scientists at NASA would be happy to find a fossil, a microbe,

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
anything to prove that life out there exists in some form.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But tonight, there are millions of people here on Earth who believe

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that intelligent life from outer space is visiting us.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And they believe that they have seen the evidence.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It was so shiny, it looked like someone was shining a very bright light on a piece of aluminum.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The craft is dis-shaped, probably bigger than a 747, and it arced over the top of our car.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then there was a third object even behind the first two.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So it came across and just stopped. It went back the direction it came from.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This light went like this. That forever gave me the view that something other than us was out in the world.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There's no doubt that we're being visited. There is no doubt. They are definitely here.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why they're here, where they're from, you can only speculate.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
More than 80 million Americans believe that the Earth has been visited by extraterrestrials, visitors from outer space.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And after a count of about four seconds, gone.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
More than 40 million Americans say they have seen or know someone who has seen an unidentified flying object, a UFO.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have seen alien vehicles on eight occasions since then.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And many Americans believe that they themselves have been abducted by aliens.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I find myself floating from my bed.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Four of these beings came into my house, came in and got me.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I know what I saw. I know what I experienced is real.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I know it because everybody else has seen it, talked about it and discussed it.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So I know for a fact it's real. I know for a fact it's real.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Real to some, fiction to others.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Most scientists would rather look for life in a grain of sand than believe that aliens are here among us.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When I look at the evidence that aliens have visited Earth, I don't find any of it compelling.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
None of it, I think, passes the rigorous tests of scientific evidence.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
NASA scientist Dr. Chris McKay studies life in California's Mojave Desert,

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
looking for clues to how life might exist on a dry barren planet like Mars.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Here in the Mojave, I know that there was life here.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can reach down to the soil and pull it up and analyze it and find evidence that there was life here when there was water here.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'd like to do the same thing on Mars.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Scientists, including McKay, believe that the universe is so vast, there must be other places where life exists.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you look at all the people interested in life beyond Earth, there's scientists and UFO searchers.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What we all have in common is a belief that there's life out there.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We really have that commonality.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The difference is how we approach what to do with that belief.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What I do with that belief is approach the problem scientifically.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I don't disparage or ridicule the UFO phenomenon.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I see it as, in a sense, a shadow of the same kind of work I do.

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The UFO phenomenon, only a shadow of mainstream science.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But people throughout the world believe that unidentified flying objects are spacecraft guided by intelligent beings from beyond the Earth.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I have no idea. I've been flying at it.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And if you are among the believers, you have probably spent at least a few late nights listening to the program broadcast from this desert compound.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Coast to Coast with Art Bell is the place to talk about UFOs, or ufology, as many of his listeners call it.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What's for the Rockies? You're on the air. Hi.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey, Art. This is Matt in Colorado.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hey, Matt.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hey, I've got a thing for you that happened last summer.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh?

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It was huge. A cigar shape.

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The common cause of ufology is to finally determine what in the hell is flying in our sky.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think that Coast to Coast AM is the main conduit for ufology information.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And over my phone lines have come the most informed ufologists, the best scientists, and some of the craziest people you'll ever meet.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And we're moving very slowly with the cloud cover.

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It definitely overflew New York City.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And I never heard about a triangular UFO until I looked it up and I found that you had seen one.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yep.

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Coast to Coast began as actually a political show, kind of like everybody else's political show that radio is infested with.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And one day I got sick of doing the same damn thing over and over again.

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Same politics over and over.

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I began to sort of inject a little, well, a different kind of programming, you know, aliens and...

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Three points of light.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The weird thing about them...

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Coast to Coast became the fourth most popular program on American radio.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It was really weird.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Like they were doing a dance.

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It was really weird.

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It was really weird.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Coast to Coast became the fourth most popular program on American radio.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It was really weird.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Like they were doing a dance.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly. And they went over the rooftop.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think we're fascinated with the whole concept of alien intelligence because it would be so strange if we were all alone.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Imagine for a moment how it would feel if we were all alone, if there was no other life, intelligent life, anywhere in all that you see out there.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Art Bell and his wife Ramona say they encountered something from out there in 1994.

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We were on the way home from Las Vegas, about a half mile from where we're standing at the moment.

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I just happened to look out the rear view mirror and just saw something coming up from behind us.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And it looked like it wasn't...

100
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Normal.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Normal. And I kept saying, what the hell is that?

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And this thing floated above our heads doing about 30 miles an hour.

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Floated. Yeah, it floated.

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Or had to have been defying gravity or it was a lighter than aircraft. I don't know.

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But it was triangular. It was monstrous. The moon and the stars went away.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And there it was above us. And we stood and watched it go across the valley and head toward the mountains.

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Art Bell and his wife were alone, but there have been UFO sightings with hundreds, even thousands of eyewitnesses.

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Phoenix, Arizona, March the 13th, 1997.

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There were some incredible sightings over Phoenix called the Phoenix Lights.

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And they occurred while I was doing my program. I took call after call after call of people in Phoenix saying,

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And they occurred while I was doing my program. I took call after call after call of people in Phoenix saying,

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh my God, what's flying over our city?

113
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
At 8.30 p.m. that night, hundreds of people reported seeing a mysterious flying something.

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Security guard Bob Nelson was sitting on his porch with his dog.

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
All at once these six or seven lights came across the top of the hill and it was moving very slow.

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And then I went in and jokingly said to my wife, we got a UFO coming over.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
She just couldn't believe what she seen. And then of course she didn't know what she seen.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Sue Watson and her children, Brian, Aaron and Kevin, were in their front yard.

119
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We saw this incredible sized vehicle. There were five huge lights in the very front of it.

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And it was in a boomerang shape. I'm only a mile and a half from that mountain.

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The top of that mountain. That vehicle spent five to six minutes hovering from that mountain to my house.

122
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know anything that can go that slow.

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It was absolutely silent. Just completely gliding. Just like part of the sky. Just a big, big, big platform.

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Just flying with lights in front of it. I could see it was covering stars so I knew it was something. Something solid.

125
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Sheriff's deputy Thomas Chavez was in his squad car.

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was sitting here facing to the east watching the intersection.

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And on one of the times when I glanced up from my paperwork, that's when I saw the strange set of lights.

128
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I can't give you a definite answer to what it was. All I can tell you of what it was not.

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And it was definitely not an aircraft. An aircraft as we know it.

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mike Fortson grabbed his binoculars and went outside with his wife.

131
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
As it passed in front of us, all we could see was the left wing of the craft itself. That's how low it was.

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We didn't go fetch a camera. We didn't do anything but sit there and watch it.

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You actually tell yourself not to blink because you might miss something. I mean that's how intense it was.

134
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It gives me goosebumps when I talk about it.

135
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
At 10 p.m. that night, thousands of other people reported seeing another series of lights in the sky.

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What I'm looking at here is a light on South Mountain.

137
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Mike Christen videotaped the event from his house on Moon Mountain.

138
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
When I saw the one light, it was one thing. I was just photographing the one light and then all of a sudden another one popped up in a different direction.

139
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So then I trained the camera on that light and then another one popped up.

140
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And before you know it, this whole thing is starting to happen in front of my eyes and I'm going away. This is something.

141
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
All right, you tell me what it is.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hey, Sue.

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
James McGahey lives in Tucson, Arizona, which is south of Phoenix.

144
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He's a retired Air Force pilot and an astronomer.

145
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He is an outspoken skeptic about UFOs.

146
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Clearly, today, UFOlogy is a mythology that's based on superstition wrapped inside a fairy tale telling a story that's simply not true.

147
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What most people see is lights in the sky at night, points of light.

148
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They equate that to spacecraft from another world.

149
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There's no connection. If you see a light in the sky, you've seen a light in the sky. That's all you've seen.

150
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This happened in the case of the Phoenix lights.

151
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The lights on the videotape were simply flares being dropped by A-10s on the Goldwater Test Range.

152
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There's nothing mysterious about it. I know what flares look like. These are clearly flares.

153
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And some people have said they saw a triangular aircraft flying through the Phoenix airspace.

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The argument against that is very simple. The Phoenix radar didn't see anything.

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
They were connecting the dots of these objects. That's all they were doing.

156
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The bright lights of these objects, they were connecting this and saying it's all one thing.

157
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It wasn't one thing. It was five different aircraft flying in formation.

158
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The people in Phoenix do not believe they were just connecting dots.

159
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
For somebody to say there were planes in formation, I'm telling them I saw a solid object. My wife saw a solid object.

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I know 300 or 400 people that I've talked to saw the solid object in the 8 o'clock hour.

161
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I know what I saw and it was something that I've never seen before and probably will never see again.

162
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it was amazing. It was amazing. It was something that is not familiar and that's what's so intriguing to me about it that it's unknown, the unknown of it.

163
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I am so certain that what I saw that I would testify in a court of law or in a congressional hearing as to what I saw because what I saw was not an aircraft.

164
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I think it was a UFO. I can honestly believe that there was a UFO.

165
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You don't have to believe me. Nobody believes it, but you'll believe it when you see it.

166
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
When it comes to unidentified flying objects, seeing is believing.

167
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This is the Center for UFO Studies on the outskirts of Chicago.

168
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
There are files here from thousands of witnesses who report seeing UFOs and the records go back for decades.

169
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The best way to become a believer in UFOs is to have a sighting. If you encounter it directly, you're likely to believe in it because you encountered it.

170
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Intellectual arguments don't always work as well with people, understandably.

171
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You know, I saw a UFO so you should believe in it or look at all these other people that saw it so you should believe in it.

172
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's always the personal that's going to lead to a belief that the subject is real, and that's true for scientists, for ufologists, and for members of the general public.

173
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Dr. Mark Rodiger has been researching the UFO phenomenon since 1974.

174
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
One conjecture is that many reports, or at least a good fraction of reports these days, are caused by secret aircraft.

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It turns out that it's actually pretty easy to distinguish between sightings that might be secret aircraft and sightings that are probably not that.

176
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:47,000
When you get a UFO sighting where the object behaves in a way that defies conventional physics, defies the way that an airplane would move,

177
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and when you can see the object, it's not just a point of light, but there is some size there, some actual shape you can see, and that thing isn't shaped like an airplane,

178
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
well then it's not a secret aircraft, it's whatever it is, it's just something totally bizarre and strange.

179
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
An example of that would be a sighting that occurred in January of 2000 near St. Louis on the Illinois side of the river.

180
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This huge triangular object was moving fairly low to the ground, kind of zipping around the area.

181
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's not Venus or Mars or whatever object was up at the time, it's not another aircraft that was up at the time.

182
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Well gee, if it's not a conventional object, what else could it be?

183
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:38,000
My name is Melvin Noll and I'm a part-time truck driver and I own this miniature golf course and also the go-kart track out here.

184
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That certain morning I happened to look over into the sky to the northeast and I seen a very, very bright light up there, like a very bright star,

185
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and then I said, well that's moving, and I just stood there and watched what I was doing, and it was just coming down out of the sky real slow,

186
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and no noise, just quiet, and I couldn't see no wings or nothing, just floating right through the mid-air up there,

187
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and I thought, well if I don't tell nobody that I've seen something go over town tonight, nobody will believe me tomorrow.

188
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Noll drove his truck to the Highland, Illinois Police Department to report an unidentified flying object heading toward the neighboring town of Lebanon.

189
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, this is just a huge call from Highland PD.

190
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Urban Tour truck driver just stopped in and said there was a flying object in the area of Lebanon.

191
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
A joke, right?

192
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No, this is not a joke.

193
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's for now.

194
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Ed Barton was the first police officer to respond to the call.

195
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
At 423 AM, police officer David Martin saw the UFO over a field on the outskirts of Shiloh.

196
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The sky was clear and clear.

197
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The sky was clear.

198
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The sky was clear.

199
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The sky was clear.

200
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The sky was clear.

201
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The sky was clear.

202
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The sky was clear.

203
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The sky was clear.

204
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
At 423 AM, police officer David Martin saw the UFO over a field on the outskirts of Shiloh.

205
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I happened to look over and saw this large floating object that was just moving very slowly.

206
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It was probably about a football field in length.

207
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It had three large bright lights lighting up the sky underneath it.

208
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I honestly don't know what it was that I saw other than I know it wasn't a plane or a helicopter or a blimp.

209
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Police reported the object over Lebanon, over Shiloh, over Milstad, over Dupo.

210
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Detective Mark Lopino says he saw it as he approached Othallan, Illinois.

211
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I was driving eastbound on Highway 50.

212
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
When I see the object, the UFO, if you will, I first thought it was probably a bunch of helicopters flying in some type of formation.

213
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
As I drew closer to it, I saw it start to cross over the roadway.

214
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It was unlike anything I had ever seen before.

215
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You could see the lights and you could see something that they were attached to and it was shaped like a triangle.

216
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm freaking out. I'm like, what the heck is this?

217
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So I continue and it's going over these trees by the time I get here toward the left turn lane.

218
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I duck into this left turn lane here and I stop right about here.

219
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I wanted to listen to see if I could hear any type of engine noise.

220
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I could not hear anything.

221
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I tried to look again at the UFO and it had already gone behind these trees.

222
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I put it in reverse to back up a couple seconds to see if I could reacquire it again.

223
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
By the time I backed up to try to see it, it had moved at least a mile away, if not further, that quick.

224
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I was just astonished. I didn't know what to say. I was speechless.

225
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Six people, including five police officers, saw an object over southern Illinois that night.

226
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
They all described what they saw as a massive triangular object flying in total silence.

227
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It very well could be an alien ship. I don't know. I guess that's why they call them unidentified objects.

228
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know. I do know that it wasn't a plane that I've ever seen before.

229
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Am I saying it was an alien spacecraft? No. I'm not saying it was a military craft.

230
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm saying I can't identify the object and it's an unidentified flying object by its very definition.

231
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
There was no official investigation of the sightings in Illinois or Arizona.

232
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The U.S. government is not in the business of investigating UFOs.

233
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
To understand why, you need to go back to the beginning.

234
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
When we come back, the story of the first flying saucers.

235
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The fascination with unidentified flying objects can be traced to a day in June 1947 and to one man, Kenneth Arnold.

236
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
He was not a guy who read science fiction. He was not a guy who had any occult interests.

237
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He was not a guy with a lot of imagination. He lived pretty close to the ground mentally, but he loved to fly.

238
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And so, on the Tuesday afternoon of June 24th, 1947, when he saw these nine dish-shaped objects flying at some considerable speed over Mount Rainier, he thought that he was witnessing a secret military experiment.

239
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Every newspaper across the nation has made headlines out of it, and this afternoon we are honored indeed to present to you, Kenneth Arnold.

240
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
They look something like a pie plate that was cut in half with sort of a convex triangle in the rear.

241
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'd be glad to confirm it with my hands on a Bible because I did see it.

242
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's just a secret military experiment.

243
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a secret military experiment.

244
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's a secret military experiment.

245
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's a secret military experiment.

246
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So, in the rear, I'd be glad to confirm it with my hands on a Bible because I did see it.

247
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's just as much a mystery to me as it is to everyone else who's been calling me the last 24 hours wondering what it was.

248
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The press referred to the nine objects Arnold said he saw as flying saucers.

249
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Arnold was such a straight shooter. He was so clearly puzzled. There was no possibility that this guy was making up a strange story.

250
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Arnold's sighting just seemed to catalyze everything.

251
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
All of a sudden, there was this presence of something unidentified in the sky that couldn't be ignored.

252
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In the next two or three weeks, there were many hundreds of sightings.

253
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Army fighter planes are on patrol for flying saucers. Cameras installed to photograph them.

254
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So many objects were being seen in the sky by so many people that the Army Air Force launched an investigation.

255
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
They're seeing flying saucers everywhere.

256
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And on September the 23rd, 1947, General Nathan Twining issued a memo that said quite categorically,

257
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.

258
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
When it appeared that technological devices of some kind were penetrating American airspace

259
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and we didn't know what they were and had no idea what to do about them, this was obviously a national security problem.

260
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It was the beginning of the Cold War and what Americans feared most was being attacked by the Soviet Union.

261
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
We didn't know what they might have flying.

262
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And so those legitimate concerns by the government for our security led eventually to them establishing a full-time office to investigate UFOs.

263
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The Air Force investigators quickly came to realize that they were not dealing with Soviet aircraft.

264
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Nothing man-made performed like flying saucers.

265
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
They started thinking, well, if the Soviets aren't doing this, there's really no thing on Earth that can be doing this.

266
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And then on July the 24th, 1948, two experienced commercial pilots, Clarence Chiles and John Whithead,

267
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
were flying at night over Alabama when they encountered what they described as a cigar-shaped object,

268
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
perhaps 100 feet long, flying faster than any aircraft they had ever seen.

269
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It had, they said, two rows of windows and they could see lights inside and orange-red flames shooting out of the tail.

270
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Air Force investigators couldn't explain it.

271
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It could not possibly fly unless it had an engine in it that was beyond anything anybody on Earth could make.

272
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And this, in a sense, was their proof that they were dealing with the extraterrestrial technology.

273
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The Air Force investigators trusted the testimony of these experienced pilots and were forced to consider the incredible.

274
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Since 1948, there have been thousands of sightings by commercial and military flight crews.

275
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
March the 12th, 1977, I was flying a trip from San Francisco to Boston nonstop in a DC-10.

276
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It was an Airbus 320 and we had 24 passengers on board with very good condition. We were at 39,000 feet.

277
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We were north of, just north of Dallas, Fort Worth. It was a beautiful clear night.

278
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Out of nowhere, some lights appeared looking over to the left of me, just to the north of me.

279
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I noticed a red light of some kind to the far, the distance off our port side, our right side.

280
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And Larry says, well, keep an eye out. And he says, well, now it's coming at us. So...

281
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And they began a turn from pointing directly at us in an echelon sort of a turn away.

282
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It was not a plane. It was not a weather balloon. It was huge, absolutely huge.

283
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It was a dark red color. And so this object began to become transparent and it disappeared.

284
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It was absolutely crazy. Ha! Crazy!

285
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It just was gliding through the sky so quietly. And as it did so, it blotted out the stars behind it.

286
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It just reminded me of a submarine in the depths when it's quiet and just kind of motoring right on through, you know.

287
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
There were no wings. There were no windows. And it was cigar shaped.

288
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Cigar shaped. I saw what I saw. And this thing was not from here.

289
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I watched this big, gigantic light go out behind our left wing tip.

290
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And then as the turn progressed, it disappeared in the distance off to the back at a very high rate of speed.

291
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I've flown all the jets. I flew in the war. I flew B-17s in the war. Everything.

292
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I've got over 30,000 hours of flight time and never had a sighting as that one.

293
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So it was once in a lifetime.

294
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
In the fall of 1948, Air Force investigators were convinced by the testimony of pilots.

295
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
In a remarkable top secret report to General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Air Force's Chief of Staff,

296
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
the investigators said the Earth was being visited by alien spaceships.

297
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
They took it so seriously that they risked their own careers by writing an estimate of the situation

298
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
that they sent on to higher headquarters and said that UFOs, some of these UFOs could be extraterrestrial,

299
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
which of course was not received well by the Pentagon.

300
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Hoyt Vandenberg looked at this thing and he said, I cannot accept this.

301
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I cannot accept this kind of conclusion because you don't have concrete proof that that's what kind of a device we're dealing with.

302
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The eyewitness accounts from experienced pilots were not enough for the General.

303
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The Air Force wanted the flying saucer phenomena to go away,

304
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
but the popular fascination with mysterious flying objects was growing.

305
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
In 1952, the Air Force received more UFO reports than any other year in history.

306
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The sky is the stage, the actors so-called flying saucers, and they're back on the scene with some new twists.

307
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
This is a photograph of a flying saucer taken by myself, and it reminded me of two straw hats stuck together at the brim.

308
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I saw an intensely bright white green object in the sky.

309
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Now I wouldn't want to say that this was one of those so-called flying saucers,

310
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
but whatever it was, it was an object and not an illusion.

311
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
The Air Force had really tried to downplay the UFO problem,

312
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
but by the summer of 1952 there was an enormous wave of sightings.

313
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
There were hundreds and hundreds, probably thousands of sightings.

314
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Most alarmingly, the sightings were focused on Washington, D.C.

315
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
At least three radar systems in Washington in the area were picking up unidentified targets.

316
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:54,000
This very much worried people in Washington because it looked like penetration of the most important airspace in the country.

317
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
In July 1952, the Pentagon's communication system was overwhelmed by calls about UFOs.

318
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The number of calls of frightened Americans, hysterical Americans coming into the switchboards of the American government

319
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
were clogging communication channels.

320
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And if American communication channels were clogged,

321
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
then this would leave America vulnerable to a potential Soviet attack.

322
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So the task is calm the furor, end the hysteria.

323
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It was public hysteria, not the flying saucers themselves, that threatened the national security.

324
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
President Truman ordered the CIA to make recommendations on how the Air Force should handle the UFO problem.

325
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The CIA convened a panel headed by the physicist H.P. Robertson.

326
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The Robertson panel says we must do something to remove the aura of mystery from the UFO phenomena.

327
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So that people no longer take them seriously and don't bother to report them.

328
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That's what we want.

329
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So flying saucers, whatever they were, wherever they came from, were to be made the subject of ridicule.

330
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
But it was impossible to control the public interest.

331
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The public was fascinated.

332
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
One of the most widely read magazine articles at the time proclaimed, the flying saucers are real.

333
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
One of the most respected publications in America, Life Magazine, published photographs.

334
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen, I think something is happening.

335
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And then came the movies.

336
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
The day the Earth stood still.

337
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
This could be the beginning of the end for the human race.

338
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The war of the worlds.

339
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So the often ridiculed flying saucers are in reality the flaming vanguard of the invasion from Mars.

340
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Flying saucers have invaded our planet.

341
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Washington, London, Paris.

342
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Earth versus the flying saucers.

343
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
The whole world is under attack.

344
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Can it survive?

345
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
The government simply could not control the public's appetite for a phenomenon so intriguing.

346
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
They're pulling the sun.

347
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
When we come back, the Air Force tries to explain the unexplainable.

348
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Prisoners hurtling through endless space.

349
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Peter Jennings reporting.

350
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
UFOs seeing is believing will return in a moment.

351
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Today, if you ask the Air Force about UFOs, it will tell you there is no evidence that they are extraterrestrial vehicles.

352
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And there is no evidence that they represent technology beyond our own.

353
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The Air Force will cite as proof its own 22-year study called Project Blue Book.

354
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:03,000
During the 1950s and 60s, Project Blue Book, based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, investigated hundreds of UFO reports every year.

355
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
They came from every part of the country.

356
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
From people in every walk of life.

357
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Night sightings.

358
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Day sightings.

359
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Nightings of mysterious lights.

360
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Structured craft.

361
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The reports came to Blue Book seeking answers to what it was in America's skies.

362
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Blue Book was overwhelmed by the volume of reports.

363
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Americans were told again and again, we have a crack unit of individuals, scientifically trained people studying this phenomenon.

364
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That wasn't the case.

365
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
There wasn't a massive institute where Blue Book had a staff of white-coated lab technicians.

366
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
There was a guy at a desk and a secretary and a private or someone there typing stuff.

367
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It was a very, very small project.

368
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Colonel Robert Friend was the director of Project Blue Book from 1958 to 1963.

369
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:07,000
We wanted to explain as many sightings as possible, but we recognized that the amount of resources that would be necessary in order to do this

370
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
would have been far beyond those that we were ready to commit at the time.

371
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Blue Book was never intended to become a serious full-scale scientific inquiry.

372
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The Air Force had another mission for its UFO office.

373
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Blue Book was tasked with a public relations mission.

374
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And that mission was denounce the UFOs, dismiss the UFOs, debunk the UFOs and anybody who believes in them.

375
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Just come up with answers and get this UFO thing out of the newspapers.

376
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The best way to keep UFOs out of the newspapers and therefore out of the public mind was to say repeatedly that they were nothing more than

377
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
weather balloons or rare atmospheric conditions, a star on the horizon, whatever it took.

378
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What they wanted to try to do was, I think, to re-educate the public regarding UFOs to take away the aura of mystery.

379
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And that job was most often left to Blue Book's one civilian scientist, Ohio State Astronomer Dr. J. Allen Heineck.

380
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
To this time there is no proof that I would consider a valid scientific proof that we have been visited by spaceships.

381
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
There was not one sound. I listened. There was not a sound.

382
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Between 1948 and 1969, Dr. Heineck was Project Blue Book's lead scientific investigator on thousands of cases.

383
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:50,000
His job was to stretch his imagination to try to find explanations for every possible case he could, even if he knew it didn't make any sense.

384
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Don't you think it would be kind of unusual for a meteor to just fall across the road and hover over there a minute and then drop to the ground?

385
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The coming over wouldn't be bad. The hovering would bother me.

386
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The longer he was in, the more cases he saw, the more he realized that he couldn't explain the cases and there was a genuine mystery involved here.

387
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:19,000
In the middle of the Cold War, across remote stretches of the northern United States, the Air Force kept ballistic missiles and B-52 bombers on constant alert.

388
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:34,000
On the night of October 24, 1968, at Minot Air Force Base in Minot, North Dakota, Airman First Class Mike O'Connor was dispatched to make a routine repair at one of the missile sites.

389
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We made our turn to come down the road to the missile site, and out of the corner of my eye I observed what I thought was a farmer's yard light, but it looked awful bright.

390
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:58,000
As we proceeded down the road, the object appeared to lift off the ground and parallel us down the road until we came to the missile site.

391
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
At which point we got out of the truck and it just kind of hovered there.

392
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Staff Sergeant Bill Smith was in charge of security for ten nuclear missiles. That night he reported seeing strange objects.

393
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:20,000
These objects would rise, they would speed up, they would slow it down, they would hover, they would dart very quickly one way or the other.

394
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
We were just not really sure that these were things that we could explain.

395
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,000
The Minot control tower diverted a B-52 to investigate. Captain Brad Runyon was the B-52's co-pilot.

396
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The air traffic controller asked us if we would mind going out to this one area.

397
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I was curious and I said, well, what are we looking for? And they said, well, you'll know it if you find it.

398
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The navigator on the B-52, Captain Patrick McCaslin, suddenly identified an object on his radar screen.

399
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I saw a return, faint one sweep, bright the next, large, off our right wing three o'clock.

400
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:10,000
At about three miles. And at that point, I asked the radar navigator to turn on the camera, which would then take pictures of whatever was on the radar screen.

401
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
These pictures of the radar screen show the object flying in formation with the B-52.

402
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
The B-52 was flying in formation with the B-52.

403
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
This thing was climbing out with us and maintaining the same heading we were. That was unusual.

404
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,000
But what really watered my eyes, when was it, when this thing backed away and allowed us to turn inside of it.

405
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
When the object suddenly disappeared from the radar, the bomber turned around.

406
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The B-52 was flying in formation with the B-52.

407
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
When the object suddenly disappeared from the radar, the bomber turned back to find it.

408
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Co-pilot Runyon was the first to spot what appeared to be a glowing craft hovering near the ground.

409
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
When things like that are happening, it seems like time to stand still.

410
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:14,000
My estimate overall object was a minimum of 200 feet in diameter, and it was hundreds of feet long.

411
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It had a metallic cylinder attached to another section that was shaped like a crescent moon.

412
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I felt that this crescent moon part was probably the command center.

413
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I tried to look inside the thing, but all I could see was a yellow glow.

414
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:48,000
At that point I was fairly sure that I was looking at an alien spaceship, something that had come here from some other planet other than Earth.

415
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Co-pilot Runyon and the other crew members of the B-52 reported their sighting when they returned to the base.

416
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:04,000
According to Blue Book's investigation, the crew of the B-52 and 16 witnesses on the ground said they saw a UFO that night.

417
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
In its final report, Blue Book concluded that they were all seeing stars.

418
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
None of those pilots saw a star. I know those pilots. I know what their training was.

419
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I know how many stars they'd seen in the course of their careers, and they were not looking at a star.

420
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It bothers me that Blue Book blew it off. I don't think this incident has ever been adequately explained.

421
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The Air Force finally got out of the business of trying to explain UFOs in 1969.

422
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It closed down Project Blue Book after an independent commission concluded that UFOs were of no scientific interest.

423
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:05,000
There was one loud, dissenting voice. Blue Book's one skeptical chief scientist, Alan Heineck.

424
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,000
After more than 20 years and more than 12,000 UFO investigations, Dr. Heineck had become a believer.

425
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,000
In Blue Book, for instance, we would get reports from military pilots, and that was particularly embarrassing to the Air Force because after they had trained those men,

426
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:30,000
they could say that a civilian pilot might have been untrustworthy, but they could hardly say that of their own military pilots.

427
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And we got case after case after case from military pilots, which never hit the press.

428
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
The difference between Alan Heineck and the people he worked with in Blue Book was this.

429
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
He was a scientist, and they weren't. And he never forgot that he was a scientist.

430
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The Air Force paid his checks and paid him well, but they couldn't quell his scientific curiosity.

431
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And it was his scientific curiosity that finally won out and that will, I think, probably at some point in the future history of science,

432
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
will earn Alan Heineck a reputation as a courageous and principled man.

433
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Dr. Heineck spent the rest of his life investigating sightings and calling for serious scientific inquiry into the UFO phenomenon.

434
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Most of his fellow scientists rejected his opinions.

435
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Peter Jennings reporting, UFOs, Seeing is Believing continues.

436
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Dr. Alan Heineck failed to interest the scientific community in UFOs. At issue was the nature of the evidence.

437
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Ufologists argued that the sheer volume of eyewitness sightings is proof that something extraordinary is happening.

438
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But mainstream scientists categorically reject eyewitness testimony.

439
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I don't care how many people say they've seen something. They've seen the lights in the sky.

440
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
As a scientist, I need something better than your eyewitness sightings.

441
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
They've seen something. They've seen the lights in the sky.

442
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
As a scientist, I need something better than your eyewitness testimony.

443
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Because even if in the court of law, eyewitness testimony is a high form of evidence,

444
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
in the court of science, it is the lowest form of evidence you could possibly put forth.

445
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It doesn't matter whether it's President Jimmy Carter who saw a UFO, which he thinks he did, or Farmer Bob.

446
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It doesn't matter. Everybody has eyes and ears and a brain that perceives and so on.

447
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I think they're all equally unreliable as eyewitnesses. We're very bad at recounting things we think we saw.

448
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
My husband and I were flying our airplane. It was at night, and we saw a light.

449
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:03,000
We saw a bright light, a two o'clock position, and it was one of those, oh my goodness, kind of moments.

450
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Jack, do you see that? Yeah, I see that. And there really is a light there, right? And it's coming towards us, right?

451
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It was this, I know I'm seeing something. It's really there.

452
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And we, you know, we just sort of looked at each other and said, this can't be happening to us.

453
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
We can't be seeing a UFO. You know, we're so skeptical. But look, it's really there.

454
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And then clouds that we didn't realize were there, spread apart enough for us to understand that what we were seeing was a piece of the moon,

455
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
that it was just shining through a hole in the clouds. Things are often not what they seem.

456
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:58,000
For scientists, seeing is not believing. For them, only physical evidence will prove that UFOs are visiting Earth.

457
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
They do believe that life exists beyond Earth, and they have spent decades searching for the first piece of evidence.

458
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
A spacecraft launched by NASA and the European Space Agency travelled billions of miles

459
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
and in January 2005 landed a probe on Saturn's moon Titan.

460
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
No human spacecraft has ever landed so far from Earth.

461
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
These images of Titan's surface suggest an active world of rivers and oceans.

462
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Scientists believe that where there is liquid, there may be life.

463
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:44,000
If we look for life in our backyard, our cosmic backyard, if we look there and find life, imagine what that tells us.

464
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That some other random place that happens to be a nearby planet has life just the way we do.

465
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Then there's no telling how rich the entire universe is with life.

466
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:07,000
There is still no evidence that the universe is rich with life, but mainstream scientists think there has got to be life.

467
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
There's more than 100 billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy alone.

468
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And there's more than 50 or 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

469
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And there's more than 50 or 100 billion galaxies in the universe.

470
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You multiply these two numbers, that's a one with 21 zeros worth of stars in the cosmos.

471
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
To suggest that we're alone is inexcusably egocentric.

472
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Somewhere among the billions of stars in our galaxy, or in the billions of other galaxies in the universe,

473
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
scientists believe there must be other planets, just like Earth, where life exists.

474
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
What created Earth and man must have created life somewhere else, they say, in the vastness of space.

475
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Somewhere there must be another developed civilization trying to reach us.

476
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Dr. Frank Drake has been listening for 45 years.

477
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:18,000
In 1960, in Green Bank, West Virginia, Dr. Drake first pointed a radio telescope at a nearby star to listen for a signal.

478
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,000
We just had this feeling that something very important was starting, that this was a new road that human beings were taking

479
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
that was going to lead to very wonderful places and very wonderful things for our civilization.

480
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Dr. Drake's experiment marked the beginning of a project called SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

481
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Dr. Seth Shostak is an astronomer who works with Drake at the SETI Institute.

482
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
We've been broadcasting our existence to the universe for the last 50 or 60 years,

483
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and we've been doing that with our high powered radio and television transmissions.

484
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Every day, those signals just go right on out into space.

485
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:10,000
That's how we're broadcasting into space, and we kind of turn that idea around when we try and find the extraterrestrials by trying to find their broadcasts.

486
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Dr. Drake remembers the day of his first search in April 1960.

487
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
For all we knew, every star in the sky had a radio transmitting civilization.

488
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
We might succeed the first day.

489
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,000
We even had a tape recorder connected to the radio receiver so that we could tape record any voices we might hear from the other world.

490
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And so we pointed at the first star, and when it finally set in the west, we moved over and pointed the telescope at the second star.

491
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And we heard on a loudspeaker a signal like we'd never heard before with a radio telescope.

492
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And it was a lot like a lot of people said we might detect, a series of pulses.

493
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It sounded like choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo.

494
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
All our hearts were pounding. You'd think this may be one of the greatest moments in history unfolding right here before us.

495
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The signal turned out to be nothing more than sound from a passing plane.

496
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:21,000
When you detect such a signal and it truly looks to be extraterrestrial, it's a very special emotion.

497
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I'd like to feel it again.

498
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
After more than four decades, Dr. Drake has yet to hear an alien signal.

499
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Dr. Jill Tarter is another astronomer working at SETI.

500
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
The chances of success in SETI are difficult to estimate.

501
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
But if we never search, the chance is zero.

502
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So I think what we ought to do is search.

503
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Seth, you can see the telescopes.

504
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
They're too shiny.

505
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:14,000
At Hat Creek in Northern California, SETI is building an array of telescopes that will search for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence on a scale never before attempted.

506
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
The project is named after its largest donor, the co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen.

507
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Alright, let's go.

508
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
This observatory is sited in a very quiet pastoral valley, mostly cows and a few people.

509
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It's going to change a whole lot when we put 350 telescopes in here.

510
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And it's going to change even more if indeed those telescopes detect a signal from someone else's technology.

511
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Of course, we don't know how many civilizations out there might be broadcasting signals that we could pick up.

512
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The faster that you can go through all that heavenly real estate, the sooner you're going to find a signal.

513
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And if that happens, this is where it will happen. It will happen right here.

514
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
This is kind of the portal to the cosmos.

515
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
This is the place where we're going to crack the crystal of isolation that has surrounded this planet for four and a half billion years.

516
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Right here, right here amongst the trees and the lava and the bright sunshine.

517
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And drink a little champagne along the way.

518
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
We will build it and I hope they will come, or at least in the form of their radio waves.

519
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Some UFO believers belittle SETI. Why search the heavens for an elusive signal, they ask, when the extraterrestrials are already here.

520
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,000
If I thought that extraterrestrials were really visiting the Earth, I wouldn't be doing this. None of us would be.

521
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Why would we go to all the trouble of building this very complex equipment and these expensive antenna arrays and so forth and so on if they were here?

522
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It's just not proven that any UFO is a spacecraft from another intelligent species.

523
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
On the other hand, it must be said that we haven't shown that the extraterrestrials exist either.

524
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
But we don't make the claim that we have. I think that's a big difference.

525
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
We will only claim success when we really know we have found something extraterrestrial.

526
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
If we claim something, there will be data to back it up.

527
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Dog on it, we're going to tell you, it's up there at these coordinates in the sky. It's at this spot on the dial at this frequency.

528
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So take out your own antenna and go out and verify it. We would encourage you to verify it.

529
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And that's the difference between science and myth making.

530
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
When we come back, the making of a myth. The story of Roswell.

531
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
UFOs Seeing is Believing continues.

532
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:55,000
For many of those who believe that the Earth has been visited by extraterrestrial spacecraft, this remote New Mexico Ranch is hallowed ground.

533
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:04,000
The story goes that it was here in the summer of 1947 that one of the greatest discoveries in human history was made.

534
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
The holy grail of ufology. Concrete evidence proving the existence of alien life.

535
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Major Jesse Marcel, the intelligence officer at the Army Air Base in Roswell, receives a telephone call.

536
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:27,000
The call is to go to the ranch of Mack Brazel and investigate some material that Brazel has found on his land.

537
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Marcel goes to the ranch and brings back a load of debris. And this stuff was extraordinary.

538
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Jesse Marcel was absolutely convinced what he found was extraterrestrial. That the debris was nothing of this Earth.

539
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Marcel loaded up his car with a strange wreckage and drove the 75 miles to Roswell.

540
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
He stopped at his home to show his wife and 11-year-old son Jesse Jr. what he had found.

541
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I walked my mother and myself up saying, I want you to look at this. I mean, I can remember it just like it happened yesterday.

542
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
The type of material that was there.

543
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:19,000
The most curious part of the debris that I saw were the I-beams, the structural members with pinkish-violet writing along the inside surface.

544
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It was more like geometric symbols. It was very impressive. When you see something that impressive, even as an 11-year-old, it stays with you.

545
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Jesse Marcel Sr. took the debris to the Army Air Force Base at Roswell early in the morning of July the 8th.

546
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And by noon, the base commander, Colonel William Blanchard, authorized a press release proclaiming that what Marcel had found was the remains of a flying saucer.

547
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Headline edition, July 8, 1947. The Army Air Forces has announced that a flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.

548
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Army officers say the missile has been inspected at Roswell, New Mexico and sent to Wright Field, Ohio for further inspection.

549
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,000
There was tremendous public excitement. I mean, the newspaper archives from that time, it was just all over the place. I mean, it was national news. It was a big deal.

550
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And people were very excited and frightened and everything else.

551
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:34,000
For one moment in history, Roswell, New Mexico could claim to be the only place on Earth where evidence existed that this planet was being visited by alien spacecraft. It was a short moment.

552
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:49,000
The next day, there was a press conference, a press conference organized by General Roger Ramey. And Roger Ramey says, we did not recover a flying saucer. This is no flying disk. What we recovered was a weather balloon.

553
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:02,000
The papers reported General Ramey empties Roswell's saucer. The Army Air Force reduced Marcel's discovery to nothing more than a harmless, high-altitude weather balloon.

554
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:11,000
The public accepted it. This was immediately in the wake of World War II. And I think most people basically trusted the government.

555
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And so, you know, they had no doubt that this was genuine. And this was true of the press as well. There was very little skepticism about it and it just kind of went away.

556
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:34,000
For 30 years, no one paid any attention to the events at Roswell. Jesse Marcel's story of a flying saucer that crashed might still be forgotten. Were it not for a ufologist named Stanton Friedman?

557
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I got involved in 1978. I was at a television station in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The station manager out of the blue. He says, you know, the guy you ought to talk to is Jesse Marcel.

558
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
He handled the wreckage of one of those saucers you were interested in when he was in the military.

559
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:06,000
What? Stanton Friedman found Jesse Marcel. He was retired from the military and was a television repairman in Houma, Louisiana. Marcel had a story to tell.

560
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
What I saw, I couldn't believe. There was so much of it. It was scattered. It was such a vast area.

561
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:23,000
We found a piece of metal about a foot and a half to two feet wide. You couldn't even bend it. You couldn't bend it. Even with a sledgehammer, it would bounce off of it.

562
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
So it was not anything from this earth that I'm quite sure of.

563
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:39,000
My dad finally came to the conclusion that this is a story that should not be contained or buried. He felt it was time that people know the truth about this.

564
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:54,000
But what is the truth? The wreckage hadn't been seen since 1947, so there was no way to prove Jesse Marcel's claims, which never stopped Stanton Friedman and his fellow Roswell promoters.

565
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:09,000
The first Roswell book appeared in 1980. It said that what crashed was a flying saucer. It said there was no evidence because the government was hiding it somewhere. The government was engaged in a massive cover-up.

566
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:29,000
If there has been a UFO cover-up, it began in Roswell, New Mexico. A persistent rumor holds that the United States government has recovered and is concealing fragments of alien spacecraft, fragments and more.

567
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:43,000
This all came together at a time when people were ready to buy into conspiracy. And then, you know, in 1989 Unsolved Mysteries did the recreation of the whole event and off to the races we go.

568
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:52,000
This Air Force base here in Roswell, New Mexico is the center of a controversy back in 1947 that over 40 years later still remains unsolved.

569
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Jesse Marcel's story about a day long ago was becoming an article of faith, and the promoters were busy spinning it everywhere they could.

570
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You think there was a government cover-up?

571
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
There's no question about that. Not only about this case, but lots of other UFO cases.

572
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:15,000
After investigating for their new book, Kevin Randall and Don Schmidt are convinced it was a military cover-up.

573
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:24,000
A parade of new witnesses came out of the woodwork to share the limelight with tales of secret government activity and alien bodies found in the wreckage.

574
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
The small nose. Eyes like this.

575
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
About how tall?

576
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
About five, five-three, five-four, someone as tall as that.

577
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I understand that extraterrestrials were found in Roswell?

578
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Yes. Dead.

579
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Dead extraterrestrials were found, no question about it.

580
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
This is an incredible story. Aliens, the federal government, intimidation, we have a best seller on our hands.

581
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
The people who are promoting Roswell realize that there is a gold rush to Roswell. There is money to be made.

582
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
But your book is only going to sell if your charges are more grandiose, more exaggerated, more powerful.

583
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So you have this ladder of escalation, of sensationalism.

584
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:15,000
In 1995, Fox Television broadcast what they promoted as a recently discovered film of an alien autopsy performed at Roswell.

585
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
It was seen by more than 20 million viewers.

586
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Alright, I want to show you something.

587
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And then came the X-Files.

588
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.

589
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Jesse Marcel's unproven story was now prime-time mythology.

590
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
In Roswell, they captured aliens from the spacecraft wreckage.

591
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:50,000
They salvaged various alien technology from them, and from their data banks, they learned of the alien plan to recolonize the Earth.

592
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Decades after something fell from the sky outside Roswell, this remote New Mexico town had hit the jackpot.

593
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It didn't matter that there wasn't a shred of evidence to support the claim that a flying saucer crashed here.

594
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It didn't matter that there were no credible witnesses to alien bodies.

595
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:19,000
On the 50th anniversary of the alleged crash, 65% of Americans told a Time Magazine CNN poll that they believed the story.

596
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
The myth, that is.

597
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,000
The crowds come to celebrate the place where the truth about flying saucers and alien life was revealed.

598
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
As for the strange debris itself.

599
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

600
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:45,000
In 1994 and 1997, in reports called the Roswell Incident and Case Solved, the Air Force offered its explanation.

601
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We're confident once the report is out and digested by the public that this will be the final word on the Roswell Incident.

602
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:08,000
The conclusion of the first report left no doubt that what was recovered near Roswell, New Mexico in July of 1947 was debris from a formerly top secret Army Air Force's research project codenamed Mogul.

603
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Project Mogul was so secret it had the same security classification as the project to build the atomic bomb.

604
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:23,000
These high-altitude balloons with their instrumentation were designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests.

605
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
They were tremendous in size, as long as 650 feet.

606
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And in 1947, nothing else on Earth looked like this.

607
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,000
When I began to look at the reports from that project and see the kinds of materials that were used.

608
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Weather balloons, aluminum foil-covered radar targets that had struts that had funny little markings in purple and pink all over them.

609
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And then I took a look at the descriptions of the genuine debris that was found.

610
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
It all matched. It all fit.

611
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:06,000
So the irony of all of this is that the great Roswell mystery, the great Roswell cover-up, arose from a real cover-up.

612
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
But the intent was not to protect knowledge of a crash-flying saucer, but to protect a very earthly project.

613
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:19,000
To this day, Roswell's true believers dismiss everything the Air Force had to say.

614
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
They believe the government cover-up continues.

615
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I think that Roswell has become an article of faith for many people.

616
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It happened, and that's all there is to it, and don't confuse me with the facts.

617
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I don't think that the hardcore believers will ever give up on Roswell.

618
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:48,000
They cling to a myth, a myth that here outside Roswell, in 1947, the question of are we alone was finally answered.

619
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It was not.

620
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
If you were to go to a UFO convention, and there are hundreds of them every year,

621
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
you will definitely find a lot of attention being paid to people who say they have been abducted by aliens.

622
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Reporting the UFO story is incomplete without this facet of it.

623
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
However you judge the people you're about to hear, bear this in mind.

624
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:35,000
The serious psychologists you will also meet tell us there's no reason to believe that your average abductee is any more psychiatrically impaired than the average person in the population.

625
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:44,000
We're perfectly normal people. We're probably your coworkers, your family, or your friends, and we're having quite extraordinary experiences.

626
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And we're all trying to understand what's happening to us, who's doing it, and why.

627
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I had gone down to bed that night when four of these beings came into my house.

628
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And I was still awake, laying down in my bed.

629
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I don't know where they came from, or how, but they came in very fast into the room heading toward me.

630
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And then they were all down the side of my bed, four of them, again, to my right.

631
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I turned to face them. I really literally thought I was going to die.

632
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
The beings measured three feet eleven. They appeared very cold.

633
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's really, really disturbing to be in a room with something that isn't supposed to exist.

634
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I was taken on the craft. I was brought to some very contained room.

635
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I can't talk about what was done there because it's too personal.

636
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It's just unbelievable.

637
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
They're in my room. They're in the room. The two are on my left.

638
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Two on the left? Yeah, they're with me again. They're on my left.

639
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Bud Hopkins is an artist who spent the last 25 years exploring his belief that aliens are among us and have been abducting people.

640
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And what do they look like? Four foot tall, four and a half foot tall.

641
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Hopkins records story after story of people being taken onto spaceships and then returned to Earth with their memory clouded or erased.

642
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I can't even move. I can't even move. I'm trying to.

643
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:52,000
As I've been working with abductees over the years, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, there seems to be no doubt that this has been going on for decades.

644
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Maybe not at the rate that it has been lately, but that nobody knew who to report this to and most people feel that it's just impossible that this could have happened to them.

645
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:13,000
It is Hopkins who has convinced a large part of the UFO community that the phenomenon of abduction is real.

646
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I've been collecting drawings, sketches people have made of what they remember inside craft and especially the faces of the aliens.

647
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I've been doing this for years and years since actually starting probably in 1975.

648
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Of course, the enormous cranium is the big feature. The mouth is very negligible, tiny, a slit.

649
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:44,000
But Hopkins was the first. He published books and magazine articles, made public appearances, and then others followed.

650
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Abduction is now a common theme in movies and television.

651
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:56,000
According to a Roper poll in 2002, one in five Americans believe that abductions have taken place.

652
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
For the so-called abductees, the memories of what they say they have experienced are deeply traumatic.

653
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Most of the abduction experiences that I've had have been from my bed in the middle of the night. This is not all, however, the great majority.

654
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I'll be in bed and I will somehow sense fear. I'll sense something in the room and at some point I can't move.

655
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I couldn't move my head left or right, but I could kind of look down at the foot of the bed and I saw people standing at the foot of my bed.

656
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I see these eyes. These eyes are just looking right through me.

657
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And then I don't remember anything. I woke up the following morning.

658
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:52,000
The person may remember the beginning of an experience and the ending, but they don't remember what happened in between.

659
01:08:53,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And they're quite tormented by this. They come to me and we proceed with the investigation.

660
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:09,000
In most cases, Hopkins uses hypnosis in what he says is a way to connect the person to memories that have allegedly been repressed.

661
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Just feeling comfortable, relaxed.

662
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Hypnosis has been extremely useful. When the person is physically relaxed, some of the static can be cleared away and the person has a clear recollection of what happened.

663
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:33,000
You're in bed. One, this is a long time ago. We're just going to see what it was. Two, right on the edge. Three.

664
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
He's looking at me very closely. I'm saying he, but I don't know. It feels like a he.

665
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:51,000
One of the things, of course, that caught my attention from the very beginning was the similarity of these cases and the details that were coming up over and over again.

666
01:09:51,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Through hypnotic regression, I came to realize that there was a spaceship maybe a hundred feet in the air off to the left of my front of my house.

667
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And an alien came in, was next to my next to my bed.

668
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:15,000
It put its hand out and I put my hand out, sort of a chalky skin, very dry to the touch.

669
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And I don't really remember how but suddenly we were sort of floating.

670
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:29,000
They brought me in front of a being that was so horrifying that I'll never be able to, you know, put it out of my memory.

671
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
It was a very tall, probably about seven foot tall.

672
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Very tall and very thin and very scary and sometimes almost like an insect. Very frightening to me.

673
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And I find myself in this room and I was lying on this stretcher and this being.

674
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I don't even know how to say this. He started to put my legs apart.

675
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:01,000
They put like a jock strap on here of some sort with a tube attached to it and it runs through a machine and they somehow extract sperm. I don't know how they do it.

676
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And this female brought a baby and she sort of handed him to me.

677
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
And I instantly said, this baby is mine, I know, I know he's mine.

678
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
She pulled the baby away from me and said, no, this baby is ours.

679
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Five are starting to wake up. Four waking up. Three almost awake. Two, one fully awake.

680
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I'm glad we did that. We didn't know those things.

681
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Bud has been looking at it for a long time and I very much like his understanding of it and how he helps people. He's a good man.

682
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Hopkins' reliance on hypnosis to recover memories is challenged by professional psychologists.

683
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:03,000
There is no evidence that hypnosis will help you retrieve memories or if it does retrieve memories that the memories that get retrieved are in fact accurate.

684
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:13,000
What does happen under hypnosis is that you feel that the experience is real or lends credibility to what's emerging.

685
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,000
But most likely what's emerging is the product of fantasy and of suggestion.

686
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Dr. Susan Clancy and other research psychologists at Harvard University who have worked with the abductees think that a common sleep disorder can explain much of the abduction experience.

687
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:42,000
The subjects that we interview, when we ask them how did this all begin, they describe an experience that sounds strikingly like sleep paralysis.

688
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
What happens is you wake up, usually it's in the middle of the night, and you feel terrified.

689
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:59,000
You're paralyzed, overwhelmed with fear. People report feeling the presence of something in the room or you might sort of see shapes or lights.

690
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
It's a very common experience.

691
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:09,000
What happens in one of these episodes is that a person is emerging from rapid eye movement sleep, REM sleep, the stage of sleep when we do most of our dreaming.

692
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,000
When we are in REM sleep, our entire body is paralyzed. It's probably a good thing, unless you act out our dreams.

693
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:26,000
But in one of these episodes, what happens is that the person's eyes can open, they can see their bedroom, they're awake, they're conscious, and they're also aware that they're totally paralyzed.

694
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:35,000
And suddenly they feel tingling sensations coursing through their body. They'll see lights flashing, sounds buzzing, and feel a sense of presence in the bedroom.

695
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
If you don't know what this is, it can be a very frightening experience.

696
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:47,000
These sorts of episodes have been reported throughout history and throughout cultures, the incubi, the succubi, the demons that used to visit people in the Middle Ages.

697
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
But in our subjects, these visitors in the bedroom are interpreted as aliens.

698
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And finally, these individuals, our subjects, will often go to hypnotherapists, often who believe in such things, and will then hypnotize them and do so-called regression sessions,

699
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
where they'll take the person back to the moment where they were paralyzed in bed and try to find out what happened next.

700
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:22,000
At that point, you get these quote unquote memories emerging of being taken out of the bedroom, through the window, up into a spaceship, being experimented upon by these alien beings,

701
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:30,000
participating in hybrid breeding and all sorts of other exotic adventures. And so at this point, you've got yourself an alien abductee.

702
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:37,000
The abductees reject any psychological explanation. They believe their experiences are real.

703
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:45,000
You know, it's not some vague apparition or something. These guys were three-dimensionally in the room with me.

704
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
What I remember is definitely real.

705
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
It was very real to me.

706
01:14:52,000 --> 01:15:00,000
These people were moved and terrified and touched by their memories and what they believe happened to them.

707
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And that's why they believe. I think if I had recovered a memory like that, I'd have a hard time just believing it too.

708
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:17,000
If this is real, it has to do with every single one of us. And we need to know more. I mean, there needs to be more questions asked, more.

709
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:26,000
It's important because there is life in the universe and we're babies, literally.

710
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
UFO Seeing is Believing will return in a moment.

711
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
UFO Seeing is Believing continues. Once again, Peter Jennings.

712
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Did you ever wonder what a civilization older than ours would look like, say a million years older than ours?

713
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:58,000
The American astronomer Carl Sagan often wondered, and we wonder too, because with all this talk of aliens visiting us, they must have some extraordinary means of travel.

714
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Earth may be the cradle of mankind, but we haven't gotten very far beyond the cradle. Our technology just isn't up to it.

715
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:14,000
The difficulty of going from star to star or of an alien spacecraft reaching here is simply not to be underestimated.

716
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Space travel is not just like the movies.

717
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Anybody who goes in the movies probably figures that interstellar travel is just a matter of having, you know, dilithium crystals and Scotty down in the engine room, and you can do it.

718
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
It's borderline on the simulator, Captain. A kind of guarantee that she'll hold up.

719
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Walk, drive, Mr. Scott.

720
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I don't mean to say that it's impossible to do it. I mean, it doesn't violate the laws of physics or the laws of physics.

721
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
A kind of guarantee that she'll hold up.

722
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Walk, drive, Mr. Scott.

723
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I don't mean to say that it's impossible to do it. I mean, it doesn't violate the laws of physics to go from one star system to another, but one shouldn't underestimate the difficulty of doing it simply because we see it done every night on television.

724
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:05,000
to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.

725
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,440
It's more than just a technological problem.

726
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,680
It's more than just building a better rocket.

727
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:20,120
The distances are so vast, the energy requirements are so extreme, it would be very, very difficult

728
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:24,260
to travel between the stars.

729
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:29,280
It is a law of science determined by Einstein that nothing can travel faster than the speed

730
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,440
of light, 186,000 miles per second.

731
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:38,960
The fastest object made by man takes along at 11 miles per second.

732
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:43,920
Voyager would take 73,000 years to reach the nearest star.

733
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,040
Scientifically, we have a rule.

734
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,560
You want to be alive at the end of your experiment, not dead.

735
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:56,200
So if you're going to be a part of a space expedition, you want to get there faster than

736
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,200
your lifespan.

737
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:05,120
I think the notion of transporting people, as some people think, to other planetary systems

738
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:16,440
beyond our own solar system is so far beyond plausible reality that it's a waste of time.

739
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:23,480
And if we can't go there, many scientists tend to believe they can't come here.

740
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:27,920
Some people slam the door on the question of other civilizations visiting the Earth

741
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,920
because distances are so far away.

742
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,760
I say not so fast.

743
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,000
...and the final death of the universe.

744
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,520
Dr. Michio Okaku is one of the leading theoretical physicists in the world.

745
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,640
He is a professor at the City University of New York.

746
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,240
Because Einstein's theory, space and time is a fabric.

747
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:53,080
The fundamental mistake people make when thinking about extraterrestrial intelligence is to

748
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:58,120
assume that they're just like us except a few hundred years more advanced.

749
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:05,120
I say open your mind, open your consciousness to the possibility that they are a million

750
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,560
years ahead.

751
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:12,200
A civilization that could harness the power of stars might be able to find a shortcut

752
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,920
through space and time.

753
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:18,160
Einstein said you cannot go faster than the speed of light.

754
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:22,320
However, he left a loophole open.

755
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,640
This is a wormhole.

756
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,520
You know, in school we learned that a straight line is the shortest distance between two

757
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,520
points.

758
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,080
But actually that's not true.

759
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:36,240
You see, if you fold a sheet of paper and punch a hole through it, you begin to realize

760
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:40,960
that a wormhole is the shortest distance between two points.

761
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:46,320
Only those civilizations, millions of years ahead of ours, capable of harnessing the power

762
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:52,440
of billions of star systems, have the ability perhaps to open gateways through space and

763
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:59,440
time to travel through portals to go these enormous distances in a blink of an eye.

764
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:05,640
A way perhaps for an alien vehicle to bridge the vastness of space.

765
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:12,800
You simply cannot dismiss the possibility that some of these UFO sightings are actually

766
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:18,040
sightings from some object created by an advanced civilization.

767
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:24,720
A civilization found out in space, a civilization perhaps millions of years ahead of us in technology,

768
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:29,560
you simply cannot discount that possibility.

769
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,480
I have no idea where it was from.

770
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:37,760
I just know that it was one, unidentified, and it was certainly flying.

771
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,800
It was a UFO, for sure.

772
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,160
My God, what did we just see?

773
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,160
What we saw.

774
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:47,240
And when you see something of that sort, your life is never, ever the same.

775
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:51,240
I mean, it is like it just happened yesterday.

776
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,800
I believe that the object that I saw was extraterrestrial.

777
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,960
You can't even sleep because you're thinking, what in the world was it?

778
01:20:58,960 --> 01:20:59,960
What was it?

779
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:00,960
And where it came from?

780
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,000
Where it came from?

781
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,800
We do not know.

782
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,960
I wish we did.

783
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:14,160
When you look at this handful, handful of cases that cannot be easily dismissed, this

784
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,440
is worthy.

785
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:19,360
This is worthy of scientific investigation.

786
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,080
Maybe there's nothing there.

787
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:26,840
However, on that off chance that there is something there, that could literally change

788
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,840
the course of human history.

789
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:34,400
So I say, let this investigation begin.

790
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:40,120
Peter Jennings reporting, UFOs Seeing is Believing will return in a moment.

791
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:45,600
Peter Jennings reporting, UFOs Seeing is Believing continues.

792
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,280
We have often wondered in the course of reporting on UFOs what we would do if we thought we

793
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,360
saw one, who we'd share it with.

794
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,840
Most people want to tell someone.

795
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,820
Today, if you call the local Air Force base or even the Federal Aviation Administration,

796
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:03,120
they will tell you they don't investigate UFOs.

797
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:10,680
But they may tell you to contact the National UFO Reporting Center.

798
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,880
The Center is in Seattle, Washington.

799
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:20,200
It is a clearing house for thousands of eyewitness reports that come in every year.

800
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:26,800
The National UFO Reporting Center is really one man, Peter Davenport, sitting alone at

801
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,400
his desk in the corner of his living room.

802
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:35,240
Davenport is the only person we met who devotes himself full time to collecting reports and

803
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:38,200
investigating UFO sightings.

804
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:43,120
This is the heart of the National UFO Reporting Center.

805
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:52,840
A telephone, my trusty tape recorder, spare tape recorder if I need it, reference materials

806
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,320
with regard to aircraft and a website.

807
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:00,320
That is UFO central, if you will, to coin a term.

808
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:07,320
As modest a facility, physically speaking, as modest as it is, we nevertheless can collect

809
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,800
a lot of information.

810
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:13,780
A lot of information from eyewitnesses to add to the already enormous record of sightings

811
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:16,320
going back more than 50 years.

812
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,440
Data that science ignores.

813
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,080
The proper stance is one of skepticism.

814
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:26,880
Because what we ufologists are saying is that the planet Earth is being visited on

815
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,680
a regular basis, perhaps on a daily basis.

816
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:31,680
There goes that line.

817
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,680
National UFO Reporting Center, good evening.

818
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,680
My name is Dr. Scott Crawford.

819
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,680
I'm calling from Miami, Florida.

820
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,680
I'm an amateur astronomer.

821
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,680
I was just outside my backyard.

822
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:51,680
I saw an object move from east to west over Miami.

823
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,280
How long did you see it, please?

824
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,280
About 10 seconds.

825
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,280
10 seconds.

826
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,280
National UFO Reporting Center, good evening.

827
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:02,280
The big white is like a big ball of white light.

828
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,280
And behind it was like this.

829
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,280
It had four cameras, like in front of it were five windows.

830
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,280
Very bright lights.

831
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,280
And I thought probably someone was looking out the windows.

832
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,280
No lights, no noise.

833
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:18,280
I'm going to guess it was going 1,000 miles an hour or faster.

834
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,280
I really don't know.

835
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,880
More than 50 years after Kenneth Arnold saw the first flying saucers,

836
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:29,880
it is left to Peter Davenport and only a few others to investigate this mystery.

837
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,880
It changed directions.

838
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,880
Twice.

839
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,880
Every day, seven days a week, Davenport talks to people,

840
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,880
sometimes dozens of people who have seen an object in the sky.

841
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:43,880
People for whom seeing is now believing.

842
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,880
Thank you very much. Good night.

843
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,880
Wow, this was a good one.

844
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,880
We're still hoping to find that golden nugget

845
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:59,880
that will make our position incontrovertible.

846
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,880
Namely, the fact that it appears that these things that we call UFOs

847
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,880
are visiting the planet Earth.

848
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,880
The golden nugget of ufology.

849
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,880
Something to elevate ufology to more than a shadow of mainstream science.

850
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:20,480
To convince the skeptics that UFOs are more than just lights in the sky.

851
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:29,480
Ultimately, the UFO believers and the scientists have one thing in common.

852
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:34,480
They dream of the day that there will be contact with extraterrestrials.

853
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:41,480
Ultimately, only contact is going to resolve the mystery.

854
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,880
It has been a very interesting journey.

855
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,880
I'm Peter Jennings. Thank you for joining us. Good night.

856
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:59,880
I've always believed that there could be something else.

857
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,880
I just believe we're not the only ones in the universe.

858
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,880
I believe that there is other intelligences.

859
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,880
I know UFOs exist because I've seen them.

860
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,880
People say, oh, it was 600 meters wide. How do you know?

861
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,880
It's in the sky. It's dark. What are you talking about?

862
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,880
They can't bring forth that one good case. I keep asking.

863
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,880
I think they're probably out there somewhere in the universe.

864
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,880
But I don't think they're hovering around Earth probing people.

865
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,880
I just don't think they're bothering us at all.

866
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:34,880
I know entities from elsewhere who know where exist because I've been in contact with them.

867
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,880
It's very straightforward.

868
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:41,880
If you just come in with a seat cushion from a UFO,

869
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:46,880
our piece of the wheel assembly or even a ballpoint pen from their dashboard, just something.

870
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,880
There's been no explanation for what we saw that night.

871
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:57,880
So it just hangs out there as one of the big question marks.
