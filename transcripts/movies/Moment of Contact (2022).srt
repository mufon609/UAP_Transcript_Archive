1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In January of 1996, North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD,

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
warns Brazilian authorities their radar has picked up UFO activity near Virginia, Brazil.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
By January 20th, news coverage across the globe explodes with stories of a UFO crash.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Strange creatures are reported by military and civilians in the town of Virginia.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Varginha is a Brazilian city located in the southern region of the state of Minas Jedi.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Varginha is considered the seventh best city in Brazil to live and invest,

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and became known internationally in 1996 for the alleged appearance of alien creatures

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
in the episode that became known as the Varginha incident.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This following story is based on truth and lies.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A strange creature was captured and then taken to another state.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The school principal read the official note, denying the whole story.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We have nothing to hide.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The tendency of the governments is to cover up everything they can't explain to their population.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Can she say what feeling she got from the creature?

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The Varginha case is considered the most well-kept secret in the military circles of Brazil.

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The Varginha case is considered the most well-kept secret in the military circles of Brazil.

17
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We're in Sao Paulo, Brazil, about to go and investigate the infamous 1996 Varginha UFO incident.

18
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's an alleged crash and reported bodies.

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So we're going to go see.

20
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, okay.

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh, yes.

22
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm basically trying to figure out what took place in Varginha, Brazil, January 1996.

23
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Many people say there was a UFO crash, debris and bodies recovered.

24
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My objective here in Brazil is to find out, put some clarity on what happened and where this debris ultimately ended up.

25
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They were captured and kept in captivity.

26
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then they were taken to the hospital here in the city and later they were removed from the city.

27
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So this is the daughter of one of the most famous UFO researchers in all of Brazil.

28
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah.

29
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And he is no longer with us.

30
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

31
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So she has brought some of his research, illustrations, documentation from the 1996 Varginha UFO incident.

32
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
An unidentified flying object, importantly crashes.

33
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And then you have beams associated with the craft alive and walking through the town.

34
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It sounds so spectacular.

35
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It sounds so unbelievable.

36
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's hard to wrap your mind around it.

37
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I didn't believe it when I first heard about it.

38
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is the design.

39
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The girls drew this for her father.

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's her father.

41
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah.

42
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They were in the fireman station.

43
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So this is the fireman.

44
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They believed this fireman was involved in the capture.

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And they saw a UFO that looked like it was definitely going to crash.

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Liliane and Valkyria, right after they saw the creature.

47
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

48
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Marco Cherisi.

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah.

50
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Who captured the creature with his bare hands.

51
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And later died.

53
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is an original artist's rendition of what the girls saw.

54
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wow.

55
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wow.

56
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Look at that.

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Brazil is one of the most amazing locations on earth.

58
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I mean, you've got Ubatuba in the 50s.

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You've got Clares, Aparazón Plateau.

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You've got 1986 UFOs over Brazil with Sao Paulo.

62
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It was amazing.

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I met with a radar operator.

64
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And then you have this crash in 1996 in Varginha.

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
These are some of the best cases in the world.

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
1957.

67
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Witnesses observe an object descending at extreme speed from the skies

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
toward Toninhas Beach.

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Before hitting the water, it explodes.

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Fragments collected on the beach are sent to a lab to be analyzed.

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This headline reads,

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Scientific Analysis Confirms Extraterrestrial Magnesium

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
from the Alleged Ubatuba Flying Saucer.

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Photographer Almiro Barraúna and the crew aboard a Brazilian Navy vessel

75
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
witness a disc-shaped object maneuvering over the ocean.

76
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He grabs his camera and takes these shots.

77
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
She had an immediate third degree contact.

78
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What was the size of the disc that you saw?

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It was a huge plate.

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
A huge plate.

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Inside the device, there was another person.

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But I don't know if it was a man or a woman.

83
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
When the disc came out,

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the lights went out.

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The lights of the building went out.

86
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The lights of the entire sanatorium went out.

87
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Previously classified Brazilian Air Force documents

88
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
contain accounts of several UFOs

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
witnessed by both civilians and military personnel.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We detected at least nine forms of objects.

91
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Shades.

92
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Ships.

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
A flying disc.

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
All reports were sent by the First Command to Brasilia.

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Shown here are several unknown craft captured on camera

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
by the Brazilian Air Force.

97
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Some officers even claimed to see occupants.

98
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
1986.

99
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Over São Paulo, six Brazilian fighter jets

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
chase more than a dozen UFOs.

101
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
A plane?

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Who are those guys? Three of them?

103
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Are there more of them?

104
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Wow!

105
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Here on Radio 6, there are 150 of them in front of the bank.

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
One of them is behind us.

107
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This week, high military authorities from Brazil...

108
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The Ministry of the Air Force confirms this encounter

109
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
in a press conference.

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The UFOs.

111
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Our goal was precisely to approach and identify.

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We couldn't even approach, much less identify.

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's a disc.

114
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I couldn't believe it.

115
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
When I saw the reaction, I thought,

116
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
how could it be?

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Then it went down very fast.

118
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It approached.

119
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't know what it's thinking.

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I got it.

121
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The object gets very close to the houses.

122
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It passes behind a post.

123
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It walks through the bay with irregular movements.

124
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't know how to explain what it was like

125
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
to do those movements.

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
She got to meet Carlos de Souza in 1996.

127
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He was the man who saw the UFO crash.

128
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Carlos' dream was something that marked me a lot.

129
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What caught my attention was his gestural communication.

130
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The body speaks.

131
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm a psychologist today,

132
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
so I have no doubt that he was telling the truth.

133
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Going back to 1996 and seeing the witnesses

134
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and seeing the location of the creatures,

135
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
seeing the original illustration,

136
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
the rendition of what the creature looked like

137
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
from 1996 and holding it in my hands,

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
it was fascinating.

139
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The photograph of the military man, Marco Cherizzi,

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
who apparently handled one of the creatures,

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
it just takes you back in time to 1996.

142
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It was just a really, really fortunate opportunity for us.

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm thrilled, and I can't wait to get to Virginia,

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
to be honest with you.

145
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I want to just say hypothetically for a moment,

146
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
if it did happen,

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
how significant of an event would it be?

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I bet you that everyone would say

149
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
there's nothing more significant in this story

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
if it was true.

151
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I just ask people to suspend judgment,

152
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
listen to the testimony,

153
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and then draw your own conclusions.

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hey, we're just going to drop me off for something,

155
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
get some drinks while they go around the block or wait.

156
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Upon arrival in Virginia,

157
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
the filmmakers want to hear from locals

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
regarding the alleged 1996 UFO crash.

159
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
A large monument in the shape of a flying saucer

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
is a clear indication that the town embraces the story.

161
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Armed with handmade signs that read,

162
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If anyone knows what happened in 1996,

163
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
please talk to us.

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The team takes to the streets.

165
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What does he think about the case?

166
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Does he think it happened or didn't happen?

167
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What are your feelings on Virginia?

168
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The 1996 Virginia UFO incident, what do you think?

169
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's a very vast universe,

170
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and it's very likely that it did happen.

171
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Things are heating up right now, guys.

172
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We're finding some witnesses.

173
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Both guys are really important here.

174
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay, let's bring it.

175
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
They see a UFO.

176
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The UFO gets closer to them

177
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
to the point where it's at the height of that streetlight.

178
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay, so then what happens?

179
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So...

180
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So, a lot of people in this town

181
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
have a little piece of the puzzle.

182
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We were only here for an hour and a half,

183
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and I can't believe how many people we got to come forward.

184
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What I love about this case is it's recent enough

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
where people either heard accounts

186
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
or experienced things themselves.

187
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So right now, we are going to meet

188
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
with the mayor of Virginia.

189
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So I'm very curious if an elected official

190
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
will talk about the details of the case

191
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and whether he believes it really happened.

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
These sorts of things.

193
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Good morning.

194
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Good morning. Thank you.

195
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Thank you.

196
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Water?

197
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes.

198
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Good afternoon, Deborah.

199
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Look at this.

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh, that's nice.

201
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's great.

202
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Verge.

203
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm extremely curious.

204
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
As an elected official,

205
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
the mayor of Virginia,

206
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
does he believe that this case happened

207
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
as the witnesses are reporting it to have happened?

208
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This is not an obituary, it's a person who died

209
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and who was part of that moment,

210
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
who is a police officer.

211
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And the girls I had contact with,

212
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
including one of them,

213
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
was the girlfriend of a nephew of mine for a long time.

214
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So I have the conviction that it really happened,

215
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
in fact.

216
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I didn't witness it, but the reports of the people

217
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
make me believe that it really happened.

218
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The witnesses in Virginia, for me,

219
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
are some of the most compelling testimony I've ever heard.

220
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So I didn't believe that a UFO crashed in Virginia, Brazil,

221
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
when I first came here.

222
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But after 10 years, I've been here...

223
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I wouldn't have imagined getting an interview

224
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
with an elected official like the mayor of Virginia.

225
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If you would have told me I'd be doing that 10 years ago,

226
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I wouldn't have believed it.

227
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Not only that, but he was basically saying

228
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
that he felt that the Virginia case was true,

229
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
that it really happened.

230
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I think we have to remind ourselves

231
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
how far we've come in the last decade.

232
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Put me on that farm in January of 1996.

233
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What happened?

234
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It was the size of a micro-bus.

235
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The size of a micro-bus.

236
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And there was no sound.

237
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We kept watching it because it was smoky.

238
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It was covered in smoke, of course.

239
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But I even played with it.

240
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What was that? A submarine?

241
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Because it was working, right?

242
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Then he kept looking at it until it disappeared.

243
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I was standing still, right?

244
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Because I kept listening to the noise,

245
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
to make some noise.

246
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
In the window of the car, he was looking.

247
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The shape of a...

248
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Like a chariot.

249
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You know what I mean?

250
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Like a chariot.

251
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Because of the speed it was, it looked like it was in trouble.

252
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm very slow.

253
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
1996.

254
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Crash witness Carlos de Souza

255
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
describes a similar object in this exclusive interview.

256
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm here today to tell my story.

257
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
January 13, 1996.

258
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Carlos de Souza is traveling from São Paulo to Minas Gerais

259
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
early in the morning,

260
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
planning to meet with friends to fly ultralight planes.

261
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
In this direction,

262
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
with this broken part,

263
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
he went towards the highway.

264
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I was passing by the highway down there.

265
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He was about...

266
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
400, 300 meters, more or less.

267
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And he was losing altitude.

268
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Losing altitude.

269
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
He went to the road.

270
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He made a 360-degree turn.

271
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And he kept losing altitude.

272
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
He gained altitude again.

273
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And when he got to the place I'm about 100, 150 meters from,

274
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
he totally lost his engines

275
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and he went down.

276
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
As if he had lost his sustainability.

277
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
He totally lost it and fell to the ground.

278
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
There must be some people in there

279
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and these people will need help right now.

280
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Now, 26 years later,

281
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the team travels with Carlos de Souza to find the crash site.

282
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Turn around.

283
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Right.

284
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Be careful of the dust.

285
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He's trying to remember.

286
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So where did the trees go?

287
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,540
If they don't... How did you know they were there?

288
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,380
I don't remember. I was 26 years old.

289
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,800
He doesn't...

290
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,040
26 years old.

291
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,220
I remember he has a house on the hill.

292
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,720
Is this looking familiar? There's a house up there.

293
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,020
But if it's close to a house,

294
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,680
then it's got to be further down this way.

295
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,020
Unless the house is gone.

296
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,520
I think the house is gone.

297
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,560
You do?

298
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,560
I'm not sure if it's this way.

299
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Maybe it's up here.

300
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
It was like this, up here, you see?

301
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,060
It was something like this.

302
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,560
But there were trees on this side,

303
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,060
there was a bush on the other side, some trees,

304
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
and there was a very big path here.

305
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,060
I mean, I could...

306
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Very big.

307
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,560
More or less around here.

308
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Will you take a look over there?

309
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
He says he needs to stop.

310
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Yeah, stop.

311
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Yes, please. Let me...

312
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
All right, let's go.

313
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Okay.

314
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
Okay.

315
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,060
What does that mean?

316
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,560
Yeah, like, at the grass, it was around here.

317
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Okay.

318
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
He wants to go there.

319
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Okay, okay.

320
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Okay.

321
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,560
So it was a white house, and it was a small house.

322
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Yeah, it was a small house, and the grass was burned.

323
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,060
The grass was burned.

324
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,560
Why was the grass burned?

325
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,560
So is the house gone?

326
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
It was around here.

327
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,060
So the house is gone.

328
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Yeah.

329
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,060
I mean, it could be here, or it could be there.

330
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,060
We walk over to there, and look.

331
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,060
If it's close to the road,

332
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,060
it only can be in a couple places.

333
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,060
Does he want to walk up closer to...

334
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,060
He said the house was close to where the crash was.

335
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,060
Yeah.

336
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,060
200 meters.

337
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
Yeah, it's like...

338
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,060
600 feet.

339
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,060
Well, I say we...

340
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,060
I say we take a closer look.

341
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,060
I mean...

342
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
Yeah.

343
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
You know?

344
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
But it's not...

345
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,060
Yeah, we got to do it, man.

346
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,060
We got to find this spot.

347
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,060
Is there a house down there?

348
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
Right down through these trees?

349
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
Yeah.

350
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,060
Well, let's get closer to there, then.

351
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,060
Let's drive down the road.

352
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
Let's drive down to get closer.

353
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,060
There is a house.

354
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
This is a field.

355
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
Yes, yes, yes.

356
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,940
Mm.

357
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,220
Aqui, oh.

358
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,640
Aqui.

359
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,520
Aqui, aquí, oh.

360
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,360
Aqui.

361
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,480
Aqui, oh.

362
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,280
Aqui, aqui.

363
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,180
Aqui.

364
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,860
Aqui, oh.

365
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,640
Aqui.

366
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,340
Wow.

367
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,040
Aqui.

368
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,760
Aqui.

369
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,240
Aqui.

370
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Here.

371
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Here.

372
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
It was here.

373
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Here.

374
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
This tree was gone.

375
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
So you see the house there.

376
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Here.

377
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,240
It came, hit, lifted, spread.

378
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Spread.

379
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
Here.

380
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Here.

381
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Here.

382
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Here.

383
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
It was here.

384
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
Here.

385
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Here.

386
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Here.

387
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
The fence of the house was that one.

388
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
It was here that it fell.

389
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
This is the spot.

390
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
The beings died here.

391
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,240
Was this object big enough to have potentially beings inside?

392
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,240
According to Mr. Sosa, this area was covered with debris from the UFO crash.

393
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,240
This is his first time at the crash site since 1996.

394
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
I immediately smelled ammonia.

395
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
It smelled like rotten eggs.

396
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
A very strong smell.

397
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,240
I had to cover my nose with the shirt I was wearing.

398
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,240
To be able to get close to my eyes, I was already dizzy.

399
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,240
The first thing I noticed was that it was something very different

400
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
from what I was expecting.

401
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,240
First, the smell.

402
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,240
It didn't make sense, that smell.

403
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,240
I saw a piece of aluminum.

404
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,240
It was a piece of paper that you wrap chicken in to roast.

405
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,240
I grabbed the paper and I grabbed a chair.

406
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
It was very light.

407
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
A chair.

408
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,240
But when I let go of it, it came back in the same shape.

409
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,240
So he gets out of the car, he sees the piece, right?

410
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,240
He picks the piece up, he folds it.

411
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,240
He said it was really light and it was shaped kind of like this.

412
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Yeah.

413
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,240
And then he picks it up and he folds it in and it opens itself up.

414
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
And it was really light.

415
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
Yes.

416
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Like aluminum.

417
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,240
At what point did the military come to him right after that happened?

418
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Yes.

419
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
The military came from this way and arrived.

420
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
Yeah.

421
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Carlos Sosa came from here and the trucks came from that side.

422
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Okay.

423
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Within minutes, trucks from the military base ESA arrive on the scene.

424
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Go, go.

425
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Yeah.

426
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Send him away.

427
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
Send him away?

428
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,240
I think some guy...

429
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Go away, go away, go away, go away, push him away.

430
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,240
No, but...

431
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Go away.

432
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Send him away, send him away.

433
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm ordering you to go away.

434
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
What does bora mean?

435
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
Go away, go away, go away.

436
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Go away?

437
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Go away.

438
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
And I'm ordering you.

439
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
I'm ordering you.

440
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Yeah.

441
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
I'm ordering you to go away.

442
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Yeah.

443
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,240
So then he pulled his gun out and said, I'm ordering you to go away.

444
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

445
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Here.

446
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Wow.

447
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

448
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,240
After giving this interview shortly after the incident,

449
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,240
Carlos de Sosa vanishes for 26 years.

450
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Can we just walk to exactly where this took place?

451
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,240
Seven days after Sosa witnessed the crash,

452
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Ruber Ladeira leaves this gym

453
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,240
when he and several friends see two military trucks driving into town.

454
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
They follow them through the neighborhood

455
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,240
and come upon a military blockade.

456
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
They follow them through the neighborhood

457
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,240
and come upon a military blockade.

458
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,240
One of the people in his group said this is a free country and I'm going through.

459
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
It was him.

460
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
Oh, it was him?

461
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
So he...

462
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,240
So he said, hey, this is a free country, I'll do what I want, and then what happens?

463
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
So...

464
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,240
This is the local TV news station that covered the case back in 1996.

465
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,240
He was deeply involved.

466
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
He was also good friends with Marco Turizi,

467
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,240
who's the military police officer who allegedly handled the creature and then died.

468
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
Thank you.

469
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Yes, of course.

470
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Absolutely.

471
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Describe what happened back in 1996.

472
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,240
It was the first time that a military police officer

473
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Absolutely.

474
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Describe what happened back in 1996, what you witnessed, what you saw.

475
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Well, I know the city.

476
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
There was a light.

477
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,240
I said, well, I'm going that way because I'm going down.

478
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,240
But when we got there, there were army trucks.

479
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Oh, no, you can't go through here.

480
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
Why can't I go through?

481
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,240
No, it's a national security issue.

482
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Oh, no, but then I'm going down because I'm going...

483
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,240
No, you can't go to a national security issue either.

484
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
It didn't make sense to us.

485
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,240
Or rather, it made sense as we were convinced

486
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,240
that there was something going on and a process of covering up.

487
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,240
There's another part, when there were interviews,

488
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,240
when it was Euclides and Calado, the two boys from here,

489
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,240
they went to the Sergeant of the Weapons School of Three Hearts.

490
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,240
Then they came to ask a question.

491
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,240
Then the sergeant went in there, came back.

492
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
Then he came back.

493
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
No, but you're not going to say anything about the case.

494
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,240
If you ask one more question, you're going to be arrested.

495
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
From ESA.

496
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
From ESA.

497
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,240
It was Euclides and Calado.

498
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,240
If they were to, like, investigate further,

499
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,240
they probably would have put them in jail.

500
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Okay, I'll quickly mention.

501
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:33,240
So we have special authorization from the city of Varginha.

502
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,240
And we have a universal key,

503
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,240
which is provided to us by, I think, Katia's husband.

504
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,240
And so we're going to film the use of the special key

505
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,240
to gain access to the exact location

506
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,240
where the encounter occurred back in January of 1996.

507
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Action.

508
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
Again.

509
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
There we go.

510
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
See how easy that was?

511
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,240
I wanted to film here because this is obviously going to invoke

512
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
memories of the encounter.

513
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
And I think that we're going to get a more dramatic,

514
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
more real on-camera testimony from the girls doing it here

515
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,240
as opposed to somewhere else.

516
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,240
Media across Brazil and the world cover the story.

517
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Tell us, walk us through what happened.

518
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,240
What did you see? Where did you see it?

519
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
So, passing through here.

520
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,240
I passed by and it caught my attention,

521
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,240
the design of the lock.

522
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
And I looked.

523
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,240
I saw the creature.

524
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
When Liliane screamed and I looked,

525
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
I felt, like, afraid.

526
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
So I looked in the eyes

527
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,240
and I saw that he was terrified.

528
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,240
I was terrified. The creature was terrified too.

529
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Because what I saw held me back.

530
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,240
It held me back here in that place.

531
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,240
But I saw that he was afraid of us.

532
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,240
So, it was a exchange of fears,

533
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,240
both him and us.

534
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,240
But the red eyes, the skin and the lily,

535
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,240
you couldn't see it with your mouth open, laughing,

536
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,240
no, happy, no, sad,

537
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
and it didn't end.

538
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
1996.

539
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
Based on the girl's testimony,

540
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,240
artist Betty Rodriguez creates this drawing.

541
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,240
What I find makes their story so credible

542
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,240
is that there were three of them.

543
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
I want to hear from Valkyria,

544
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
because she was the youngest.

545
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,240
What were her thoughts at the time?

546
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Did you run? Like, put me there.

547
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
She was a creature

548
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
that was in a corner,

549
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
leaning, afraid.

550
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
The fear of us,

551
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
the same way that we were afraid

552
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,240
of this being that we don't know what it is.

553
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,240
These eyes, compared to my eyes,

554
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
how much bigger?

555
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Three times bigger.

556
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
Three times bigger.

557
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
I want to walk over by the wall

558
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
and I want you to tell me

559
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
where exactly the creature was.

560
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
The creature there.

561
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,240
Wow!

562
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,240
And we passed by here.

563
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,240
Really close.

564
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Then I screamed,

565
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
ran out,

566
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
and the two came.

567
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
I didn't realize

568
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
that's closer than I expected.

569
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
It's like eight feet away.

570
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
They were eight feet away from this creature,

571
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
broad daylight.

572
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
It was 3.30 in the afternoon.

573
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,240
This is the exact location

574
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
when she made eye contact

575
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
with this creature.

576
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
Was there a moment of any kind of communication?

577
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
Did she feel anything at all?

578
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,240
The heat, the sun, the skin.

579
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,240
OK, so this is Valkyria.

580
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,240
This is Katya.

581
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,240
And this is Liliane.

582
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,240
You see the eyes.

583
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,240
They didn't draw a nose, they didn't draw a mouth.

584
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
It was all about the eyes.

585
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,240
I want to understand,

586
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,240
first of all, the moment of contact

587
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,240
with the eyes,

588
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,240
meeting the eyes.

589
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,240
I really want to be there, I want to feel it.

590
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,240
When they locked eyes with this being,

591
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
what were they thinking?

592
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,240
They all ran out of here quickly.

593
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,240
So they were scared.

594
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,240
Were they scared because they felt threatened?

595
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
Or were they scared because

596
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,240
they just simply didn't know what they were looking at?

597
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
I remember when we came down

598
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
and we were all scared,

599
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
scared, running, then we stopped.

600
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
But down there,

601
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,240
the three of us stopped like this.

602
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,240
What happened? What did you see?

603
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,240
So the three of us saw the same thing.

604
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Let's run.

605
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
And we ran until we got to my mother's house.

606
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,240
I saw the girls meeting

607
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,240
because mothers

608
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,240
have a feeling.

609
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,240
Then I saw Katya

610
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,240
almost carrying this one

611
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,240
or vice versa,

612
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
I don't know.

613
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,240
I saw them very nervous,

614
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,240
walking slowly, one dragging the other.

615
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,240
At the time, we were

616
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,240
always children, we were children of

617
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,240
Catholic people,

618
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,240
who could be demons.

619
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
That's why we were afraid

620
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,240
at the time.

621
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,240
And do they

622
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
get in the car and drive here?

623
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
Do they walk here? How did they get here?

624
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
And what did they see when they got here?

625
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,240
Can she draw

626
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,240
the footprint,

627
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,240
the shape of the footprint?

628
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Here.

629
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
See, see, see.

630
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,240
Small finger, long finger,

631
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,240
and another finger like this.

632
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,240
It was this

633
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,240
that I saw on the ground.

634
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,240
I couldn't stand the smell

635
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
here in my nose

636
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,240
for twenty days.

637
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,240
I don't know where

638
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,240
that smell came from.

639
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,240
I washed my nose with alcohol and water

640
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,240
to get rid of that smell.

641
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,240
That strong smell.

642
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,240
Ammonic.

643
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,240
It's not ammonic.

644
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,240
It's a smell.

645
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,240
No, it's worse than...

646
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,240
I don't know, because for me it was ammonic.

647
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,240
What a strange smell.

648
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,240
Let's go.

649
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,240
Then I took it like this and said, let's go.

650
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,240
That's the exact location

651
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,240
where the girls saw the creature right through that wall

652
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,240
where we filmed already with the girls.

653
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,240
I didn't realize that Marco Ciresi,

654
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,240
the military officer who allegedly

655
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,240
captured the creature with his bare hands,

656
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,240
did it right over here.

657
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,240
Roughly three hours after the girls

658
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,240
witnessed the strange creature,

659
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
military police officers

660
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,240
Eric Lopes and Marco Ciresi

661
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,240
drive down this road

662
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,240
on the lookout for something unusual

663
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,240
when suddenly it runs right across their path.

664
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,240
It was captured by Marco Ciresi

665
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,240
with his bare hands

666
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,240
easily and taken to the hospital.

667
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,240
After he captured the creature,

668
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,240
he was smelling

669
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,240
the creature in his body

670
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,240
and in his clothes

671
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,240
because he had this

672
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,240
strange feeling of something greasy,

673
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,240
sticky over his body

674
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,240
that came from the creature.

675
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,240
He developed this

676
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,240
disinfection

677
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,240
that wouldn't go away.

678
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,240
And for two or three weeks

679
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,240
the creature was

680
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,240
getting worse and worse

681
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,240
and worse.

682
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,240
And it looks like that his immunity

683
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,240
system was shut down.

684
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,240
These were the words

685
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,240
used by one of the doctors

686
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,240
who treated him

687
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,240
who said that he never

688
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,240
saw in his whole

689
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,240
medical career

690
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,240
anything like that.

691
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,240
And that infection

692
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,240
killed him.

693
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,240
I had to work

694
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,240
to take care of

695
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,240
Marco Ciresi

696
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,240
who was the soldier

697
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,240
who said he was involved

698
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,240
in the case at the time.

699
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,240
And we

700
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,240
took him to the ICU

701
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,240
and did all the treatments

702
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,240
and he died

703
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,240
from an undetermined cause

704
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,240
an unknown cause

705
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,240
at the time

706
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,240
by us doctors.

707
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,240
All the witnesses

708
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,240
that claim

709
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,240
that Marco Ciresi

710
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
handled a creature

711
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,240
a strange creature

712
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,240
it doesn't have to be from another world

713
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,240
it was a strange creature

714
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,240
he gets some unknown infection

715
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,240
you did everything you could to save him

716
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,240
and he died.

717
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,240
Do you believe that there's some credibility

718
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,240
to that story?

719
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,240
It's like a downfall

720
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,240
to try

721
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,240
to help himself

722
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,240
to save his life

723
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,240
because he realized

724
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,240
that he was going

725
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,240
and according to his sister

726
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,240
he was prevented

727
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,240
from reporting this.

728
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,240
Marco Eli Ciresi

729
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,240
of 23 years old

730
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,240
the family only knows

731
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,240
that he participated in a secret operation

732
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,240
do you confirm

733
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,240
that your brother was on duty

734
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,240
on that 20th? I confirm.

735
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,240
My name is Marta, Marta Tavares

736
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,240
your sister from the military

737
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,240
who got involved in the case

738
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,240
of the alien in January 1996.

739
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,240
When her brother falls ill

740
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,240
she asks about his involvement

741
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,240
with the case.

742
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,240
Is it really true?

743
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,240
His answer is

744
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,240
look, this story is going to be a pain in the ass.

745
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,240
On February 10th

746
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,240
Marco Ciresi

747
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,240
is admitted to Regional Hospital.

748
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,240
He went to the CTI

749
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,240
at 7am

750
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,240
he said to me

751
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,240
try to find out what I have

752
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,240
because I want to know what I have

753
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,240
I'm not feeling anything

754
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,240
he went to the CTI

755
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Dr. Luiz Severo

756
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Luiz Alberto Severo

757
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,240
who was the Plantonista of the CTI

758
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,240
asked for the funeral

759
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,240
to be done as soon as possible.

760
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
In this test

761
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,240
he says

762
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,240
that he has a presence

763
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,240
of toxic granulations

764
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,240
in 8% neutrophils

765
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,240
where an unidentified substance

766
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,240
was acquired

767
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,240
therefore

768
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,240
he died of a general infection

769
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,240
but without a cause

770
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,240
just.

771
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,240
Roger, what's the main purpose that you go to Virginia

772
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,240
for a nephrological research?

773
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,240
The main purpose for being here

774
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,240
is to look at the

775
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,240
physical evidence

776
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,240
aspect of this case

777
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,240
which is what I specialize in.

778
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,240
It is

779
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,240
June the 7th

780
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,240
2002 and

781
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,240
I'm here in Virginia, Brazil

782
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,240
with the

783
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,240
Chief Investigator

784
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,240
on the Virginia episode

785
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,240
Ubajar Rodriguez.

786
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:25,240
2002

787
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,240
renowned UFO researcher

788
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,240
Dr. Roger Lear

789
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,240
travels to Virginia

790
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,240
to investigate the case.

791
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,240
He documents

792
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,240
multiple key witnesses on video.

793
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,240
This footage

794
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,240
has never been released.

795
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,240
She is the wife

796
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,240
of a deceased

797
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,240
member of the military

798
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,240
police. I think we should at least

799
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,240
know what her husband's name was.

800
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,240
Does she know if anyone has seen

801
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,240
a medical report?

802
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,240
They took a long time to deliver it

803
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,240
and they asked for money and they

804
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,240
were missing pages.

805
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,240
She searched

806
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,240
for explanation but nobody would give any.

807
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,240
Was Marco Alicciresi the only person

808
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,240
infected

809
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,240
who died? We don't know.

810
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,240
Were

811
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,240
these two creatures the only

812
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,240
ones that remained alive after

813
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,240
the crash? We don't know.

814
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,240
We only have

815
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,240
very detailed

816
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,240
information about

817
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,240
the existence and the capture

818
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,240
of these two. One captured in

819
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,240
the morning and one at evening

820
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,240
of the same day

821
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,240
January 20, 1996.

822
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,240
According to credible reports

823
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
there were two captures on January

824
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,240
20th.

825
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,240
Hours before the girls' encounter

826
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,240
the fire brigade captured

827
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,240
a being.

828
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,240
This capture was thoroughly investigated

829
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,240
by leading Brazilian researcher

830
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,240
and lawyer,

831
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,240
Ubirajara Rodriguez.

832
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,240
The lawyer and professor

833
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Ubirajara Rodriguez, who is also

834
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,240
an ufologist, said on TV

835
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
that he found evidence that the story

836
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,240
is authentic.

837
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,240
We are not going to abandon the case.

838
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,240
Obviously not. All the information will be

839
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,240
welcome.

840
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,240
This is the fire department that

841
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,240
responded. Dr. Lear teamed up

842
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,240
with Ubirajara. They questioned

843
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,240
the fire battalion allegedly involved

844
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,240
in the capture of the first creature.

845
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,240
This is the creature.

846
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,240
This is the kind of equipment

847
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,240
that is used to catch it.

848
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,240
The fire department

849
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,240
was dispatched to this location

850
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,240
after receiving several calls

851
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,240
from concerned residents who

852
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,240
reported seeing something strange

853
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,240
in the area.

854
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,240
You have problems like

855
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,240
a marimbu box, a pet, a dog...

856
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,240
The fire brigade.

857
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,240
The fire brigade was assigned.

858
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,240
They themselves didn't know what they would do

859
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,240
when they arrived here.

860
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,240
We went looking for other witnesses

861
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,240
and found content.

862
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,240
We were up there, we went down

863
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,240
to the fire brigade and immediately saw

864
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,240
people saying that the fire brigade caught

865
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,240
an animal right here.

866
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,240
Was it strange? Was it an animal?

867
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,240
What kind of comments did they make?

868
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,240
I cried a lot. I cried like a child.

869
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,240
And because two arrests have occurred

870
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,240
on the part of the bomber's body in the morning

871
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,240
and on the part of the military police in the afternoon.

872
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,240
The army truck entered by this gate here,

873
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,240
got in over here.

874
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,240
Did it catch the creature?

875
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,240
It took the dead creature from inside.

876
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,240
Got the creature already dead from inside.

877
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,240
In the presence of several elements of the military police of the ICERC

878
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,240
and the presence of several elements from the military police,

879
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,240
from the army, several doctors, nurses.

880
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:32,240
And this convoy left the place.

881
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,240
Both creatures left at the same time.

882
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:42,240
And the creature that was alive got to Campinas alive.

883
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,240
The team drives to meet with a family who saw a UFO

884
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,240
hovering over the area of the encounter and capture.

885
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:04,240
The team drives to meet with a family who saw a UFO

886
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:09,240
hovering over the area of the encounter and capture.

887
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,240
Okay, let me ask.

888
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,240
How about we film the back of their heads talking to me?

889
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,240
No, I don't want to.

890
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,240
No, you're not going to show the sir.

891
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,240
Hey, I'm just going to tell you the story.

892
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,240
Hey, Fernanda, we have two options, okay?

893
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,240
One, we blur his faces, no problem, and we will do that.

894
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,240
Two, we film from the backside,

895
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,240
and their faces aren't seen ever.

896
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:42,240
Like doctors, and they all saw the UFO right over this area.

897
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,240
It looked like they were looking for something,

898
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,240
like it was doing a grid search.

899
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,240
And this is a very respectable family.

900
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,240
They don't want their faces on camera.

901
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,240
They want to talk and tell what they saw,

902
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,240
but they don't want their faces revealed on camera,

903
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,240
which happens.

904
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,240
Okay, so we're standing in very near the area

905
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,240
where the girl saw the creature.

906
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,240
It was 1996, January.

907
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,240
This entire family saw something they want to share with us,

908
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,240
but they don't want to have their faces revealed.

909
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,240
So what did they see?

910
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,240
It was all...

911
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,240
Like you can see on this wall,

912
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,240
there was nothing abnormal.

913
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,240
It was something like...

914
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,240
I don't know if it's from another planet,

915
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,240
I don't know what it is.

916
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,240
It was an album, I was going to sleep.

917
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,240
There was no way, I don't know.

918
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,240
And I was still...

919
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,240
Now I can tell you how many minutes

920
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,240
they were with me on the star.

921
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,240
Every 15 minutes.

922
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,240
And I was looking at each other.

923
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,240
Stopped.

924
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,240
Stopped and doing this.

925
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,240
And I was looking for something around here.

926
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,240
It was very red.

927
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,240
But it was red, red, and very patched up.

928
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,240
And I was looking.

929
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,240
I was crazy about something.

930
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,240
And we kept looking.

931
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,240
What I'm seeing here today,

932
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,240
I'll never see again in my life.

933
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,240
I don't know why God gave me this opportunity to see.

934
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,240
Is it real?

935
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,240
Did this happen?

936
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,240
There's no way, I don't know.

937
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,240
This case of Virginia was real.

938
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,240
I think it was a week or so.

939
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,240
It was.

940
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,240
Then people came.

941
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,240
They turned around.

942
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,240
Yeah, yeah.

943
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,240
The phologus came.

944
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
The people from NASA came.

945
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,240
From NASA?

946
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,240
I don't know.

947
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,240
They were Americans too.

948
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
They came here.

949
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,240
They stayed for a long time talking to us at night.

950
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,240
And one of them called me and said,

951
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,240
this conversation didn't take place.

952
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,240
They left.

953
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,240
Did I hear...

954
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,240
I heard Americana.

955
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,240
You say the American.

956
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,240
Yes.

957
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,240
What was that about?

958
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:11,240
Some American officials came here to talk about what they saw.

959
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,240
Americans.

960
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,240
Were they military?

961
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,240
Were they police?

962
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,240
Who were they?

963
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:41,240
Is there any way that there is a conventional explanation to what they saw?

964
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:12,240
I just want to go over that interview and what I find.

965
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,240
First of all, they hesitated on whether or not they even wanted to go on camera.

966
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,240
They cancelled yesterday.

967
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,240
Today they were like, we don't want...

968
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,240
Sorry, bus coming.

969
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
We don't want our faces on camera.

970
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:30,240
It was like an entire family and they all saw this object and it was really big,

971
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,240
shaped like a disc.

972
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,240
Zero noise.

973
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,240
You have witnesses like that.

974
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,240
They're friends of the doctor, the guy that we rent the house from,

975
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,240
that you could just tell they've been sitting on that story for 26 years,

976
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,240
how excited he was to finally share it.

977
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,240
GUNSHOTS

978
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,240
It was a normal day when suddenly, on the school's pole field,

979
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,240
this marine helicopter came down to me.

980
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:35,240
And then there was a big movement of cars from the Navy entering the barracks.

981
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:44,240
I was in the line at the bank, normal to receive, when I saw a Navy truck standing on the side of the infirmary,

982
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,240
and they put a metal box in a hurry.

983
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:56,240
There was unusual activity at the base.

984
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:02,240
There were helicopters from the Navy, which in itself was unusual.

985
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:07,240
He sees a box. Was the box unusual?

986
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:24,240
The Navy guys wanted to hurry. With that line at the bank, the guys left.

987
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:37,240
The school commander explained that he was having some rumors that they were in Varginha to get a creature.

988
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:45,240
That this creature was there, that the whole press was wanting to get in from the barracks.

989
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:51,240
It was very strange. Very strange.

990
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:56,240
In my company, because it was the company that was most directly involved in this matter,

991
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,240
because it was the case that transported,

992
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:08,240
so within my company I avoided talking.

993
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,240
Then these drivers who were going to Varginha were called up there,

994
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,240
at the command of the battalion in the pavilion, and we never saw them again.

995
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:22,240
So to this day, has he spoken to any of them that went to Varginha?

996
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,240
No. No.

997
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,240
Nothing?

998
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,240
Yes.

999
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:37,240
According to the witness, it wasn't only the drivers who were never seen again.

1000
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:43,240
Their captain, Edson Ramirez, also left without a word.

1001
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:47,240
He went to Brasília.

1002
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:52,240
He was a person who was very friendly to everyone, he talked to everyone, he could help everyone.

1003
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,240
He was not a person who would simply say, tomorrow I'm going away, I'm not going to ask anyone.

1004
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,240
January 1996.

1005
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:08,240
A radiologist has an unexpected visit by the military while on duty at Regional Hospital.

1006
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:14,240
He agrees to share his story, provided his identity remains concealed.

1007
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:20,240
There was an unexpected visit by the military while on duty at Regional Hospital.

1008
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:26,240
He agrees to share his story, provided his identity remains concealed.

1009
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:32,240
Inside the ward, with the door closed, there was a military ESA truck.

1010
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:41,240
Inside the ward, there was another military jeep, and I think there were about 8 to 10 police vehicles.

1011
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,240
No one entered and no one left.

1012
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,240
So we have a big military presence on the outside of the hospital.

1013
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:55,240
We got two army and two police on the inside of the hospital with a box and something inside of a black zipped body bag.

1014
01:06:55,240 --> 01:07:00,240
They asked me to do the radiography of the parts that were requested.

1015
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:08,240
Cranial, cervical spine, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, legs and arms.

1016
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,240
Their gaze was fixed.

1017
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:21,240
I was observing myself all the time I was doing it, but they didn't say anything.

1018
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,240
They didn't even communicate with each other.

1019
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:33,240
The revelations were made and at that moment I didn't even see any danger.

1020
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,240
I didn't see anything.

1021
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,240
It was all collected by the military on the day.

1022
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,240
Normally I check the images to see if they are within the standard.

1023
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,240
But that day was not checked by me.

1024
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:51,240
Do you understand?

1025
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:57,240
One of the people inside, you did your job, thank you very much.

1026
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:03,240
End here, don't say anything about what you saw, what you did.

1027
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,240
What did it smell like?

1028
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:12,240
It smelled strong, mixed with a kind of sulfur or ammonia.

1029
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:19,240
When they took whatever it was in that black bag and they left the hospital,

1030
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:26,240
the military and the police, with that bag and that thing, did the smell leave?

1031
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,240
The smell still remained the next day.

1032
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,240
The people were complaining.

1033
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,240
They were impregnating me with my breathing.

1034
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,240
It felt like I was breathing.

1035
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:54,240
I felt it for three or four days.

1036
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:05,240
Three of the most strange, bizarre points of this encounter.

1037
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:12,240
The first thing I found strange was that they had selected me to do this type of procedure.

1038
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,240
That could have been done by any professional at the time.

1039
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,240
Another thing is to get there and ask for a seal.

1040
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,240
A seal on everything that was done in that room.

1041
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:27,240
And another thing is not to let me have access to the images I made.

1042
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:32,240
And then thank me and ask me not to say anything else.

1043
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,240
Stay quiet.

1044
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:47,240
Probably about ten months ago, Marco managed to reach a vetted, legitimate witness

1045
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:55,240
who was involved in the transportation of the, they call them ET, or the Bean.

1046
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:59,240
This guy was so scared.

1047
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:07,240
Marco spent, I think, eight to ten months slowly developing a relationship with this guy.

1048
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:13,240
And about four days ago, he agreed to meet with me and Marco, just the two of us.

1049
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,240
So we drove late into the night.

1050
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,240
We met him at a bar when we arrived.

1051
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,240
He was with another guy.

1052
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,240
He took us to a different location.

1053
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:27,240
We sat outside and we talked for a couple of hours.

1054
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:31,240
About coming forward, appearing in the documentary.

1055
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:39,240
I've never, ever had the opportunity to interview a witness that potentially handles an extraterrestrial being.

1056
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:46,240
I worry about the military getting wind of what's going on because they're clearly paying attention to this witness.

1057
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:52,240
I'm worried about him getting a phone call, reminding him of his oath to secrecy.

1058
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:57,240
I don't want to put someone else's family in harm's way.

1059
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:02,240
So you're always in the back of your mind in a situation like this.

1060
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:08,240
You know that at any moment, the carpet can get pulled out from under you and it's not a done deal until it's a done deal.

1061
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:13,240
Listen, I wonder if we should rent a hotel room and then have him come to us.

1062
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:19,240
Because then we can get all the gear inside the hotel room and then he can just show up and walk in.

1063
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:25,240
Marco coordinates with the witness Military X to secure a safe meeting location.

1064
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:30,240
Yes, I made appointment with him in some hotel right here, close to here.

1065
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,240
And then so I think we have to go to the hotel first.

1066
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,240
Yeah, we go check in and then he just walks in.

1067
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,240
Yeah, exactly.

1068
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,240
That's yeah, that's good.

1069
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:44,240
Feel that, that anxiety.

1070
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:50,240
I feel that that anxiety in my stomach.

1071
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:59,240
You know, it's just like pull this off and it's just like first time.

1072
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:04,240
It'll be the most compelling testimony ever revealed on the history of this case.

1073
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,240
No question.

1074
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,240
Oh my fucking God, I feel so steep.

1075
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,240
I know.

1076
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,240
Entrada.

1077
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,240
This is the hotel.

1078
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:22,240
I would get a quick shot of it and I'd shut these cameras off right now.

1079
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,240
Can you guys do that?

1080
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,240
Shut everything off.

1081
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,240
Guys.

1082
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,240
Yeah.

1083
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,240
Right.

1084
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,240
Right here.

1085
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,240
Where?

1086
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,240
Here.

1087
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,240
Fuck this room is small.

1088
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,240
This is where you can use these cameras in here.

1089
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,240
Oh my God.

1090
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,240
Okay.

1091
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:43,240
He's trying to find a room with two beds.

1092
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,240
You better.

1093
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,240
Okay.

1094
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,240
Yeah.

1095
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,240
Mark it.

1096
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,240
Okay.

1097
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,240
Okay, anytime.

1098
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:09,240
Okay, so we are sitting here with Military X who clearly doesn't want his identity revealed,

1099
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,240
which we're not going to do.

1100
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:17,240
And he's going to provide enough detail, not too much, but enough detail on operations that

1101
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,240
he was involved with with the Virginia case.

1102
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,240
Okay.

1103
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,240
Okay.

1104
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,240
Okay.

1105
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,240
Okay.

1106
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,240
Okay.

1107
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,240
Okay.

1108
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,240
Okay.

1109
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,240
Okay.

1110
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,240
Okay.

1111
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:41,240
When he was in humanic dust, this is where he saw part of the creature.

1112
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,240
Yes.

1113
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,240
What was the atmosphere like?

1114
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:49,240
What were the looks on the faces of the other people in the room?

1115
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,240
Yeah.

1116
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,240
What was it like?

1117
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,240
Can he put me in that room?

1118
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:34,240
When he looked and he saw the leg or part of the leg and the foot with the V, what did

1119
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,240
you think?

1120
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,240
Okay.

1121
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,240
Okay.

1122
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,240
Okay.

1123
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,240
Okay.

1124
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,240
Okay.

1125
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,240
Okay.

1126
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,240
Okay.

1127
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,240
Okay.

1128
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,240
Okay.

1129
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,240
Okay.

1130
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,240
Okay.

1131
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:45,880
Is a military base is roughly 20 miles southeast of Virginia.

1132
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:52,040
According to witnesses, the army operations originated from here.

1133
01:18:52,040 --> 01:19:12,400
Is there filmed footage, video footage of the creature that he knows about?

1134
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:21,520
He says that on January 22nd, 1996, he drove the creature from Humanitas Hospital in Virginia

1135
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,920
to ESA Army Base, where it would remain overnight.

1136
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:26,920
Okay.

1137
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:27,920
Okay.

1138
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:28,920
Okay.

1139
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,920
Okay.

1140
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:32,920
Okay.

1141
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,920
Okay.

1142
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,920
Okay.

1143
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,920
Okay.

1144
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:11,520
Does he have any idea where the creature went?

1145
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:19,400
Because it went to Reginas, then Humanitas, then ESA, then Campinas.

1146
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,680
And then what happened?

1147
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:28,720
According to Military X, he transported a creature from Humanitas Hospital in Virginia

1148
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:34,760
to ESA Military Base in Tres Corazones, where it stayed for the night.

1149
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:40,080
Early the following morning, the convoy continued their mission, heading south on Formal Dias

1150
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:46,080
Freeway, then west on Dom Pedro to SBX Army Base in the city of Campinas.

1151
01:21:52,680 --> 01:22:03,760
And now, things that I don't know, I can't prove, but comments from the time that would

1152
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:16,560
have gone to the United States, that we wouldn't be able to really keep the creature here.

1153
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:30,200
The team meets with Brazilian Air Force traffic control officer José Manuel Fernandes.

1154
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:36,760
His unit was responsible for monitoring specific airspace over the state of São Paulo.

1155
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,200
Do you know anything about this case?

1156
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:54,480
What I know is that Yusaf lands in Campinas, Yusaf's plane landed in Campinas and two helicopters

1157
01:22:54,480 --> 01:23:03,000
took off from Campinas Airport to the unknown place, which we later found out was the city

1158
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
of Varginha.

1159
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:30,600
Was it Americans involved or was it just the Brazilians involved?

1160
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:51,720
Only Americans, only.

1161
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:57,000
And how does he know that the Americans were involved?

1162
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:05,600
Because they landed without the authorization of the Brazilian government, it was a secret mission.

1163
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,600
It was a plane from Yusaf.

1164
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:38,600
I know it was nine o'clock at night, the boys were already sleeping and knocked on the door.

1165
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:45,000
I then opened the door innocently thinking it was the other guys who had come here,

1166
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,000
the Birajara or the Pacatini, for example.

1167
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:58,000
At first, there were four men that I had never seen in my life, all dressed in black.

1168
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:05,000
One brought a suitcase in his hand and the other one with a bag and said,

1169
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
close the door, close the door.

1170
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,000
And I was afraid of that.

1171
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
And then they said to me, Mrs. Luisa, we are here.

1172
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Only one spoke, the rest, one signed and the other was quiet, listening only.

1173
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:33,000
We came here to make a big proposal to you, because you can get rich now if you want.

1174
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And I didn't understand that very well, because I was even preparing to go to bed too.

1175
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And then I said, but about what?

1176
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:46,000
That you tell the girls that they didn't see anything.

1177
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:53,000
The money that's in this suitcase that we're going to give you can only come out of Brazil.

1178
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Then I said, young man, I can't do that, because something my daughter saw,

1179
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I can't treat them like liars and be a liar too.

1180
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
So I can't do that.

1181
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
If you'll excuse me, if you leave my house, I'm going to call the police.

1182
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
They insisted a lot, insisted a lot.

1183
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Soon they left.

1184
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:24,000
And I ran to the gate to see what car it was.

1185
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
And left on a farm.

1186
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
But it wasn't from Brazil.

1187
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
It was people from abroad.

1188
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
It was from Brazil.

1189
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
At that moment I touched a gas station to have a coffee.

1190
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
To relax a little.

1191
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And then two people came to my side.

1192
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,000
They were black, very tall people.

1193
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
They touched my side and spoke to me.

1194
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Mr. Carlos de Souza, married to someone like that, his daughter is like that.

1195
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
They described my whole life there.

1196
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I said, who are you? Who do you want to know?

1197
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
How do you know that?

1198
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
It was clear to me.

1199
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Look, you didn't see anything. You shut up.

1200
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Go away.

1201
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
If someone asks you something, you didn't see anything.

1202
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
You don't know anything.

1203
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Otherwise things will get weird for you.

1204
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
So go away from here.

1205
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I was scared at the time.

1206
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
It was a black Opala.

1207
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Or a very dark blue, almost black.

1208
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And without a plate.

1209
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
They put it together and went away.

1210
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
That's it.

1211
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,000
The commander of the car was Cabo Lopes.

1212
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Because he is the living proof of what happened.

1213
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
He participated in the capture.

1214
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
My brother was subordinate to him.

1215
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Has anybody seen Eric Lopes? Has anyone ever tried to talk to him?

1216
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
People have tried. And nada.

1217
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
With the help of Virginia Mayor Vergi,

1218
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
the team connects with Mr. DeCosta,

1219
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
a military police corporal in 1996.

1220
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,000
His son, Romulo Ribeiro, agrees to escort them to the home of Eric Lopes.

1221
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
To get there and you can talk to him.

1222
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I'll give you a present and pass it to you, who are the professionals.

1223
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Thank you.

1224
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
All right.

1225
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

1226
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Let me go up carefully.

1227
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Eric Lopes is the military police officer from P2,

1228
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:35,000
who reportedly drove the car during the second capture with Marco Ceresi.

1229
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Not even the family of the deceased officer,

1230
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
has been able to get a statement from Lopes.

1231
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Look at this.

1232
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Hiding.

1233
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Hiding, huh?

1234
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
If the reports are true,

1235
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
he is the only living witness of the second capture.

1236
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Officer Lopes has been unreachable for 26 years.

1237
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
We waited.

1238
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
He talks first.

1239
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Oh my God.

1240
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I'll go with him. I'm going with him.

1241
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Tell him that the mayor has blessed us.

1242
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Tell him the mayor said...

1243
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
This is Eric Lopes?

1244
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Let me just, hold on, please, let me ask you a question.

1245
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Please.

1246
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Uh-huh.

1247
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
His friend loves his friends.

1248
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Okay.

1249
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Hold on, hold on.

1250
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Just ask him one question for me.

1251
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Will he ever come forward and make a statement?

1252
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
What's happening?

1253
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
This is the house of Eric Lopes.

1254
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah.

1255
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
But he doesn't like to talk.

1256
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And the threat is that they might shoot us

1257
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
because we're on the property trespassing.

1258
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
They're currently talking right now.

1259
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Okay.

1260
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
So Eric won't talk.

1261
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
What just happened? What happened?

1262
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Is that Eric Lopes?

1263
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Who is that?

1264
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
That's Eric Lopes.

1265
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
He doesn't want to talk at all.

1266
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Turn me down, turn me down.

1267
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Okay, okay.

1268
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Oh my God, that was Eric Lopes.

1269
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Just saw him.

1270
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1271
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Okay, okay.

1272
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
We'll go talk.

1273
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Did you get him? Dave, did you get him?

1274
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Please tell me you got him.

1275
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
That was Eric Lopes.

1276
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
You got him in the window?

1277
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Yeah.

1278
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Oh my God, you got him.

1279
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
He's here. Confirm.

1280
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I'm Eric Lopes.

1281
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
And if you say,

1282
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
we shot if you don't leave here.

1283
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
He will shoot you? Yeah.

1284
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Fuck.

1285
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
If that guy had nothing to hide,

1286
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
he would have just said so.

1287
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,000
That guy was driving the car

1288
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
that Marco Treese was in.

1289
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Right, what we just did.

1290
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
The interview yesterday was pretty good.

1291
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
For what?

1292
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
No, right now it was pretty gnarly.

1293
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
The area.

1294
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Ask him if we can talk about what we just did.

1295
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Okay, okay.

1296
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Which way did he go?

1297
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
To the left.

1298
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Are we stopping here?

1299
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Okay.

1300
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Oh, my God.

1301
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
What exactly did he say?

1302
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Okay.

1303
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
And he believed that Eric Lopes was serious?

1304
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Yes, he was.

1305
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Thank you.

1306
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
This photo, in this report,

1307
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
was the first time

1308
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
that my mother participated.

1309
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
The first and only time.

1310
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
The first and only time.

1311
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
The first and only time.

1312
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
The first and only time.

1313
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
The first and only time.

1314
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
The first and only time.

1315
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I'm indignant

1316
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
because of the attitude

1317
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
that the police have,

1318
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
where 25 years ago

1319
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
they would tell my mother

1320
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
that there really was a creature,

1321
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
there really was,

1322
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
but that they couldn't admit

1323
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
the truth to the society

1324
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
because the population

1325
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
would collapse.

1326
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:54,120
If his story is true, he is walking around with a level of confirmation that only a handful

1327
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:56,920
of people on this planet have.

1328
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,360
What does that feel like?

1329
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:02,880
I remember the words of Mark when I met him.

1330
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,440
One of the first things he said to me was,

1331
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:09,920
Wow, I wanted to be in your place.

1332
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,800
I wanted to be in your place.

1333
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:17,160
Because you lived something that I dream of living.

1334
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:23,800
And I'm honest, for me it's different, because it's not something that attracts me.

1335
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:28,840
It's a story, it's something that I lived, that marks for a lot of people,

1336
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:34,200
it marks for the world, it marks for the human being.

1337
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:39,160
But you guys are looking for that.

1338
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,800
I didn't want to live that.

1339
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,840
I'm honest.

1340
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:48,080
I didn't want to live that, because that brought me a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble.

1341
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:51,360
I went through all my private situations after that with Mark,

1342
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,280
I had a lot of trouble.

1343
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:06,680
I wish it hadn't been us, because we went through a lot together,

1344
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:10,640
and a lot of trouble, until today.

1345
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:15,960
But today we can see with different eyes.

1346
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,000
May 8th, 1996.

1347
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,280
With mounting pressure from media and witnesses,

1348
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:32,240
the military base ESA holds a press conference.

1349
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,840
General Lima addresses the crowd.

1350
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,360
What for?

1351
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,360
For the press conference.

1352
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,360
Why?

1353
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,360
Because you don't want to prove the facts?

1354
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,360
The facts?

1355
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,360
I don't have to.

1356
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,360
I just wanted to tell you.

1357
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:08,360
They made us shut up about this story.

1358
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:13,360
That it wasn't ET, that it was crazy, that it was bullshit, that there was nothing about it.

1359
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:20,360
So it's where we don't even like to talk about cops, about ESA, about anything like that.

1360
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,360
It's the same thing.

1361
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:32,360
Do you think I would go through the same thing I did for 26 years?

1362
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:36,360
People, family, really, playing, enjoying myself?

1363
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,360
Never would I do that.

1364
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:39,360
What did I gain from that?

1365
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,360
Nothing.

1366
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,360
I never get a real with that.

1367
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:45,360
There's no interest for me to win.

1368
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,360
If I say I got a coin, I'm lying.

1369
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,360
that I was going to give my last testimony.

1370
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:30,360
And I have to thank you too for giving me this opportunity to speak.

1371
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,860
But I want you to keep looking,

1372
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:36,860
always and always, for you to never let go.

1373
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:40,860
Never let go of that.

1376
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:34,860
It all happened to me because it happened at the Maiolini farm.

1377
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:38,860
That's where this whole story began.

1378
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:40,860
That's where it all began.

1379
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:42,860
It was at the Maiolini farm.

1380
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:53,860
For more information, visit www.mooji.org

1381
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:04,860
The accumulation of aspects, the girls who saw something,

1382
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:07,360
the other people in the town who saw something,

1383
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,360
this wasn't an isolated event where you got one witness saying,

1384
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:12,360
oh, I saw something extraordinary.

1385
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:13,360
Not at all.

1386
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:17,360
These seemed to be relatively naive young girls.

1387
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:20,360
And there were fire department people involved,

1388
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:23,360
who saw the beings too.

1389
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:27,360
And one nice thing about it is it takes the onus away from saying,

1390
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,360
things only happen in the United States.

1391
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,360
Well, there was United States involvement,

1392
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,360
and it wouldn't surprise me if they paid to pick up the wreckage

1393
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,360
and all the rest of the stuff.

1394
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,360
Why not?

1395
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,360
Makes sense. Cheap way to get information.

1396
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:43,360
Let the other guy do the work.

1397
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:58,440
The

1398
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:04,360
fire department

1399
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:09,360
As I'm the second lieutenant of the reserve of the Brazilian Army,

1400
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:14,360
and through my contacts, a sergeant who worked with me at the time

1401
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:19,360
told me that the boxes where the entities were

1402
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,360
were taken to the preparatory school of Campinas,

1403
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,360
the preparatory school of Cadetes,

1404
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:28,360
and from there it was to Unicamp, to the hospital of the clinics,

1405
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:32,360
where after a security perimeter was made,

1406
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:35,360
they were examined by the team there,

1407
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:39,360
then the Americans came and took these entities

1408
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,360
that were in boxes to the United States.

1409
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:51,360
Why Varginha wasn't treated like the other cases?

1410
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:55,360
Many people ask, but why Varginha wasn't treated like the other cases?

1411
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,360
Probably because it's the most important case

1412
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:03,360
in which there was cooperation between Brazil and the United States.

1413
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:36,360
It will always be our word against everyone.

1414
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,360
But there is still something to be raised.

1415
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:40,360
It's a mystery that remains.

1416
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:44,360
I believe that the Varginha case is much more important today

1417
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:49,360
because it is more recent and some of the events have not unfolded yet.

1418
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:52,360
Do you have any connection with the eyes?

1419
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:56,360
Did she make any, like, feel that she saw eye to eye with the bee?

1420
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,360
Mm-hmm.

1421
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:00,360
Ah, she took it out of here.

1422
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,360
I'm suffering.

1423
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:06,360
I thought she would, but she didn't let me.

1424
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,360
This won't ever be the end.

1425
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,360
This is the end.

1426
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,360
This is the end.

1427
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:14,360
This is the end.

1428
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,360
This is the end.

1429
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,360
Mm-hmm.

1430
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:41,360
Were there live aliens seen walking around this town?

1431
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:52,360
I have deal with this case in 1996

1432
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:55,360
because I have some friends from there.

1433
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:59,360
He told that, oh, you don't know what is true,

1434
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,360
but I know what I saw.

1435
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,360
Oh, damn.

1436
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,360
Oh, yeah.

1437
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,360
Really?

1438
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,360
Weight off his shoulders.

1439
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,360
Yeah.

1440
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:54,360
God, I just wonder, like, what they said to these witnesses

1441
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:59,360
that 25 years later they still don't want to talk about it on camera at all.

1442
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,360
It's, like, unbelievable.

1443
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:05,360
It's like you offer them even compensation that it still won't do it.

1444
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:09,360
I know. It's like money doesn't hold and won't do it.

1445
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,360
It's weird.

1446
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,360
The reason why they haven't made overt contact

1447
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,360
is because we're so aggressive.

1448
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:26,360
Come on.

1449
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:43,360
Would that smell make a good perfume?

1450
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,360
I don't know.

1451
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:58,360
It smells like sweet.

1452
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:17,360
I don't know.
