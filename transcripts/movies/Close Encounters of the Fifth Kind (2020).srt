1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,300
Something strange is happening.

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,200
We are living through the most extraordinary moment in human history.

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,300
After decades of denial and ridicule, government officials and the mainstream media are admitting

4
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,960
that extraterrestrial civilizations are visiting Earth.

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,680
But there's a twist.

6
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,200
The same people and institutions who lied about ETs and just about everything else are

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,440
now framing the extraterrestrial presence as a threat.

8
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,640
And we are seriously thinking of the Space Force.

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,280
One man has been trying to warn us about this for decades.

10
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,280
If you're seeing this, it's because I'm either dead or have been entrapped or have

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,600
disappeared.

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,640
Most of us are ill-prepared for open contact with an advanced ET civilization.

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,720
As our expanding cosmology outgrows our theological institutions, modern human society is spiraling

14
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:45,440
into decadence, narcissism, depravity and nihilism.

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:52,240
If we want to truly understand ETs, their technology and their intentions, we have to

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,960
re-address our assumptions about the nature of reality and our relationship with the

17
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,880
physical universe.

18
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,560
On the surface, UFOs are real, there are these machines zipping through the sky.

19
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,760
But one of the things I've always said is, well, that's interesting and it's cool and

20
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
it's great to see them.

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,320
But what's really interesting are the people on board those spacecraft.

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,440
They're intelligent, they're conscious, they're here, they're interested.

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,640
Why are they here otherwise?

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,760
But no one has made the question, how do we develop that relationship with the occupants

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
of the UFOs?

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,640
That's what this is about.

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,640
It's going from just sort of a materialistic view, there's a machine flying around the

28
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,080
and sort of a superficial view of it, to a deeper truth of who's on board, why are they

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
here?

30
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,760
What is their relationship to humanity, perhaps the origins of the human race?

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,000
What are we to do to create a relationship with them and how do we do that?

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,880
What is the foundation of a relationship between humans at this stage of our evolution and

33
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,040
in civilizations that are hundreds of thousands to millions of years more developed technologically

34
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,040
and socially and perhaps in consciousness?

35
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,120
We have to find where that point of commonality is.

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,560
I have put a briefing together for every president since Bill Clinton and to the extent that

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,800
they know anything, it doesn't mean they have control over these covert programs.

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,800
The unacknowledged special access projects are run in a way that they are outside the

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,880
purview and control of the president or the Congress.

40
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,920
And for that reason, our elected representatives are unlikely to resolve this problem.

41
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,720
But we can resolve it by going directly to these civilizations and saying, we're here,

42
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,960
you can make contact with us, we're unarmed, we're friendly.

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,480
Since 1990, a network of free thinkers and renegades have been bypassing the national

44
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,480
security state to make direct contact with advanced extraterrestrial civilizations using

45
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,120
the Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind Protocols, or CE-5, developed by Dr. Greer.

46
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,560
This has proven to be the most subversive and dangerous information he has released

47
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,560
to the public.

48
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,640
Oh my gosh.

49
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Boom.

50
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Close Encounters of the First Kind consists of visual sightings of an unidentified flying object.

51
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,360
Close Encounters of the Second Kind, some physical traits is present, like impressions

52
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,360
in the ground or scorched vegetation.

53
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the occupants or pilots of an ET craft are witnessed.

54
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind, a human is brought on board an ET craft.

55
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind, proactive human-initiated communication with extraterrestrial beings.

56
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Most of the phenomena presented in this film were photographed or recorded during a CE-5 contact event.

57
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,360
For thousands of people, contact has begun.

58
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,360
This is their story.

59
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Look, there's four.

60
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
There's four.

61
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Holy damn hot shit.

62
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Hot dog.

63
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Come on buddy, don't go away.

64
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:21,360
This got on the radar of the intelligence community and they knew that we had come across

65
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,360
the Rosetta Stone of contacting and communicating with interstellar civilizations and it worked.

66
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,360
That is what started the intelligence community coming after what we were saying and doing

67
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
and trying to intercept it.

68
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,360
This is, in fact, cosmic disobedience on a grand scale.

69
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,360
We're going to bypass the sociopaths in these covert programs and do this directly.

70
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
It's the same thing with the Civil Rights Movement.

71
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,360
The Civil Rights Movement would have never happened from the top down.

72
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Even the Kennedy brothers did not want to step into that mess.

73
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,360
It took a mass of people, not just Martin Luther King, but millions of people all over the country

74
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
doing sit-ins and lunch counter sit-ins and buses and what have you,

75
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,360
to change that direction of our civilization out of Jim Crow onto a society that is,

76
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,360
while not perfect, is more open and inclusive than it was.

77
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Well, the same has to happen here.

78
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,360
And to do that, we have to understand what cosmic consciousness is

79
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,360
and what the nature of the cosmic mind is that is resonating within every single human being.

80
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Because that's the foundation for the relationship between humans and these civilizations.

81
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
By doing it directly, all of us are going to know what the truth is.

82
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,360
You don't have to go through a proxy for someone who's telling you secondhand,

83
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,360
but it also creates a movement globally to show these civilizations

84
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,360
that there are people on this planet who are enlightened and conscious and peaceful,

85
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
which is the majority of humans.

86
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,360
There's real disclosure as humans making contact with these civilizations directly.

87
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,360
And these civilizations are waiting for us to do it.

88
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,360
So this is our opportunity. This is our moment.

89
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
And it really is we, the people, that have to do it.

90
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Well, for decades, only crackpots and crazy people believed in UFOs.

91
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
That's what I thought anyway.

92
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,360
And then in recent years, it turns out that governments have been taking them seriously all along.

93
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Very seriously.

94
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Yeah.

95
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Yeah.

96
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,360
The question is often asked, when will UFO disclosure happen?

97
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,360
The answer is it has already happened.

98
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,360
It happened in 2001 at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.,

99
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,360
where military, NASA, and intelligence agency whistleblowers testified to their involvement

100
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,360
in the UFO cover-up and the back engineering of extraterrestrial technologies.

101
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,360
It happened again in 2017 with the release of the film Unacknowledged,

102
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:01,360
in anticipation of which the CIA and the FBI published millions of UFO documents on their websites.

103
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Despite all this, nothing has really changed.

104
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Life goes on as before, except there is a new narrative unfolding in the mainstream media,

105
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,360
one that is designed to subvert true disclosure

106
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,360
and extinguish the opportunity for transformation available to us through these revelations.

107
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Earlier this week, the New York Times and Politico revealed the existence of a secret government program

108
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
to investigate UFO sightings.

109
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
It was especially focused on encounters by members of the military,

110
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,360
like this one experienced by a U.S. Navy pilot off the coast of California.

111
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,360
There's a whole fleet of them. Look on the A.S.A.

112
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,360
My gosh.

113
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,360
They're all going against the wind. The wind's a hundred and twenty miles to the west.

114
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Look at this thing. It's rotating.

115
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
Average people see UFOs, you know, on the news, right?

116
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
All of a sudden, it's real.

117
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
UFOs, we've been tracking them in the sky.

118
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,360
And they go, OK, well, were the tinfoil hat people right?

119
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,360
It took a long time for the mainstream media finally admit that, yeah, you know, they are in fact real.

120
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Why did we wait that long?

121
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Why did we wait for the mainstream media to tell us before we finally believed, hey, this is actually happening?

122
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,360
And the challenge is, if there's potentially multiple narratives, how do you decide which one to go with?

123
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Back in the 1990s, I was read into or briefed on a project that involved an interagency group

124
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:41,360
that had the ability to disclose the E.T. presence in a way that would frighten everyone on Earth

125
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,360
and convince the public that there was an alien threat, which is completely false.

126
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,360
It's all a lie and that this had been developed in the fifties

127
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,360
and they had been developing the means and the psychological warfare to make that happen.

128
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,360
So in the 1990s, I wrote a paper called When Disclosure Serves Secrecy.

129
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,360
What that means is there are two kinds of disclosures that might happen.

130
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:13,360
A truthful one that is also a hopeful one, which is what I gave up my medical career to try to actuate do.

131
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:21,360
And then there's the one that is spun by the spinmeisters in Washington and at the Pentagon and CIA, which runs like this.

132
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,360
It's true. The UFOs are real. They are here as a threat.

133
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,360
They are violating our airspace, their national security, and a threat to our sovereignty, I'm quoting.

134
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:40,360
The purpose of the program, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, was really designed to do just that.

135
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,360
From a national security perspective, identify those things that we see

136
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,360
and try to ascertain and determine if that information is a potential threat to national security.

137
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,360
And we knew this was going to happen because I had met with people who were in these classified projects

138
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:04,360
who were on interagency committees that had everything set to roll this out and they were just waiting for the right time.

139
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,360
The Soviet Union has ended. We have the global terrorism while it's still there. It's not like it was around 9-11.

140
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,360
This is the next big thing that they want the public to be afraid of.

141
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,360
When a pickpocket meets a saint, all he sees are his pockets or like if you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

142
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,360
And it's not that this isn't a genuine perception on their part because they've been raised,

143
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:35,360
their entire political and professional career has been designed to have this kind of artificial construct of this.

144
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,360
There's this national airspace and nobody can come into the airspace unless we say so.

145
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,360
And they've got this super control mechanism going.

146
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,360
And they're right at this really important place right now where they're attempting to establish a kind of one world government.

147
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,360
They've gotten the communication systems up, the transportation systems up, and they want to establish a planetary government.

148
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,360
And there's nothing that is going to motivate the creation of a one world government

149
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,360
like the discovery of an ultimate other, Ronald Reagan, standing in front of the United Nations.

150
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
The Senate, right out.

151
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Perhaps we need some outside universal threat.

152
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:23,360
I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.

153
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
He was silly enough to say it.

154
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
You know, that's part of his naivete.

155
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
But the fact is that is their agenda.

156
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Legendary civil rights attorney Daniel Sheehan has spent over 50 years fighting the national security state.

157
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,360
The Pentagon Papers and the Iran-Contra Scandals are but two of as many landmark cases

158
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,360
before becoming a whistleblower and legal counsel for the Disclosure Project in 2001.

159
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,360
It's helpful, of course, for them to say, oh, UFOs are real.

160
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
That's quite helpful.

161
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,360
We've been trying to get people to understand that now for the last 30 years.

162
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,360
But it's all immediately wedded to this fact that they're this horrible threat.

163
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,360
And so we have to come forward with a positive set of programs, a positive vision for this.

164
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,360
And that's what I'm trying to help get the Vatican and the Jesuit order to become involved in,

165
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,360
in putting forth a discussion about the theological and philosophical challenges that this presents to us.

166
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,360
But it's not a national security threat, you know.

167
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
It's not a threat to our species.

168
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
It's not a threat to our planet.

169
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:29,360
It's a threat to our view as ourselves, as the be-all and end-all that the entire universe was created

170
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,360
as a stage on which to play out the human drama of one single species.

171
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
You know, that ain't so.

172
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,360
But let's get used to it and let's figure out what the new story is.

173
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
What is the new story?

174
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
It is a positive story.

175
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
What is our role in it?

176
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,360
We may not be the star, you know, of it,

177
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,360
but we're a good supporting character in the unfolding of our universe.

178
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
And let's figure out what that story is.

179
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,360
The success of Unacknowledged, which has been seen by hundreds of millions of people now.

180
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
Have you not watched Unacknowledged?

181
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
What is Unacknowledged?

182
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
You gotta watch Unacknowledged.

183
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
What is that one?

184
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Okay.

185
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
You gotta watch Unacknowledged.

186
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
What is it?

187
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
You gotta watch Unacknowledged.

188
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Isn't that that Stephen Greer movie?

189
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Caused a reaction within the intelligence community of the United States.

190
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,360
And so what the major media has begun to do is to cooperate with the intelligence community

191
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,360
in reporting all this information out, but with this peculiar spin,

192
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,360
very subliminal at this stage, that it's a threat.

193
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,360
The project was called the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program,

194
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
run by an official named Luis Elizondo.

195
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,360
I think this is a national security imperative.

196
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:46,360
We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.

197
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,360
One of my first cases coming out of law school was for NBC to establish a right of journalists

198
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
to protect their confidential news sources.

199
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,360
I did the amicus briefs for the New York Times and the Washington Post and also for CBS and ABC.

200
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,360
And it was at that time that I began to realize that there was this close working relationship

201
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,360
between the Board of Editors of the New York Times and the national security community.

202
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,360
There's conversations going on all the time between the Board of Editors and the national security people.

203
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,360
And we actually got an affidavit from Teddy Sorenson saying that,

204
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,360
oh yes, the national security state and CIA and everybody consult regularly with the New York Times

205
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,360
to get them not to tell information about covert operations that we're engaged in.

206
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,360
I was surprised to find that out at that point.

207
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,360
I began to do an investigation about this as the lawyer for the Times, now and for NBC,

208
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,360
and found out that there were 42 full-time central intelligence agency or NSA people employed

209
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
by the major national news media.

210
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,360
And they had an entire project called Project Mockingbird.

211
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,360
And that they were deeply embedded with the major national news media.

212
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,360
And they were constantly, from their point of view, safeguarding the information that was going to be allowed to get out.

213
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,360
And it was quite clear that they viewed themselves as all part of the same basic fraternity.

214
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,360
They all shared in the patriotic vision of the central intelligence agency, being able to go around the world.

215
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,360
The thing we had the biggest challenge with on the Pentagon Papers case is they didn't want to reveal

216
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,360
the fact that there was a massive assassination program going on.

217
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,360
And it was being funded by heroin trafficking, you know,

218
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,360
to keep it away from the congressional funding investigations, et cetera.

219
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,360
I thought this was a terribly newsworthy thing to tell about, but it was beyond the pale.

220
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
That was not to be talked about here.

221
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,360
You know, you can talk about how bad the Vietnam War was,

222
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,360
and even the fact that they lied about the Bay of Tonkin incident, but not this.

223
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Even the Air Force Office of Special Investigations officer, Richard Doty,

224
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,360
admitted that he would bring bags of cash to national security editors in the major media

225
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,360
to get their cooperation in this narrative.

226
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:07,360
So every news agency, every television, radio station in the Albuquerque or Santa Fe area

227
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,360
had our snitches in there.

228
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,360
So we knew, and we paid them.

229
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
We paid them good money.

230
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,360
One of the reasons you get to people is you pay them.

231
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,360
And that was controversial. That was somewhat controversial.

232
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Do you know of national media that have had this?

233
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Oh, yes, yes. I'm not going to name them.

234
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
What you have now is a concerted effort between mainstream media, social media platforms,

235
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,360
and tech giants to say, let's gain control back of the narratives that we require

236
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,360
to make sure that we can control how people think about certain topics.

237
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,360
So now you have this fear driven, you have this tight little box

238
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,360
of what the UFO and the extraterrestrial subject is really about,

239
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,360
how it relates to military, government spending, weapons,

240
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,360
all the sort of conversations that are very common in the mainstream

241
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,360
that people are going to relate to, that they can piece the typical dots together.

242
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
Let me give you a great example.

243
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,360
If you look at a lot of the disclosure project materials, which is beyond the scope of this film,

244
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,360
we identified dozens of people who were at intercontinental ballistic missile,

245
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,360
nuclear silos, nuclear weapons areas, who had had UFOs come in to those areas,

246
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,360
surveilling them, but in some cases rendering those missiles unlaunchable.

247
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Now, most of the men that were in those silos have said to me personally,

248
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,360
they felt that these ETs were saying, please don't blow up this beautiful planet.

249
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,360
But if you do, if you go to mutual assured destruction, the full launch of nuclear weapons globally,

250
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,360
we can intercept a lot of them so that you don't go to a full extinction level event.

251
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,360
They felt that it was actually a very hopeful thing that happened.

252
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Meanwhile, people came along, took the same data, the same cases,

253
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,360
and spun it into a national security threat.

254
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,360
One set of facts, two narratives, diametrically opposed, opposite.

255
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,360
When I got involved in the issue of the UFO issue and the ET issue,

256
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,360
starting in 1977 with President Carter, I realized that the work that I was doing

257
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,360
was characterized by the national security state as a target for counterintelligence activities.

258
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,360
When I see this thing happening with this To the Stars Academy,

259
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,360
where they suddenly appear on the front page of the New York Times,

260
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:32,360
and the CNN all of a sudden wants to talk with them, and they're on MSNBC, and all this kind of stuff,

261
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,360
I immediately kind of realize, wait a second, this is part of what I've been worried about coming out,

262
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,360
because they were constantly spinning this story, that this is a threat.

263
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,360
My name is Tom DeLong. A lot of people know me from my band Blink 182.

264
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,360
I started that band when I was 16.

265
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Through a series of meetings, I was soon connected to a large group of U.S. government officials

266
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,360
from the CIA, the Department of Defense, and Lockheed Martin Skunk Works.

267
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,360
These guys were the ones involved in the secretive U.S. government programs that dealt with these subjects.

268
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,360
What's happening is the To the Stars Academy people, who are all, you know, Jim Simi Van, who's there,

269
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,360
the chief of covert operations, domestic for CIA, which in and of itself is totally against the law.

270
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,360
You know, the National Security Act of 1947 completely, clearly and unequivocally prohibits

271
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,360
any kind of covert operations stateside, but here that's who he is, and there he is there.

272
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,360
And you've got guys from the DIA and the Defense Department and Hal Putoff and stuff, and they're all there.

273
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,360
And what they're doing is they're putting this intense spin.

274
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:45,360
Every single thing they talk about all has this kind of gestalt to it, that this is a threat.

275
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,360
And it very well could be a threat.

276
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,360
It's a threat to our national security.

277
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,360
It's a threat to our airspace.

278
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,360
It's a threat to our sovereignty.

279
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,360
What it is, it's a threat to our dominion over our own planet.

280
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,360
And, of course, they think that's their job.

281
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Our job is to assert full-spectrum dominance over the entire planet.

282
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,360
We actually have the documents from the 1992 United States Defense Department policy planning guidance document,

283
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,360
and they said that right at the end of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

284
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,360
They said, oh, we've got to not cut back on our military spending.

285
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,360
We have to increase it so we can establish full-spectrum dominance over the planet.

286
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,360
And so you know what their agenda is, the national security state.

287
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
It's not for the defense of our sovereignty.

288
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:37,360
The danger of this, of course, is that this is exactly what all fascistic demagogues do to an innocent target,

289
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,360
whether it be Jews in Germany or African Americans in this country.

290
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,360
They will create sort of a boogeyman effect to try to get people mobilized against it.

291
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,360
You're one ugly motherfucker.

292
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,360
And as one member of a royal family told me,

293
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:07,360
we need to do things so that the public will accept in blood and treasure the sacrifices needed to have an interplanetary war, I'm quoting.

294
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Bombshell CIA documents, previously published by The Disclosure Project,

295
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:21,360
reveal a decades-long psychological warfare campaign to cultivate a culture of fear towards extraterrestrials.

296
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,360
It's interesting that Hollywood and, you know, the clandestine services,

297
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,360
they both spend most of their time convincing people that something that's not true is in fact true.

298
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,360
I think probably Hollywood is full of CIA agents, and we just don't know it.

299
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,360
And I wouldn't be surprised at all to discover that, you know, this was extremely common.

300
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Intelligence assets within Hollywood have made billions of dollars,

301
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:48,360
popularizing the narrative that humanity's first encounter with ETs will be a devastating bloodbath.

302
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Mr. Chambers, don't get on that ship.

303
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,360
The rest of the book, To Serve Man, it's a cookbook.

304
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:31,360
Why can't we be friends?

305
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Let's go out into space and look at our planet over the last hundred years.

306
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,360
World Wars, hundreds of millions of people killed in war, the advent of weapons of mass destruction,

307
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,360
our going into space in a competitive way with the Soviet Union for the Apollo projects and others,

308
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,360
the degradation and destruction of our environment, our targeting of extraterrestrial assets around the Earth and in space,

309
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,360
and successfully killing many ETs and downing their spacecraft.

310
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Out here in Fort Pachuca in Arizona, there's an underground facility where there are nine different ET craft that are there with all the autopsy bodies.

311
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,360
There's a man on my team who used to work in that facility near Tombstone, Arizona, not coincidentally, perhaps.

312
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,360
This footage, captured by NASA's Discovery Space Shuttle on September 15, 1991,

313
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,360
shows an extraterrestrial vehicle dodge an electronic weapon fired from Earth.

314
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,360
Here we see the craft slowly crossing the frame.

315
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,360
There's a bright flash and then it makes an abrupt right angle turn and flies off.

316
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:48,360
Moments after the turn, we see the shot fired across space where the craft had just been.

317
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Knowing all that, if they were hostile in the way we think of an invading hostile force,

318
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,360
that would have been made abundantly clear to us the day we detonated the first atomic bomb.

319
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:09,360
The fact is they have shown remarkable restraint, almost a level of Gandhian pacifism not to have pushed back.

320
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,360
So the threat isn't extraterrestrial. The threat is covert human.

321
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,360
These secret projects are an existential threat to Earth, the environment,

322
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,360
and to our peace in space and relationship with these civilizations.

323
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,360
I remember being at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where a lot of the Roswell stuff ended up

324
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,360
and it was the Foreign Technology Division of the Air Force.

325
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,360
And I was there to do a briefing and the colonel said,

326
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,360
well, what if these civilizations are a threat?

327
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,360
He was trying to bring me into that view and I said, sir, with all due respect,

328
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,360
given the galactically stupid things you have been doing,

329
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,360
if they were a threat, you would know it by now and we would not be having this conversation

330
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,360
and breathing the free air of Earth. It would have been point, set, match, over.

331
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,360
What are the technologies that would permit an interstellar civilization to go from one star system to another?

332
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Now, we're not talking about Elon Musk's SpaceX or the Apollo rocket.

333
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,360
We're talking technologically, advances that are in the hundreds of thousands to millions of years

334
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,360
past what we have operating on this planet.

335
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,360
Those technological breakthroughs, if they were weaponized and in the possession of a hostile force,

336
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:26,360
would be so devastating that you could target a planet and turn it into a pink mist

337
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,360
floating through the cosmos if you were a hostile entity.

338
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,360
What I have discovered in our contact with these civilizations,

339
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:44,360
and we have had many hundreds of contact experiences with our CE5 teams around the world over the last 30 years,

340
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,360
is that none of them are hostile, but quite a few of them are very concerned about our hostility

341
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
and are doing things to try to contain that.

342
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,360
But our destiny beyond the Earth is not only a matter of national identity,

343
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,360
but a matter of national security.

344
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,360
It is not enough to merely have an American presence in space.

345
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,360
We must have American dominance in space.

346
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,360
They want to project out into the stars their dominion.

347
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,360
Our job is to get people to understand that that is not what our mission is as a human species.

348
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,360
We need to lay back, participate with all other sentient life in the universe,

349
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:35,360
and merit a proper position in the Galactic Federation, not be the big bully on the block.

350
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,360
Counterintelligence efforts reach a new level of absurdity

351
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,360
with the staging of host events like cattle mutilations and alien abductions.

352
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:53,360
In 2017, retired Air Force intelligence officer Richard Doty made history

353
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,360
when he admitted on camera that unacknowledged special access projects within the military

354
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:06,360
do indeed stage alien abductions to lay the psychological foundation

355
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,360
for an interplanetary conflict sometime in the near future.

356
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,360
We did do that, yes.

357
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,360
OSI did that.

358
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:25,360
There was a special group out of the 7602nd Air Intel Wing at Fort Belvoir that came out and did that.

359
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:32,360
They had these people that had maybe some sort of defects,

360
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:40,360
astronomical defects that were brought in to fool people into thinking they were aliens.

361
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Yeah, I can't give you any specifics because the program is still classified,

362
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,360
and they're probably still doing it. I wouldn't doubt that they were still doing it.

363
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,360
This corroborates what dozens of other insiders have disclosed to Dr. Greer,

364
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,360
but they're too afraid to testify on camera.

365
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,360
Colonel, you're about to find out who your alien really is.

366
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,360
General Stahl.

367
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Some years ago, I had a meeting with the Crown Prince of Liechtenstein, Hans-Adam von Liechtenstein.

368
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,360
He had reached out to me through some of his contacts.

369
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,360
He said, look, Dr. Greer, we have to meet, but we can't talk about this on the phone.

370
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Your efforts to effect disclosure are noble, but they will not be able to be permitted,

371
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,360
and not for the reasons you think.

372
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
I said, well, this is interesting.

373
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Finally, we got together in New York City in July of 1994.

374
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:39,360
He said to me, in 1989, a group of us were trying to do disclosure,

375
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:46,360
and it involved Gorbachev, President Bush, Sr., himself, and the U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar.

376
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,360
And in the course of us putting together high-level planning meetings to do this,

377
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. Secretary General, was abducted out of his limousine in Manhattan.

378
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:05,360
He was told by the aliens that if they did not cease and desist from their plans to disclose this information,

379
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,360
that every world leader involved, including the President of the United States, would be abducted.

380
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,360
This blew up like an atomic bomb in the Bush White House, and it did not go forward.

381
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,360
I said, okay, well, tell me more.

382
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:24,360
He says, well, we've concluded that we have to prepare the public for an interplanetary war,

383
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,360
and in doing so, we can then also force the return of Christ.

384
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,360
I'm quoting, and I just listened.

385
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:37,360
He didn't know that I knew that the means for that abduction, for Perez de Cuellar,

386
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,360
were run by a counterintelligence unit out of the national security state

387
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:49,360
that had the technologies to simulate an alien craft and aliens run completely by military assets,

388
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,360
and that there was a deeper part of these unacknowledged special access projects

389
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,360
that were zooming even people like Bush Sr., who was on the committee

390
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,360
but had lost control of some of these renegade factions.

391
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
This is a very complicated story.

392
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Perez de Cuellar being abducted caused him to stop that process.

393
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,360
It manipulated these leaders into going onto a war footing,

394
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,360
and he confessed to me that the reason he was funding the work of the abduction groups

395
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,360
was because they wanted to put information out to the public that would scare the public

396
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,360
so that people would make the sacrifice and blood and treasure to have an interplanetary war.

397
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Now, this is 25 years ago. It was not a happy meeting for me.

398
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:38,360
If there's any one thing that is going to mobilize people to allow the national security state

399
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,360
to establish full-spectrum dominance over our planet, it is this.

400
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,360
It is this. The beings themselves, interestingly and very importantly,

401
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,360
aren't putting out their own story. They're not doing that yet.

402
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,360
They're trying to get us to understand it. They're trying to give us warnings.

403
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,360
They're trying to help raise our consciousness, which is a critical part of this entire operation going on,

404
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,360
and trying to get us to do this for ourselves. That's what this is all about.

405
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,360
But the national security state realizes that that's a slower process, so they're now trying to hurry this up.

406
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,360
There's a kind of an emergency process underway right now. Make no mistake about that.

407
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:24,360
When I was briefing the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the very first thing he asked wasn't about this subject.

408
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:30,360
He looked at me. He says, Dr. Greer, what we don't understand is why you haven't killed yourself yet.

409
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:37,360
He said, well, my dad knew about some of this way back in the 60s. No one would do anything about it.

410
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,360
So he took his revolver and ate his gun and blew his head off.

411
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Now, this is a three-star general telling me this story. In the first 10 minutes, we're together.

412
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:53,360
I said, well, I'm sorry that happened to you, but I understand where your dad was coming from.

413
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Because it's sort of this...

414
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,360
Here we go.

415
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Here we go.

416
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:14,360
I want to take a breath.

417
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:25,360
Now, the truth is, there are a lot of people who've been on my team who were military, who killed themselves, others who have been assassinated.

418
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:46,360
So the other thing that keeps me up is, you know, survivor guilt.

419
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
Sorry.

420
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:54,360
This national security state is the bane of our human existence right now.

421
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,360
And so we have to start disassembling that national security state.

422
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:04,360
Because, you know, even assuming, say, Bernie Sanders, hypothetically, were to become president.

423
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,360
You know, the national security state isn't even going to tell him where the washrooms are.

424
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,360
And that whole group is going to descend upon him.

425
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,360
And they're going to give him at least as much trouble as they've given Trump.

426
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:25,360
If you got into the office and you found out something about aliens, if you found out something about UFOs, would you let us know?

427
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,360
Well, I'll tell you, my wife would demand that I let you know.

428
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:37,360
So that's why they want Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to come in and kind of, you know, continue to get things, quote, back to normal, where the national security state is functioning.

429
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:44,360
They're all operation, you know, they're all going to brief Goldman Sachs and they're putting people from Goldman Sachs in charge of the economy.

430
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,360
You know, that that kind of thing.

431
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:57,360
We have to rise above those kind of dialectical politics and bring the people up, raise the consciousness of the people and have this function through democracy.

432
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,360
That's that. I mean, we've got the tools here.

433
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,360
They're in front of us and we've got access to the Internet still.

434
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,360
They haven't taken that away from us yet.

435
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,360
But there's a short window here.

436
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:20,360
One exception to the almost universal failure of world governments to initiate peaceful diplomacy with the civilizations took place in France in 2007.

437
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:31,360
Then President Sarkozy's Ministry of Defense reached out to Dr. Greer to train its senior officials in the close encounters of the fifth time protocols.

438
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:41,360
During a covert test run in the French countryside, E.T. craft were tracked overhead, going 200,000 kilometers per hour.

439
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:47,360
This massive mauve-colored craft partially materialized a few meters from the group.

440
00:40:47,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Since the operation was swiftly halted by national security state interests, it remains the duty of we, the people, to become peaceful ambassadors to the universe.

441
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Much like a denial of service cyber attack can bottleneck and bring down a computer network, millions of people initiating contact would completely overwhelm the national security state's ability

442
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,360
to subvert disclosure.

443
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:27,360
The national security state people, and potentially working with and through the To The Stars Academy, are going to be pitching this problem.

444
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:40,360
Say, well, you know, we can't just let our whole civilization know that there's this highly advanced, technologically superior society out there because our whole culture will collapse.

445
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:54,360
Whereas, in fact, it's quite clear that it's their defense of the elite, this 1% of the human family that basically ends up controlling over 40% of all the wealth on the planet that they're really defending.

446
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,360
And it's their world that they're trying to defend.

447
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:14,360
So that you see that this is a subset of a larger question about how spiritual consciousness and the evolution of consciousness of understanding what we really are in the makeup of the universe is a threat in itself to this elite.

448
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:29,360
Because that is the dissolving away of these kind of differences among ourselves and this coming into a full ownership of our proper place in the universe puts these people out of business as the ruling elite.

449
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:44,360
And so that the raising of consciousness of our human family is so closely related to the opening onto the extraterrestrial experience that both of them together are viewed as a threat by the elite.

450
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:53,360
What they're afraid of is that this is such an accelerator as people have these repeated contacts with the extraterrestrials, their whole consciousness starts to rise.

451
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,360
They start becoming aware of the fact that we're damaging our environment.

452
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:02,360
They can become aware of the fact that nuclear weapons are kind of an insane thing to have. War is a really bad idea.

453
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:08,360
This is a spiritual experience. It's a spiritual stimulation that's coming.

454
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:18,360
If you take someone from Italy and someone from Japan, very different cultures, very different people, personalities, backgrounds, emotional temperament.

455
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:24,360
Now, extrapolate that out across the cosmos. Think of the vast differences we're going to be.

456
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,360
How do we make any sense of that if we aren't anchored into something deeper?

457
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:35,360
And that point of commonality has been folded within each of us, and that is we are awake conscious beings.

458
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:44,360
They are awake. We are awake. That faculty of being aware of awareness, the consciousness, not what you're conscious of, but the means to be awake.

459
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:52,360
That is a singularity. And once we're anchored into that state of consciousness, the unit of state, then there aren't any aliens.

460
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:59,360
There are just other people who are a little different from us. This is the point where we can make contact most easily.

461
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:24,360
When I looked at Close Encounters of the Third Kind, I said, well, somebody knows what's going on here.

462
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:32,360
Because it had a lot to do with the telepathy, the sort of dreams people had that led them to the Devil's Tower in Wyoming, all this.

463
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:40,360
And I then found out that Spielberg had actually had a man, J. Alan Hynek, who was the head of Project Blue Book for the Air Force,

464
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:50,360
who was the chief consultant who opened up files for him so he could make that movie almost like a docu-drama.

465
00:44:53,360 --> 00:45:03,360
In 2011, a CE5 group at Joshua Tree National Park successfully contacted an entire flotilla of ET craft.

466
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:09,360
In the unprocessed night vision footage, we see what appears to be two distinct craft.

467
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:19,360
But image enhancements reveal that these are two parts of a superstructure or mothership surrounded by an entire fleet of ET vehicles.

468
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,360
How is this possible?

469
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:35,360
It is not possible to simply crowbar extraterrestrials into our traditional, relatively primitive view of reality.

470
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:46,360
In order to make sense of things, and indeed, in order to make contact, we have to pause and readdress our assumptions about the very nature of reality.

471
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:57,360
This is an essential reflection which reveals that the mystery of extraterrestrials is but a signpost that points to a far more profound and intimate secret,

472
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,360
one with the power to transform us and the cosmos forever.

473
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,360
One day I went to my mailbox and I got out a little flyer and it said,

474
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:13,360
we're inviting you to a meeting with Ben Rich, the chairman and CEO of Lockheed Skunk Works, former UCLA alumni.

475
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,360
He'll be speaking to the engineering alumni group about his time at the Skunk Works.

476
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:25,360
So as he was finishing his talk after about 45 minutes, his last slide was a black disc zipping off an outer space.

477
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,360
And he ended the talk by saying, we now have the technology to take ET home.

478
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,360
And the whole room burst out laughing.

479
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,360
We said, did he just say that?

480
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:42,360
And as he was walking away, I followed him and I said, Ben, Ben, he turned around, looked at me and I said, Ben, I'm really fascinated with what you had to say today.

481
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,360
And I said, I really love to know how these, how we would do it.

482
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,360
What would we use to get to the stars?

483
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,360
He looked at me, trying to figure out who I was, I think.

484
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,360
And he said, well, let me ask you a question.

485
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,360
How does ESP work?

486
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,360
And I was really taken back because frankly, I was asking a question.

487
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,360
I wasn't expecting to get a question back.

488
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,360
So the first thing that popped in my mind was all points in space and time are connected.

489
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360
So I fired that answer back to him.

490
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,360
I don't know, all points in space and time are connected.

491
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
He said, that's how it works.

492
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,360
He turned around and he walked away.

493
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:19,360
This astonishing admission from a top military industrial complex insider proves to be much more than a simple analogy.

494
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:33,360
The physics of UFOs, how they travel and communicate through interstellar distances, how they generate power, how they're manufactured is beyond the grasp of unclassified mainstream science.

495
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:43,360
Instead, a model of reality that accounts for ESP is the only model in which we can begin to comprehend ET technology.

496
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:49,360
If you're traveling beyond the speed of light, I call it the crossing point of light, it's like this beyond the sound barrier.

497
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,360
Well, there's something beyond the light barrier.

498
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:57,360
And you're going from, say, the Andromeda Galaxy, that's two and a half million light years away.

499
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,360
So at the speed of light, it would take two and a half million years for them to get here.

500
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
The speed of light is too slow.

501
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:08,360
You cannot go from point A to B through the cosmos through a linear system of transportation.

502
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:23,360
Moreover, you cannot communicate through those distances with something at the speed of light, which is what your cell phone and all these radio frequency electromagnetic communication devices we use now on Earth are using.

503
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:30,360
Any civilization that is here, that is interstellar, by definition is transdimensional.

504
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:44,360
They're passing through other dimensions and dropping out of linearity and going from A to B, boom, almost like a teleportation where it's that resonant effect from point A to B.

505
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:55,360
Any communications systems that these ETs have are also going at the speed of not light, but of thought, a quanta of thought.

506
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:02,360
We think of consciousness and thought as this sort of amorphous, irrelevant, interesting, but mystical thing.

507
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:13,360
But the central operating system and communication system for all interstellar civilizations is consciousness and thought and technologies that interface with them.

508
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:20,360
God. Prana. She. Magic. Consciousness.

509
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:29,360
Every culture throughout history has had a word to describe this intangible energy that connects everyone and everything.

510
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:37,360
Decades of laboratory studies show that our minds have a mysterious ordering effect on quantum level phenomenon.

511
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:49,360
Despite overwhelming scientific evidence, most people would still be shocked to learn that certain scientists have known that the force is real for a very long time.

512
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:57,360
One of the people that I met in the course of doing this work was astronaut Edgar Mitchell, who was the sixth man to walk on the moon.

513
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:06,360
We have sightings of all sorts. There seems to have been a great deal of secrecy surrounding the so-called UFO event.

514
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:17,360
He had an experience in space, an expanded state of consciousness that led him to form the Institute of Noetic Sciences to study the science of consciousness.

515
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:25,360
I also brought him to the briefing I did in 1997 with the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Tom Wilson.

516
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,360
The data on that has since leaked out.

517
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:38,360
Edgar Mitchell realized there was this connection between space and these extraterrestrial life forms and the science of consciousness that was very integral to the study.

518
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:48,360
Most of the people that I have met with in senior science, NASA, aerospace, and intelligence community figures know that the key missing ingredient

519
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:54,360
out of most people's understanding of the whole UFO phenomenon is the science of consciousness.

520
00:50:54,360 --> 00:51:06,360
The ETs are trying to encourage people to understand higher consciousness and universal mind to be able to have a relationship with them that's going forward into the future.

521
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:13,360
And Edgar Mitchell realized that quite early on because of his own personal experience out in space as the sixth man to walk on the moon.

522
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:19,360
What's the nature of the universe we live in? What is our relationship to the larger reality?

523
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:26,360
If that's a part of the larger reality and we're denying it, that to me is unconscionable.

524
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:33,360
I theorize that there is a spectrum of consciousness available to human beings.

525
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,360
At one end is material consciousness.

526
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:44,360
At the other end is what we call field consciousness, where a person is at one with the universe, perceiving the universe.

527
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:51,360
Just by looking at our planet on the way back, I saw or felt a field consciousness state.

528
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,360
Dr. Edgar Mitchell.

529
00:51:54,360 --> 00:52:01,360
We've thought for a long time that the closer we could look at the operations of cells in our body and our brains,

530
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,360
the closer we'd come to finding the location of consciousness.

531
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:10,360
While there's been fantastic work at mapping neural connections and understanding more and more about the brain and memory,

532
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,360
what we find is that we still don't know where consciousness is.

533
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:24,360
Adam Michael Curry is an inventor and entrepreneur whose groundbreaking work as a teenager caught the eye of Princeton's Dean of Engineering, Dr. Robert John.

534
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,360
Dr. John recruited Adam into the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab,

535
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:39,360
where they studied the mysterious ordering effect of consciousness on quantum systems, an effect they called mind-matter interaction.

536
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:44,360
Now, a non-localized picture is the picture of consciousness on which we're converging now,

537
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,360
which is to say that consciousness does not seem to be strictly produced by the brain.

538
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,360
It involves the brain, but there's something much deeper going on here.

539
00:52:53,360 --> 00:53:01,360
Consciousness may not be localized to our bodies, but may be a fundamental feature of the physical world in which we live.

540
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:06,360
The universe looks less like a big machine than a big thought.

541
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,360
Dr. Dean Raden, Chief Scientist, Institute of Noetic Sciences.

542
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:22,360
Consciousness, this faculty of being sentient, awake, is not limited to our brain waves or our bodies,

543
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,360
but in fact transcends the limits of space-time.

544
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:32,360
It's an unbounded field of awareness, and that is true whether you recognize it or not.

545
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,360
Interestingly, it doesn't matter if you intellectualize it.

546
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:41,360
That is the reality of it that has been proven through scientific studies, such as Dr. John's work at Princeton,

547
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:48,360
where they would have people put their awareness on a random number generator that's spitting out zeros and ones randomly,

548
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:55,360
and would intend to shift it, say, towards zeros, and it would shift without any linear wires, just their thought.

549
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:00,360
Essentially, what a random number generator does is it looks at something intrinsically random in the physical world,

550
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,360
typically a quantum process, and it converts those into a string of ones and zeros.

551
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:09,360
So you can think of it kind of like a coin flipper where heads is one and tails is zero.

552
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:15,360
Now, if you collect a large enough sample size, you find a 50-50 distribution of these ones and zeros,

553
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,360
meaning physical reality is behaving the way it should.

554
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:26,360
Well, if you get somebody in front of the machine and you ask them to use their intention to mean-shift the thing to more ones or more zeros,

555
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:32,360
what you find is that there's not all the time, but often a significant mean-shift in the direction of their attention.

556
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:37,360
Now, that's a very simple experiment, but the implications are absolutely profound.

557
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:45,360
That suggests that, in fact, consciousness does not seem to be just an illusion or just a localized phenomenon,

558
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,360
but that it does have some sort of capabilities to affect the probabilities.

559
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,360
At the deepest layer of reality, down in the basement layer in the quantum world somehow.

560
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,360
In this flow, mind and matter are not separate substances.

561
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:05,360
Rather, they are different aspects of one whole and unbroken movement.

562
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,360
Dr. David Bohm, physicist.

563
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:18,360
The best way to understand nonlocality is to understand that in both physics and in consciousness,

564
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:26,360
there is a connection that exists amongst all things, from photons to people to awareness,

565
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:32,360
that isn't limited by space and time per se, that are woven within each other.

566
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:40,360
Dr. Yamamoto, the Japanese scientist, began to experiment with water and people putting their intent on the water,

567
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:45,360
and he did photography that would show these different crystalline structures.

568
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:50,360
If it was a very negative emotion, the crystals would be all dissonant,

569
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,360
but when it was highly ordered, conscious, or love,

570
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,360
the structures were these beautiful, ordered structures that he would photograph,

571
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,360
and this was repeated by other scientists.

572
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:06,360
Water has a crystalline component, but it's also tied into,

573
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:11,360
like all matter in space and time in the universe, to this consciousness force field.

574
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:17,360
If you enter into just a quiet state of consciousness and intend something very positive,

575
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,360
it literally altered the structure of the water itself.

576
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,360
Nonlocality is au courant with modern physics.

577
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:31,360
Schrodinger talked about nonlocality and entanglement in the 1920s,

578
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:39,360
but it really wasn't until 1970 that Friedman and Clauser at Berkeley discovered

579
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:48,360
that photons born together like identical twins can move off into the distance from one another,

580
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:53,360
and you grab one twin and you change the polarization of the other,

581
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,360
even though they're very, very far apart.

582
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:03,360
And the lingo describing this in modern physics is we would say they're entangled with one another.

583
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:09,360
There was an unpublished experiment that we did at the Pear Lab, which we called Plant RNG.

584
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:15,360
You have a room with no windows, and you have a house plant that needs light to grow.

585
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,360
You have a single growing light up on the roof.

586
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,360
The growing light can turn in one of four quadrants,

587
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,360
and which quadrant that light is showing is controlled by a random number generator.

588
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,360
So you put the plant in one corner of the room.

589
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,360
The light has an equal chance of shining in all four quadrants,

590
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:37,360
but you give it enough time and what you find is the light actually shines far more often on the plant

591
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,360
than on the other coordinates.

592
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:45,360
It's as though life itself, even life or consciousness in something as simple as a house plant,

593
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,360
bends probabilities in the physical world in the direction of what it needs,

594
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,360
in the direction of its growth and its evolution.

595
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:57,360
I see that experiment as profound because it shows to me what consciousness does in the world.

596
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,360
How could ESP work? Does ESP violate any physics?

597
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,360
First of all, you can't violate the laws of physics.

598
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,360
That's like going through a stop sign.

599
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:12,360
If you have a phenomenon, physics has to change to agree with your phenomena.

600
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:19,360
The biggest interest in classified intelligence projects has to do with the science of consciousness,

601
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:23,360
because even during the Cold War and before World War II,

602
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:28,360
they realized that there were people on the other side of some of those conflicts

603
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,360
that were very adept at what's now called remote viewing,

604
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,360
the ability to use consciousness to spy on a remote place.

605
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:41,360
These programs began to be studied scientifically and then routinized,

606
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:46,360
made routine in the intelligence community back in the 40s, 50s, 60s.

607
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,360
You could say my spiritual development was paid for by the CIA.

608
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,360
It's a very unusual situation.

609
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:58,360
In 1972, Dr. Russell Targ, a laser physicist at the Lockheed Missile and Space Company,

610
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:05,360
joined the Stanford Research Institute to begin a CIA-funded psychic espionage program

611
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,360
using remote viewing to gather intelligence on distant targets.

612
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:17,360
So we had a 20-year program at Stanford in which we worked with the CIA

613
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:21,360
to describe what the Russians, what the Chinese were doing.

614
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:28,360
We were forecasting on a Monday whether the market would go up or down the following Friday,

615
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:35,360
and we made nine forecasts like that, nine weeks in a row, and they were all correct.

616
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:40,360
We made $120,000 and were on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.

617
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:48,360
So back in 1982, when we were making money on Wall Street, ESP was real.

618
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:54,360
Everyone who is seriously interested in the pursuit of science becomes convinced

619
00:59:54,360 --> 01:00:01,360
that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe, a spirit vastly superior to man

620
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:06,360
and one in the face of which our modest powers must seem humble.

621
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,360
Albert Einstein.

622
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:15,360
We didn't invent remote viewing. It was known since biblical times.

623
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:22,360
The Buddhists spoke in very great detail about how to quiet your mind, look into the future,

624
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:29,360
and if you're an accomplished meditator, you were expected to be able to see into the distance,

625
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:34,360
see into the future, heal the sick, diagnose illnesses.

626
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:41,360
And various times during the next millennia, people would discover that, yes, indeed,

627
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,360
you can look into the future, you can look into the distance,

628
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:56,360
and our operation from 1972 to 1995, 23 years, our venture into this was a rediscovery,

629
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:04,360
a recapitulation of what people had known and forgotten during the previous millennia.

630
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:11,360
Religious traditions and the emerging scientific paradigm are converging on this personal experience

631
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,360
of universal consciousness.

632
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:20,360
Dr. Greer first glimpsed this reality during a near-death experience when he was only 17 years old.

633
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,360
You know, if you've died and you know there is no death, then you have no fear of it.

634
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,360
And until you have no fear of death, you really can't live.

635
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:34,360
I realized that the consciousness whereby I was awake, that drop of my individual awareness,

636
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,360
could merge with the ocean of unbounded cosmic mind.

637
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:44,360
So that experience taught me that there's nothing to be afraid of, and there's nowhere to go,

638
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:49,360
because you're already there. You just have to open to what's already there within you.

639
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:56,360
This liberated me in a way that I can't even imagine. It is true liberation.

640
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,360
Now, you don't have to drop dead like I did to have that happen.

641
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,360
I think you can experience that through this deeper experience in meditation.

642
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,360
And that's why after I had that near-death experience, I thought,

643
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,360
how do I get back to there without being deathly ill?

644
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,360
And so I began to learn how to do meditation.

645
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:17,360
Because the whole universe is actually folded within every single conscious being.

646
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:24,360
It's a quantum hologram, but if you look at it, every single sentient being in the cosmos

647
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:31,360
has folded within the structure of their consciousness, the entirety of the cosmos, everything.

648
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:35,360
Which is why, within these deep, quiet meditative states,

649
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,360
you can obtain knowledge, see places, know things, communicate.

650
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,360
Because in reality, it's always there.

651
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:47,360
You just have to get into a quiet state of consciousness where it opens to you.

652
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:03,360
And so I began to be a student of the ancient Vedas.

653
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:08,360
What I learned was that they had a really excellent articulation,

654
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:12,360
an explanation of consciousness, the science of consciousness,

655
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,360
higher states of consciousness, and their effect.

656
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:21,360
Now, their effect are known as cities, S-I-D-D-H-I-S.

657
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:29,360
For example, the ability to levitate, teleport, dematerialize, rematerialize,

658
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,360
bilocate, trilocate, go through solid objects.

659
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,360
These were all things that develop spontaneously as you enter into deeper and deeper

660
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,360
and higher states of consciousness, precognition, telepathy.

661
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,360
These were not considered exotic phenomena.

662
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:52,360
These were considered abilities that were available to the experienced meditator.

663
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:58,360
It's just part of quieting your mind, part of the practice, and it's all available.

664
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:05,360
We have to participate in consciously evolving these faculties that we have

665
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:11,360
that can directly experience dimensions of reality that at the present time

666
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:15,360
are out beyond our direct, immediate, sensorial system.

667
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,360
That's what we're engaged in. That's what this is all about.

668
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,360
And that's what these beings are. These beings, obviously,

669
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,360
probably come from like a red dwarf star, some of them,

670
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,360
where they've been around 10 billion years longer than we have.

671
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:31,360
And so they've evolved these other faculties in addition to being able to see

672
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,360
and touch and taste and do the things they do.

673
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:38,360
And so people are saying, what is our relationship to these beings?

674
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:43,360
Why is it that they even look as much as they do like us or why we look like them?

675
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:47,360
These are all profoundly important questions of our relationship

676
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:53,360
with other sentient life in the universe and to understand our place in the order of things.

677
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:58,360
When you accept what this science is showing us, that we are all connected,

678
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:03,360
and you then say, well, hold on a second, if we're not just connected with human beings,

679
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,360
but we're also connected with the plant life, with the planet itself,

680
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:12,360
with the entire animal kingdom, and you begin to develop that deeper sense of empathy with all that,

681
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:19,360
who's to say that that interconnectedness doesn't extend to all the other planets, to the cosmos?

682
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,360
If we share that with extraterrestrials, what does that world look like?

683
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:29,360
If consciousness and thought can affect something at a distance, and at a very great distance,

684
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:33,360
even many miles or thousands of miles away instantaneously,

685
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:40,360
what does that mean for us communicating with a civilization that is centered in the science of consciousness?

686
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:47,360
And that is their chief operating system. It's not electromagnetic. They use it, but it's beyond that.

687
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:51,360
So now add to everything we know about the internet and communications and telecom,

688
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:57,360
and then add a deeper level of trans-dimensional physics that involve electronic devices

689
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:03,360
very clearly picking up intended coherent thought. That's what you're dealing with.

690
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,360
It's like Dr. John's random number generator experiment on a cosmic scale,

691
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:15,360
but at a level of perfection where there's precision with the thought that you project to it,

692
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,360
it's reception, and then it's activity.

693
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:23,360
Interstellar civilizations are using consciousness-assisting technologies,

694
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:30,360
and technologies that assist their own consciousness, both, in all their travel and communication systems.

695
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:35,360
The central operating system for any interstellar competent civilization

696
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:40,360
is the science of consciousness and all the physics that go with that.

697
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:47,360
We can see an early example of consciousness technology in the MIND lamp, developed by Siluron.

698
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:52,360
This prototype integrates a random number generator into a color-changing light.

699
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,360
Think of a color, and the lamp turns that color.

700
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:04,360
That's what I actually was doing. First I was doing sunset.

701
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,360
Oh, cool.

702
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:10,360
This basic interface between mind and machine points to a deep interconnection

703
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:15,360
between all things that science is only beginning to recognize.

704
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:20,360
It's the means for us as a civilization to be anchored in something more profound

705
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:24,360
than the superficial aspects of being, say, human.

706
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:28,360
Because humanism isn't enough, because we're dealing with non-human life forms.

707
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:34,360
Now we have to transcend even humanism and our common humanity into this idea

708
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:38,360
that there has to be something more universal within us

709
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:43,360
that's also within these extraterrestrial civilizations that bind us together.

710
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:49,360
And luckily there is. It's this field of consciousness that is cosmic and universal.

711
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,360
And that's what's inside everyone.

712
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:56,360
It doesn't matter if it's a homeless person on the street or an MIT professor.

713
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:01,360
If they are conscious and awake, the entirety of the cosmos is folded within them

714
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,360
like a conscious quantum hologram.

715
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,360
Because consciousness isn't limited by space and time.

716
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,360
People say, where do I have to go?

717
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,360
Well, first you have to go within yourself.

718
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,360
But you have to understand what yourself is.

719
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,360
And there's your individual ego and self.

720
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:21,360
But there's this deeper aspect of ourselves that is simultaneously interwoven.

721
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,360
And when we go deep in meditation and connect to that,

722
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:29,360
then we have reached the point that we can be an ambassador to the universe.

723
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,360
Because we have become universal.

724
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:38,360
In our time, this search for extraterrestrial life will eventually change our laws,

725
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:45,360
our religions, our philosophies, our arts, our recreations, as well as our sciences.

726
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:51,360
Space, the mirror, waits for life to come look for itself there.

727
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,360
Ray Bradbury.

728
01:08:55,360 --> 01:09:01,360
Once this question mark is introduced into your brain, you start searching out answers.

729
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,360
It was like the kind of the Dreyfus character in Close Encounters.

730
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:09,360
You want to know what's really behind the screen.

731
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,360
And because we're not being told this.

732
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:16,360
And, you know, we do have the ability to change life for the better on this planet.

733
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:22,360
But we're being suppressed and we're being stopped from doing it for a variety of reasons,

734
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:26,360
most of which are greed motivated.

735
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:32,360
So we went out to Oracle and sure enough, I mean, we did these protocols and we got into meditation,

736
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,360
which is something I want to learn about more.

737
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,360
And, you know, things started to appear.

738
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:57,360
Well, oh, no.

739
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,360
Oh, and it's fading out.

740
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,360
Yeah, it just went away.

741
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:25,360
Oh, it's back.

742
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,360
Yeah, right here.

743
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:55,360
It just went out again.

744
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:02,360
The steps of this are that you sit in quiet consciousness and you don't have to have a full on Samadhi or whatever,

745
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:09,360
but just in quiet consciousness, connect to that aspect of your mind that is unbounded

746
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:15,360
and then intend to sense, feel, see, know where the ET craft is.

747
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,360
It could be in another galaxy.

748
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:23,360
Connect to those beings, politely invite them to come and visit you.

749
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,360
And then you connect to their communication systems and their consciousness, which are integrated,

750
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,360
and you show them where you are.

751
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,360
So you kind of zoom in.

752
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:38,360
It's almost like a vectoring, zooming in from wherever they are to where you are.

753
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:45,360
Let's say if you're in North Carolina, you're coming into Earth, you're coming into North America,

754
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:51,360
the East Coast, the mountains, the Blue Ridge, zoom down to a few square meters around where you are,

755
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,360
where you clearly show them where you are.

756
01:11:53,360 --> 01:12:09,360
And you do this in a coherent thought sequence that is continuous.

757
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,360
It's very easy to do once you practice it for a while.

758
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:18,360
The key thing is to first take about half an hour to meditate, go into quiet mind,

759
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,360
then sense where they are, and then invite them.

760
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,360
Well, people say, you're calling them.

761
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,360
I say, well, no, it's not like that.

762
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,360
You're actually making contact and consciousness and thought

763
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:32,360
before they arrive in their craft or trans-dimensionally around you.

764
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:38,360
And when the ETs approach us most profoundly is when everyone in the team

765
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:43,360
is in a coherent state of consciousness and are clearly doing this with the intent.

766
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:48,360
This cohesion with the group, this meditation being part of making contact,

767
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,360
which I had no idea, even though I'm looking at your YouTube videos,

768
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,360
that component didn't resonate.

769
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:58,360
It was my scientific brain saying, well, I'm going to go look at UFOs.

770
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:02,360
What happens in these groups is there's a coherence between a bond between the group.

771
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:07,360
And when there's a love and a connection there, it enhances the part of making contact

772
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:12,360
because we're together where, one, there's like a fine love there between all of us.

773
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:17,360
The second or third night, we had the twin ships come from the Atlantic Ocean 910 at night.

774
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:24,360
Here's all of a sudden this ship comes in and it's like the size of a sun and it's pulsing.

775
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:28,360
And Dr. Greer, you signal it with your laser and then a second one manifests

776
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,360
and they're both pulsing.

777
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,360
At that point, my hair is standing up.

778
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,360
I have the chills.

779
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,360
I'm going, this is amazing.

780
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:42,360
I'm like, to actually witness something firsthand as opposed to seeing it on television

781
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,360
or seeing photographs, it's mind-blowing.

782
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,360
For me, it was so profound, I couldn't sleep that night.

783
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:53,360
I was just amazed, but the amazement was that not that I saw it,

784
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,360
and actually I needed that because I have that mindset, but the feeling you got.

785
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,360
I got this incredible feeling.

786
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:04,360
You have these two ships and then I can't explain it.

787
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:09,360
It's just an emotional state and I was so taken by it.

788
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,360
Once you see something, you can't unsee it.

789
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:18,360
It sort of shattered my small view of the world and I became aware.

790
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:24,360
Learning the protocols and making this kind of contact has really helped me move up a notch spiritually.

791
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:28,360
I really feel that it's helped me to really see the oneness in all things.

792
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,360
When you're sitting under a blanket of stars, you're really part of it.

793
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:37,360
I mean, you feel your little drop in that huge ocean.

794
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,360
Sorry, it's emotional.

795
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:45,360
You have to experience it, but I wish for everybody to have that opportunity.

796
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,360
When I first started out, it was shocking.

797
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:01,360
The first few orbs I saw, the phenomena I saw, changed my entire paradigm.

798
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:06,360
The first sighting was an incredible triangle formation of three golden spheres

799
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,360
over my apartment in Newport Beach, California.

800
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:14,360
I ran outside and saw this formation right above my house at close range

801
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,360
and I managed to capture it on film.

802
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:20,360
As I put the lens on it, I saw they were three perfect golden spheres

803
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:24,360
all holding this incredible formation over my apartment.

804
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,360
The longer I filmed, the more maneuvers they demonstrated

805
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,360
and it was clear the objects were under intelligent control.

806
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,360
It was Christmas morning, December 2016.

807
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,360
I was on my porch having coffee

808
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,360
when I saw this incredible double-staged orb flying through the air.

809
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,360
I was following this object upward

810
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,360
and it went right up like it was going to pass out of my line of sight.

811
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,360
When I asked the object, please turn back around,

812
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,360
I didn't want the experience to end.

813
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:59,360
And amazingly, it stopped, changed direction, then headed back downward.

814
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,360
That was truly profound to me, that I could meditate,

815
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,360
send my thought into the universe,

816
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,360
and then have a visual response in the sky

817
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,360
to confirm that we are interacting with each other.

818
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,360
That says something about the nature of mind,

819
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,360
the nature of the phenomenon itself,

820
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,360
and the power of our own consciousness to interact.

821
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,360
In October 2018, we had the biggest sighting I've seen yet

822
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,360
in Long Beach, California.

823
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,360
My girlfriend and I were in the backyard

824
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,360
when we saw this huge white object in the sky.

825
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,360
This was different than most of the normal orbs I filmed.

826
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,360
This object was elongated

827
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,360
and almost looked like a moving portal in the sky.

828
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,360
Amazingly, once I got the camera on it,

829
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:45,360
an incredible triangle formation of orbs shot out of this main object,

830
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,360
and I captured it on film.

831
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,360
You can hear how excited I am in the film

832
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:53,360
to see this again, this triangle formation, for the third time.

833
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,360
Wow, what the fuck is that thing?

834
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,360
Wow.

835
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,360
Holy shit.

836
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,360
I continued to film the object as it traversed across the sky

837
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,360
when suddenly it started ejecting a series of these smaller orbs,

838
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,360
50 smaller objects and counting.

839
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:20,360
Strangely, I could only see the smaller orbs on my infrared camera.

840
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,360
They were not visible to the naked eye.

841
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,360
It goes to show you how much is flying around in the sky that we can't see.

842
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,360
About six months after I had the near-death experience

843
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,360
and I began learning meditation,

844
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,360
I was sitting up on a mountain up in North Carolina,

845
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,360
and right before sunset I looked over towards the southwest

846
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,360
and I saw a beautiful silver disc, seamless,

847
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,360
close encounter to the first kind.

848
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:55,360
It looked exactly like the ET craft I'd seen when I was eight or nine

849
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,360
when I was a child in North Carolina,

850
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,360
which actually ignited my interest in all of this.

851
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,360
So I said, oh, well, they're back. I didn't think much more about it.

852
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,360
So I sat to meditate and I went into this very deep meditation.

853
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,360
By the time I came out of the meditation, it was very pitch dark,

854
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:13,360
and there was the whole Milky Way galaxy was above my head,

855
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,360
and a thought was sent in to me.

856
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,360
It was very clear.

857
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,360
It wasn't my random thought or hallucination at all.

858
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:25,360
And it said, behold, what a beautiful universe God has made.

859
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,360
And with that, I went right into the state of consciousness

860
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,360
that I was in, in the near-death experience,

861
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,360
except now I'm awake and standing on the mountain.

862
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,360
And at that instant, I became aware that there was sort of a glow

863
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:42,360
an energy field right below the peak and through the forest.

864
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:45,360
I thought it was a deer standing on its hind legs,

865
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,360
and it had these beautiful deer-like eyes.

866
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,360
And I went, what is that doing here?

867
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:55,360
And I realized it wasn't a deer, and it actually appeared

868
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,360
and then dematerialized, came over and touched me on the right shoulder.

869
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,360
But I could sense its energy field was still there.

870
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,360
There was phasing in and out of 3D

871
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:10,360
and the near dimension of astral energy.

872
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:13,360
And when it touched my right shoulder,

873
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,360
I could actually see my ski jacket and dent.

874
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,360
And all my hair stood on end.

875
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,360
It was like this electromagnetic pulse.

876
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,360
And I had long hair, and it sort of ding!

877
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,360
At that instant, I vanished off the mountaintop onto the ship,

878
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,360
and then we were bang, almost instantly out in space.

879
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,360
So at that point, I stayed in this meditative state

880
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,360
and was teaching the ETs what it was like

881
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,360
to be in that state of consciousness,

882
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,360
but also be a boy, a young man, on Earth.

883
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,360
They were very interested in this.

884
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,360
And then we kind of merged together in our meditation,

885
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:54,360
and I created with them this protocol for making contact with them.

886
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,360
Two years later, Dr. Greer attempted to recreate the experience

887
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,360
during a meditation teacher training course in the French Alps,

888
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,360
resulting in the first mass witness CE5.

889
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:12,360
What we experienced in France was really life-changing for me.

890
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,360
It was the summer of 1975, and that was the year we both turned 20.

891
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:19,360
When we were in teacher training, it was very intensive.

892
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,360
We were meditating, doing yoga,

893
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:25,360
listening to endless tapes of Maharishi.

894
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,360
So I did a deep meditation, went into this state,

895
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,360
and could sense where in space these ET crafts were,

896
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,360
connected to them, introduced myself by name,

897
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:40,360
and then vectored them like you would vector a jet into JFK Airport.

898
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,360
All of a sudden, right out of nowhere,

899
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:52,360
appeared a metallic, silent, tetrahedron-shaped silver ship.

900
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,360
It just appeared.

901
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,360
And I said, what is that, Steve?

902
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,360
There was no sound.

903
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:02,360
And it was just suspended in the air and then gone.

904
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,360
And there was just the blue sky again.

905
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:09,360
It will happen if you do it with just a pure state of innocence about it.

906
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:14,360
And that's when I realized that this can actually be done with groups of people.

907
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,360
And I just filed that away.

908
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:21,360
Snoopy 2, if you want to turn towards the tower and show me your lights,

909
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,360
I can look over that way with the glasses.

910
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,360
That's a 2-rocket.

911
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:29,360
We got to...I don't know where they got to now.

912
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,360
There were two of them.

913
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,360
They were low and then went to about 4,000 foot to start to circle.

914
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,360
And there was two of them.

915
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,360
No navigation lights at all on them.

916
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:45,360
In 1977, Dr. Greer discovered how precisely he could vector ET's to a star.

917
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,360
Upon reconnecting with those beings using the CE5 protocols,

918
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:53,360
he showed them his location in the Blue Ridge Mountains,

919
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,360
but first directed them to where he was born and raised,

920
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,360
in Charlotte, North Carolina.

921
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,360
Then he went to sleep.

922
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,360
Two objects over the Coliseum.

923
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,360
Yeah, I do have something.

924
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,360
I got a specimen out there eastbound.

925
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,360
I don't know what the other one is.

926
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,360
Negative, you got two of them out here to keep circling.

927
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:22,360
Unbeknownst to him, that attempt to initiate contact

928
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:28,360
precipitated a major sighting over Charlotte involving pilots and air traffic control.

929
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:34,360
An insider has leaked the FAA traffic control tapes that corroborated the encounter.

930
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:38,360
Snoopy 2, no sir, I'm not painting a target right now.

931
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,360
Move it there Roger.

932
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,360
We got something out here flying around.

933
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,360
I don't believe in flying saucers, but it ain't an aircraft, so I don't know why it is.

934
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,360
What I experienced was that I'm awakened,

935
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,360
and there's this kind of beautiful cobalt blue chip,

936
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:56,360
maybe 20 feet above the ground outside my window, the bedroom window.

937
01:22:56,360 --> 01:23:01,360
This wakes up my housemate, who's in the bedroom adjacent to mine.

938
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,360
He comes running out, says, what did you do?

939
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:09,360
And the lesson from that was the specificity of the vector.

940
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,360
In other words, I was very specific.

941
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:15,360
I vectored them first to Charlotte, showed them where Charlotte was,

942
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,360
the epicenter where all this was going on.

943
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,360
It was over the part of Charlotte where I was born and all that,

944
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,360
and then guided them from there up here.

945
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,360
I think what they were saying to me is, we can be very specific with instructions,

946
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,360
and we'll show you that.

947
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,360
It was a teachable moment.

948
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,360
And I sort of felt like I really shouldn't do this in my life.

949
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:36,360
I sort of felt like I really shouldn't do this unless I have some higher purpose, too.

950
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:52,360
In 1990, he formed the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence

951
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,360
to disseminate the CE5 protocols

952
01:23:55,360 --> 01:24:00,360
and establish peaceful and sustainable relations with ET life forms.

953
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:07,360
Two years later, Dr. Greer and his team went up to Woodborough Hill in Wilshire, England.

954
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,360
There, they visualized and thought a geometric pattern

955
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:16,360
symbolizing the trilogy of components that make up the CE5 protocols.

956
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,360
Thought, light, and sound.

957
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:24,360
Immediately, this crop circle appeared in the field nearby.

958
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:36,360
So, some of these civilizations that we're interacting with on our teams

959
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:40,360
are in the order of a billion years beyond our development.

960
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:46,360
And all those beings in that civilization are in a state of unity consciousness

961
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:51,360
that is so enlightened that they could be confused with, say, an angel or something.

962
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,360
But they're not. They're not from...

963
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,360
They're ET, and they're not from that.

964
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:59,360
They could be confused with, say, an angel or something.

965
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,360
But they're not. They're not from...

966
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,360
They're ETs with star systems and planets and bodies.

967
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:10,360
But their level of consciousness would be at the level of, say, the highest spiritual realm.

968
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:16,360
There's a precise correlation to the kind of technology that you will observe

969
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,360
and the level of consciousness that civilization has attained.

970
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,360
Let's take our own civilization.

971
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,360
We're mostly still separate people,

972
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,360
and we're operating through a reductionist separate paradigm.

973
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,360
We're also still very violent and destructive.

974
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,360
So, let's look at our technologies.

975
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,360
Oil, we're burning something and destroying the air.

976
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:39,360
Nuclear power, we're splitting and tearing apart an atom to create heat,

977
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,360
to turn a turbine, to create electricity.

978
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,360
Coal, we're digging stuff up and destroying mountains

979
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,360
and then burning this stuff in a fiery furnace.

980
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,360
It's all very destructive.

981
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:56,360
And so our technologies are a corollary to our inner state of consciousness.

982
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:03,360
In 1964, Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev proposed a hypothetical scale

983
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:07,360
of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement

984
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:12,360
based on the amount of energy they're able to utilize.

985
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:17,360
A level one civilization, also called a planetary civilization,

986
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,360
can use and store all the energy available on this planet.

987
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:26,360
At that point, their main focus becomes the development of higher states of consciousness

988
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:30,360
because they have all the technologies to meet everyone's needs.

989
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,360
There's no shortage.

990
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:36,360
Their economic system is non-economic in the sense that

991
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:40,360
there is an infinite abundance for everyone because of these technologies

992
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:45,360
that can materialize things out of the substrate of space-time,

993
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,360
the elementals of space-time.

994
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:52,360
So at that point, a civilization becomes really focused

995
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:55,360
on the development of higher states of consciousness.

996
01:26:55,360 --> 01:27:00,360
And as they evolve in consciousness, their technologies evolve with them.

997
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:05,360
They will begin to then unfurl the mysteries of consciousness

998
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,360
and the cities I mentioned earlier in the Vedas,

999
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:11,360
but those get applied technologically,

1000
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,360
which include levitation, teleportation, dematerialization, bilocation,

1001
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,360
where the same object can be instantly, resonantly created

1002
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,360
and be in two places at once.

1003
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,360
We've had this happen on our team.

1004
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:27,360
As water by cooling and condensation becomes ice,

1005
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:31,360
so thought by condensation assumes physical form.

1006
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:36,360
Everything in the universe is thought in material form.

1007
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:48,360
I like this story of this Lockheed Skunkworks top-secret witness who defected.

1008
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:52,360
He was trying to learn a technique to go into meditation

1009
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,360
but then astrally project, and he did.

1010
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,360
And he went up out of his body with his astral body of light,

1011
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:02,360
went up into the air and slammed right into the side of an ET spacecraft.

1012
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:06,360
Well, what he couldn't understand was that when he bumped up

1013
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:09,360
against the ET spacecraft with his astral body,

1014
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,360
the body all of you, when you have a lucid dream

1015
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:15,360
and you're flying over the water or flying over,

1016
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,360
that is your body of light.

1017
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,360
Same thing when you have a near-death experience,

1018
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,360
you go in your body of light.

1019
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:24,360
Well, his astral body hit the side of this craft and it rocked it.

1020
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,360
And then he popped inside and the ETs were looking at him like,

1021
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:30,360
my God, why don't you watch where you're going, cosmic faux pas.

1022
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,360
But he moved the ship.

1023
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,360
He says, how did my astral body move that ET spacecraft?

1024
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,360
I said, because the density of that spacecraft,

1025
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,360
resonantly, energetically, was identical to your astral body

1026
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:45,360
because with the naked eye, it was shifted out of 3D

1027
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,360
into this dimension that is increasingly conscious energy

1028
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,360
and conscious forms.

1029
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,360
And since like can interface with like,

1030
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,360
your density of your astral body and that craft,

1031
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:02,360
because it was shifted to that level, it could interact with it.

1032
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:06,360
Now, had it been a 3D craft that had stepped down,

1033
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:09,360
like a transformer stepped down into full 3D,

1034
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,360
he would have gone straight through it

1035
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,360
because the density would have been different.

1036
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,360
The resonant field interface would have been different.

1037
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:19,360
And when I explained that to him, he said,

1038
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,360
now I understand so many things that have happened

1039
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,360
between me and ETs.

1040
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:28,360
The great thing about C5 is it's anything but remote.

1041
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,360
It is true contact.

1042
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:34,360
Oh, my God.

1043
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,360
That was great.

1044
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:43,360
During a CE5 expedition at Mount Shasta,

1045
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,360
Dr. Greer and his team were in contact

1046
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:49,360
with an interstellar object and its occupants

1047
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,360
in the field in front of them.

1048
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,360
Suddenly, this light ship lifted off from the ground

1049
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:59,360
and turned left, phasing in and out of 3D space time

1050
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,360
before vanishing in clear skies.

1051
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:07,360
This was visible to the naked eye for everyone present.

1052
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,360
You know, Dr. Greer says our first interest

1053
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,360
is an academic interest,

1054
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,360
and in my case, that was how I got into this.

1055
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,360
But very quickly after that,

1056
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:23,360
it changes to a heart, mind, and soul connection

1057
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:28,360
that is really a very powerful driving force in your life.

1058
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:32,360
And it's important to go from the academic interest

1059
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,360
to the experience level,

1060
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,360
and that's what happens very quickly.

1061
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:39,360
You make this transition to an experience

1062
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,360
of this new lifestyle,

1063
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:45,360
this new understanding of our place in the universe.

1064
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,360
We wanted to take action because it's important

1065
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,360
to not only learn about this academically,

1066
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,360
but then to take action on it.

1067
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,360
It was very empowering for me

1068
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,360
because I felt like they helped to let us know

1069
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,360
that we are on the right path,

1070
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,360
and then we have the power to make a change.

1071
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,360
It changes you completely.

1072
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,360
It changes your heart.

1073
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,360
And then your entire life changes.

1074
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:13,360
All things from that point forward are possible.

1075
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,360
I have a friend in Holland.

1076
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,360
Her name's Linda.

1077
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:25,360
And she has some very amazing footage that she's captured.

1078
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,360
This is amazing.

1079
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,360
Stop, turn left, turn right, move around,

1080
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,360
at all kinds of angles.

1081
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,360
And she's had multiple events like this happen.

1082
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,360
What will be evident in that footage

1083
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:01,360
is what she has actually asked for them to do.

1084
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:05,360
So I know there's one case where she has told me herself

1085
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,360
that they have produced a V-shape,

1086
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:10,360
and she requested that in consciousness.

1087
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,360
They're divided themselves in six balls,

1088
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,360
and then three balls,

1089
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,360
and there were lots of other lights.

1090
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,360
We see this quite often,

1091
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,360
but it's very unusual to get it on video.

1092
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:33,360
And this is why it's a fantastic example

1093
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:37,360
of the kind of maneuverability that these spacecraft can make.

1094
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:40,360
I really do love it when people get things like that

1095
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,360
and they can show people that are new to the subject

1096
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,360
because it's really inspiring.

1097
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,360
This is amazing.

1098
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,360
This is amazing.

1099
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:51,360
When I sound

1100
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:55,360
It moves away so fast

1101
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:59,360
You fall down to the ground

1102
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:03,360
The noise wants to come

1103
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,360
Jump back to my feet

1104
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:10,360
Now I only see a head of me

1105
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:14,360
Chasing down the street

1106
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:23,360
Chasing down the street

1107
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:28,360
Chasing down the street

1108
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:32,360
Chasing down the street

1109
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,360
I do want to know what the aliens...

1110
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,360
Look like.

1111
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:40,360
All right, well, the one, for example,

1112
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:44,360
that healed this man's hearing who is in our circle,

1113
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:48,680
sort of very triangular head, about five and a half feet tall.

1114
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,880
The photograph of it is beautiful,

1115
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,840
but the experience that this man had was more beautiful.

1116
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,200
Had a great experience at Oracle

1117
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,120
and ended up having a healing experience.

1118
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:07,040
We did these protocols and we got into meditation

1119
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,240
and things started to appear.

1120
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,200
And we're photographing it and we're seeing it

1121
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,720
and we're watching it and we're looking around

1122
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:15,680
and everyone's mouths are wide open.

1123
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:19,120
A lot of times these craft, they pop in and out so fast

1124
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,440
that to try and capture them on a telephoto lens

1125
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,200
is next to impossible.

1126
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,040
While in deep meditation,

1127
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,160
they heard a being walking behind them,

1128
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,600
phasing in and out of 3D space time.

1129
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,920
Marconi adjusted his camera to shoot in the direction

1130
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,320
that Dr. Greer pointed.

1131
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:41,120
All of a sudden, a teardrop-shaped trans-dimensional object

1132
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:44,320
materialized between Ed Moen and a medical student,

1133
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,520
which was witnessed by most of the circle.

1134
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,680
We reviewed my photos from that particular time

1135
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:52,160
and there on the hillside,

1136
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,880
standing behind a man named Ed Moen,

1137
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,320
was this being that everyone was like, whoa, what is this?

1138
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,240
This being has a very triangular face

1139
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,720
and has been seen on a number of our expeditions

1140
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,880
and they are known as master healers.

1141
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,560
Ed couldn't, he wore hearing aids in both ears

1142
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,560
and he couldn't hear half of the things

1143
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:13,720
people were saying to him.

1144
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:16,240
I had hearing loss from high school.

1145
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:18,880
I would avoid parties and social settings

1146
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,160
where lots of people would gather together

1147
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,760
because it was uncomfortable not to be able to hear.

1148
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,320
Got to my room and I felt this draw to go back out there.

1149
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:34,160
So I got up and walked out and I saw this red light out

1150
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:37,760
in the middle of the desert about 300 feet away or so.

1151
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,400
They connected with it right away.

1152
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,280
I could feel it.

1153
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:41,720
I knew that it was aware of me

1154
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:44,760
and that it was indeed the thing that was calling me.

1155
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:48,440
So I invited it to come and hang out.

1156
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,040
At one point, Daniel heard me talking to this red orb

1157
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,040
and he couldn't believe it either.

1158
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,120
He went and got his camera

1159
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:59,120
and took a short video clip of this red orb.

1160
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,600
He said that for the next 45 minutes,

1161
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,160
he had a communication with them

1162
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:08,880
and at the end of the conversation, he said,

1163
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,560
do you think you can do something about my hearing?

1164
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,000
Got some sleep and when I woke up,

1165
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,160
I went out to breakfast with some of the people in the group.

1166
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:21,320
I had hearing aids and they weren't with me at breakfast

1167
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:25,240
and it was a very emotional event for me to discover

1168
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:28,320
that I could hear everything everyone was saying

1169
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,800
at the table and not only at my table,

1170
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,440
but at tables away from me.

1171
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,080
And I haven't worn my hearing aids since.

1172
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,000
I had a hard time finding them to bring them here.

1173
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,440
They do a very good job, but not as good as the E.T.'s did.

1174
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,000
It's changed my life, you know, it really has.

1175
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,480
That's the part that gets me.

1176
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,840
I didn't know this happened to him

1177
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,560
until I saw him the next day on the hammock

1178
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,600
and he was just relating the story

1179
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,840
and he was crying like a baby.

1180
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,080
Just to watch the emotion coming out of him

1181
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,240
was very moving and he's had perfect hearing since then.

1182
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:10,440
My takeaway from the event and from my experience

1183
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:14,280
with the E.T.'s is that they've been in my life a long time

1184
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,240
and I just didn't know it.

1185
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,920
It's such a beautiful world waiting for us.

1186
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,720
It's useful for us to think about our own experience

1187
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,320
over the last couple hundred years.

1188
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,360
You go back 200 and some years

1189
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:31,120
and show Thomas Jefferson a modern smartphone.

1190
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,840
To anyone of that period,

1191
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:35,040
it would look like something that was magic.

1192
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,760
Any sufficiently advanced technology

1193
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:41,880
is indistinguishable from magic.

1194
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,880
Arthur C. Clarke.

1195
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:45,480
We're dealing with civilizations

1196
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:48,400
where almost every aspect of how they appear

1197
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:51,880
in our time space would look like magic to us.

1198
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:56,160
And in the CIA, this is actually called WSFM.

1199
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:57,400
Sounds like a radio station.

1200
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:00,560
It stands for Weird Science and Frickin' Magic.

1201
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:03,320
A spacecraft can be completely 3D

1202
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:06,080
like you see a solid aircraft.

1203
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,680
It can be partially in this dimension

1204
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:12,000
but shifted mostly into another dimension.

1205
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,320
So I liken this to like when you're turning a dial

1206
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:18,440
on an old AM radio and you can move it across

1207
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:21,040
and you suddenly pick up Chicago and New York.

1208
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,280
At the same time, they're bleeding together,

1209
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,720
dimensional bleeding.

1210
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,440
And so often these E.T. craft

1211
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,800
will be partially in this dimension

1212
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,560
but mostly out.

1213
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,760
And all that we will detect in this dimension

1214
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,720
might be an electronic signature

1215
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,800
or an object that appears and flashes in and out,

1216
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,000
a scintillation of light that then vanishes

1217
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,560
or an object that comes in

1218
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,400
where it looks almost like a hologram

1219
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,560
of an E.T. being that will be standing amongst us.

1220
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:53,920
But it's an electronically teleported version

1221
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:56,000
of that conscious being.

1222
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,960
I love this one.

1223
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:58,680
His name is Bijou.

1224
01:39:58,720 --> 01:39:59,720
He's pronounced Bijou.

1225
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:02,960
He's an interstellar being from Andromeda

1226
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,680
and he has a very bright looking nose

1227
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,800
because there was an orb here

1228
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,240
that teleported him onto the site.

1229
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,560
With the naked eye, the only thing that was seen

1230
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,600
was this sphere that came up right beside my shoulder.

1231
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,720
What was amazing is there was a light

1232
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:18,720
kind of illuminating this being.

1233
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:22,200
He was just floating in sort of this energetic space

1234
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,440
and it looked like he was waving at me.

1235
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,720
He's sort of doing this, floating.

1236
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:27,800
He's in the air maybe five feet up.

1237
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,600
When I asked him where he was from,

1238
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:33,440
he said it was from Andromeda Galaxy.

1239
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,480
Sometimes I have to pinch myself

1240
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:38,080
and make sure I do a little self check

1241
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:40,840
to make sure I'm just really seeing something

1242
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,160
or it's not my imagination,

1243
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:44,920
but that was a huge confirmation

1244
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:48,800
that we are really onto something with what we're doing,

1245
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,760
that we are really making contact.

1246
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:54,120
The E.T.'s are participants in the whole story

1247
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:55,920
and this whole unfoldment.

1248
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:58,840
So it's really amazing that you're communicating

1249
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:02,480
with someone from an entirely different world

1250
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:06,960
and it's mind boggling really.

1251
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,000
Now this is beautiful.

1252
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,280
We were on the beach and this appears

1253
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,680
right on the sand in front of me.

1254
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:14,920
And you can see the eyes very faintly.

1255
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,920
It's barely in this dimension.

1256
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:21,920
It's very crystalline, pitch black on this beach.

1257
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:25,000
This being highly intelligent,

1258
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,160
an extraterrestrial civilization

1259
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,240
at the level of the celestial.

1260
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:32,320
So it visualized humanity evolving

1261
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,880
to the point that everyone on earth

1262
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:37,160
were in cosmic consciousness and enlightenment.

1263
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,880
That's what we're talking about.

1264
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,320
Half a million to a billion years ahead of us.

1265
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,160
Get a load of this.

1266
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,040
We're in a deep meditation I'm leading.

1267
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,600
We're in cosmic consciousness.

1268
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,120
This is a Peruvian doctor, medical doctor.

1269
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,320
I call it the cosmic spermatozoa.

1270
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:54,920
It looks, and it comes in and it wraps around her

1271
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,480
and she begins to have the Kundalini

1272
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:00,440
and an enlightenment experience like she's never had.

1273
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:04,000
And of course this happens a lot on these expeditions

1274
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,720
but we got it on photograph.

1275
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,000
Isn't that cool?

1276
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,400
I love this one.

1277
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,680
It's just off the edge of the hill

1278
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:12,360
and you can see people turning to look.

1279
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,520
And it was this object that materialized

1280
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:18,360
into this dimension and lit up and then dematerialized.

1281
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:22,520
What I saw in my remote view was a very large craft

1282
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,920
filled with ETs from different civilizations

1283
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:27,280
that were joining us in the meditation.

1284
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,560
Because that's what they're interested in.

1285
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,440
They're interested if you have a pure heart,

1286
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:32,480
a clear intent, and you're wanting

1287
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,560
to join them in universal peace.

1288
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:35,440
That's it.

1289
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,080
They don't care about your degrees.

1290
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,120
They don't care about.

1291
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,760
This is what the Prince of Liechtenstein said.

1292
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,800
You know I've gone all over the world

1293
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,040
where these UFOs are seen

1294
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,040
and they're seen before I'm there and after

1295
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:47,200
but when I'm there they're not around.

1296
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,560
Maybe it's my attitude.

1297
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,200
I said bingo.

1298
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:52,680
Every experience that could be that was described,

1299
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:55,880
no matter how unbelievable in Dr. Rear's books

1300
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,800
or the manuals, we've experienced them ourselves.

1301
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,000
And someone snapped a photo with their iPad,

1302
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,440
beams of energy with arrowheads on them

1303
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,600
coming out of members third eye and the heart center.

1304
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,480
When we look closer at the photo here,

1305
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,840
there was a silhouette and they were standing

1306
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:12,880
before we had broken the circle,

1307
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,240
they were standing under the hands of people

1308
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16,360
as we had held hands there.

1309
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:19,760
So you could see a bald being with a long robe

1310
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,080
about four feet tall.

1311
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:22,640
So that was an amazing shot.

1312
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,280
What I began to understand

1313
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:27,320
is that there's this whole spectrum of phenomena

1314
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:32,320
that involves 3D matter, light, sounds that emerge,

1315
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:35,560
tonality, electromagnetic interface.

1316
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:38,240
For example, we have electronic devices we'll have out

1317
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,760
like a radar detector, magnetometers

1318
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,960
that pick up the magnetic field shift.

1319
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:45,480
Those will all start being activated

1320
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,280
when a craft is approaching

1321
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,920
and we're out in the middle of the wilderness

1322
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:51,960
where there's no source of this electromagnetic radiation

1323
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:56,040
but they'll start communicating in a specific cadence

1324
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:57,680
and a repeatable cadence.

1325
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,920
And I call this trans-dimensional electronic communication.

1326
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:03,760
And they will actually take over the circuitry

1327
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,960
of these electronic devices we have out in the desert

1328
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:11,640
and begin to do a specific communication.

1329
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:15,040
Now you have to decode it, but it's reproducible.

1330
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,560
And there are different civilizations

1331
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,520
will have a different pattern.

1332
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:21,720
So this is an electronic version of the making contact.

1333
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,080
On the shores of the outer banks in North Carolina,

1334
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:29,720
ETs produce these tones via the Teams radar detector.

1335
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:40,720
An enormous golden object appeared, illuminating the ocean.

1336
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:42,040
Yes.

1337
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:51,640
Another object appeared and made 180 degree turn,

1338
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:54,040
a maneuver that no satellite can make

1339
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:58,640
then dematerialized in clear skies.

1340
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:02,080
What comes up in the context of CE5

1341
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,360
is something's happening.

1342
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:07,200
Well, what is it?

1343
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,360
How's it gonna affect me?

1344
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,280
And all the drama comes up.

1345
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,120
The Independence Day images,

1346
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:17,720
the drama that's all through YouTube,

1347
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:20,480
all of the programming that is out there

1348
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,040
comes up because we're saturated in it.

1349
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,440
What I would suggest to people

1350
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:26,680
if they are experiencing fear

1351
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:28,760
or if they feel apprehensive about doing it,

1352
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:30,880
make sure you do it in a group.

1353
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:35,880
Make sure you set up the parameters of unity, of peace.

1354
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:41,040
This is a frequency that is far out of the spectrum of fear.

1355
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,400
So there's an incompatibility there

1356
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,720
in a scientific perspective.

1357
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:47,160
If you think about resonant waves,

1358
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:51,160
the energy, the gratitude, love, joy, peace, all of that.

1359
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:53,800
This is a frequency that you establish first

1360
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,200
through whichever practice appeals to you

1361
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,960
and then extend your connection from there.

1362
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:02,040
Researchers have discovered that remote viewing

1363
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,720
and meditation are most effective

1364
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,880
when the participant enters a state

1365
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,720
called heart-mind coherence.

1366
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:12,880
The human heart contains 40,000 neurons

1367
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:16,920
that can sense, feel, learn, and remember.

1368
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:20,840
You can bring your mind and heart into this coherence state

1369
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:23,600
and have more access to intuitive knowing

1370
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:27,360
by consciously focusing on positive emotions

1371
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,480
during your meditation.

1372
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,800
These beings, they respond to our thought.

1373
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,160
They respond to our thought.

1374
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,760
They will not be invasive.

1375
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:39,600
And if you're feeling like you want to continue

1376
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,000
whatever contact experience that is happening,

1377
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,960
but there may be a bit of residual fear

1378
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,800
that you're trying to work through, tell them.

1379
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,560
Say, look, I'd love to carry on doing this,

1380
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,880
but I feel a bit scared right now.

1381
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,720
Can you help me with that?

1382
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,080
And they will.

1383
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:57,240
And that's the other evidence.

1384
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:58,560
I know they're not hostile.

1385
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,280
We've been all over the world, thousands of hours

1386
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:06,040
with thousands of people, have had all manner of contact

1387
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:09,680
at a distance, intimately, beings, ET beings

1388
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:12,320
appearing in our rooms, all kinds of things.

1389
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,720
No one has ever been harmed.

1390
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,200
No one has ever been harmed at all.

1391
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:19,120
This isn't an official document on the FBI website,

1392
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:20,840
sort of hidden in plain sight,

1393
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:23,800
but it really confirms everything that we're explaining,

1394
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:25,600
but also the experience we've had.

1395
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,720
And this isn't from 1947, so this is 72 years old.

1396
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,160
He goes through and describes that they are peaceful people.

1397
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,000
They traverse these dimensions,

1398
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,440
that they have these abilities in consciousness.

1399
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:40,960
He even relates to some of the Vedic terms

1400
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,880
of the kind of capabilities witnessed from these beings.

1401
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:49,880
All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force

1402
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:53,380
which brings the particles of the atom to vibration.

1403
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,920
I must assume behind this force,

1404
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:00,400
the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind.

1405
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,960
This mind is the matrix of all matter.

1406
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:06,720
Max Planck, founder of quantum theory.

1407
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:10,360
Even though what I'm doing with CE5

1408
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:12,400
is what I'm most ridiculed for,

1409
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:16,280
it was the project that got the most respect

1410
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:18,080
and attention from the intelligence community

1411
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:19,940
because they knew it was real.

1412
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:22,240
They knew the science of consciousness is real.

1413
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:24,160
They knew that these ET civilizations

1414
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:26,720
utilize communication technologies

1415
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:30,000
that interface with thought and telepathy and consciousness.

1416
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,520
They all know this, this is an open secret

1417
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,080
in the intelligence community.

1418
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:38,760
We all think that power is derived from your weapon system,

1419
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:42,560
your financial clout, the usual materialistic paradigm.

1420
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,320
The reason that the deeper elements

1421
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,760
of the intelligence community have this intense interest

1422
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,640
in it and don't want the public to know

1423
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:53,600
is that first of all, it is extremely efficient spy craft

1424
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,160
which they don't want others to have.

1425
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:58,880
Secondly, they know that if people understood

1426
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:03,360
the power of consciousness and of mass consciousness,

1427
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,960
they would be able to completely change

1428
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:08,360
the direction of the planet.

1429
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:10,580
That is, to me, the big secret.

1430
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:12,120
Most people have heard of the random number

1431
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:14,720
generator studies through the Global Consciousness Project.

1432
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:17,140
A question tonight, can you actually measure

1433
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:19,800
the emotional outpouring in a worldwide crisis?

1434
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:22,440
Some scientists think that they have done just that.

1435
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:25,040
Their machines and computers found a bizarre pattern

1436
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,400
right after several global disasters.

1437
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:30,080
This was an experiment in which researchers placed

1438
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:33,400
dozens of random number generators around the world

1439
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:36,800
and analyzed their data to see if they could discover

1440
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,240
anything about global or collective consciousness.

1441
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:44,460
On September 11th, a few hours before the first plane struck,

1442
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:46,880
this network of random number generators

1443
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,080
became more coherent, less random and more coherent.

1444
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:53,160
It may sound bizarre, but Dr. Nelson and his team

1445
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,640
have been at this for the better part of a decade.

1446
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:58,300
The first spike showed up in 1997

1447
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,200
with the death of Princess Diana.

1448
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:02,240
Other events like the Concord crash,

1449
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,860
the Madrid train bombing, and the Pope's funeral

1450
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:07,720
all registered on those random number generators.

1451
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:10,400
But early on the morning of September 11th,

1452
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:13,000
the data went off the charts.

1453
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,720
The odds of this being a coincidence

1454
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:19,180
is less than one in 100 billion.

1455
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:23,220
This shows there is a deep relationship

1456
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:27,580
between collective consciousness and the physical world.

1457
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:30,660
Sociology studies of meditators

1458
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:32,700
where they go into a community,

1459
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:35,660
say you have a town of 200,000 people,

1460
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:38,820
and they would send in 1% of the population equivalent,

1461
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:42,020
2,000 people, to go into deep meditation.

1462
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:45,220
And they found that emergency room visits declined,

1463
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:48,220
violent crimes declined, robberies,

1464
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:50,940
all kinds of negative behaviors declined,

1465
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:52,620
even though those people didn't even know

1466
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:53,700
they were in the city.

1467
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:57,660
Because there is this resonant effect through the force,

1468
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:58,940
if you want to look at it that way,

1469
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:03,900
through this entangled, interwoven consciousness field.

1470
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:07,140
And people who didn't even know these meditators were there

1471
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:09,140
became more ordered, more peaceful,

1472
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:11,260
more happy, et cetera, and so on.

1473
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:13,420
This was actually based on the studies done

1474
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:16,520
in quantum physics in which a container of helium

1475
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,920
was cooled down to absolute zero.

1476
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:22,440
When only 1% of the helium became aligned to coherent,

1477
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:26,160
the entire container went through a phase transition,

1478
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:28,720
instantly shifting into coherence

1479
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:31,860
and taking on almost magical properties,

1480
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:34,440
a state called superfluidity.

1481
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:40,120
So there was this transformation at that 1% point

1482
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:41,920
when a critical mass of people,

1483
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:44,480
and whether it's 1% or a fraction of that

1484
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,600
depends on the state of consciousness

1485
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:49,820
of those who are practicing the meditation

1486
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:52,160
or a prayer or coherence.

1487
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:56,360
But at that point, you can shift an entire civilization.

1488
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:58,280
If we all become coherent,

1489
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:01,160
just 1% of us like a molecule of helium,

1490
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:02,720
and we become aligned and coherent

1491
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:04,920
and move in the right direction,

1492
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:08,160
it will transform the other 99%,

1493
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:10,080
even though they don't know that we're doing it.

1494
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,360
And that's the beauty and the power

1495
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:16,280
of the structure of non-locality and consciousness

1496
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,340
is that it's all inner woven,

1497
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:21,280
but there's enormous power when you're operating

1498
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,680
at that deeper level of consciousness.

1499
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:27,040
And that the intelligence community is very much afraid of

1500
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:30,240
because that's something A, they cannot control,

1501
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:34,920
and B, it would transcend their ability to alter the outcome.

1502
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:40,020
The total number of minds in the universe is one.

1503
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:43,780
In fact, consciousness is a singularity

1504
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:45,900
phasing within all beings.

1505
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:50,300
Dr. Erwin Schrödinger, Nobel Prize winning physicist.

1506
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:52,980
I'll tell a really funny story in 92.

1507
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:54,380
The head of army intelligence

1508
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:57,060
and a few of his minions intercepted me

1509
01:52:57,060 --> 01:52:59,540
and took me to a hotel room, very threatening.

1510
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:02,480
It was a national security agency person there, CIA people.

1511
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,320
They were saying,

1512
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:04,740
what the hell do you think you're doing?

1513
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:07,940
Teaching people to bypass our systems

1514
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:09,600
and contact these civilizations.

1515
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:13,640
I said, I don't recognize your authority over this matter.

1516
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,840
And then I looked them in the eyes and I said,

1517
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:19,480
I'm not afraid of you because I died when I was 17

1518
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:20,980
and I know there is no death.

1519
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,560
I don't care about your money.

1520
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:25,920
And I've had direct contact with these civilizations

1521
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,680
so you can't deceive me

1522
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:30,200
about who they are and why they're here.

1523
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:32,240
And the general just sat back like this and went,

1524
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,880
we know exactly who this son of a bitch is.

1525
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,140
And I said, yes, so this is what we're gonna do.

1526
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:39,900
It was very frustrating for them.

1527
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:43,500
But later, a member of one of the European royal families

1528
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:44,660
who I don't wanna name,

1529
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:47,540
who was involved with that crowd came up to me

1530
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:50,180
and she says, you know, they're very jealous

1531
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:51,780
of what you and your team are doing.

1532
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:53,380
I said, jealous of what?

1533
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:54,580
These are the most powerful people.

1534
01:53:54,580 --> 01:53:58,100
And he says, no, they know that you guys

1535
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:01,620
actually collectively have all the power

1536
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:04,180
and they wish they could do what you're doing,

1537
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:05,700
but they're in the box

1538
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:08,580
of this national security state program

1539
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:12,020
that they cannot escape from and you're free.

1540
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:13,580
You're a free agent.

1541
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:16,140
You're free to do wonderful things and they're not.

1542
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:19,260
And they're really jealous of what you guys are doing.

1543
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:22,740
It was a real insight into the sad psychology

1544
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:26,860
of the people who are in this pinched small world.

1545
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:28,340
So I say to the public,

1546
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:32,860
you should be happy that you're not part of all of that.

1547
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:36,700
You have the freedom to do things they can never do.

1548
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:37,820
So let's do it.

1549
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:42,020
It's good to know that we have the tools we need

1550
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:44,540
when we apply CFI protocols.

1551
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:45,860
So anybody can do it,

1552
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:48,660
no matter where you're from, what background.

1553
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:51,340
You can just learn the protocols.

1554
01:54:51,340 --> 01:54:53,220
We have a lot of friends from around the world

1555
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:55,220
who've never been on one of these expeditions

1556
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:57,900
and they just go online and use the protocols

1557
01:54:57,900 --> 01:55:00,900
and apply them and have wonderful experiences.

1558
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:05,580
I'm practicing CE5 in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom.

1559
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:06,740
Colorado Springs.

1560
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:07,580
Creston.

1561
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:08,660
British Columbia, Canada.

1562
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:10,340
Geraldton, Western Australia.

1563
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:11,580

1564
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:12,900
Lexington, Michigan.

1565
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:14,140
Moorhead, Kentucky.

1566
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:15,340
Vancouver Island.

1567
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:16,860
Shelton, Washington.

1568
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:17,700
New Zealand.

1569
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:18,540
CE5.

1570
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:21,540
Melbourne, Australia.

1571
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:22,820
Riverdale, Georgia.

1572
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:24,460
Beautiful Buckingham, Virginia.

1573
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:25,620
It's in Germany.

1574
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:27,100
Ontario, Canada.

1575
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:28,620
Capus, Oregon.

1576
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:29,460
Vancouver.

1577
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:30,540
Bahá'u'lláhara.

1578
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:32,260
Sydney, Australia.

1579
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:33,380
Winchester, Virginia.

1580
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:34,580
Darlington, England.

1581
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:36,220
Orlando, Florida.

1582
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:37,580
Knoxville, Tennessee.

1583
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:39,260
Freistadt, Austria.

1584
01:55:39,260 --> 01:55:42,020
Five United Arab Emirates.

1585
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,620
Alexandria, Virginia.

1586
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:45,420
Bate, Shemesh, Israel.

1587
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,100
Copper Creek, New Mexico.

1588
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:48,820
Japan, Enoshima Team.

1589
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:49,660
CE5.

1590
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:52,220
Indianapolis, Indiana.

1591
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:53,060
England.

1592
01:55:53,060 --> 01:55:54,500
Signet, Tasmania.

1593
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:58,300
We are doing a CE5 in Hong Kong and making history.

1594
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:00,820
People from all walks of life

1595
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:03,020
are becoming interstellar ambassadors

1596
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:06,740
and experiencing transcendent states of consciousness

1597
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:09,820
in union with these beings.

1598
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:12,180
Thousands are making contact

1599
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:14,660
by simply using the guided meditation

1600
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:16,780
in the CE5 Contact app.

1601
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:19,900
It's up to the children of Earth

1602
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:21,860
to become active participants

1603
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:24,300
in the unfolding of our universe

1604
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:27,260
and not leave it to the power elite.

1605
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:29,660
Once we reach a critical mass of people,

1606
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:32,100
a coherent and enlightened minority

1607
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:36,020
can transform the rest of humanity instantly.

1608
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:40,900
It's more about what your intent is.

1609
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:43,820
Do you have a pure heart, for lack of a better word?

1610
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:47,060
Do you have a clearness in your mind and in your heart?

1611
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:50,780
Can you bring your mind and heart into resonance together

1612
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:53,580
and invite these civilizations to connect with you

1613
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:57,100
in this great purpose, this great journey

1614
01:56:57,940 --> 01:56:59,940
that we're launching on as a civilization

1615
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:02,220
where we are going to become interstellar?

1616
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:06,020
Interestingly, there was a colonel named Philip Corso

1617
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:08,700
and Colonel Corso wrote a book the day after Roswell.

1618
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:10,980
And one of the events that wasn't known

1619
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:13,580
was this encounter he had with an ET

1620
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:15,820
at White Sands Missile Range,

1621
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:19,740
not far from where the first atomic bomb was dropped.

1622
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:23,900
And this was 1956 and an interstellar vehicle came in

1623
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:25,420
and it landed.

1624
01:57:25,460 --> 01:57:27,660
And then his jeep rushes out there,

1625
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:29,420
it's his young brash colonel,

1626
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:32,500
and has a meeting, an encounter with this ET.

1627
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:35,220
At a certain point, the ET asked the colonel

1628
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:37,860
to switch off these radar systems

1629
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:39,620
that had piggybacked on them,

1630
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:42,140
electronic warfare systems that were knocking

1631
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:43,660
these spacecraft down.

1632
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:46,260
And the colonel leaned in and said,

1633
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:47,780
what's in it for me?

1634
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:52,460
And the ET looked at him and said,

1635
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:54,860
a new world if you can take it.

1636
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:59,700
It looked ugly, but it was all good news.

1637
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:05,020
What's in it for me?

1638
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:09,740
I had killed more than two people,

1639
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:14,220
more than two people.

1640
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:20,020
And I let America talk to diligently

1641
01:58:20,020 --> 01:58:21,300
as if it were territory,

1642
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:24,540
or had said, go back to the East,

1643
01:59:54,540 --> 02:00:01,540
This place of life, when it's in between the dead and the still

1644
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:05,540
That's the only reason to cry

1645
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:10,540
Cause we have, I have been there

1646
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:15,540
There's always a sign of a life

1647
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:20,540
There's always a sign of a life

1648
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:25,540
There's always a sign of a life

1649
02:00:25,540 --> 02:00:30,540
There's always a sign of a life
