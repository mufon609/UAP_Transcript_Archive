1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
The phenomenon could involve some type of activity that some might say constitutes a

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:26,200
different form of life.

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,120
This would be one of the most closely held secrets in the entire United States government,

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,680
if not the most closely held secret.

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,800
When people say the government can't really keep secrets, I and my colleagues know many

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,480
secrets that have been kept for decades.

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
And they can be kept.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:56,040
I'm sitting here today because the American people are being lied to.

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,600
The only way the lid's going to get bone off this, we get a commander in chief with the

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,160
guts to just take the lid off of it.

11
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,440
There are now close to 400 reports from military personnel of possible UFO encounters.

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:19,440
In 2017, Congress began learning about a half-century plus cover-up of an ultra-secret program

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:29,600
dealing with UFOs, now referred to as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP.

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,080
In 2022, the first congressional hearings were held on the subject in over 50 years,

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,640
confirming the phenomenon is real.

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,680
Instruments report there is something there.

17
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,760
There are flight characteristics or signature management that we can't explain.

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,200
What began was a rare, bipartisan effort to dig even deeper.

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,680
You're the guys investigating it.

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,760
I mean, who else is doing it?

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,960
The more Congress pulled on the emerging threads, the more they began to unravel.

22
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,240
You're talking something that can go into space, go someplace, drop down in a matter

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,560
of seconds, do whatever it wants and leave, and there's nothing we can do about it.

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,480
With no self-evident propulsion system.

25
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,520
No wings, no IR energy coming off of the vehicle.

26
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,720
And more startling was the discovery of an alleged black-budget program, tasked with

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,120
the recovery of craft of alien origin.

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,600
You solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to hear...

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,080
Mr. Gresh, finally, do you believe that our government is in possession of UAPs?

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,160
Absolutely, based on interviewing over 40 witnesses over four years.

31
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,480
Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft?

32
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,600
Biologics came with some of these recoveries, yeah.

33
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,360
Were they, I guess, human or non-human biologics?

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,840
Non-human, and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,000
I talked to that are currently still on the program.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,880
I would go to jail to say things that I know, that I've been exposed to in the program.

37
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:20,280
Have you ever met anyone that claims to have put their hands on, or been inside, one of

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,160
these alleged crafts in our possession?

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,720
I can't respond to that.

40
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,400
Hi, I'm Director and Producer James Fox.

41
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,760
I just arrived in Washington, D.C., which is currently the epicenter of an unprecedented

42
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,800
effort to force the government's hand into finally revealing what they really know about

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
the UAP phenomenon.

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:00,200
In 2023, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Mike Rounds proposed the most

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,360
ambitious UAP disclosure bill in American history.

46
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,080
This is a major, major win for government transparency on UAPs, and it gives us a strong

47
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,720
foundation for more action in the future.

48
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,920
And a requirement as a transparency measure for the government to obtain any recovered

49
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:26,520
UAP material or biological remains that may have been provided to private entities in

50
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,040
the past and thereby hidden from Congress and the American people.

51
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:44,080
And here you have in an actual Congressional, in this case Senatorial, document the phrase

52
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:52,320
NHI, meaning non-human intelligence, mentioned more than 20 times in an actual Congressional

53
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
document.

54
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:06,520
My name is Leslie Kane, and I'm an investigative reporter, and I was one of three journalists

55
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,680
who broke the story in December of 2017 about the Department of Defense secret program studying

56
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,440
UFOs, and that story was kind of a catalyst for a lot of things that have happened since.

57
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,640
You get that close to something.

58
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,560
As details of the exposed Department of Defense program came to light, so did evidence and

59
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
additional military witnesses.

60
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,200
What followed was a bipartisan Congressional effort to find out what the intelligence agencies

61
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,940
really knew about UAP.

62
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,140
Now they know that this is real, right, because the Pentagon's been studying it, and we had

63
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:48,100
all this great material in our story, and members of Congress started to ask questions.

64
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:55,300
In fact, Congressional committees initiated briefings with witnesses behind closed doors.

65
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,100
Classified briefings by members of the program, by some of the pilots who had actually seen

66
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:09,060
the objects, and that made them realize we've got to do something about this.

67
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:16,960
The New York Times story also revealed official military videos of UAP leaked from the Pentagon.

68
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,240
The gimbal and the FLIR video.

69
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,200
And I remember the media was just going nuts.

70
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,940
The objects seen in the various clips are unidentified aerial phenomena.

71
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,120
We don't know what this is, and it's here.

72
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,120
The program has since been shut down, but it was run by a military intelligence official

73
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
who told CNN,

74
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,000
There is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone.

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So not necessary extraterrestrial, but you're not ruling it out.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,800
The stories that first broke in 2017 about the existence of a Pentagon UFO research effort,

77
00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:01,280
about some very intriguing sightings that they really couldn't explain, the dam broke.

78
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,800
The U.S. Navy has finally acknowledged that videos appearing to show UFOs flying through

79
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,760
the air are real.

80
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,800
The aircraft had zero control surfaces.

81
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,440
It had no means of propulsion that we could detect.

82
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,600
There was four of us in the airplanes literally watching this thing for roughly about five

83
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
minutes.

84
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,960
The UFO reports were first investigated by a secret $22 million program.

85
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,120
Do you know if they had the capabilities to create these flying objects like this?

86
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,680
We don't think so.

87
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,680
The Pentagon now admits there's something out there.

88
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,120
It's the story of the U.S. government's grudging acknowledgement of unidentified aerial phenomena,

89
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,960
and the U.S. Senate wants to know what it is.

90
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,640
Maybe it has a very simple answer.

91
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,160
Maybe it doesn't.

92
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,360
Navy fighter pilot Ryan Graves was on duty during a number of sightings, including a

93
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,360
near collision with a UAP in August of 2015.

94
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,920
Mr. Graves was invited to Washington, D.C. for briefings before members of the Senate

95
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,360
Armed Services Committee and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

96
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,680
Senior Department of Defense officials were sitting at the opposite end of the table during

97
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
the briefings.

98
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,400
There was probably eight or nine stars, you know, on that side of the table.

99
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,960
Navy Intelligence and more broadly, I think, DIA.

100
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,720
The DOD side wasn't able to provide a lot of answers to the congressional side, but

101
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,600
it wasn't a I don't know or we don't know, it's too classified to talk about in this

102
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
environment.

103
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,240
And so there seemed to be a very clear barrier there that Congress was even having a hard

104
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,080
time really getting around, because if you don't know what's there, it's hard to ask

105
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,400
good questions about the information, right?

106
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,840
So there seemed to be a little difficulty crossing that barrier.

107
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,200
My name is Kirk McConnell.

108
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,800
I believe this is the first time I've ever been on camera.

109
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,920
I recently retired from government service after 37 years working as a staff member

110
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,520
for various committees in Congress.

111
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:15,160
Armed with high-level clearances, Mr. McConnell researched UAPs from 2017 to 2024.

112
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,440
He attended multiple classified briefings between senators and numerous government and

113
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,260
contractor sources.

114
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:30,180
These insiders and their data provide extraordinary confirmation of the phenomenon.

115
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:37,420
These events were not just accompanied by visual observation, but by sensors, some of

116
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,260
the best sensing systems that money can buy.

117
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,420
Early warning and surveillance radar that's the top of the line for the Navy, the Aegis

118
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:53,180
radar system, were seeing these objects drop down from what appeared to be from space altitudes

119
00:09:53,180 --> 00:10:00,900
and just coming down at a high rate of speed and just stopping, you know, in midair and

120
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:08,420
then flying around and then after a while they would just go right back up again.

121
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,140
So this was something really different, pretty radical.

122
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,260
What the heck were these folks seeing?

123
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,740
The Congress people and the elected representatives and the retired officials too would come out

124
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,180
and make these statements and they tend to go further and further each time.

125
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,500
How concerned should we be about the briefing that you received on UFOs?

126
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,780
You know, I'm not going to get into any of the contents of the briefing, it was a classified

127
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,900
briefing.

128
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,980
One of the key takeaways I'd have is that the military and others are taking this issue

129
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,460
seriously, which I think in previous generations may not have been the case.

130
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,660
The senators were shocked.

131
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,140
They had thought, as most Americans do, that this is just myth and they became aware that

132
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:53,620
Whether it's the Russians or Chinese or aliens or something else, this is very much for real.

133
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,860
It's happening and we need to get to the bottom of it.

134
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,740
Responding to decades-long claims of intimidation and the forced signing of NDAs, Congress passed

135
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,580
bipartisan witness protection legislation.

136
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,340
What we made clear in this law is that there can be no stigma associated with reporting

137
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,340
and that reporting is now mandatory and that if there is retaliation that that will be

138
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,980
prosecuted.

139
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,100
The extent of activity is so prolific that at one military air base they were posting

140
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,900
posters around the base warning the pilots of the potential for mid-air collisions in

141
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,420
restricted military operating space.

142
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:41,940
The Navy, for example, I think it was in 2018, issued new guidelines to pilots to report

143
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,900
UAP and created a process for that.

144
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,860
And I think what we've seen in the last couple of years has been pretty stark in terms of

145
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,740
the legislation Congress has written.

146
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,140
Very specifically demanding that the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies, not just set up

147
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:04,900
an office but forcing them to dig through the cobwebs, if you will, and look into the

148
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,900
past and try to determine whether there are secret programs that may be revealed more

149
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,780
about the phenomenon.

150
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:21,580
The process began of the Pentagon grudgingly releasing bits of information.

151
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,780
Congress asked us to produce a report that assessed what we saw as the threat essentially

152
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,340
from unidentified aerial phenomenon.

153
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,220
A preliminary assessment was released in the summer of 2021.

154
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:42,180
UAP represent physical objects that have been registered across multiple sensors, including

155
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:49,780
radar, infrared, electro-optical, weapon seekers, and visual observation.

156
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:56,340
A handful of UAP demonstrated an advanced technology, remaining stationary in winds

157
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:02,500
aloft with the ability to move against the wind and to maneuver abruptly at considerable

158
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,860
speed without discernible means of propulsion.

159
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,040
And what really caught the attention of Congress was the admission from military pilots of

160
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,840
near-misses with UAP.

161
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,360
And the main issues that Congress and others have been concerned about are basically safety

162
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,000
of flight concerns and counterintelligence issues, but of course there's always the

163
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,520
question of is there something else that we simply do not understand that might come extra-terrestrially.

164
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:44,200
It became pretty clear to me that there was a real story here.

165
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,040
As long as the Congress keeps pushing, and I think they will, I'm not sure how they're

166
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:58,240
going to wiggle out of this.

167
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,800
More than 50 years ago, the U.S. government ended Project Blue Book, an effort to catalog

168
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,200
and understand sightings of objects in the air that could not otherwise be explained.

169
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,760
The last time Congress had a hearing on UAPs was half a century ago.

170
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,440
I hope that it does not take 50 more years for Congress to hold another because transparency

171
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,760
is desperately needed.

172
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,360
We have not been hiding anything.

173
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,680
In 2017, we learned for the first time that the Department of Defense had quietly restarted

174
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,720
a similar organization tracking what we now call unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs.

175
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,400
UAPs are unexplained, it's true, but they are real.

176
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,120
They need to be investigated, and many threats they pose need to be mitigated.

177
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,640
The Pentagon sent two high-level officers, Deputy Director of Navy Intelligence Scott

178
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,080
and Under Secretary of Defense Ronald Moultrie, to a Congress far better informed than prior

179
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,480
intelligence officials had faced in the past.

180
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,900
There is something there measurable by multiple instruments, and yet it seems to move in directions

181
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,940
that are inconsistent with what we know of physics or science more broadly.

182
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,320
Do we have an example of an object that can't be explained as having been human-made or

183
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,500
natural?

184
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,200
The example that I would say that is still unresolved, that I think everyone understands

185
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,060
quite well, is the 2004 incident from Nimitz.

186
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:39,500
Two hundred miles off the coast of San Diego, the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group encountered

187
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:47,140
an unknown object described as a tic-tac that flew rings around two of the Navy's best front-line

188
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,140
fighters.

189
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,020
The ability to hover over the water and then start a vertical climb from basically zero

190
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,700
up towards about 12,000 feet and then accelerate in less than two seconds and disappear is

191
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,140
something I had never seen in my life.

192
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:08,780
Are we aware of any foreign adversary capable of moving objects without any discernible

193
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,820
means of propulsion?

194
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,020
Without discernible means of propulsion, I would say that we're not aware of any adversary

195
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,740
that can move an object without discernible means of propulsion.

196
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,140
Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Christopher Mellon was one of the key figures

197
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,580
who brought the Nimitz case public.

198
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:39,060
He and a few other insiders found a loophole in the classification that allowed him to

199
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:45,340
walk the tapes out of the Pentagon and onto the front page of the New York Times.

200
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,540
When I first contacted the Armed Services Committee or shortly thereafter, I said to

201
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,500
one of the staffers there, why don't you get the deck logs for the Nimitz from 2004,

202
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,700
from November 2004?

203
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:03,380
So he went to the Congressional Research Office and tasked them to go to the archives and

204
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,580
get the deck logs.

205
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
Guess what?

206
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,420
They're missing for that one limited window of time.

207
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,620
The records before are there, the records after are there, but the deck logs from the

208
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,100
Nimitz incident for that period of time are missing.

209
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:31,660
Gentlemen, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that there is some exploration coming here,

210
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,860
and that underlies a lot of the reports you get.

211
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,140
I think Mr. LaHood was asking about that.

212
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,020
People think there must be extraterrestrial life, and it's not at all beyond the pale

213
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,620
that there would be a visit here.

214
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:51,140
There have been no collisions between any U.S. assets in one of these UAPs, correct?

215
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,660
We have not had a collision.

216
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,560
We've had at least 11 near misses, though.

217
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:04,880
There hasn't been a hearing since 1968, and here we are having a hearing where just a

218
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,480
few years ago, we didn't even acknowledge that these things were real prior to 2017.

219
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,280
That alone to me was so incredible that I almost didn't care what happened during the

220
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,320
hearing, just the fact that it was happening and that I could be present for that.

221
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,440
It felt like after all the work I'd done on this for so many years, it was really rewarding

222
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,360
to me, just really meant a lot to just be in that room.

223
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,040
It's also been reported that there have been UAP observed and interacting with and flying

224
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,680
over sensitive military facilities, housing our strategic nuclear forces.

225
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,880
One such incident allegedly occurred at Malmstrom Air Force Base, in which 10 of our nuclear

226
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,240
ICBMs were rendered inoperable.

227
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,920
What really moved me about it was some of the statements that the congressman made and

228
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,920
the kinds of questions they asked were so probing, and Andre Carson was so eloquent

229
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:58,000
in his introduction and Adam Schiff, you know, and they seemed to really understand

230
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,400
the importance of this issue.

231
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,800
And here they were stating that to the world.

232
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,840
You're the guys investigating it, I mean, who else is doing it?

233
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,800
If something was officially brought to our attention, we would look at it.

234
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,920
I'm bringing it to your attention, this is pretty official.

235
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,600
So we'll go back and take a look at it, but generally there is some authoritative figure

236
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,680
that says there is an incident that occurred, we'd like you to look at this.

237
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,360
For what it's worth, I would like you to look into it, and for no other reason you can dismiss

238
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,960
it and say this is not worth wasting resources on.

239
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,560
Mr. Christin Moorthy.

240
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:37,920
First question is, have we come across any wreckage of any kind of object that has now

241
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,880
been examined by you?

242
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,680
The UAP task force doesn't have any wreckage that isn't explainable, that isn't consistent

243
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,840
with being of terrestrial origin.

244
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,920
And then finally, are you aware of a document that appeared around 2019, sometimes called

245
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,800
the Admiral Wilson memo or EW notes memo?

246
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,240
I am not personally aware of that.

247
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,480
Okay.

248
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,560
The leaked memo reveals an alleged covert meeting with former director of the Defense

249
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:16,080
Intelligence Agency, Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson, and astrophysicist and aerospace engineer

250
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Dr. Eric Davis about an ultra-secret UAP crash retrieval program.

251
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,360
According to the memo, the meeting took place in the back parking lot of United States National

252
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:37,040
Defense Contractor involved with some of the government's most sensitive technologies.

253
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,600
Vice Admiral Wilson prefaced the meeting with the following caveat, if you blow my trust,

254
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,560
I'll deny meeting you, deny everything said, won't meet with any more people without clearances,

255
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:58,880
too risky, never seen anything like this program in black programs community.

256
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,360
A reverse engineering program, something recovered years ago in the past, called themselves the

257
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,960
Watch Committee or Gatekeepers, an isolated group using their own facilities and cleared

258
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:22,800
personnel, about 400 to 800 workers, no White House names, no president, no congressional

259
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,280
people, no congressional staffers.

260
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:34,640
They had a craft, an intact craft they believed could fly.

261
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,280
The program manager said they didn't know where it was from, they had some ideas on

262
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:48,800
this, it was technology that was not of this earth, not made by man, not by human hands.

263
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,600
So you're not aware of that?

264
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm not aware, Congressman.

265
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,720
In my 10 seconds remaining then, I guess I just would ask Mr. Chairman unanimous consent

266
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,640
to enter that memo into the record.

267
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,760
Without objection.

268
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,960
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, appreciate it.

269
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,000
The Wilson memo was brought up in the congressional hearings.

270
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,480
Do you think there's any legitimacy to that memo?

271
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,040
That's an area that I don't feel I can comment on.

272
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,480
Stanford-trained PhD physicist Dr. Hal Puthoff has been involved in highly classified programs

273
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,280
for the DOD and intelligence communities.

274
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,800
Dr. Puthoff was senior advisor and contractor to a number of UAP programs for the Defense

275
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,000
Intelligence Agency.

276
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,440
His alleged research into crash retrievals is mentioned in the Wilson-Davis memo recently

277
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,120
read into the congressional record.

278
00:22:51,120 --> 00:23:03,680
I mean, I've signed security O's, TS, SCI, gamma, HCS, I mean, a whole line of things.

279
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,640
Well, if you get access to this information and this information and this information

280
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,200
and this information, you will not reveal it to the public.

281
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,120
And if you do, you will go to jail.

282
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Sign the piece of paper, okay?

283
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,720
Sign the piece of paper.

284
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,040
So until there's some statement on high that somehow abridges that,

285
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:35,680
no, for sure, I would go to jail to say things that I know, that I've been exposed to in

286
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,240
the program.

287
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,440
I mean, Davis, you know, it's part of the Wilson-Davis memo.

288
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,240
I mean, of course, Davis was my senior scientific advisor for a couple of decades,

289
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,440
so I know him well.

290
00:23:52,320 --> 00:24:00,800
And if he were to say it happened, then I'd be willing to admit it happened.

291
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,040
But at this point, that's an area that it's not worth digging into.

292
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:16,240
We caught up with the man who organized the first congressional hearing on UAP in over 50 years,

293
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
Representative Andre Carson.

294
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,680
Senator Reid was quoted in 2019 in the New Yorker magazine,

295
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,960
I was told for decades that Lockheed had some of these retrieved materials,

296
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,680
and I tried to get, as I recall, a classified approval by the Pentagon

297
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,040
to have me go look at the stuff.

298
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
They would not approve that.

299
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,440
I don't know what all the numbers are, what kind of classification it was,

300
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,800
but they would not give that to me.

301
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,560
They would not give me clearance.

302
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,040
Have you heard any credible reports or anything at all that would substantiate

303
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,320
that we have hardware or bodies?

304
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,440
I know it's a tall order, and I'm not trying to put you on the spot,

305
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,160
but that's so significant if that's the case.

306
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,160
What are you hearing, Congressman?

307
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,840
Well, obviously, due to my work on the hearing and the oath that I've taken,

308
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,720
you know, I won't talk about technology because it could compromise our national security.

309
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,120
I think it's important to acknowledge our victories.

310
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,800
Just a couple of years ago, if you brought up UAPs to other members of Congress,

311
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,400
there's a chance you could be laughed at, you know.

312
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,800
Now we're seeing public statements from the White House, the Pentagon, and more

313
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
and there's a lot we don't know.

314
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,120
I understand that that can be frustrating, but we want to encourage folks,

315
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,640
give kudos to you, to keep pushing for more information and more answers.

316
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,840
So we have a lot of work to do to remove the stigma.

317
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,760
One thing I learned as a reporter for 20-plus years in Washington is

318
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,960
if the Congress learns it, we will learn it too, eventually,

319
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,000
because Congress is the worst at keeping secrets.

320
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,720
It'll be interesting to see how this process plays out, but, you know, the pressure's on,

321
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,280
and I think the Pentagon, the CIA, other agencies are going to have to answer the mail.

322
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,120
In late 2022, President Biden signed legislation that established a mandate

323
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,760
for new UAP reporting procedures.

324
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:25,280
Within the National Defense Act for 2023 is a section outlining new UAP reporting procedures

325
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,320
relating to retrieved materials.

326
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,000
One particular thing that really jumped out at me, any activity or program by a department

327
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,200
or agency of the federal government or a contractor of such a department or agency

328
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,000
relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena, you know, it's going to be very, very difficult

329
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:52,320
relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena, including with respect to material retrieval,

330
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,800
material analysis, reverse engineering, research and development, detection and tracking, etc.

331
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,280
That's some pretty incredible language.

332
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,120
I don't even have to read between the lines there.

333
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,480
It's stunning.

334
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,800
What they're saying is that all of these legends about Roswell...

335
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,400
The Army Air Force has announced that a flying disc has been found

336
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
and is now in the possession of the Army.

337
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,360
The disc landed at a ranch at Corona, New Mexico.

338
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,800
It was not anything from this earth that...

339
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,600
We find it's sufficiently credible.

340
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,320
We now have reason enough to believe that may have happened.

341
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,800
I mean, it's incredible.

342
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,720
And I think it will lead to the realization that we're not alone.

343
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,520
But maybe we're not publicly ready for that yet.

344
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,040
Our team takes to the streets in Washington, D.C.

345
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,720
I think if UFOs were real, I would not want to know.

346
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,160
It might just give me more anxiety.

347
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,800
So I think I would be really, really interested to know if anyone else out there,

348
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,440
even if it's scary, even if it's scary, it's better.

349
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,320
I think there's a right way to communicate that to the public, though.

350
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,720
There needs to be a unified message on both sides of what could be going on.

351
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,880
But I just think that people need to have a consensus.

352
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,780
Yeah.

353
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,200
There's no way to slowly reveal something like that,

354
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,840
but I think it should just be talked about like anything's talked about, like sports.

355
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,520
Transparency is always a good thing.

356
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,120
So I do think it's something I care about.

357
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,360
They wouldn't want to cause a mass hysteria.

358
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,840
How are we safe? How are things going on?

359
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,160
I think that as citizens, we are citizens of this earth, not just this country.

360
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,480
And as such, we would have a right to know what is beyond this earth.

361
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,600
How would they tell us?

362
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,240
Hide your kids. Hide your wives.

363
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
I know, right?

364
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,560
They're coming to get you.

365
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,440
They're coming to get you.

366
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
I know. I'm thinking of like the Marvels now.

367
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,840
Is there other data? Is there other sensory data?

368
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,120
Is there other photographic data, videotape, flier footage?

369
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,440
Things that you've seen that have not gotten out?

370
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,080
Oh, there's lots more data that has not gotten out.

371
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,160
Like what?

372
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,680
That I'm aware of.

373
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,040
That you're aware of or that you saw?

374
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,520
Well, that I saw, that I worked on. Yeah.

375
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,600
Can you talk about it at all?

376
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,100
No.

377
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:36,340
All of the witnesses in this film have been vetted as to the veracity of their government

378
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:42,660
or contractor positions. Some appear anonymously as they work their way through the Congressional

379
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,980
Whistleblower Protections Program recently established by Congress.

380
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:55,140
They represent just a small portion of legitimate UAP whistleblowers

381
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,380
wanting to testify under oath.

382
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm sitting here today because the American people are being lied to.

383
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,860
I think it's high time that we rip the band-aid off and go for full transparency because I

384
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:17,460
believe the American people, and quite frankly, the people of the world at this point, have a

385
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:23,380
right to know. So the government has done itself a disservice for whatever reason because

386
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:29,540
in a lot of people's eyes, this particular subject is where the government really started lying to

387
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:36,020
us. Hi, my name is Lenval Logan. Everyone calls me Logan. I'm a retired Air Force intelligence

388
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,140
analyst that started off as a B-52 crew chief and cross-trained. I had the opportunity to support

389
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:48,420
the UAP task force and I'm here to talk about what I can at an unclassified level to share what I

390
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,780
know. People are starting to come out. You know, Congress is saying, come testify. I am Sarah

391
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:59,700
Gamm. I was a research scientist for the Department of Defense, and during my years as a scientist,

392
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:06,900
I was able to investigate and research classified and unclassified reports of UAPs. Why now?

393
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:14,500
I feel like it is the time where I've seen the interest in the Congress. So you're not aware

394
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:23,140
of that? I've seen the interest with the UFO programs and it just was very adversarial. I get

395
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,300
the fact that the technology, if you could separate that out and call that national security that the

396
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:33,140
technologies they're working on, that has some reason to stay classified. But the revelation

397
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:39,940
that there's other life out there, that should be something for everybody. Did what you see convince

398
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:47,060
you that the DOD or the intelligence agencies have a lot more compelling data than what the

399
00:31:47,060 --> 00:32:05,140
general public knows about? Yes. There's a lot more data out there. I'd say a fraction of it

400
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,660
that I was able to see is something unexplainable, like physics that's beyond

401
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,460
our realm. It's not an aircraft. It's not camera parallax. It's not trash in the sky. It's not a

402
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:22,500
balloon. It's something we don't know what it is. It is a true UAP. Senate Majority Leader Harry

403
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,540
Reid said to me, what's been released is merely the tip of the iceberg. How do you respond to that?

404
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:32,340
Because I've supported the task force and everything, there's more data out there.

405
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:40,820
More data out there or in there? Okay, more data behind closed doors. I'm 100%

406
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:48,740
saying I have evidence and I've seen it of craft that perform with anomalous characteristics,

407
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:55,940
completely silent, able to maneuver at random speeds, stop on a dime, hover, take off again,

408
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:12,420
go into and out of the water. What do we have that could do that?

409
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:24,980
It is really truly amazing when I'm able to look at a report or video photos and know

410
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:32,580
that's not from here. The number of emails that I've gotten alone in the last two months

411
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:39,220
from other scientists saying, how do I help physicists? Dr. Gary Nolan is an American

412
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:46,340
immunologist, academic, inventor, and business entrepreneur with his own lab at Stanford

413
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:54,580
University School of Medicine. Dr. Nolan has worked on alleged exotic or meta materials

414
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,140
in association with members of the intelligence and defense communities

415
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:06,420
from UAP cases around the world. Do you know things that if you revealed them right here

416
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,140
on camera would get you in trouble? Yes. Is it frustrating knowing those things?

417
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:23,460
Yes. And so I don't know anywhere near what I think some people do know and people I know do

418
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:32,580
know. And so it's not what I know, it's what they do. And I think that that's the reason why you're

419
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:38,420
seeing this concerted effort from individuals within the government who are saying enough is

420
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:45,060
enough, time to get this information out. I'm 100% saying I have evidence and I've seen this

421
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,540
stuff up to secrets housed on Sipper, stuff at the top secret levels housed on Jaywix.

422
00:34:52,260 --> 00:35:00,660
On these systems, there are very high quality image files showing UAPs doing transmedium travel,

423
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:09,140
atmospheric entry, etc. Science can explain this stuff, but you can't explain it based on a shaky

424
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:16,340
iPhone video that somebody took while camping. It's frustrating when I hear mainstream scientific

425
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:23,780
community on all the talk shows criticizing the lack of more compelling data when I know it exists.

426
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:30,980
It seems to me aliens who visited us, it would be much they would manifest more convincingly

427
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,300
than fuzzy video. And then there's all these different excuses as to why it's not being

428
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:41,380
released. I get that and I'm sure that some of that is relevant. However, the bigger issue is

429
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,740
they have definitive confirmation that these craft are real and they don't know where the

430
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,780
fuck they come from. Excuse my French. That's it. I know that's the case.

431
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:58,580
There's enough evidence out there that demands a verdict that says yes, there's something going on.

432
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:03,300
Is there enough evidence to say that these are off-worlders? Some of us would say yes,

433
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:10,820
some of us would say no. But collaboratively with the right people working together, I think we

434
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,620
could come up with a definitive answer and the answer is yes.

435
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,980
His name is Gary McKinnon. He's 46 years old. He hacked into the computers of NASA,

436
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:45,540
the U.S. Army, the Navy, the Air Force and broke into some of the most secret U.S. military

437
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:51,540
computer networks. The 97 U.S. military and NASA computers. But he claims he was just looking for

438
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:59,620
secret evidence of unidentified flying objects. The Americans say McKinnon is a cyber terrorist

439
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,540
who caused almost half a million pounds worth of damage to military computers.

440
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,140
Jonathan Hunt is live in our studios in New York and U.S. officials, Jonathan, not at all happy

441
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,820
about this one. Not at all, Shep. He stumbled on unedited satellite images of, as he said,

442
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:18,580
out of this world flying objects. 2002 he was charged with the biggest U.S. military hack in

443
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,460
the universe. What did he find in the way of UFO evidence? Well, he says he spent a year looking

444
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:30,340
through these computer systems and he found, he says, photographic proof of alien spacecraft

445
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,860
and the names and ranks of something he called non-terrestrial officers. He has

446
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:46,820
not at this point shared those names with us. If extradition does go ahead, Gary could face 60

447
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:54,740
years in an American prison. The crew caught up with Gary McKinnon in the English countryside.

448
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:04,180
How many people wanted to know what you saw? Oh, God. Newspapers, film companies, book writers,

449
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:13,700
television stations. I've lost count. Oh, my God, so you're Gary McKinnon? Yeah.

450
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,980
What did you see? Is it true?

451
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:27,620
They very much want to get him back here to face American justice. One official here at the home

452
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,500
office told me the fresh evidence left Theresa May, the home secretary, with little option but

453
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,260
to extradite McKinnon. By 2008, I was so low because we went for court case after court case

454
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:44,500
and judicial review and losing every time and eventually I thought, look, I'm gonna, I had a

455
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:50,260
good talk to myself. I'm going to either spend the rest of my life until I die in a foreign prison.

456
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:58,420
So I decided to take my own life because I thought I'm not giving my life to prison.

457
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,500
Gary McKinnon had hacked into a number of military networks, but it was through a subnet

458
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:16,820
at Johnson Space Center that he hit pay dirt. I was on dial-up, 56k dial-up, and it took me

459
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:22,020
five minutes to download one megabyte. So I thought, I've got to do this before I get caught.

460
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,180
I've got to download. I was trying to steal the truth,

461
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:34,100
slowly. This image started to appear as black, and then it lightened, and then it was the

462
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:41,060
hemisphere of a planet. I assumed Earth, and then I started to see the top of a tubular-shaped

463
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,940
thing. It's silvery-white, metallic-looking. It got about halfway down the screen, and this was

464
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:51,140
a craft floating above. I assumed the Earth. I didn't see land masses, but I saw cloud cover.

465
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,500
Totally not man-made. It was very smooth. There were no rivets, no seams, just this very smooth

466
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:05,220
tube shape. And it got two-thirds of the way down the screen, and I was sitting there with

467
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:14,340
bated breath waiting for this gold dust to come into my lap. But then I saw the mouse move,

468
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,260
and the mouse pointer moved to the bottom right of the screen. It right-clicked on the local area

469
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:24,260
network icon and the pop-up menu, and chose disconnect and, boom, blank screen. That was me

470
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:29,780
blocked out. So it was my eureka moment, but also my, shit, I've been caught.

471
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,260
Mr. McKinnon is accused of serious crimes.

472
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:40,580
Then you really do think, you know, the talking heads song, oh my god, what have I done? Very heavy shit.

473
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,380
The gravity of Gary McKinnon's alleged offences are not in doubt.

474
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,860
There have been discussions between the British government and the American ambassador about

475
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,260
potential steps that could be taken in this case.

476
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,980
On his visit to the White House, David Cameron spoke to President Obama about the case,

477
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,780
and both agreed they could find an appropriate solution.

478
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,420
One of the traditions we have is the president doesn't get involved in

479
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,220
decisions around prosecutions. Extradition matters.

480
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,180
Since I came into office, the sole issue on which I have been required to make a decision

481
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,220
is whether Mr. McKinnon's extradition to the United States would breach his human rights.

482
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,700
After careful consideration of all of the relevant material,

483
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:34,900
I have concluded that Mr. McKinnon's extradition would give rise to such a high risk of him ending

484
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:42,500
his life. That a decision to extradite would be incompatible with Mr. McKinnon's human rights.

485
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,260
I have therefore withdrawn the extradition order against Mr. McKinnon.

486
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:56,420
That was incredible, Theresa May. I cried like a baby. You know, that huge relief, 10 years of,

487
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,700
because you know, us men, we bustle it up, don't we? It's all, just keep it in, keep it down.

488
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,100
And it all just, floodgates. But yeah, incredible day.

489
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,780
I want to say thank you, Theresa May, because it was an incredibly brave decision

490
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,540
to stand up to another nation as strong and powerful as America is rare,

491
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:22,820
and she had the guts to do it. We've done it. We've won for the little person.

492
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:29,140
Mr. McKinnon is forbidden to travel outside of England and Wales

493
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:36,820
for the rest of his life unless he receives a pardon from the United States.

494
00:42:41,780 --> 00:43:03,940
There are a number of ways in which this story could have been, shall we say, managed

495
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,420
to stop it getting out, which was our intention.

496
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,820
They were bracing for impact of this story coming out.

497
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:24,660
Dr. David Clark uncovered what many say is the UFO case of the century, August 1990.

498
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:31,460
Scotland's daily record was on the eve of publishing a story involving two witnesses

499
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:38,420
and six 35-millimeter photographs. Then the Ministry of Defense stepped in,

500
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,580
and the witnesses and prints vanished for over 30 years.

501
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,700
After over a decade of research, Dr. Clark discovered one of the early investigators of

502
00:43:53,700 --> 00:44:00,500
the case, Royal Air Force Press Officer Craig Lindsay, one of the officials known

503
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,300
to have interviewed the witnesses. Something that could hover without making any noise

504
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,660
and travel at the speed that this guy said that went vertically upwards is utterly beyond my

505
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:17,860
knowledge. How they keep it quiet for 30-odd years, again, beyond me.

506
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:29,460
In August of 1990, two hotel employees left after their shift for a late afternoon hike

507
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,740
in the town of Calvin, just a few miles away.

508
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,540
It was the Athol Palace Hotel, because when they mentioned the name,

509
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:44,100
that hotel's got lots of, you know, pinnacles and things. It's a very Disney type of place.

510
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,340
Two witnesses were out hiking.

511
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:59,460
They then saw a large diamond-shaped craft hovering.

512
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,700
It didn't move. It just hovered in the air without making any noise.

513
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,580
With the help of Calvin resident Giles Stevens,

514
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,260
we were able to find the probable location of the encounter.

515
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,460
The two witnesses most likely hid under this tree.

516
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,380
The witnesses looked at this for a while, and one of them had a camera.

517
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,900
The craft was hovering silently, and they were terrified.

518
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:41,860
That's what they said to me, that all they wanted to do was to hide. But when the jet came along,

519
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:46,260
they sort of stuck the camera out from behind the bush and snapped six frames.

520
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,420
They got a picture of the likes of which I don't think anybody has seen before.

521
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,260
The bit that then stands out is that I asked him what happened next, and he said,

522
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,980
We watched it for another minute or two, and then it started to move.

523
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,580
And how did it move? Oh, it started to go up, and then it got faster and faster and faster,

524
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,860
disappeared straight up.

525
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:26,580
And I said, what sort of noise did it make? And I got the instant answer, it didn't make any noise.

526
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,180
And that was the bit where suddenly everything in my head went, wait a minute, I don't know of any

527
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:37,540
aircraft that can't make, I can hover and can maneuver at that kind of speed and doesn't make

528
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,580
a noise. That's when I kind of walk up to the whole thing.

529
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:51,460
It would have blown our standard line out of the water. Therefore, we wanted to bury this.

530
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,540
And we did.

531
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:03,780
All the photographs and all the negatives were acquired by the Ministry of Defense,

532
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,700
and they were never seen again.

533
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:15,860
Despite efforts of the Ministry of Defense to keep this evidence from the public,

534
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:24,260
Royal Air Force Press Officer Craig Lindsay kept one print, which he has now donated to the Center

535
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:30,340
for Contemporary Legend, where it was analyzed by photo specialist Andrew Robinson.

536
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,900
First time he mentioned it to me, he said, I've got this photograph.

537
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,420
I wonder if you could copy it for me. I'm going up to Scotland to get it.

538
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:49,220
Everything fitted with the story, it substantiates the narrative that's been told about it.

539
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,900
The grain seems very smooth over the edges of the object. There's no

540
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,700
sign that anything was done to this after the image was taken.

541
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:12,580
So Craig Lindsay at the RVF saved this for 30 plus years.

542
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:18,020
Yes. Even after retirement, he took it with him when he left the office in 2000.

543
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,060
He's kind of a hero.

544
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:25,940
He is a real hero. We would know so less about this story now if it wasn't for Craig doing what he did.

545
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:32,020
The reason that this was a good photo was twofold, really. Firstly, it was daylight.

546
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:38,180
But secondly, far more importantly, there were features of the ground.

547
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,420
And what that meant, of course, is that one can triangulate,

548
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:50,180
one can start to make detailed calculations about the distance of the object from the object.

549
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:56,580
One can start to make detailed calculations about the distance of the object from the camera,

550
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,140
the height above the ground, etc.

551
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:08,500
The bottom line was everyone was very impressed with this and said, no, it's a solid, structured,

552
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:15,780
real craft. Where are the wings? Where's the fuselage? Where are the engines? How does this

553
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:24,420
thing fly? And what we were interested in trying to do from the images is to try and almost reverse

554
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:32,340
engineer an idea about what kind of propulsion system was involved here and that we hoped would

555
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:40,660
give us a clue as to who was operating this. The last thing we wanted was an open discussion about

556
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:51,300
these up close and personal daylight images of a huge unknown craft of some type with military

557
00:49:51,300 --> 00:50:02,100
aircraft in the background. If you have a date and a location and a time when a military aircraft

558
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:08,980
was seen, you would find out in an instant what aircraft it was, what squadron it came from,

559
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,940
who the aircrew were, and you would instantly be able to debrief them.

560
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:25,940
For whatever reason, the Ministry of Defense line on this is that the aircraft was not traced

561
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,140
and the pilots were not interviewed.

562
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:34,820
The overwhelming consensus is that the military plane seen in the photo is a Harrier jump jet,

563
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,740
but neither records nor a pilot's name has been found.

564
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:52,500
So we've got three possible scenarios. One, hoax. Two, secret stealth military aircraft belonging to

565
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:58,900
the United States or some other foreign power. Or three, which would fall into the category of

566
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,540
other, which would imply originating from a non-human intelligence.

567
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:13,460
At one point during my posting on the UFO desk, I went to a briefing, a more general briefing about

568
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:19,620
UAP, and this photo was brought out and the briefer, who was in charge of the briefing,

569
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,820
and this photo was brought out and the briefer, who was in the intelligence community,

570
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:31,220
said, you know, this photo here, he said, and he started gesticulating and he said, you know,

571
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:38,740
it's not the United States. He said, it's not Russia and that only leaves,

572
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:45,140
and he pointed straight up and we looked at his finger and we looked at the ceiling and

573
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,060
nothing further was said.

574
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,780
Now, 34 years after their disappearance,

575
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:01,060
a co-worker at the hotel, Richard Grieve, has broken his silence.

576
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:41,700
A few days after taking the photos, the witnesses and their co-workers

577
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,100
were on a five-minute cigarette break when they had an unexpected visit.

578
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:22,740
Richard and the other chefs watched through a nearby hotel window

579
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,820
as the two strangers confronted their co-workers in the parking lot.

580
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:44,740
After roughly 10 minutes, the men drove off and the two witnesses came back inside.

581
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:24,740
According to their co-worker, Richard,

582
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:31,220
the two witnesses started to drink heavily, missed shifts, slept in their cars at work,

583
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:35,140
and after four weeks, they vanished without a trace.

584
00:54:54,740 --> 00:55:11,140
Even if the dudes had popped to be dead, I'd still like to know where they went to.

585
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:31,060
Back in Washington, DC, the filmmakers arrive at NASA headquarters for a press conference

586
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:37,060
where the head of NASA will announce the results of their first year-long UAP study.

587
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:44,020
The announcement was made during a news conference on findings from NASA's headquarters in Washington, DC.

588
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:52,020
We, NASA, have taken for the first time concrete action to seriously look into UAP.

589
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,020
UAP are one of our planet's greatest mysteries.

590
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:02,020
We looked at NASA's assets. They typically do not have the resolution needed for UAP events.

591
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:06,020
They relied on unclassified data only.

592
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,980
The NASA independent study team, based on our current findings and methodology,

593
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:17,620
that we find no evidence to suggest that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin.

594
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:24,820
Most events are explainable as planes, balloons, dryers, satellites, aircraft,

595
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,380
seeing the sun glinting off of them, weather phenomenon, and instrument features.

596
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:38,340
But we don't know what these UAP are, but we're going to try to find out.

597
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:44,340
You said at the beginning of the meeting that NASA will be transparent.

598
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:50,340
Well, a month and a half ago, Mr. David Grush said under oath in Congress

599
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,340
that the U.S. government is in possession of UAPs and extraterrestrial life.

600
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,300
Do you believe what Mr. David Grush said, or is he lying?

601
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:05,300
What he said, if I recall having seen this on the nightly news,

602
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:11,300
was that he had a friend that knew where a warehouse was

603
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,300
that had a UFO locked up in a warehouse.

604
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,300
I served at the Intero Operations Center on the director's briefing staff,

605
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,300
which included the coordination of the presidential daily brief

606
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,260
and supporting a variety of contingency operations,

607
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:30,260
which I was the reserve intelligence division chief backup.

608
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,260
For the first time in history, an intelligence officer

609
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:40,260
with top-level security clearances testified under oath

610
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:46,260
that the U.S. government has definitive proof that we're not alone.

611
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,260
Mr. Grush?

612
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,220
Mr. Chairman, ranking members and congressmen,

613
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,220
my name is David Charles Grush.

614
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:59,220
I was an intelligence officer for 14 years both in the U.S.

615
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:03,220
Mr. Grush, a decorated combat veteran,

616
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,220
had been tasked by multiple agencies to look specifically

617
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,220
into classified UAP evidence.

618
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:14,220
I was my agency's co-lead in unidentified anomalous phenomena

619
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,180
and transmedium object analysis,

620
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,180
as well as reporting to the UAP task force.

621
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,180
The inspector general deemed his whistleblower claim

622
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:28,180
both credible and urgent.

623
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,180
Mr. Grush, in the last couple of years,

624
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,180
have you had incidences that have caused you to be in fear

625
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,180
for your life for addressing these issues?

626
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,180
Yes, personally.

627
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:43,180
Upon discovering a rogue UAP program,

628
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,140
Mr. Grush felt going public was his only option.

629
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,140
I just want everyone to note that he's coming forward

630
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,140
in fear of his life to put in perspective

631
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:54,140
if they were really not scared about this information coming out,

632
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,140
why would someone be intimidated like that?

633
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,140
Has the U.S. government become aware of actual evidence

634
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:03,140
of extraterrestrial, otherwise unexplained forms of intelligence?

635
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,140
I was informed in the course of my official duties

636
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:10,140
of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval

637
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,140
and reverse engineering program.

638
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,100
I made the decision, based on the data I collected,

639
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:19,100
to report this information to my superiors

640
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,100
and multiple inspectors general,

641
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,100
and in effect becoming a whistleblower.

642
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,100
What level of security clearance is required

643
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,100
to fully access these programs?

644
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,100
You know, TSSEI clearance meets the eligibility criteria.

645
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,100
The access adjudicative authority

646
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,100
should be able to grant you access.

647
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,100
Mr. Burch, if you'll yield.

648
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,100
Just to put a fine point on that.

649
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,100
He knows all this information,

650
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:44,060
and he won't tell it to us unless we're in this secure environment.

651
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,060
Something I can't discuss in public setting.

652
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,060
Mr. Burch, finally, do you believe

653
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,060
that our government is in possession of UAPs?

654
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:54,060
Absolutely, based on interviewing

655
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,060
over 40 witnesses over four years.

656
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,060
And where?

657
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,060
I know the exact locations,

658
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:03,060
and those locations were provided to the inspector general

659
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,060
and some of which to the intelligence committees.

660
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,060
I actually had the people with the first-hand knowledge

661
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,020
provide a protected disclosure to the inspector general.

662
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:15,020
I handle intelligence and cyber security...

663
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,020
Kirk McConnell,

664
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:21,020
a former staff member for the Senate Armed Services Committee,

665
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:25,020
was present at meetings with current and former government

666
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,020
and contractor personnel

667
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,020
claiming first-hand knowledge of involvement

668
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,020
in crash recovery operations,

669
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,020
intelligence operations,

670
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,020
and reverse engineering programs.

671
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:40,980
They have or have had very high-level security clearances.

672
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,980
They appear to be rational and believable.

673
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:48,980
You're telling me people have come forward

674
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,980
behind the scenes

675
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,980
claiming first-hand knowledge

676
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,980
of craft of non-human origin.

677
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,980
That's correct. They have.

678
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,980
We have, let's say, sources.

679
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,980
We have individuals, people,

680
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,980
who have asserted not only that there have been crashes,

681
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,980
but there have been crash retrievals

682
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,980
and that there is a crash retrieval effort

683
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,980
that has spanned a significant period of time

684
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,980
since the end of the Second World War.

685
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:24,980
And so it does deserve to be looked at seriously

686
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,980
and not dismissed.

687
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,980
You know, I've always tried to keep an open mind,

688
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,980
and I really believe it's all about the data.

689
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,980
I'm very empirical,

690
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,980
and I'm not going to say take a conclusive position on this

691
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,980
until there is absolute conclusive proof.

692
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,980
But at this point, together with some other sources,

693
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,980
I started to think, oh, my God, it's really true.

694
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,980
In 2020, the U.S. Department of State

695
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:58,980
In 2020, former Deputy Assistant Secretary

696
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,980
of Defense for Intelligence Christopher Mellon

697
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,980
engaged in confidential correspondence

698
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,980
with a high-level government official with credible access,

699
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,980
who described in considerable detail

700
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,980
aspects of an alleged UAP recovery program.

701
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:18,980
After he cleared it for release,

702
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,980
Mellon provided an unredacted copy with names,

703
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,980
including that of the gatekeeper of the program

704
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,980
to select members of Congress.

705
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:30,980
I was flabbergasted when I got this message.

706
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,980
This is from somebody that I knew,

707
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,980
a senior government official

708
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:42,980
with appropriate clearances and access

709
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:49,980
telling me that UAP have landed and been recovered

710
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,980
and there is a formal government program,

711
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,980
and he had encountered it, discovered it,

712
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,980
and was seeking to be read into it.

713
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:04,980
Blank and I are making huge progress

714
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,980
getting into the crash retrieval program.

715
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:09,980
So it's not just one individual, it's two,

716
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,980
who are involved in witting.

717
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:15,980
He plans to meet with you at some point.

718
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,980
The Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees

719
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:22,980
would be slack-jawed if they found out what we now know.

720
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,980
We're dealing with the recovered UAP that landed,

721
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,980
not crashed, landed in Kingman, Arizona in the 50s.

722
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:34,980
We also know who recovers landed or crashed UAPs

723
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,980
under what authorities.

724
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,980
We know the management structure

725
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,980
and the security control systems

726
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,980
and ownership of the program.

727
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,980
We know a still highly classified memo

728
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,980
by the Secretary of the Air Force in the 50s

729
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:50,980
is still in effect to maintain the cover.

730
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:53,980
We also know who the Air Force gatekeeper is,

731
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,980
and he names them.

732
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,980
The gatekeeper is the individual

733
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:00,980
who manages access to the program.

734
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:03,980
And I know someone who spoke to the Air Force gatekeeper,

735
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:09,980
and the Air Force gatekeeper purportedly

736
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,980
sort of neither confirmed nor denied.

737
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,980
U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant Jason Sands

738
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,980
has secretly testified

739
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,980
to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees.

740
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,980
This is his first time going on camera

741
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:34,980
to discuss the unclassified portion of those meetings.

742
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,980
Could you and a handful of others

743
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,980
prove to our government, our elected officials,

744
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:45,980
that we are in possession of off-world vehicles?

745
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,980
Yes.

746
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,980
Master Sergeant Sands is willing

747
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:54,980
to publicly testify under oath to Congress

748
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,980
that he can produce the classified details

749
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,980
needed to verify the following claims,

750
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,980
provided he's given immunity.

751
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,980
I'm a retired Air Force Master Sergeant.

752
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,980
Part of my career in the 1990s,

753
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,980
I worked three years at Air...

754
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,980
and the programs, which included

755
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,980
numerous sites around the United States,

756
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,980
and I was one of the Red Team members

757
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:18,980
that would go out and do telecommunications assessments

758
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:21,980
to check for intelligence leaks

759
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,980
and counterintell type issues at those locations

760
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,980
that were involved in the legacy program.

761
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:33,980
The term legacy program means endeavors to collect,

762
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:38,980
exploit, or reverse engineer technologies of unknown origin,

763
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:41,980
or examine biological evidence

764
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:45,980
of living or deceased non-human intelligence.

765
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,980
Do you have the names of the programs?

766
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:49,980
I gave it all to them.

767
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,980
You have the names of the people involved with the programs?

768
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:52,980
Yes.

769
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:57,980
This definition appears verbatim in the UAP Disclosure Act

770
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:03,980
authorized by Senators Schumer, Rounds, Rubio, and Gillibrand

771
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,980
that passed the Senate in 2023.

772
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,980
Why now?

773
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,980
I feel like it is the time

774
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:15,980
where I've seen the interest in the Congress,

775
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:20,980
I've seen the interest with the UFO programs,

776
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,980
and including Arrow, the talk of that standing up and everything,

777
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,980
kind of think in my head, is this the time to do this?

778
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,980
Because I'd seen so many times that it failed.

779
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,980
Decade after decade of somebody trying to come forward,

780
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:37,980
pointing fingers at Congress, pointing fingers at Air...

781
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,980
pointing fingers at whoever else, and it just was very adversarial.

782
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,980
If I felt comfortable enough without getting shot

783
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:51,980
to go walk on air and show them exactly what I told them in the interview,

784
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,980
I would go out there and I would drive them right up to the gate,

785
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:58,980
as long as I knew they had the authority to walk into that facility with me.

786
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,980
This is the hangar I told you about.

787
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,980
There's the radar over there.

788
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,980
There's the weather station I was taking over.

789
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,980
Me and the commander went around the whole base.

790
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,980
I could show them all those kinds of things,

791
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,980
and that's where we're kind of headed with all this.

792
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,980
I get the fact that the technology,

793
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,980
if you could separate that out and call that national security,

794
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,980
that the technologies they're working on,

795
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:27,980
that has some reason to stay classified.

796
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:30,980
But the revelation that there's other life out there,

797
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,980
that should be something for everybody.

798
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,980
That's the way I feel.

799
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,980
Two congressional committee staffers have confirmed

800
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,980
the credentials of this witness to the filmmakers.

801
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,980
He is who he says he is.

802
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,980
He was stationed where he said he was,

803
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:57,980
and he's confirmed actual names of classified programs.

804
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:04,980
There's so much concern that there's something locked up, classified,

805
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:10,980
and that the American government is not being open.

806
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,980
Well, we are the American government,

807
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:16,980
and we are open, and we're going to be open about this.

808
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:20,980
Do you believe what Mr. David Krauss said, or is he lying?

809
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,980
Whatever he said, where's the evidence?

810
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:28,980
Where's the evidence is my response.

811
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:32,980
I can give you a specific cooperative and hostile witness list.

812
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,980
And we could get that in the SCIF,

813
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,980
if we were allowed to get in a SCIF with you, would that be probably?

814
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,980
I can't discuss that publicly, but I did provide that information

815
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,980
both to the intel committees and the inspector general.

816
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:45,980
He also said he had another friend

817
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:52,980
that said that he had parts of an alien.

818
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:56,980
Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft?

819
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:59,980
As I've stated publicly already in my News Nation interview,

820
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:02,980
Biologics came with some of these recoveries, yeah.

821
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,980
Do you believe our government has made contact

822
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:08,980
with intelligent extraterrestrials?

823
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:12,980
Something I can't discuss in public setting.

824
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:58,980
The following encounter took place at Nellis Test Range in Nevada

825
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,980
in the winter of 1994.

826
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:04,980
As far as this unknown object or aircraft type,

827
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:08,980
18 degrees, 18.6 degrees elevation.

828
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:11,980
U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant Jason Sands

829
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,980
was stationed at the nearby Nellis Air Base

830
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,980
with the 67th Intelligence Group at the time.

831
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,980
This previous week, the UFO came on the range,

832
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,980
flew right by what we call the schoolhouse,

833
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,980
because that's where we did the training,

834
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:29,980
and it went down into the valley and continued on.

835
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,980
So they have actual video of it,

836
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,980
and that's what you see out there in the public,

837
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,980
this Nellis range UFO.

838
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:38,980
T1 control doesn't know what type of aircraft it is either.

839
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,980
No ACM, no tactics.

840
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:45,980
The system that they use also uses a type of radar to lock on

841
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,980
to aircraft as they come into view.

842
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:51,980
So this is what had recorded the UFO also.

843
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,980
The people that leaked the video out to the public

844
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,980
also leaked the names of those individuals.

845
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,980
And they were talking, a lot of them were excited.

846
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,980
Some of them didn't know what it was.

847
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,980
Some of them were saying it was a UFO for sure.

848
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:19,980
Other people were like,

849
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,980
no, it had to be some kind of messed up looking helicopter.

850
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,980
Other people were like, I just don't know, I just don't know.

851
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,980
But everybody was excited about it.

852
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:32,980
Three days later, Sergeant Sands was part of a convoy

853
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,980
overseeing a training exercise.

854
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:38,980
He was in the lead vehicle heading toward the center

855
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:41,980
of Nellis range near Quartz Mountain.

856
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,980
One of those days when the wind just cuts right through

857
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,980
whatever you're wearing.

858
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,980
It's me, there's another person in the passenger seat

859
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,980
and a young lady off to my right.

860
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:03,980
About a mile down the road, there's this guy on my left

861
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:06,980
and he looks like he's wearing a uniform like ours.

862
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:10,980
But I also notice his skin tone is very white to blue.

863
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:18,980
And I'm thinking, oh crap, this guy is dying of hypothermia.

864
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:19,980
And he's running funny too.

865
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,980
It's like every step he takes,

866
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,980
it looks like he's going to fall over.

867
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,980
Guy needs help, we need to stop.

868
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,980
As we get closer, I definitely get the idea

869
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,980
that he must be suffering from hypothermia

870
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:40,980
because he does have this bluish tint to his skin.

871
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:43,980
I'm thinking this guy needs medical help.

872
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:47,980
I need to get my butt out of the car before he falls down

873
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,980
and starts to die.

874
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:53,980
In the distance, Sergeant Sands noticed a strange landed craft

875
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:57,980
resembling a helicopter, but he was more focused

876
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,980
on the individual in need of help.

877
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,980
And then as we slow down and we approach the part

878
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:04,980
where he's only just a few feet away,

879
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,980
the guy in the passenger seat screams,

880
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:09,980
he's got no effing ears.

881
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,980
At that point, there's my open door,

882
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,980
I'm standing on one side of it,

883
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,980
and the individual that was running towards us

884
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,980
was on the other side.

885
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,980
And I shut the door.

886
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,980
And I look up, and he's got no ears.

887
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,980
And I'm thinking, is he a mutant?

888
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,980
I look at them, they're symmetric.

889
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:36,980
They're just like ours.

890
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,980
They've got lobes, everything.

891
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,980
It's just they're conformed to his head.

892
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,980
They're not sticking out like we do.

893
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:43,980
And then I notice his eyes.

894
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,980
They're like twice as big.

895
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:50,980
And I'm thinking, he's either not from around here,

896
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:52,980
from another planet, kind of not around here,

897
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:55,980
or this is some sort of a mutant.

898
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:00,980
And he turns towards me, and I get that kind of a snake bite,

899
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:03,980
kind of a fear in my gut, like, oh my gosh, you know,

900
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:04,980
I'm very scared.

901
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:07,980
And then he starts talking to me.

902
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:12,980
And he's speaking a language I don't know,

903
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,980
but I'm understanding every word he says,

904
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,980
and I don't know how that happened.

905
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,980
So there's this telepathic sort of understanding

906
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:25,980
I get from him, but he's speaking a different language.

907
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:29,980
How far away were you from him?

908
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:31,980
No more than about three feet.

909
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:35,980
The eyes caught me at first for how dark they were,

910
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:36,980
but it was more like, you know,

911
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:39,980
looking at somebody that had just large eyes

912
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,980
that were dark-colored.

913
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:44,980
Looking right in the eyes,

914
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,980
and then I'm starting to kind of once him over,

915
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:49,980
and I can see his battle-dressed uniform.

916
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:51,980
Usually, if you go up range,

917
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,980
you wear your really crappy stuff.

918
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:55,980
And this guy had a pristine uniform on.

919
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:56,980
I remember looking at his boots,

920
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,980
thinking, how on earth are they dressed like that?

921
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:00,980
I remember looking at his boots,

922
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:03,980
thinking, how on earth are they that shiny?

923
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,980
After running as far as he did just there,

924
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:07,980
he should have had dust on them.

925
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:09,980
And I'm thinking, how did they stay pristine like that?

926
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:13,980
So it was a little bit off to me,

927
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,980
but that didn't stop me for too long

928
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:17,980
because he was asking me stuff,

929
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,980
and he was asking for some material,

930
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:22,980
a material he called either Tantalium,

931
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,980
Trentillium, or something like that.

932
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:27,980
And I didn't know what the name was.

933
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,980
He mentioned it was to repair his craft,

934
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,980
and the only material that I could come up with

935
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,980
was like, is that titanium?

936
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,980
He's like, no.

937
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,980
And then he stepped off the roadway

938
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,980
and went back to his craft.

939
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:45,980
As the individual walked back toward the craft,

940
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:48,980
Sergeant Sands realized his military colleagues

941
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,980
seemed entranced.

942
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:54,980
They all watched as the pilot climbed back into the cockpit,

943
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,980
and the canopy closed.

944
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:59,980
The vehicle rose silently.

945
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:09,980
He got into the cockpit,

946
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:14,980
and then he just kind of went up in chunks,

947
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,980
like stair steps, above the roadway,

948
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,980
and then he took off to the south.

949
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:20,980
I got back in the car,

950
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,980
everybody seemed to come back to normal, snap to,

951
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,980
and we just went up and did our daily job.

952
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:30,980
Would you respond to anyone watching this

953
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:32,980
that would say this guy's clearly...

954
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:34,980
In that job, yeah? Yeah.

955
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:35,980
I would say, number one,

956
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:38,980
the Congress would never have talked to me if I was.

957
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:43,980
I was verified probably a year before I even talked to Congress

958
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,980
by the UAP task force.

959
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,980
There are databases that people don't have access to

960
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:54,980
that only Congress and people that are in special access programs have.

961
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,980
That's where they discovered my name.

962
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,980
That's where they saw where I was stationed also

963
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,980
in my military records.

964
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,980
That established at least who I said

965
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:05,980
and where I had been in the programs I was accessed to.

966
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,980
They can verify all of that.

967
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,980
The producers contacted DOD officials

968
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:15,980
who were aware of the 1994 encounter,

969
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:18,980
but would not verify it on or off the record.

970
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,980
As extraordinary as this story seems,

971
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,980
the subject is not new.

972
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,980
The Air Force and other agencies,

973
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,980
as well as governments around the world,

974
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:31,980
have been documenting close encounters of the third kind,

975
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:35,980
reports of interactions with non-human intelligence

976
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:38,980
since at least the 1940s.

977
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:41,980
I asked some of our scientists,

978
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:44,980
what is the mathematical probability

979
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:47,980
that there is life out there in the universe?

980
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:51,980
I don't know.

981
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,980
I don't know.

982
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,980
I don't know.

983
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,980
I don't know.

984
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,980
I don't know.

985
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,980
I don't know.

986
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,980
I don't know.

987
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,980
I don't know.

988
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,980
There is life out there in the universe.

989
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,980
At least a trillion.

990
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:17,980
And when you think of the universe

991
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:20,980
and how vast that it is,

992
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:24,980
there are billions and billions of galaxies,

993
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:28,980
and each of those galaxies, including our own,

994
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:31,980
have billions and billions of stars.

995
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:39,980
There are 1,000 times more stars in the universe

996
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:43,980
than there are grains of sand on the surface of the Earth.

997
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,980
Has the U.S. government become aware

998
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,980
of actual evidence of extraterrestrial,

999
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,980
otherwise unexplained forms of intelligence?

1000
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:58,980
And if so, when do you think this first occurred?

1001
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:03,980
Certainly, like I've discussed publicly previously in the 1930s.

1002
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,980
I'm Congressman Tim Burchett from Knoxville, Tennessee.

1003
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,980
I was one of them that was responsible

1004
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:11,980
for putting on the big hearings that we had on UFOs

1005
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:15,980
with Grush, Baver, and Graves.

1006
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:20,980
Claims under oath were made that, if true,

1007
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:23,980
are paradigm-shifting for all civilization.

1008
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:26,980
What is being done to verify the assertion

1009
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:28,980
that the U.S. government has spaceships

1010
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:31,980
of non-human intelligence in their possession?

1011
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,980
We need to have a select committee on that.

1012
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,980
Over a year after the congressional hearings,

1013
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:40,980
featuring intelligence officer Grush,

1014
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,980
Congress is still unable to get him

1015
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:46,980
into a sensitive, compartmented information facility,

1016
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,980
referred to as a SCIF,

1017
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:53,980
where he can provide the classified details of what he knows.

1018
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,980
Where would you look?

1019
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:59,980
Titles, programs, departments?

1020
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,980
Every obstacle is being put up.

1021
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:04,980
They're trying to block Grush from getting into the SCIF,

1022
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,980
saying he doesn't have the security credentials.

1023
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:10,980
He cannot share classified information in public settings.

1024
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,980
Not only has Grush been obstructed

1025
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,980
from fully revealing the classified details

1026
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:18,980
necessary for Congress to verify his claims,

1027
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:22,980
but his private medical records were leaked to the media,

1028
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:27,980
resulting in stories questioning his credibility and mental health.

1029
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:31,980
Grush is saying the government leaked his personal medical information

1030
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:35,980
to smear him and discredit his claims that he made against them.

1031
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,980
David is not making conclusions.

1032
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:40,980
He's providing data.

1033
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,980
And this is where I think the media has gotten it wrong,

1034
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:49,980
is that he's just saying, look, I was tasked to go collect this data,

1035
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,980
and I just provided the data to the relevant authorities.

1036
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:56,980
Now, the only reason, frankly, that David is sitting at that table

1037
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:59,980
was because the relevant authorities didn't like what he was saying

1038
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,980
and went after him.

1039
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:06,980
What I personally witnessed, myself and my wife, was very disturbing.

1040
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:09,980
He filed an official report of witness intimidation

1041
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:13,980
to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community,

1042
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,980
which is an ongoing investigation.

1043
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:19,980
It was very brutal, some of the tactics they used

1044
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:25,980
to hurt me both professionally and personally, to be quite frank.

1045
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:31,980
Meanwhile, back in the Senate, the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 passed.

1046
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:39,980
An unprecedented piece of legislation that could prove or disprove Grush's claims.

1047
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:46,980
For the government to obtain any recovered UAP material or biological remains

1048
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:50,980
that may have been provided to private entities in the past

1049
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:55,980
and thereby hidden from Congress and the American people.

1050
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:58,980
We are lacking oversight opportunities,

1051
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,980
and we are not fulfilling our responsibilities.

1052
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:07,980
The bill's most significant provision provided for a presidential-level panel

1053
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,980
to look into all other federal agencies.

1054
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,980
Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed

1055
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:17,980
to control the process of reviewing the records and recommending to the president

1056
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:22,980
what records should be released immediately or postponed.

1057
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:27,980
The bill passed in the Senate, but was shot down in the House.

1058
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,980
Key portions of an unprecedented measure

1059
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:34,980
to disclose classified government records relating to UAPs,

1060
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:38,980
those measures were stripped from the annual defense spending bill.

1061
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:42,980
It's beyond disappointing that the House has refused to work with us

1062
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:47,980
on all the important elements of the UAP Disclosure Act during the NDAA conference.

1063
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:48,980
But nevertheless...

1064
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:52,980
Key to gutting the bill were Mike Rogers of Alabama,

1065
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:55,980
the chair of the House Armed Services Committee,

1066
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:59,980
and Mike Turner, the chair of the House Intel Committee,

1067
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:04,980
who represents Dayton, Ohio, home of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,

1068
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:10,980
long rumored to be one location where UAP material is kept.

1069
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:14,980
There's nothing to see here why are Mike Rogers and Mike Turner in the House

1070
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:18,980
blocking this bill that is, in my opinion,

1071
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:23,980
the most important legislation for transparency in American history.

1072
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:27,980
The story is that they've held it from Congress, from the administration.

1073
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:30,980
I mean, it's pretty astonishing if true.

1074
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:34,980
Every decade there's been individuals who've said that the United States has

1075
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:39,980
such pieces of unidentified flying objects that are from outer space.

1076
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:44,980
There's no evidence of this, and certainly it would be quite a conspiracy

1077
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:48,980
for this to be able to be maintained, especially at this level.

1078
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:51,980
Pull up his pack donors. Who are his biggest donors?

1079
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,980
Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing.

1080
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:59,980
If there's nothing to see here, why don't we just pass this and see what happens?

1081
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:05,980
Most people won't touch it.

1082
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:11,980
I mean, one, they're afraid to be embarrassed, or two, they're afraid of what they find.

1083
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:22,980
Those with first-hand knowledge who have an interest in being forthcoming

1084
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:28,980
are deterred from doing so because they're afraid of the consequences,

1085
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:35,980
despite the whistleblower protections that exist in statutes and in policies,

1086
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:40,980
that those are just not really nearly effective enough.

1087
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:51,980
They feel that their livelihoods will be at risk, in some cases even worse.

1088
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:56,980
There's some people who express fear for their personal safety.

1089
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:04,980
Thank you so much to all of our speakers.

1090
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,980
We will start taking questions.

1091
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:12,980
For those in the room, we have a microphone over here that we would ask you to speak into.

1092
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:16,980
Thank you very much. This is directed to Mr. Nelson. Thank you for being here.

1093
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,980
Two quick questions.

1094
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:24,980
One is, how can we make the determination of what something isn't when we don't know what it is?

1095
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:31,980
And B, after a careful review of the data, if it's determined that some,

1096
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:37,980
underline the word some ten times, UFOs or UAP originate from a non-human intelligence,

1097
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:40,980
what's the plan to disclose that to the public?

1098
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,980
And can you identify yourself, please?

1099
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:45,980
James Fox. Thank you.

1100
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:49,980
Let me repeat what I said.

1101
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:53,980
I think it's important that you hear this word for word.

1102
01:25:53,980 --> 01:26:02,980
The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin,

1103
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:07,980
but we don't know what these UAP are.

1104
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:10,980
But we're going to try to find out.

1105
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:11,980
Thank you very much.

1106
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:16,980
And is there a plan in place, if it is determined that some of them originate from a non-human intelligence,

1107
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,980
to tell the public? Is there a plan?

1108
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:26,980
If we are what I said we intend to be, which is transparent, you bet your boots.

1109
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:28,980
We will say that.

1110
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:31,980
Whatever we find, we're going to tell you.

1111
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:40,980
I just wonder if the people in power even have any kind of plan for that.

1112
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:44,980
I kind of doubt they've really, they're very prepared for that.

1113
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:46,980
I don't know.

1114
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:52,980
What does the press release say when the government or governments decide to come forward and say,

1115
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:55,980
yes, we have evidence that we're not alone?

1116
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:05,980
That truth potentially upends the established order across the world, political, religious, economic.

1117
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:08,980
And I think there is a disincentive.

1118
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:13,980
If you don't really know what the reaction is going to be, how is it going to affect markets?

1119
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:16,980
How is it going to affect sovereign borders?

1120
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:20,980
How is it going to affect economies around the world?

1121
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:24,980
How is it going to affect the way people view God?

1122
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:33,980
Are people ready for some kind of revelation that deals with extraterrestrial life,

1123
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,980
life that is interdimensional, life that is otherworldly?

1124
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:48,980
And so that kind of revelation unearths people's beliefs, their religious beliefs, their spiritual beliefs,

1125
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:50,980
what they've been taught all of their lives.

1126
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:57,980
And so if such a revelation were to present itself, how does it get presented?

1127
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:02,980
And can it be done in a way that people are accepting of it?

1128
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:05,980
People are threatened by this thing.

1129
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,980
It doesn't threaten me.

1130
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:14,980
You know, I get the old 50s talk about how this would upset the balance of our religious.

1131
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:16,980
It doesn't upset me.

1132
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:18,980
I'm a born-again Christian.

1133
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:24,980
I think, you know, Genesis says, God created the heavens and the earth.

1134
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:33,980
We made a list of well over a couple dozen issues that would have to be addressed.

1135
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:36,980
And some of them really got into the nitty-gritty like, well,

1136
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:43,980
if Corporation A finds out that Corporation B had access to the advanced materials from crash retrievals

1137
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:46,980
and they didn't, well, then they're going to sue that corporation.

1138
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:51,980
They're also going to sue the government because they didn't get access, and one of their competitors did.

1139
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:54,980
So, you know, when we added up all the numbers,

1140
01:28:54,980 --> 01:29:01,980
it turned out that despite our personal feelings about it as we entered this process,

1141
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:08,980
we came to the conclusion that disclosure was kind of unsustainable almost.

1142
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:17,980
It's a bigger, more complex issue than most people probably appreciate when they just say,

1143
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:21,980
well, why don't they just tell us what's going on, be more transparent?

1144
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:25,980
Well, a lot of things have to happen before you can get to that point.

1145
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:37,980
Today, we stand at a pivotal moment in history.

1146
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:43,980
The question before us is not just about unidentified anomalous phenomena,

1147
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:48,980
but about the very principles of transparency, accountability, and trust

1148
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:52,980
between the government and the people it serves.

1149
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:55,980
Some of these crash retrieval programs, maybe...

1150
01:29:55,980 --> 01:30:02,980
There remains an ongoing official public effort to investigate what is really known about UAP.

1151
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:10,980
And to say, until I've seen evidence, I'm just not going to accept this, can't blame them.

1152
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,980
I mean, that, in fact, is a scientific position.

1153
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:17,980
If they got the clearances and were exposed to some of the evidence that you've seen,

1154
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:19,980
would it be a different story?

1155
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:20,980
Sure.

1156
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:25,980
But then they couldn't tell their friends or their wives or whatever.

1157
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:29,980
So they would be in the position of people that are on the other side.

1158
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:34,980
And so if they tried to tell somebody, they would get the same response to them as,

1159
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:37,980
well, prove it to me, show me some proof.

1160
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,980
And they wouldn't be able to do that.

1161
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,980
They would be in a different position.

1162
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:43,980
They would be in a different position.

1163
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:48,980
Maybe we get the same response to them as, well, prove it to me, show me some proof.

1164
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:51,980
And they wouldn't be able to do it.

1165
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:55,980
So that's what happens.

1166
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:58,980
Damn if you do, damn if you don't.

1167
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:04,980
A growing number of high-level insiders, elected officials, physicists,

1168
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:10,980
intelligence officers, and military whistleblowers are telling us that the evidence needed

1169
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:15,980
to prove their claims is being held by private corporate entities,

1170
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:22,980
contracted by the government, who for the time being remain immune from congressional oversight.

1171
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:26,980
So there's a degree of separation between them and the government.

1172
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:30,980
It's just like, you know, you contract somebody to paint the street out here,

1173
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:32,980
and they're not a government entity.

1174
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:35,980
I can't bring them in in front of a committee.

1175
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:38,980
I can bring the government entity that contracts with them.

1176
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:41,980
But there's a great deal of separation there.

1177
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:46,980
So that is by design, I feel like, and that keeps it away from us.

1178
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:59,980
Do you believe that a higher form of non-human intelligence has visited this planet?

1179
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,980
Non-human intelligence exists.

1180
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:04,980
Non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity.

1181
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:08,980
This interaction is not new, and it's been ongoing.

1182
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:12,980
And there are unelected people in the government that are aware of that.

1183
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:16,980
How confident are you that that is true?

1184
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,980
There's zero doubt.

1185
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:22,980
They have hardware, and there's a crowd.

1186
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:26,980
And there's occupants running these crowds, whatever they may be.

1187
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:33,980
And it's a very supersensitive topic, because it's something that probably a minute fraction,

1188
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:38,980
like less than $11,000 to $1100,000 of the United States,

1189
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:42,980
no attorney in the government, are the only ones that know.

1190
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:46,980
If programs like that existed, or still exist,

1191
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:51,980
where even the president's top advisors aren't aware of it,

1192
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:55,980
let alone the people's representatives, that's a government within a government.

1193
01:32:55,980 --> 01:33:01,980
How does a democracy survive if you could have something like that,

1194
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:07,980
that is shielded from the people that are by law authorized to know about that stuff?

1195
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,980
Witnesses with nothing to gain and everything to lose,

1196
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:19,980
who claim first-hand knowledge, are pleading with elected officials for immunity,

1197
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:23,980
so they can testify under oath about what they know.

1198
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:24,980
That's what happens.

1199
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:28,980
The implications, not just for the United States,

1200
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:33,980
but for all of humanity, are so profound that we owe it to ourselves

1201
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:37,980
to continue to support our committed elected representatives

1202
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:41,980
during this unprecedented push for transparency.

1203
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:42,980
Where would you look?

1204
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:47,980
If the existence of these secret programs is true,

1205
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:51,980
it would prove to be the greatest revelation in history.

1206
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:56,980
If we were provided the clearances right here and right now,

1207
01:33:56,980 --> 01:34:00,980
could you walk me into a lab and show me something?

1208
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,980
I'm not saying anything.

1209
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:26,980
Have you ever met any insider that made the indication to you that we're not alone?

1210
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:30,980
Yeah. Yes.

1211
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:33,980
Did you believe them?

1212
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:34,980
I believe them.

1213
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:57,980
It's very funny to me that every time a Russian bear comes across by Alaska

1214
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,980
or the West Coast or whatever, we freak out.

1215
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:02,980
We've got fighter planes, everything up there.

1216
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:05,980
We've got an unknown that pops up and everybody's just like,

1217
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:07,980
nothing to see here.

1218
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:11,980
And I'm like, how can that be?

1219
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:13,980
How can that be?

1220
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:16,980
Nothing to see here.

1221
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:19,980
And I'm like, how can that be?

1222
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,980
How can that be?

1223
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:47,980
I had a conversation about this with the current secretary of the Air Force,

1224
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:53,980
Frank Kendall, who has been in and out of the Pentagon for 40 years.

1225
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:55,980
So I said, hey, you're the head of the Air Force.

1226
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,980
What do you make of this?

1227
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:01,980
And basically he said, listen, the phenomenon has been around

1228
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:03,980
for as long as I've been alive.

1229
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:05,980
This is not new, these reports.

1230
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:08,980
In his view, he said, you know, I have to worry about threats.

1231
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:11,980
I have to worry about China.

1232
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:14,980
I have to worry about real-world national security vulnerabilities.

1233
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:17,980
And his point was like, maybe the scientific community

1234
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,980
needs to be where you go to try and figure this out.

1235
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:23,980
My name is Fred Claussen.

1236
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:27,980
I'm a retired Air Force bird's-cunnel and fighter pilot.

1237
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:31,980
In the spring of 1980, I had an event with the UAP.

1238
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:35,980
I was scrambled while sitting alert with a fully armed F-16.

1239
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,980
I was in the middle of the night,

1240
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:39,980
and I was in the middle of the night,

1241
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:41,980
and I was in the middle of the night,

1242
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:43,980
and I was in the middle of the night,

1243
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,980
and I was in the middle of the night,

1244
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:47,980
and I was in the middle of the night,

1245
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,980
and I was scrambled while sitting alert

1246
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:51,980
with a fully armed F-15

1247
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:55,980
to identify an unknown object over the North Sea.

1248
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,980
Once I found the object,

1249
01:36:57,980 --> 01:37:00,980
I observed a glowing football-shaped object

1250
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:02,980
about the size of my F-15,

1251
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:04,980
less than a quarter of a mile away.

1252
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:06,980
So I centered it up in my HUD.

1253
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:08,980
Gun camera is running.

1254
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,980
I'm taking pictures of it,

1255
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,980
trying to figure out what I'm going to do next.

1256
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:15,980
Do I intercept it? Do I shoot at it?

1257
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:16,980
I don't know.

1258
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:19,980
Then all of a sudden, the object just disappeared,

1259
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:21,980
went up into space in a blink of an eye,

1260
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,980
and it was gone.

1261
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:25,980
They had no wings,

1262
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:28,980
no type of propulsion that I could identify.

1263
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:31,980
It was just a glowing object with structure

1264
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,980
that was there,

1265
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,980
and then it was gone.

1266
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:39,980
I returned and debriefed my commander.

1267
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:42,980
I was told not to speak about it again.

1268
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:45,980
The gun camera film that I had was confiscated,

1269
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,980
never to be seen again.

1270
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,980
Why are you coming forward now?

1271
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:53,980
Coming forward now because I'm 82 years old,

1272
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:56,980
and I feel the time is right to speak about this.

1273
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:59,980
Even though my story is an old one,

1274
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:02,980
it proves that the Air Force was intercepting

1275
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:06,980
unidentified flying objects in the 1980s,

1276
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:08,980
and mine was one of them.

1277
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:45,980
If the answers are,

1278
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:48,980
there are no unidentified aerial phenomena,

1279
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:50,980
then say that.

1280
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:51,980
But that's not what the answers are.

1281
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:53,980
The answers are, we can't tell you.

1282
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:55,980
Were there members that just gobsmacked

1283
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:56,980
by the assertions from David Gruss?

1284
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:57,980
Yeah, they were.

1285
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,980
They were.

1286
01:38:58,980 --> 01:38:59,980
They couldn't believe it.

1287
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:00,980
A lot of them,

1288
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:04,980
they were a little shocked that all that came out.

1289
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,980
I heard lots of stories in 2017

1290
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:11,980
about there being a very strong

1291
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:14,980
evangelical Christian community

1292
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:16,980
within the military.

1293
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:18,980
And when I got to the military,

1294
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:21,980
I was shocked—

1295
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:23,980
I was shocked.

1296
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:25,980
I was shocked to see that

1297
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:28,980
there were so many people

1298
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,980
who were fighting for the military,

1299
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:32,980
and the military.

1300
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:36,520
community within the military, particularly in the Air Force,

1301
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:40,860
that didn't want to go here, put that stuff away.

1302
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,620
We don't want to hear about the woo-woo,

1303
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:46,320
because, again, it doesn't fit

1304
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:49,660
the established, accepted human story.

1305
01:39:49,660 --> 01:40:15,180
What would you like to see the President of the United States do?

1306
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:19,380
I'd like the President of the United States not to be embarrassed

1307
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:22,380
and for fear this is going to hurt his legacy,

1308
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:29,860
to say there's something going on out there, let's take a look at it.

1309
01:40:29,860 --> 01:40:34,260
It means that he is interested in a scientific community coming up with some answers

1310
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:37,760
to questions that thousands and thousands of people have

1311
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:48,460
and thousands and thousands of people have experienced unusual things.

1312
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:52,300
We send people to the electric chair in this country

1313
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:55,340
on the basis of eyewitness testimony every day.

1314
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:58,660
It is a foundation of our legal system,

1315
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:10,820
but that's not how this issue is treated.

1316
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:12,780
What happened when you looked at those photographs?

1317
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:14,940
Come on, put me there.

1318
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:16,100
Well, it's like...

1319
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:17,500
I want to be you for a minute.

1320
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:20,740
It's like, wow, you know, like,

1321
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:23,420
I can't think of any way to explain this

1322
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:28,540
other than this is not something in our inventory, I'm pretty sure.

1323
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,820
James, thank you so much, my friend.

1324
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:50,820
Let's go to work.

1325
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:55,020
Let's everybody have a great, safe, beautiful, fun and amazing weekend.

1326
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,660
We're going to go work and go have some fun.

1327
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:58,940
So see you later.

1328
01:41:58,940 --> 01:41:59,940
Bye.

1329
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:02,300
All right, James, thank you so much, my friend.
