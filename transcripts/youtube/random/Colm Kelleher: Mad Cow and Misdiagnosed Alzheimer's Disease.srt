00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We are talking today with Colm Kelleher. He is the author of the new book Brain Trust,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The Hidden Connection Between Mad Cow and Misdiagnosed Alzheimer's Disease.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Colm, thanks for coming in today.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Good to be here.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Start out and tell us, what was the motivation in writing your book Brain Trust?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, my motivation really arose from several fronts.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As a long-time research biochemist, I've always been interested in the underlying causes behind these mysterious brain diseases.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And the underlying cause is a very strange protein called a prion.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, if you're looking at it from a scientific point of view, prions break all the rules, or prions as they're also called.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
They break all of the rules. They're not like viruses, they're not like bacteria.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They're almost indestructible. They are very difficult to kill, but yet they seem to behave like infectious organisms.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So that really got my attention.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And the second thing that really got my attention was a study done from Yale University in the last few years,

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and the University of Pittsburgh, in which they went into the autopsy banks of Alzheimer's disease patients,

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
people who had died of Alzheimer's, and they looked at their brains and they found that their brains were not,

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
5% or 10% of these brains were not actually Alzheimer's disease.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They had died of a totally separate disease called CJD, Christophel Jakob disease, which has ties to mad cow disease.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now, the reason that's important is because it strongly implies that the numbers of CJD cases in the United States

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
is dramatically underestimated by the health authorities.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Usually, if the health authorities ever talk about this, they usually talk in terms of one in a million cases, very, very rare disease.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But these studies from Yale University, University of Pittsburgh, documenting about 5% to 10% of Alzheimer's disease patients

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
are actually misdiagnosed and that they're really CJD.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Currently, we have between 4 and 5 million Alzheimer's patients in the United States. It is an epidemic.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Alzheimer's disease has increased dramatically since the late 1970s by a factor of about 9,000%, which is an unbelievable number.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So if you look at even a tiny fraction of those Alzheimer's disease patients,

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
maybe even if you take a low number like 2% or 1% that are misdiagnosed and they're really CJD patients,

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
that is still an enormous number of CJD cases.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now, the other issue that I found that motivated me to write the book is that I discovered that CJD

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is not a mandatory reportable disease in the United States, in most of the states in the country.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So that's another reason for saying that the number of cases in CJD in the United States is simply not known.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And that has other implications for possibilities of numbers.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And the more numbers that are discovered for CJD, the less likely it is that these diseases arise randomly,

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
which is that CJD in the United States is mostly a variant called sporadic CJD,

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
which the CDC and the USDA, that's the Center for Disease Control and the United States Department of Agriculture,

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
routinely dismiss as having nothing to do with eating tainted beef.

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, there's evidence that's coming out in the scientific literature, which has been buried really in obscure journals,

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
rarely sees the light of day in the media, which are definitely questioning that premise.

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In other words, they're questioning the idea that mad cow disease and sporadic CJD are not connected.

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They're suggesting that there may be a connection between BSE and sporadic CJD.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So if you tie all those things together, you've got a potentially much larger number of CJD patients in the United States.

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You've got a potential linkage between BSE and sporadic CJD.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And then you've got this large number that are buried in this Alzheimer's disease epidemic in the United States.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then I think this sort of aura of complacency in the United States that has happened

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
since the first case of mad cow disease was announced in Washington a year ago may be unwarranted.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This sense of complacency may be unwarranted.

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Talk a bit about why our system wouldn't discover people having CJD.

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The real definitive way of discovering whether somebody has CJD, unfortunately, is waiting for them to die,

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
doing an autopsy on their brain, and looking at the pathology of the disease under the microscope.

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
A recent survey of pathologists in California came out just in the last six weeks

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
showed that over 70% of pathologists in California have a strong aversion to doing any autopsies on CJD patients.

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And why is that?

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Because the infectious organisms associated with, or infectious entities, prions associated with CJD

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
are not destroyed by the usual sterilization methods that are used to treat surgical instruments.

54
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So it has already been shown that surgical instruments will transmit the disease to other people,

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and other people have died because contaminated surgical instruments have been used.

56
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
70% of the pathologists in California do not want to contaminate their surgical instruments or their facilities with CJD.

57
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So that is one reason why there has not been a rush to increase the numbers of autopsies

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
in order to define the number of CJD patients.

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
At the state level, the disease is not mandatory reportable.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So if a CJD patient is discovered in a rural locale outside the university research hospital system,

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
chances that a primary physician will diagnose CJD versus dementia, versus Alzheimer's disease,

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
is fairly low because CJD has not had a lot of press, medical press or media press.

63
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So there's a tendency to lump these initial diagnoses into sort of a catch-all that includes dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

64
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So therefore, a lot of these CJD cases would be dropping through the cracks.

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now the other issue is in the United Kingdom and in Europe, mad cow disease had a dramatic effect

66
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
right across the board, both on the health of people as well as on the economics of the beef industry over there.

67
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The people in the United States have looked across the Atlantic and have seen the devastation that has happened across the Atlantic.

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I would wager that there's many, many people at the CDC and the USDA who do not want to see a repeat

69
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:11,000
of what happened over in the United Kingdom and in Europe with over a million cows slaughtered to prevent spread of mad cow disease,

70
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
150 young people, teenagers in their 20s and counting dead from a human variant of mad cow disease.

71
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So I think there's a strong kind of selection in the health authorities and in the agricultural authorities

72
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
to try to downplay the seriousness of these diseases.

73
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I think the American population tends to look at these as specifically a European problem.

74
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It has nothing to do with what's going on in the United States.

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And my book, you know, another motivation for my book is to argue that that is not the case.

76
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Well, I think one can understand how the USDA, which is more a front organization for the beef industry,

77
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
would not be so concerned with repeating what happened in the UK.

78
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But you'd expect the CDC, which you have the impression that it's concerned with the health

79
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and well-being of the citizens of this country, to be a little more on the ball on this.

80
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah, that's a very good point.

81
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think there's a strong drive at the CDC to downplay alarming the public,

82
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
unless there's data there that are actually beating you over the head.

83
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And if you look at the experience of what happened in the United Kingdom,

84
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I think you can really draw some very useful lessons.

85
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And, you know, in my book, there's a very famous photograph of the agriculture minister,

86
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
John Gummer and his daughter Cordelia, posing in front of the cameras eating hamburgers.

87
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And the purpose of that was to assure the British public that eating beef was safe.

88
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And then within a short period of time, the first teenagers started dying of human mad cow disease.

89
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Young people in their 20s started dying of human mad cow disease.

90
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That was the kind of the attitude in the ministries,

91
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
both the health ministries and the agriculture ministries over in Britain, is do not alarm the public.

92
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's continue along this line until we see everything is, you know, all the data are in, so to speak.

93
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But in the meantime, you know, there were people dying of mad cow disease.

94
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Over in the United States, even in the last nine months,

95
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
there have been a couple of worrying clusters of sporadic CJD in New York State.

96
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It was announced in the last eight weeks that there was about five people had died in a small area in Ulster County in New York State.

97
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The Catskills had died in the last few months from sporadic CJD.

98
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Nine months ago in New Jersey, the state of New Jersey,

99
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
there were reports of about 15 people who had died over a period of time.

100
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And all of those people had eaten at a single restaurant at a racetrack in New Jersey.

101
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The CDC was tasked to go into both of these and to investigate.

102
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Immediately, what they said was that these cases were sporadic CJD.

103
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They had nothing whatever to do with mad cow disease.

104
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
They had nothing whatever to do with eating meat.

105
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And therefore, they probably were statistical blips.

106
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
In other words, the number that's usually thrown out is that sporadic CJD is one in a million.

107
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So here we have 15 people in New Jersey dying over a couple of years, which is a statistical aberration, to put it mildly.

108
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
CDC said it had nothing to do with eating tainted meat.

109
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Therefore, they weren't going to fully investigate it.

110
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It was kind of like a chicken and egg situation.

111
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It has nothing to do with eating tainted meat.

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Therefore, it's not a problem.

113
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Therefore, we're not going to fully investigate it.

114
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We're not going to go into these premises and check for prion contamination, that kind of thing.

115
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Now, interestingly, the data in the science journals started to contradict that a couple of years ago.

116
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And all of this research is coming out of London and Europe,

117
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
where the research into prion diseases for obvious reasons is a lot more sophisticated than it is over here.

118
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What they found over in the United Kingdom is that BSE may cause different forms of CJD in humans,

119
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
not only the so-called variant CJD, which has been unambiguously tied with tainted meat, but also perhaps sporadic CJD.

120
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So there's research in the science journals, and the latest research came out less than a week ago,

121
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
documenting exactly the same thing, that BSE may give rise to different forms of CJD in humans,

122
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and that we may be missing the boat only by focusing on the so-called variant CJD, the human mad cow disease.

123
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There may be other forms of CJD that BSE gives rise to.

124
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So when the CDC confidently announces that sporadic CJD has nothing whatever to do with eating tainted beef,

125
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
the science is beginning to say otherwise. The science is trending in the opposite direction.

126
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So I think one of the reasons that the CDC can get away with saying the one in a million number,

127
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
in addition to the fact that, as you pointed out earlier, the current climate is not to go in and test people

128
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
after they die to see if they have this disease, is that in this country there hasn't been a lot of coverage

129
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
of the vast history of the different parallel diseases that are similar to BSE.

130
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm wondering if we can go into some of the details on that, fill people in.

131
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:13,000
My understanding is it actually starts in a couple of places. One is the sheep in the UK that we're getting.

132
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Is it Scrapey?

133
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Scrapey, yeah, that's right.

134
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And then also, tell us about Papua New Guinea.

135
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, the disease actually, the oldest known variant, if you want to call it, of these so-called prion diseases are sheep.

136
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And it's been known that sheep have dropped from these neurological symptoms for a couple of centuries in the United Kingdom.

137
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So it goes way, way back. But the really, I think from the United States perspective,

138
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
the really interesting events occurred in Papua New Guinea in the late 1950s

139
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:03,000
when a scientist, Carlton Gajusek, who was funded by the Walter Reed Army Hospital

140
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and Dr. Joe Smaddell, who was kind of like a kingpin at the NIH in Washington,

141
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
arrived over in Papua New Guinea in 1957 and began researching a mysterious brain disease that was killing

142
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
hundreds and eventually killed thousands of Foray tribespeople in the highlands in New Guinea.

143
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They were dying of this mysterious brain disease.

144
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The local tribespeople ascribed it to sorcery, and Gajusek was a brilliant physician.

145
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I mean, he was one of these extraordinary people who could go into a country,

146
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,000
basically live in the wild with different tribespeople, sleep in flea-infested huts for months on end,

147
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,000
take enormous amounts of blood samples, do autopsies at 2 a.m. in the middle of a rainstorm, this kind of thing.

148
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I mean, he was an extraordinary guy in terms of his ability to do this kind of medical research.

149
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So what he began to do as a way of researching this was to autopsy several of these Foray people

150
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
who had died from this mysterious disease.

151
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And by the way, these Foray people were cannibals, and the way they were spreading this disease,

152
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
it was found out later, was that they were eating their dead relatives after death.

153
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So they would eat brain material, they would eat the rest of the corpse,

154
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and that way the people who ingested it were getting the infectious entities, and they were dying.

155
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And then when they died, they would spread it to their relatives.

156
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So over a period of several decades, over 3,000 people died in that community.

157
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So Gajusek, in his brilliant, inimitable way, began doing autopsies on these people,

158
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
persuaded them to do autopsies because it took a lot of persuasion,

159
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
because they didn't like their relatives being cut open and their brains being removed.

160
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And he shipped a series of these brains back to the facilities at Bethesda and Fort Detrick, but mostly Bethesda.

161
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What they started doing for a variety of reasons is they began to test whether or not this brain disease was transmissible.

162
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So they found an isolated wildlife refuge at Patuxent, Maryland, between Washington and Baltimore, I believe it is.

163
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And they got a bunch of chimpanzees, a whole bunch of different primates, and a whole bunch of different species of animals,

164
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and they ground up the brains from these dead cannibals, made a brain slurry of them,

165
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:57,000
injected them into chimpanzees and primates and a whole variety of different species to see if these diseases were transmissible and they were.

166
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The chimps came down with the brain disease and they died.

167
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But this was in the middle of a wildlife refuge in Patuxent, Maryland.

168
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The USDA actually in 1963 visited the facility and they were so appalled at the containment,

169
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
the restrictions and whether or not the animals could escape, they tried to shut the place down.

170
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It was that bad.

171
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So one of the theories in my book is that this kind of intense series of inoculations that had happened over a multiple year period in the 60s

172
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
may have contributed to spreading these prion diseases into the wildlife.

173
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Because nothing was known in those days that prions could jump species.

174
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The dramatic jump from cattle to humans that happened in the United Kingdom in the 90s was a very good example of how prions can jump species.

175
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The way I would look at that whole thing is that it was like throwing gasoline on a fire.

176
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There may have been low levels of prions.

177
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
For example, sheep were imported from the United Kingdom in 1947 into the United States that had scrapie.

178
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So there may have been low levels of prion in sheep in the United States and maybe even mink.

179
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But this kind of massive parallel inoculation series of experiments that happened out in Maryland in the 1960s,

180
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
my theory is that this could have spread to wildlife.

181
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Now the other part of this thing is about 20 years after this whole episode of injection into wildlife,

182
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
there was a mysterious outbreak in 1985 in Stetsonville, Wisconsin,

183
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:07,000
where 4,000 mink died of a strange, and these were farm mink, they died of a strange brain disease.

184
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
A University of Wisconsin research veterinarian called Dr. Richard Marsh went up there to investigate.

185
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What he did was he took the brains from these mink and examined them.

186
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And he found that all of those mink had died of essentially mad mink disease.

187
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They had died from the brain disease.

188
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So he investigated how these animals might have got this disease.

189
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He looked at their feeding habits, he looked at what they had been fed,

190
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and it happened that the owner of the mink ranch had kept extremely meticulous records.

191
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And it turned out that this rancher had been feeding the mink dead cows.

192
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Ground up remains of dead cows.

193
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So this was 1985, this was not 2003, this was 1985.

194
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So the strong implication from Dr. Richard Marsh's investigations,

195
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and he published all this stuff in science journals,

196
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
was that there was a mad cow disease variant present in beef that had been fed to mink

197
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and had caused the mink to die of mad mink disease.

198
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So the idea that mad cow disease has only been discovered in one single animal

199
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
in Washington state in 2003 is not exactly the truth,

200
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
because there is strong evidence that this disease has been around in this country for decades.

201
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And so while all this is happening, I understand there was also independent efforts

202
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
by different scientists kind of working this at different angles,

203
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
looking at the transmissibility of the disease between, let's say,

204
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,000
mice they were testing and hamsters and the cows and seeing which directions the disease could go.

205
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
My impression was it looked like it could pretty much go in any direction they wanted it to.

206
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes, there's really now very little doubt that these prion diseases can transmit between species.

207
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And as you mentioned, yeah, there have been a lot of experiments done with mice and hamsters.

208
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And the interesting thing is if you set up these series of experiments properly,

209
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
which has been done many times, you can find that if you transmit prion diseases between species

210
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and then retransmit them back to the original species,

211
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
the prions that are retransmitted are actually more virulent than the original prions.

212
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
In other words, if they cycle through species, they become even more virulent if they come back to the original species.

213
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So that is obviously very worrying if you look at it in terms of wildlife being infected with these prion diseases.

214
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
There's a good example of that.

215
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
There was a couple of clusters of CJD that erupted in Kentucky in the 1980s and 1990s.

216
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It turned out that a lot of these people had been eating squirrel brains.

217
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It was kind of apparently it's a local delicacy in those areas.

218
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And people had died from CJD from eating squirrel brains.

219
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Well, how do the squirrels get these prion diseases?

220
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Unknown. There was another couple of cases that were found in Texas for the same reason.

221
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So the whole idea that prions jump species is gaining an awful lot of attention.

222
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And actually there's, overlaid on the mad cow topic,

223
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
there's a second major epidemic that's running through the wildlife in the United States, and that is the deer and elk.

224
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Deer and elk in between 15 and 20 states now have been documented to have this same brain disease, prion disease,

225
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
only in deer and elk it's called chronic wasting disease because the deer become emaciated.

226
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
They can't eat. They start dripping saliva, that kind of thing.

227
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Their symptoms are pretty bad and then they die.

228
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And when their autopsies and necropsies are done, their brains are full of holes.

229
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
They look like Swiss cheese.

230
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So overlaid upon the concern about beef, we have a second major situation here in the United States that may have relevance to hunters.

231
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We know right now as we speak that about 11 million hunters throughout the country are beginning their annual hunting season

232
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
and they're shooting a lot of deer and a lot of elk.

233
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
This disease in deer and elk originated in a research facility.

234
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It was found originally in a research facility in Colorado, Northern Colorado, and in a sister facility in Wyoming.

235
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Since then, it has transmitted to the wild deer population and wild elk population, first in Colorado, then Wyoming, Nebraska.

236
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
There was an epicenter that sort of grew in the 1970s and 1980s,

237
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
but it was really only in the last two or three years where these wildlife diseases in deer and elk really started spreading quickly.

238
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And only in 2002 and 2003, these wildlife diseases jumped into Utah, they jumped into Wisconsin,

239
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and they're now in Wisconsin and Illinois where there's two million hunters embarking I think this week or next week on hunting season in Wisconsin and Illinois.

240
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The disease also jumped in all the way down to the south part of New Mexico near the White Sands Proving Grounds.

241
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And it has since trafficked up across the border from the United States into Canada.

242
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's both in Saskatchewan and in Alberta.

243
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So, you know, you've got lots of hunters who are field dressing carcasses.

244
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
They're stripping meat from the spinal cord of deer and elk.

245
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
They're eating venison, you know, they're cooking up venison, they're eating venison.

246
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Right now, there are still questions about whether or not prions can jump from deer or elk into humans,

247
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
or where prions can jump from deer or elk into cattle and then into humans.

248
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Those questions are unknown.

249
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
In the last couple of years, there have been reports of a couple of reports of young hunters dying of CJD.

250
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And these people are in their 20s.

251
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
CJD is supposed to be an old people's disease, quote unquote.

252
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You know, people in their 60s and 70s are supposed to die of CJD, not people in their 20s and 30s.

253
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So when you've got a couple of young hunters in the last couple of years who have died of CJD,

254
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
you start beginning to be concerned.

255
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The CDC investigated those cases of hunters, and they said there was no relationship with eating venison or hunting.

256
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But again, they said it was a statistical blip that these people died at a young age for unknown reasons.

257
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But there have been many, many different instances now in the United States of apparent clusters of CJD cases

258
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
that have cropped up, have been explained away, and kind of disappeared off the horizon.

259
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And at the same time, there's this mounting body of circumstantial evidence,

260
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and it's all trending in the same direction that indicates that we have a problem in the United States.

261
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And all we have to do is to look across at the United Kingdom to see how they handled their problem in the 1990s,

262
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
to see that we need to learn some lessons here.

263
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Well, it begs the question with the problem with the deer that currently is growing exponentially.

264
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You can understand it with the mink that they were fed rendered cows.

265
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You can understand it with the cows because they're eating rendered, again, rendered parts and stuff.

266
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You can understand perhaps a jump from deer to humans because the humans are eating the deer.

267
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But my understanding is you generally don't, when you're driving by on the side of the road,

268
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
see the deer down there like chowing on each other, you know, eating some other animal.

269
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So how would the deer be picking that up?

270
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I know deer can transmit the prion disease very, very easily among species.

271
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:56,000
In other words, if a deer in a farm, a farmed elk or a farmed deer rubbed noses with a wild animal that comes up to the fence line,

272
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
that wild animal can get the deer disease and spread it.

273
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Now, in terms of how it actually arrived into the deer population, that's another large question mark.

274
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Was it connected with these wildlife or these inoculation experiments that happened in the 60s?

275
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Right now, there's no smoking gun.

276
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But, you know, the traffic, if you look at the sort of the traffic of the squirrels in Kentucky, mink in Wisconsin, deer and elk in Colorado,

277
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:42,000
you do see that there seems to be a pattern of these, and it's way under the radar, of these wildlife species coming down with prion disease or brain disease

278
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and then maybe spreading it to other species.

279
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:56,000
There's a study ongoing right now in Wisconsin where they're putting deer carcasses out there with cameras on the deer.

280
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And they're documenting exactly how many species come in there to feed on those deer.

281
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And, you know, they've already documented 10 different species, including foxes and coyotes and raccoons and squirrels and even crows that come in there to feed on those dead deer.

282
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And the intent is to start trapping those animals, those wild animals, to see if those wild animals do pick up those prion diseases from dead deer.

283
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Because there's a lot of concern that, you know, if you've got 10 different species feeding on a carcass, how many of those species can get prions?

284
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's already been shown, for example, it's very easy to transmit prions from, say, mink to raccoons.

285
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Very easy, you know, because genetically they're very, very susceptible.

286
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:03,000
There's a whole sort of slew of worried wildlife officials right through the country who are not speaking to the press.

287
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I've talked to a couple, you know, but all of these interviews are off the record.

288
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But a lot of these people are very concerned about how this disease has jumped so quickly across so many different states in such a short time.

289
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I talked to one guy in New Mexico, for example, who could not explain the jump in the brain disease from deer from the supposed epicenter in northeastern Colorado,

290
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
all the way down to the border, you know, the border of the southern, south part of New Mexico.

291
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And, you know, these guys had examined deer migration routes.

292
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They'd examined trucking deer into the state and all of this, and they had ruled it out.

293
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That was not the explanation.

294
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Somehow these deer, you know, down in the south part of New Mexico had contracted prion disease.

295
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Now, where did it come from? These guys didn't know.

296
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And, you know, there's another jump right into the middle of Utah, which is not consistent with deer migration routes either.

297
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Wisconsin, you know, the suspicions that some cowboy operator may have brought contaminated deer into the state or elk into an elk farm kind of thing.

298
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
But nobody has really got the smoking gun there.

299
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So these these diseases are spreading very, very quickly through the through the wildlife.

300
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Talk about a little bit about because we're talking about different technically have been labeled different diseases.

301
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Let's say Scrapey, BSE, CJD, but they all share something in common.

302
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
They're all exactly the same mechanism of disease.

303
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And that is this mysterious infectious entity called the prion.

304
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Now, a prion is not a virus. It's not a bacterium.

305
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It is a protein that everybody has.

306
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But the difference is that protein changes shape into a new lethal form.

307
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And that the change once it changes shape, it's almost like a different structure of a protein that that creates a lethal form of this protein.

308
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The normal form is supposedly protective in the cell, but the lethal form is is associated with widespread cell death.

309
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So if you eat a hamburger that's tainted with prions, it goes first into the gut and then it moves into the gut associated lymphoid tissue,

310
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:44,000
which is called GALT, which is a dense area of lymph lymphatic tissue around the gut.

311
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It then moves into the lymph system and then moves into the peripheral nervous system and eventually central nervous system,

312
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:00,000
which is the spinal cord and brain. But it does it is known to migrate through the through the lymphoid tissue.

313
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The prion is definitely one of the most mysterious things known in infectious disease because it breaks every single rule that's been known in science in the last 50 years.

314
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It doesn't carry DNA, doesn't carry RNA, which are the two things that viruses and bacteria use to replicate.

315
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
These prions seem to be able to force normal prions to adopt the lethal shape.

316
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And so it's kind of like a chain reaction in the cell and in the cells next to those cells where it's over many,

317
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:49,000
many years these hundreds of millions of cells and then billions of brain cells die from this slow transmission like a chain reaction in the brain.

318
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And it's only when the terminal stages of this whole process, which can take years if not decades, that the person begins to notice symptoms.

319
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:17,000
The person begins to notice forgetfulness, mood changes, feeling really, really weird and feeling off, shaking, start trembling, muscle spasms and then seizures.

320
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And then it really starts getting serious where all memory begins to go, person doesn't recognize family members.

321
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This all happens right after the first initial symptoms and it may take months, sometimes maybe a year or two to die.

322
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Now, the very initial symptoms of this, of CJD, are there's some overlap with the very initial symptoms of Alzheimer's.

323
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The difference with CJD and Alzheimer's is Alzheimer's takes much, much longer to progress.

324
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
People can last for years if not maybe even a decade between the initial symptoms and final terminal stages.

325
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
With CJD, it is usually months, sometimes maybe 18 months kind of thing.

326
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But the prion has already been the subject of two Nobel Prizes that have been won,

327
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:22,000
first by Carlton Gajuszek for the discovery of the infectiousness in the kuru population in New Guinea,

328
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and then the second one by Dr. Stanley Prusner from the University of California in San Francisco for his actual discovery of the prions.

329
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And, you know, the still scientists around, even in 2004, who were saying that prions cannot possibly exist,

330
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:47,000
it's like a bad science fiction movie, you know, that these entities, they don't even require DNA, RNA to replicate.

331
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
They infect other people, they jump species, they're indestructible.

332
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
If you try to sterilize surgical instruments after autopsy of a CJD patient,

333
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
you've got to raise the temperature to 600 or 700 degrees before you will kill these things.

334
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:12,000
They last in a pasture. If a deer loses saliva that's infected with prions onto a pasture,

335
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
then those deer are removed. Two years later, a new herd of deer are put on the pasture.

336
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And those new herd of deer will come down with that disease because the prions remain infectious in the pasture for up to a couple of years.

337
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So, you know, not only is this mysterious prion breaking all the rules in molecular biology and all of that, but it's also indestructible.

338
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So from so many different angles, these prions and these diseases associated with prions are quite scary.

339
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You know, the disease is 100% fatal. There has never been a known case where a person, once they have initial symptoms, do not die.

340
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's usually a question of just when.

341
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Talk a bit about why Scrapey, which has been known for, I believe you said hundreds of years, and people have been consuming that sheep meat,

342
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
why didn't this whole thing pop up in the population earlier?

343
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Well, that's a very good question. There are a number of possible explanations for that.

344
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
One explanation is that it did crop up in the population, but was not detected.

345
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Another possibility is that somehow the Scrapey form of the prion is not capable of jumping straight to humans.

346
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:47,000
There is a possibility, for example, that the Scrapey form may have been the cause of the epidemic in deer and elk,

347
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
but that has not been absolutely tied down. It is more sort of speculation.

348
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:06,000
But there is no really good explanation of why the Scrapey has not led to the same kind of epidemic of people dying of CJD that mad cow disease has caused.

349
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:18,000
One of the things that is becoming increasingly clear, as more research is done, is how little we know about these prions and how they act.

350
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:30,000
We do know that there is genetics involved and that the type of mutations that are in the gene, the prion gene,

351
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
do have an effect on the kinds of shape that it can adopt in the cell and therefore have an effect on species transmission.

352
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So it may be simply, for example, that the sheep Scrapey is much more difficult for it to transmit to humans than, say, the cow variant.

353
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But it may be easier to transmit from sheep to cattle and then cattle to humans. We don't know that.

354
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:07,000
There are so many unanswered questions. For example, the actual use or the biology of the normal prion in the cell is really not known.

355
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Nobody really knows what the normal prion protein in the cell does. It's not known.

356
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So when you've got that kind of level of knowledge base with respect to this,

357
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
making confident statements and making confident predictions about, oh, yeah, this has nothing to do with mad cow disease is way premature.

358
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And yet if you were sitting back and looking at all these epidemic levels of these different variants of this disease

359
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and how it's racing through different species and that we're dealing with something that apparently does look like something from, you know, attack from Planet Nine or whatever.

360
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,000
If I was in charge, I would be directing a lot of resources towards finding out what the heck was going on with this.

361
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, you're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. And that is one of the reasons. Another reason that I wrote this book.

362
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:13,000
You know, there are two main areas that need to be tested very, very quickly. And the first is the cow population in this country.

363
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You know, you may remember before December of 2003 when the mad cow case appeared in Washington state that got all the news.

364
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Only twenty thousand animals in this country were tested for mad cow disease out of an annual slaughter of thirty five million.

365
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So thirty five million cattle are slaughtered before they arrive on the dinner table every every year in this country.

366
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So before the 2003 announcement, twenty thousand cases or twenty thousand animals were tested after the announced case.

367
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,000
They they made a lot of press coverage about the fact they were increasing the numbers of animals tested to two hundred thousand.

368
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Two hundred thousand animals out of thirty five million is still less than one percent.

369
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:10,000
If you look across at the Europeans, Europeans on average test 30 percent of all animals that go to the dinner dinner table.

370
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Japan tests 100 percent. Ireland has just begun to test 100 percent.

371
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So the you know, the kinds of statements that have been issued very successfully, by the way,

372
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,000
from the USDA in the last twelve months saying that all of the all of the bases are now covered.

373
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You know, we're testing two hundred thousand animals. It is still a very, very low number.

374
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
In fact, Dr. Dr. Prusner, the Nobel Prize winner for for discovering prions, issued a statement in the last month or so

375
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
saying that the the level of testing is absolutely woefully inadequate in the in the USDA.

376
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Now, the second part of this whole thing is is testing of humans.

377
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You've you've really got to dramatically increase the number of of autopsies that are being conducted on CJD and on on,

378
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:15,000
quote unquote, dementia patients in order to get some kind of a baseline figure on what the actual numbers are.

379
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Got to have a real good national database.

380
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Right now, there's the National Prion Surveillance in Cleveland case Western, which is woefully inadequately funded.

381
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And it is you know, it does not cover all the bases that there is a lot of evidence that there's a lot of cases dropping through the cracks.

382
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So you've got to test test in humans. You've got to test in in cows.

383
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
You've got to put a lot of resources into this.

384
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:51,000
NIH just shut down their their national prion research laboratory about two months ago.

385
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You know, that doesn't exist anymore.

386
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I mean, that is a measure of the level of you could call a complacency in this country in terms of research.

387
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm not saying there's no prion research in the United States.

388
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I think there's centers of excellence.

389
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I mean, there's some brilliant research, Nobel Prize winning research that has come out of the United States.

390
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
But if you're looking at the for the groundbreaking research in the last five years that is looking at the effects on humans,

391
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
you have to go to the United Kingdom and you have to go to Europe because, you know, they have learned the lessons.

392
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And, you know, one of the things I say in my book is that a lot of the European scientists

393
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
who have come through this this gut wrenching experience in the last 10 years in UK and Europe,

394
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
when they look across at the United States and they see the circumstantial data in the cattle,

395
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
you know, going back to Dr. Richard Marsh's 1985 discoveries and all the way to now on the wildlife,

396
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
they really shake their heads at the lack of attention that's being focused on this whole thing.

397
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And then on top of everything else is this epidemic in deer and elk that's spreading through the country, brain waste and diseases.

398
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And they're all the same thing. They're all prion based diseases.

399
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You know, they're suggesting that the United States may be able to learn from the mistakes that were made in the United Kingdom and in Europe.

400
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But, you know, I think history has a habit of repeating itself endlessly.

401
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And, you know, there's a photograph in my book right beside that British agriculture minister and his daughter eating hamburgers.

402
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
There's a photograph in my book of the then Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chrétien.

403
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,000
He's two days after the announcement in May 2003 of the first mad cow in Canada.

404
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Prime Minister Jean Chrétien sat down in a restaurant in Ottawa and in front of the cameras put a whole bunch of beef into his mouth and started eating beef.

405
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Again, the message was exactly the same as the minister and his daughter in Britain that eating beef was perfectly safe.

406
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
There's nothing to worry about. Canadians should continue eating beef. You know, everything is okay.

407
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Same thing happened in the United States right after the mad cow case in Washington.

408
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:27,000
There was a relentless, you know, overdrive of publicity and public relations for about two to three months right after that announcement.

409
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And, you know, Secretary Anne Veneman retired just in the last few days, and she has been praised and credited with keeping American confidence in beef,

410
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
consumers' confidence in beef at an all-time high.

411
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Just a mere three months after the announcement in Washington of this mad cow case, CNN ran a story entitled Cow Brain Sandwiches.

412
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And there was a, I'm not sure if it was in Georgia or somewhere in the southeastern part of the United States,

413
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:11,000
but there was a story about this group of people, families, down in this area who were still eating cow brain sandwiches, which is apparently a local delicacy.

414
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
This was a mere three months after the first documented case of mad cow disease.

415
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Now, you know, eating cow brain sandwiches is, I would consider, a fairly high-risk procedure,

416
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
but it was a measure of the success of the public relations exercise that the USDA had successfully completed

417
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:39,000
that people, the American consumers, were happily continuing to eat, you know, beef, including cow brain sandwiches.

418
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
My understanding as well, jumping back to the amount of cattle being tested here in the U.S.,

419
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
in addition to it being a microscopic number of the actual herd of 35 million being tested,

420
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,000
that they're only focusing on the downer cows, and because I talked to Dave Luther earlier in this year,

421
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:05,000
if we look at the single cow that turned up as being the first recognized case of BSC in the U.S., that was not a downer cow.

422
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So they're ignoring, you know, the very portion of the herd, the bulk of the herd that turned out as positive.

423
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yes, I think Dave Lothan did the country a tremendous service by coming forward and explaining how exactly that whole thing went down.

424
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
The implications, I think, of what Dave Lothan was saying are really staggering,

425
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:36,000
because what they're saying is that the program, the USDA program that was focused on testing only downer cows,

426
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,000
which are cows that drop for any number of reasons and can't walk anymore,

427
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:51,000
is that the cow that was found in Washington State was not a downer cow, it was actually walking, it was quite capable of standing up.

428
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That means that the program that the USDA was focusing on just downer cows was missing the boat,

429
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
and that that cow was found completely by accident.

430
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I understand that there's still an ongoing investigation at the federal level into falsifying the records out there in Washington State

431
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
regarding whether that animal was a downer or a walker.

432
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And, you know, that's winding its way through the bureaucratic channels right now.

433
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:33,000
But there's sufficient concern about that whole thing that the idea that the cow, the single cow that has been admitted to,

434
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:40,000
was actually walking rather than downing, a downer, is staggering.

435
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Because it means that how many other cows have been missed if the USDA is only focusing on downer cows.

436
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And, you know, that raises a whole series of questions about symptoms, how long it takes for symptoms to appear in cattle.

437
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Is it only at this much-talked-about 30-month period?

438
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,000
30-month is supposedly the break-off period where cows begin to develop symptoms of mad cow disease.

439
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:20,000
The saying goes that there's no point in testing pre-30-month, but only post-30-month.

440
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So you've got a higher probability of detecting mad cow disease in the older animals, which is true.

441
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:32,000
But does that mean that any animals that are less than 30 months of age do not have prion disease?

442
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Again, there's a whole slew of convoluted logic that is really self-defeating in this whole thing.

443
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I think Dave Lutheran really put his finger on the whole thing by coming forward like that and saying that the animal that he killed was not a downer cow.

444
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And I think the implications are still reverberating through the country.

445
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But by and large, in terms of the media, that particular part was not picked up on the way it should have been,

446
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:13,000
because it really exposed a sort of a flank in the whole testing process in this country that, you know,

447
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I think people are really going through the motions of testing rather than, you know,

448
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:26,000
genuinely going after to see what kind of the baseline is in the United States with regard to numbers of mad cows.

449
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And finally, quickly, the media has repeated what has come out of Anne Veneman and the USDA,

450
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:43,000
saying that if you just take out, for instance, the brains and the spinal cord and maybe a couple other organs,

451
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,000
that, you know, you'll be relatively safe, that the beef will be clean. What's the truth to that?

452
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Well, you know, that's another of these issues that needs to be intensively researched.

453
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
If you look at the New England Journal of Medicine recently came out in the last year,

454
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,000
came out with an article showing that CJD humans had lots of prions in their muscle.

455
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
They had detectable, I should say, rather than lots, detectable prions in their muscle.

456
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Sheep, scrapie-infected sheep, have prions detectable in their muscle.

457
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Hamsters have detectable prions in their muscle.

458
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
What the USDA has been saying is that there have never been prions found in cow muscle.

459
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And, you know, there have been a couple of studies published so far, but the numbers are so low

460
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,000
that there really needs to be a large increase in the resources devoted to testing.

461
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Asking that simple question, you know, do we really need to increase the sensitivity of the tests

462
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
in order to be able to detect these prion proteins in cow muscle?

463
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Because if prions are detected in cow muscle, that means that the entire beef supply,

464
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
which is, you know, steaks that people eat, again, is at risk.

465
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:12,000
You know, muscle is full of nerves, it's full of blood vessels.

466
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,000
It's already known through, again, research from the United Kingdom that prions are transmitted in blood.

467
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Both the blood donors and acceptors of blood transfusions in the United Kingdom have died of CJD.

468
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And in France, they're currently tracking a donor who has died of CJD,

469
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
who has donated blood to multiple different people.

470
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So, you know, it's known that the blood carries prions, too.

471
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:49,000
So the idea that beef, which is infused with both nerves and with blood vessels, would be entirely free of prions.

472
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Again, you know, if you look at the science and you look at the public relations, I think there's a definite gap.

473
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
All right. What final thoughts would you like to share with our listeners?

474
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Well, I think the real essence of this book is really, if you will, a wake-up call to the people in this country,

475
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:20,000
that there have been a tremendous amount of experiences that have happened across the water.

476
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:27,000
The United Kingdom in the last few years have put up thousands and thousands of pages of documents on their website,

477
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:35,000
the BSE Inquiry website, which people can go to to look to see what the mistakes, the bureaucratic mistakes,

478
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
there were so many and they were so varied.

479
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
The United States has a tremendous amount of lessons to learn.

480
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I believe that the complacency that exists in the United States regarding mad cow disease,

481
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,000
regarding prion diseases, both in the wildlife and in the beef and dairy supply.

482
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I think that that sense of complacency is misplaced.

483
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I believe that we really need to get a whole program, series of programs of testing urgently in this country.

484
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
All right. Well, I want to thank you for spending time with us today.

485
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
You're very welcome. It was really good to talk to you.

486
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
We have just been talking with Colm Keller.

487
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:29,000
He is the author of Brain Trust, the hidden connection between mad cow and misdiagnosed Alzheimer's disease.
