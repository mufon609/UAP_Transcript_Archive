1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Well, I am very interested in the subject of human misjudgment, and Lord knows I've

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,360
created my, well, a good bit of it.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,080
I don't think I've created my full statistical share.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,540
And I think that one of the reasons was I tried to do something about this terrible

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:28,160
ignorance I left the Harvard Law School with when I saw this patterned irrationality which

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,280
was so extreme.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,320
And I had no theory or anything to deal with it, but I could see that it was extreme and

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,040
I could see that it was patterned.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,160
I just started to create my own system of psychology, partly by casual reading, but

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,240
largely from personal experience.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,920
And I used that pattern to help me get through life.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,480
Fairly late in life, I stumbled into this book, Influence, by a psychologist named

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,120
Bob Cialdini, who became a super tenured hotshot on the 2000 person faculty at a very young

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
age.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:12,600
And he wrote this book, which is now sold 300,000 copies, which is remarkable for semi

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,520
well, it's an academic book aimed at a popular audience.

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,840
And that filled in a lot of holes in my crude system.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:30,200
And when those holes had filled in, I thought I had a system that was a good working tool

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,360
and I'd like to share that one with you.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,200
And I came here because behavioral economics, how could economics not be behavioral?

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,120
If it isn't behavioral, what the hell is it?

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,480
And I think it's fairly clear that all reality has to respect all other reality.

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,000
If you come to inconsistencies, they have to be resolved.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,880
And so the idea of if there's anything valid in psychology, economics has to recognize

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,600
it and vice versa.

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,840
So I think the people that are working on this fringe between economics and psychology

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,640
are absolutely right to be there.

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,360
And I think there's been plenty wrong over the years.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,800
Well, let me romp through my as much of this list as I have time to get through 24 standard

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,400
causes of human misjudgment.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,560
First, under recognition of the power of what psychologists call reinforcement and economic

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,760
and economists call incentives.

33
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,520
Well, you say everybody knows that.

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,960
Well, I think I've been in the top five percent of my age cohort all my life and understanding

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,040
the power of incentives and all my life I underestimated it and never a year passes.

36
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,200
But what I get some surprise that pushes my limit a little farther.

37
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,080
So one of my favorite cases about the power of incentives is the Federal Express case

38
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,360
where heart and soul of the integrity of the system is that all the packages have to be

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,520
shifted rapidly in one central location each night.

40
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,480
And the system has no integrity if the whole shift can't be done fast.

41
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,280
And Federal Express had one hell of a time getting the thing to work.

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,560
And they tried moral suasion.

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
They tried everything in the world.

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,280
And finally, somebody got the happy thought that they were paying the night shift by the

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,600
hour and that maybe if they paid them by the shift, the system would work better.

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,880
And lo and behold, that solution worked.

47
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
Early in the history of Xerox, Joe Wilson, who was then in the government, had to go

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,680
back to Xerox because he couldn't understand how their better new machine was selling so

49
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,280
poorly in relation to their older and inferior machine.

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,400
Of course, when he got there, he found out that the commission arrangement with the salesman

51
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,440
gave a tremendous incentive to the inferior machine.

52
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,680
And here at Harvard in the shadow of B.F.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:09,560
There was a man who really was in the reinforcement as a powerful thought.

54
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,000
And you know, Skinner has lost his reputation in a lot of places.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,080
But if you were to analyze the entire history of experimental science at Harvard, he'd be

56
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,640
in the top handful.

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,240
His experiments were very ingenious.

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,800
The results were counterintuitive and they were important.

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,760
It is not given to experimental science to do better.

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,800
What gummed up Skinner's reputation is that he developed a case of what I always call

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,520
man with a hammer syndrome.

62
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,000
To the man with a hammer, every problem tends to look pretty much like a nail.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,400
And Skinner had one of the more extreme cases in the history of academia.

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
And this syndrome doesn't exempt right people.

65
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,600
It's just a man with a hammer and Skinner is an extreme example of that.

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,200
And later, as I get on my list, let's go back and try and figure out why people like Skinner

67
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,040
get man with a hammer syndrome.

68
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,880
Incidentally, when I was at the Harvard Law School, there was a professor naturally at

69
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:21,560
Yale who was derisively discussed at Harvard and they used to say, poor old Blanchard,

70
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,800
he thinks declaratory judgments will cure cancer.

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,280
And that's the way Skinner got.

72
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,080
And not only that, he was literary and he scorned opponents who had any different way

73
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,920
of thinking or thought anything else was important.

74
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,660
This is not a way to make a lasting reputation if the other people turn out to also be doing

75
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,120
something important.

76
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,840
My second factor is simple psychological denial.

77
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:53,360
This first really hit me between the eyes when a friend of our family had a super athlete

78
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,080
super student son who flew off a carrier in the North Atlantic and never came back.

79
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,600
And his mother, who was a very sane woman, just never believed that he was dead.

80
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,440
And of course, if you turn on the television, you find the mothers of the most obvious

81
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,600
premises man could ever diagnose and they all think their sons are innocent.

82
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Simple psychological denial.

83
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,520
The reality is too painful to bear, so you just distort it until it's bearable.

84
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,360
We all do that to some extent, and it's a common psychological misjudgment that causes

85
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,960
terrible problems.

86
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,640
Third, incentive-caused bias, both in one's own mind and that of one's trusted advisor,

87
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,440
where it creates what economists call agency costs.

88
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,880
Here my early experience was a doctor who sent bushel baskets full of normal gallbladders

89
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,000
down to the pathology lab in a leading hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska.

90
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,280
With that quality control, for which community hospitals are famous, about five years after

91
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,440
he should have been removed from the staff, he was.

92
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,000
And one of the old doctors who participated in the removal was also a family friend.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,880
And I asked him, I said, tell me, did he think here's a way for me to exercise my talents?

94
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,840
This guy was very skilled, technically, and make a high living by doing a few maimings

95
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,880
and murders every year, along with some frauds.

96
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,680
He said, hell no, Charlie.

97
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,240
He thought that the gallbladder was the source of all medical evil, and if you really loved

98
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,800
your patients, you couldn't get that organ out rapidly enough.

99
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:43,200
Now, that's an extreme case, but in lesser strength, it's present in every profession

100
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,800
and in every human being, and it causes perfectly terrible behavior.

101
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,400
If you take sales presentations of brokers of commercial real estate and businesses,

102
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm 70 years old.

103
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,400
I've never seen one, I thought was even within hailing distance of objective truth.

104
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:10,520
And you want to talk about the power of incentives and the power to rationalize terrible behavior.

105
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,400
After the Defense Department had had enough experience with cost plus percentage of cost

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:21,560
contracts, the reaction of our republic was to make it a crime for the federal government

107
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,680
to write one, and not only a crime, but a felony.

108
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,480
And by the way, the government's right, but a lot of the way the world is run, including

109
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,400
most law firms and a lot of other places, they've still got a cost plus percentage of

110
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,080
cost system, and human nature, with its version of what I call incentive-caused bias, causes

111
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
this terrible abuse.

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,080
And many of the people who are doing it, you would be glad to have Mary into your family

113
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,640
compared to what you're otherwise going to get.

114
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:01,680
Now, there are huge implications from the fact that human mind is put together this

115
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
way.

116
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,720
And the idea is that people who create things like cash registers, which make misbehavior

117
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,480
hard, are some of the effective saints of our civilization.

118
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,640
And the cash register was a great moral instrument when it was created.

119
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,800
And Patterson knew that, by the way.

120
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,080
He had a little store, and the people were stealing him blind and never made any money,

121
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,200
and people sold him a couple of cash registers, and it went to profit immediately.

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,160
And of course, he closed the store and went into the cash register business, with results

123
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,640
So this is a huge, important thing.

124
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,840
If you read the psychology text, you will find that if they're a thousand pages long,

125
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:51,520
there's one sentence, somehow incentive-caused bias has escaped the standard survey course

126
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
in psychology.

127
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:59,040
Fourth, and this is a superpower in error-causing psychological tendency, bias from consistency

128
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,080
and commitment tendency, including the tendency to avoid or promptly resolve cognitive dissonance,

129
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,880
is the self-confirmation tendency of all conclusions, particularly expressed conclusions

130
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,280
and with a special persistence for conclusions that are hard won.

131
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,160
But what I'm saying here is that the human mind is a lot like the human egg, and the

132
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,560
human egg has a shutoff device.

133
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,320
When the sperm gets in, it shuts down, so the next one can't get in.

134
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,280
The human mind has a big tendency of the same sort.

135
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,080
And here again, it doesn't just catch ordinary mortals, it catches the deans of physics.

136
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,800
According to Max Planck, the really innovative, important new physics was never really accepted

137
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,120
by the old guard.

138
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,080
Instead, a new guard came along that was less brain blocked by its previous conclusions.

139
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:52,600
And if Max Planck's crowd had this consistency and commitment tendency that kept their old

140
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,800
conclusions intact in spite of disconfirming evidence, you can imagine what the crowd that

141
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,400
you and I are part of behaves like.

142
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,800
And of course, if you make a public disclosure of your conclusion, you're pounding it in

143
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,240
to your own head.

144
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,800
Many of these students that are screaming at us, you know, they aren't convincing us,

145
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,720
but they're forming mental chains for themselves because what they're shouting out, they're

146
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
pounding in.

147
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,840
And I think educational institutions that create a climate where too much of that goes

148
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:29,920
on are, in a fundamental sense, they're irresponsible institutions.

149
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:37,740
It's very important to not put your brain in chains too young by what you shout out.

150
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,560
And all these things like painful qualifying and initiation rituals, all those things pound

151
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,640
in your commitments and your ideas.

152
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,580
The Chinese brainwashing system, which was for war prisoners, which was way better than

153
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:59,920
anybody else's, they maneuvered people into making tiny little commitments and declarations.

154
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,180
And then they'd slowly build.

155
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,640
That worked way better than torture.

156
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:11,920
Sixth, bias from Pavlovian association, misconstruing past correlation as a reliable basis for decision

157
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,160
making.

158
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,800
I never took a course in psychology or economics either, for that matter, but I did learn about

159
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,520
Pavlovian high school biology and the way they taught it.

160
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,480
So the dog salivated when the bell rang.

161
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,040
So what?

162
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,880
Nobody made the least effort to tie that to the wide world.

163
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:40,200
The truth of the matter is that Pavlovian association is an enormously powerful psychological

164
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,720
force in the daily life of all of us.

165
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,480
And indeed in economics, we wouldn't have money without the role of so-called secondary

166
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:57,600
reinforcement, which is a pure psychological phenomenon demonstrated in the laboratory.

167
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,280
Practically, I'd say three quarters of advertising works on pure Pavlov.

168
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,040
Think how association, pure association works.

169
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,360
Take Coca-Cola Company, we're the biggest shareholder.

170
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,160
They want to be associated with every wonderful image, heroics in the Olympics, wonderful

171
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,400
music, you name it.

172
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,600
They don't want to be associated with president's funerals and so forth.

173
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,560
When have you seen a Coca-Cola ad?

174
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,880
And the association really works.

175
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,920
And all these psychological tendencies work largely or entirely on a subconscious level,

176
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,640
which makes them very insidious.

177
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,480
Then you've got Persian messenger syndrome.

178
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,960
The Persians really did kill the messenger who brought the bad news.

179
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
You think that is dead?

180
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,560
I mean, you should have seen Bill Paley in his last 20 years.

181
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,840
He didn't hear one damn thing.

182
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,280
He didn't want to hear.

183
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:54,040
People knew that it was bad for the messenger to bring Bill Paley things he didn't want

184
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
to hear.

185
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,680
Well, that means that the leader gets in a cocoon of unreality and is a great big enterprise.

186
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,120
And boy, did he make some dumb decisions in the last 20 years.

187
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,840
And Persian messenger syndrome is alive and well.

188
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,320
When I saw some years ago, ARCO and Exxon arguing over a few hundred millions of ambiguity

189
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,840
in their North Slope treaties, before a Superior Court judge in Texas with armies of lawyers

190
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,280
and experts on each side, this is a Mad Hatter's Tea Party.

191
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,120
Two engineering style companies can't resolve some ambiguity without spending tens of millions

192
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,440
of dollars in some Texas Superior Court.

193
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,700
In my opinion, what happens is that nobody wants to bring the bad news to the executives

194
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
up the line.

195
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,200
That here's a few hundred million dollars you thought you had that you don't, and it's

196
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,920
much safer to act like the Persian messenger who goes away to hide rather than bring home

197
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,740
the news of the battle lost.

198
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,400
Talking about economics, you get a very interesting phenomenon that I've seen over and over again

199
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,680
in a long life.

200
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,640
You've got two products, suppose they're complex technical product.

201
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:19,320
Now you think under the laws of economics that if product A costs X, if product Y costs

202
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,280
X minus something, it will sell better than if it sells at X plus something.

203
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
But that's not so.

204
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,160
In many cases, when you raise the price of the alternative product, it'll get a larger

205
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,560
market share than it would when you make it lower than your competitor's product.

206
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,280
That's because the bell, a Pavlovian bell, ordinarily there's a correlation between price

207
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,360
and value.

208
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,400
You have an information inefficiency.

209
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,400
When you raise the price, the sales go up relative to your competitor.

210
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,720
That happens again and again and again.

211
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,120
It's a pure Pavlovian phenomenon.

212
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,360
You can say, well, the economists have figured this sort of thing out when they started talking

213
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,200
about information inefficiencies, but that was fairly late in economics that they found

214
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,920
such an obvious thing.

215
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,820
Of course, most of them don't ask what causes the information inefficiencies.

216
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,200
One of the things that causes it is pure old Pavlov and his dog.

217
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,800
Now you've got bias from Skinnerian Association, operant conditioning, where you give the dog

218
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:33,960
a reward and pound in the behavior that preceded the dogs getting the award.

219
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:41,240
Of course, Skinner was able to create superstitious pigeons by having rewards come by accident

220
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,880
with certain occurrences.

221
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,600
Of course, we all know people who are the human equivalents of superstitious pigeons.

222
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,920
That's a very powerful phenomenon.

223
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,360
Of course, operant conditioning really works.

224
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,280
The people in the center who think that operant conditioning is important are very much right.

225
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,600
It's just that Skinner overdid it a little.

226
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:15,880
Where you see in business just perfectly horrible results from psychologically rooted tendencies

227
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
is in accounting.

228
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,560
If you take Westinghouse, which blew what?

229
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:26,720
$2 or $3 billion pre-tax at least, loaning developers to build hotels and virtually 100%

230
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
loans.

231
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,320
Now you say any idiot knows that there's one thing you don't like, it's a developer, another

232
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
you don't like, it's a hotel.

233
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,840
To make 100% loans, the developer is going to build a hotel.

234
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,560
But this guy, he probably was an engineer or something and he didn't take psychology

235
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,040
anymore and I did.

236
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,400
He got out there in the hands of these slick salesmen operating under their version of

237
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,440
incentive cost bias or any damn way of getting Westinghouse to do what was considered normal

238
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,080
business and they just blew it.

239
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,880
That would never have been possible if the accounting system hadn't been such that for

240
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:09,280
the initial phase of every transaction, it showed wonderful financial results.

241
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,760
So people who have loose accounting standards are just inviting perfectly horrible behavior

242
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,160
in other people and it's a sin.

243
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
It's an absolute sin.

244
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,360
If you carried bushel baskets full of money through the ghetto and made it easy to steal,

245
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,560
that would be a considerable human sin because you'd be causing a lot of bad behavior and

246
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,480
the bad behavior would spread.

247
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,040
Similarly, an institution that gets sloppy accounting commits a real human sin and it's

248
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,320
also a dumb way to do business as Westinghouse is so wonderfully prude.

249
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,360
Oddly enough, nobody mentions, at least nobody I've seen, what happened with Joe Jets and

250
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
Kidder Peabody.

251
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,600
The truth of the matter is the accounting system was such that by punching a few buttons,

252
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,640
the Joe Jets of the world could show profits and profits that showed up and things that

253
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,040
resulted in rewards and esteem and every other thing that human be.

254
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,200
Well, the Joe Jets are always with us and they're not really to blame in my judgment

255
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,040
at least, but that bastard who created that foolish accounting system, who so far as I

256
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:24,680
know has not been played alive, ought to be.

257
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:31,480
Seventh, bias from reciprocation tendency, including the tendency of one in a role to

258
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,600
act as other persons expect.

259
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,160
Well here again, Sealdini does a magnificent job at this and you're all going to be given

260
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,680
a copy of Sealdini's book and if you have half as much sense as I think you do, you

261
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,280
will immediately order copies for all of your children and several of your friends.

262
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,760
You will never make a better investment.

263
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:01,240
It is so easy to be a patsy for what he calls the compliance practitioners of this life.

264
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,840
But at any rate, reciprocation tendency is a very, very powerful phenomenon and Sealdini

265
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:16,240
demonstrated this by running around the campus and he asked people to take juvenile delinquents

266
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:26,880
to the zoo and it was a campus and so one in six actually agreed to do it.

267
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,320
And after he'd accumulated the statistical output, he went around on the same campus

268
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,000
and he asked other people, he said, Jay, would you devote two afternoons a week to taking

269
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,800
juvenile delinquents somewhere and suffering greatly yourself to help them?

270
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,760
And there he got 100% of the people to say no.

271
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,080
But after he'd made the first request, he backed off a little and he said, well, would

272
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,720
you at least take them to the zoo one afternoon?

273
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,800
He raised the compliance rate from a third to a half.

274
00:20:53,800 --> 00:21:00,040
He got three times the success by just going through the little ask for a lot and back

275
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
off.

276
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,000
Now, the human mind on a subconscious level can be manipulated that way and you don't

277
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
know it.

278
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,200
I always use the phrase, you're like a one legged man in an ass kicking contest and you

279
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,320
are, I mean, you are really giving a lot of quarter to the external world that you you

280
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:30,400
can't afford to give and on this so-called role theory where you tend to act in the way

281
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,520
that other people expect.

282
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,160
That's reciprocation.

283
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,600
If you think about the way society is organized and a guy named Zimbardo had people at

284
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,400
Stanford divide into two pieces.

285
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,120
One were the guards and the other were the prisoners.

286
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,080
And they started acting out roles as people expected.

287
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,480
He had to stop the experiment after about five days.

288
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,080
He was getting into human misery and breakdown and pathological behavior.

289
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,040
I mean, it was it was it was awesome.

290
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,520
However, Zimbardo was greatly misinterpreted.

291
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,600
It's not just reciprocation, tendency and role theory that caused that.

292
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,640
It's consistency and commitment tendency.

293
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,040
Each person, as he acted as a guard or a prisoner, the action itself was pounding in.

294
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,560
The idea wherever you turn this consistency and commitment tendency is is affecting you.

295
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,840
In other words, what you think may change what you do, but perhaps even more important,

296
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,320
what you do will change what you think.

297
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,400
And you can say everybody knows that.

298
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,920
I want to tell you, I didn't know it well enough early enough.

299
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,160
Eight. Now, this is a lullabaloo, and Henry Kaufman wisely talked about this bias from

300
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,240
over influenced by social proof, that is the conclusions of others, particularly under

301
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,440
conditions of natural uncertainty and stress.

302
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,800
And here, one of the cases the psychologists use is Kitty Genovese, where all these people,

303
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,000
50, 60, 70 of them just sort of sat and did nothing while she was slowly murdered.

304
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,280
Now, one of the explanations is that everybody looked at everybody else and nobody else was

305
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,600
doing anything. And so there's automatic social proof that the right thing to do is nothing.

306
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,920
That's not a good enough explanation for Kitty Genovese in my judgment.

307
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
That's only part of it.

308
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,840
There are microeconomic ideas and gain loss ratios and so forth that also come into play.

309
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,320
I think time and time again, in reality, psychological notions and economic notions

310
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,560
interplay. And the man who doesn't understand both is a damn fool.

311
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,040
Big shot businessmen get into these waves of social proof.

312
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,880
You remember some years ago when one oil company bought a fertilizer company and every

313
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,200
other major oil company practically ran out and bought a fertilizer company.

314
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,360
And there was no more damn reason for all these oil companies to buy fertilizer companies.

315
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
But they didn't know exactly what to do.

316
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,480
And if Exxon was doing it, it was good enough for mobile or vice versa.

317
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,080
And of course, I think they're all gone now.

318
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,200
It was a total disaster.

319
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:08,000
Now, let's talk about efficient market theory, a wonderful economic doctrine that had a long

320
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,480
vogue in spite of the experience of Berkshire Hathaway.

321
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,720
In fact, one of the economists who won, he shared a Nobel Prize.

322
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,160
And as he looked at Berkshire Hathaway year after year, which people would throw in his

323
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,440
face as saying, maybe the market isn't quite as efficient as you think.

324
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,840
He said, well, it's a two sigma event.

325
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,640
And then he said we were a three sigma event.

326
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,080
And then he said we were a four sigma event.

327
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,480
And he finally got up to six segments.

328
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,280
Better to add a sigma than change the theory just because the evidence comes in differently.

329
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,000
And of course, when there's a share of a Nobel Prize winner, the money management himself,

330
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,240
he sank like a stone.

331
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:52,720
If you if you think about the doctrines I've talked about, namely one, the power of

332
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,520
reinforcement.

333
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,720
After all, you do something and the market goes up and you get paid and rewarded and

334
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,520
applauded and what have you getting a lot of reinforcement if you make a bet on a lot of

335
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,840
reinforcement, if you make a bet on a market and the market goes with you.

336
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,520
Also, there's social proof.

337
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,920
I mean, the the prices in the market are the ultimate form of social proof, reflecting

338
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,840
what other people think.

339
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,520
And so the combination is very powerful.

340
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:27,400
Why would you expect general market levels to always be totally efficient, say even in

341
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:34,680
1973, four at the pith or in 1972 or whatever it was when the nifty fifty were in their

342
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:40,200
heyday? If these psychological notions are correct, you would affect you would expect

343
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:51,400
some waves of irrationality, which which carry general levels to to to.

344
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,520
So they're inconsistent with with reason.

345
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,240
Nine, what made these economists love the efficient market theory is the math was

346
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,240
elegant. And after all, math is what they've learned to do.

347
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,120
The man with a hammer, every problem tends to look pretty much like a nail.

348
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,800
The alternative truth was a little messy and they'd forgotten the great economist Cain's,

349
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,760
whom I think said better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.

350
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,880
Nine bias from contrast caused distortions of sensation, perception and cognition.

351
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,280
Here, the great experiment that Sealdini does in his class, he takes three buckets of water,

352
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,800
one's hot, one's cold and one's room temperature.

353
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,240
He has the students stick his left hand in the hot water and his right hand in the cold

354
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,520
water. Then he has them remove the hands and put them both in the room temperature

355
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,280
bucket. And of course, with both hands in the same bucket of water, one seems hot and other seems

356
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,720
cold because the sensation apparatus of man is over influenced by contrast.

357
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,640
It has no absolute scale. It's got a contrast scale in it.

358
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,600
And it's a scale with quantum effects in it, too.

359
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,800
It takes a certain percentage change before it's noticed.

360
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,080
Maybe you've had a magician remove your watch.

361
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,320
I certainly have without your noticing it.

362
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:26,840
It's the same thing. He's taking advantage of your contrast type troubles in your sensory apparatus.

363
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,000
But here, the great truth is that cognition mimics sensation

364
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:36,520
and the cognition manipulators mimic the watch removing magician.

365
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,440
In other words, people are manipulating you all day long on this contrast phenomenon.

366
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,320
Cialdini cites the case of the real estate broker.

367
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,200
And you've got the room that's been transferred into your town.

368
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,320
And the first thing you do is you take the room out of the two of the most awful overpriced houses

369
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,440
you've ever seen. And then you take the room to some moderately overpriced house and then you

370
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,480
stick them. And it works pretty well, which is why the real estate salesmen do it.

371
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,040
And it's always going to work. And the accidents of life can do this to you and it can ruin your

372
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:20,200
life. In my generation, when women lived at home until they got married, I saw some perfectly

373
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,120
terrible marriages made by highly desirable women because they lived in terrible homes.

374
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,440
And I've seen some terrible second marriages which were made because there were slight

375
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:39,000
improvements over an even worse first marriage. And you think you're immune from these things and

376
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,320
you laugh and I want to tell you, you aren't. And my favorite analogy, I can't vouch for the

377
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,320
accuracy of. I have this worthless friend I like to play bridge with and he's a total intellectual

378
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,120
amateur that lives on inherited money. But he told me once something I really enjoyed hearing.

379
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:05,240
He said, Charlie, he says, if you throw a frog into very hot water, the frog will jump out.

380
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,720
But if you put the frog in room temperature water and just slowly heat the water up,

381
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,800
the frog will die there. Now, I don't know whether that's true about a frog,

382
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,160
but it sure as hell true about many of the businessmen I know. And there again,

383
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,680
it is the contrast phenomenon. These are hotshot high powered people. I mean, these are not

384
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:38,920
not fools. If it comes to you in small pieces, you're likely to miss. So you have to,

385
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,600
if you're going to be a person of good judgment, you have to do something about this warp in your

386
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:50,920
head where it's so misled by by mere contrast bias from over influenced by authority. Well,

387
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,560
here are the Milgram experiment as it's caused. I think there've been 1600 psychological papers

388
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,920
written about Milgram. And he had a person posing as an authority figure,

389
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,560
trick ordinary people into giving what they had every reason to expect was heavy torture by

390
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:15,720
electric shock to perfectly innocent fellow citizens. And the experiment has been he was

391
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:24,040
trying to show that why Hitler succeeded in a few other things. And, and so this really caught the

392
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:31,000
fancy of the world. They partly it's so politically correct. And, and, and

393
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:40,040
over influenced by authority as another very useful. You'll like this one. You got a pilot

394
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,720
and a co pilot. The pilot is the authority figure. They don't do this in airplanes,

395
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:52,120
but they've done it in simulators. They have the pilot do something where the co pilot who's

396
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,120
been trained in simulators a long time, he knows he's not to allow the plane to crash.

397
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,480
They have a pilot to do something where an idiot co pilot would know the plane was going to crash,

398
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,680
but the pilot's doing it and the co pilot is sitting there and the pilot is the authority figure

399
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:18,040
25% of the time the plane crashes. I mean, this is a very powerful psychological tendency.

400
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,200
It's not quite as powerful as some people think. And I'll get to that later. 11 bias from deprival

401
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,800
super reaction syndrome, including bias caused by present or threatened scarcity, including

402
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:35,000
threatened removal of something almost possessed, but never possessed. Here I took the monger dog,

403
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,000
lovely harmless dog. The one way, the only way to get that dog to bite you was to try and take

404
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,480
something out of its mouth after it was already there. And any of you who've tried to do tests

405
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,160
there and any of you who've tried to do takeaways and labor negotiations will know that the human

406
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:58,360
version of that dog is there in all of us. And I have a neighbor, a neighbor, a predecessor on a

407
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,680
little island where I have a house and his next door neighbor put a little pine tree on that was

408
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:09,240
about three feet high and it turned his 180 degree view of the harbor into 179 and three quarters.

409
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,000
Well, they had a blood feud like the Hatfields and McCoys and it went on and on and on.

410
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:22,680
I mean, people are really crazy about minor decrements down. And then if you act on them,

411
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,800
you get into reciprocation tendency because you don't just reciprocate affection, you reciprocate

412
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:36,200
animosity and the whole thing can escalate. And so huge insanities can come from just subconsciously

413
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,040
overweighing the importance of what you're losing or almost getting and not getting.

414
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,800
And the extreme business case here was New Coke.

415
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,280
Now, Coca-Cola has the most valuable trademark in the world.

416
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,520
We're the major shareholder. I mean, I think we understand that trademark.

417
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:59,480
Coke has armies of brilliant engineers, lawyers, psychologists, advertising executives, and so

418
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:06,840
forth. And they had a trademark on a flavor and they'd spent a better part of 100 years

419
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,400
getting people to believe that trademark had all these intangible values too.

420
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,920
And people associated it with a flavor. And so they were going to tell people not that it was

421
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,640
improved because you can't improve a flavor. If a flavor is a matter of taste, I mean,

422
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,040
you may improve a detergent or something, but telling you you're going to make a major change

423
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:35,000
in a flavor. I mean, so they got this huge depriveable super reaction syndrome. Pepsi was

424
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,360
within weeks of coming out with old Coke in a Pepsi bottle, which would have been

425
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:50,600
the biggest fiasco in modern times. Perfect, co-perfect insanity. And by the way,

426
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,000
both Goizuara and Kiyo are just wonderful about it. I mean, they just joke. I mean,

427
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,760
Kiyo always says, I must have been away on vacation. He participated in every single...

428
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,760
He's a wonderful guy. And by the way, Goizuara is a wonderful, smart guy, an engineer.

429
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,920
Smart people make these terrible boners. How can you not understand depriveable super reaction syndrome?

430
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,600
But people, I mean, people do not react symmetrically to loss and gain. Now, maybe

431
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:26,680
you have a great bridge player like Zekha, but that's a trained response. Ordinary people

432
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,760
subconsciously affected by their inborn tendencies.

433
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,760
Bias from envy jealousy. Well, envy jealousy made what? Two out of the ten commandments.

434
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,480
Those of you who have raised siblings, you know about, or tried to run a law firm or

435
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,720
investment bank or even a faculty. I've heard Warren say a half a dozen times,

436
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:55,480
it's not greed that drives the world, but envy. Here again, you go through the psychology survey

437
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:02,040
courses and you go to the index, envy, jealousy, thousand page book. It's blank.

438
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,600
There's some blind spots in academia, but it's an enormously powerful

439
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,680
thing and it operates to a considerable extent on a subconscious level.

440
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:24,360
And anybody who doesn't understand it is taking on defects he shouldn't have.

441
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,560
Bias from chemical dependency. Well, we don't have to talk about that. We've all seen so much

442
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:36,040
of it, but it's interesting how it always causes moral breakdown if there's any need

443
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:43,480
and always involves massive denial. See, it's just, it aggravates what we talked about earlier

444
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,640
in the aviator case, the tendency to distort reality so that it's endurable.

445
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:57,480
Bias from misgambling compulsion. Well, here Skinner made the only explanation you'll find in the

446
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,480
standard psychology survey course. He, of course, created a variable reinforcement

447
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,840
rate for his pigeons, his mice, and he found that that would pound in the behavior better

448
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,760
than any other enforcement pattern. And he says, aha, I've explained why gambling is such a powerful

449
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:23,160
addictive force in a civilization. I think that is to a very considerable extent true,

450
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,880
but being Skinner, he seemed to think that was the only explanation. But the truth of the matter is

451
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,080
that the divisors of these modern machines and techniques know a lot of things that Skinner didn't

452
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:41,320
know. For instance, a lottery. You have a lottery where you get your number by lot and then somebody

453
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:47,240
draws a number by lot. It gets lousy play. You get a lottery where people get to pick their number,

454
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,800
get big play. Again, it's this consistency and commitment thing. People think that if they

455
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,440
have committed to it, it has to be good. And the minute they've picked it themselves, it gets an

456
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:05,240
extra validity. After all, they thought it and they acted on it. And then you take slot machines,

457
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,640
you get bar, bar, lemon. That happens again and again and again. You get all these near misses.

458
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:19,960
Well, that's Deprival Super Reaction Central. And boy, do the people who create the machines

459
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:26,920
understand human psychology. And if you got to the high IQ crowd, they've got poker machines

460
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:33,160
where you make choices. So you can play blackjack, so to speak, with the machine.

461
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,240
It's wonderful what we've done with our computers to ruin a civilization.

462
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,040
But at any rate, misgambling compulsion is a very, very powerful and important thing. Look at what's

463
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,440
happening to our country. Every Indian has a reservation, every river town. And look at the

464
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,640
people who were ruined by it with the aid of their stockbrokers and others. And again, if you look in

465
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,760
the standard textbook of psychology, you'll find practically nothing on it except maybe one's

466
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:09,640
sentence talking about Skinner's rats. That is not an adequate coverage of the subject.

467
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,000
Bias from liking distortion, including the tendency to especially like oneself,

468
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,360
one's own kind and one's own idea structures, and the tendency to be especially susceptible

469
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:26,840
to being misled by someone like. Disliking distortion, bias from that. The reciprocal of

470
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,920
liking distortion and the tendency not to learn appropriately from someone disliked.

471
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,840
Well, here again, we've got hugely powerful tendencies. And if you look at the wars

472
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,360
in part of the Harvard Law School, as we say here, you can see the very brilliant people get into

473
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:50,520
this almost pathological behavior. And these are very, very powerful, basic, subconscious,

474
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,200
psychological tendencies, or at least partly subconscious. Now let's get back to B.F. Skinner,

475
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:04,040
man with a hammer syndrome revisited. Why is man with the hammer syndrome always present?

476
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,280
Well, he stopped to think about it. He's had caused bias. His professional reputation is all

477
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:19,000
tied up with what he knows. He likes himself and he likes his own ideas. And he's expressed them to

478
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,200
other people, consistency and commitment tendency. I mean, you have four or five of these elementary

479
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,880
psychological tendencies combining to create this man with a hammer syndrome.

480
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:40,840
Once you realize that you can't really buy your thinking done,

481
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,920
partly you can, but largely you can't in this world, you've learned a lesson that's very useful

482
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,400
in life. George Leonard Shaw said and had a character say in The Doctor's Dilemma,

483
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,080
in the last analysis, every profession is a conspiracy against the laity. But he didn't

484
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,680
have it quite right because he's not so much conspiracy as it is a subconscious psychological

485
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:12,120
tendency. The guy tells you what is good for him. He doesn't recognize that he's doing anything

486
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,720
wrong any more than that doctor did when he was pulling out all those normal gall waters.

487
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,520
And he believes that his own idea structures will cure cancer. And he believes that

488
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,560
the demons that he's the guardian against are the biggest demons and the most important ones. And

489
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,360
in fact, they may be very small demons compared to the demons that you face. So you're getting

490
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,560
your advice in this world from your paid advisor with this huge load of ghastly bias.

491
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:50,520
And woe to you. There are only two ways to handle it. You can hire your advisor and then just apply

492
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,800
a windage factor like I used to do when I was a rifle shooter. I just adjust for so many miles

493
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:04,520
an hour of wind. Or you can learn the basic elements of your advisor's trade. You don't

494
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,200
have to learn very much, by the way, because you learn just a little and then you can make him

495
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:19,800
explain why he's right. And those two tendencies will take part of the warp of the thinking you've

496
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,720
tried to hire done. By and large, it works terribly. I have never seen a management consults

497
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:30,200
report in my long life that didn't end with the following paragraph. What this situation really

498
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,520
needs is more management consulting. Never once. I always turn to the last page.

499
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:44,680
Of course, Mercher Hathaway doesn't hire them, so I only do this on sort of a voyeuristic basis.

500
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,040
Sometimes I'm in a non-profit where some idiot hires one.

501
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,920
17.

502
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,760
Bias from the non-mathematical nature of the human brain in its natural state

503
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,720
as it deals with probabilities employing crude heuristics and is often misled by

504
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,080
mere contrast, a tendency to overweigh conveniently available information

505
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,120
and other psychologically rooted misthinking tendencies on this list. When the brain should

506
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,720
be using the sample probability mathematics of Fermat and Pascal applied to all reasonably

507
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,520
obtainable and correctly weighted items of information that are of value in predicting

508
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,440
outcomes, the right way to think is the way Zach Houser plays bridge. It's just that simple.

509
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,040
And your brain doesn't naturally know how to think the way Zach Houser knows how to play bridge.

510
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,960
Now, you notice I put in that availability thing and there I'm mimicking some very

511
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,960
eminent psychologists on the like, I hope I pronounced that right, and diversity,

512
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,720
who raised the idea of availability to a whole heuristic of misjudgment.

513
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,800
And, you know, they are very substantially right. I mean, ask the Coca-Cola Company,

514
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,040
which has raised availability to a secular religion, if availability changes behavior.

515
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,800
You will drink a hell of a lot more Coke if it's always available.

516
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,360
I mean, availability does change behavior and cognition.

517
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,120
Nonetheless, even though I recognize that and applaud diversity in common,

518
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,160
I don't like it for my personal system, except as part of a greater subsystem,

519
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,320
which is, you got to think the way Zach Houser plays the bridge. It isn't just the lack of

520
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:42,120
availability that distorts your judgment. All the things on this list distort judgment.

521
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,960
And I want to train myself to kind of mentally run down the list instead of just jumping on

522
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:54,920
availability. So that's why I stated the way I do. In a sense, these psychological tendencies

523
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,600
make things unavailable. Because if you quickly jump to one thing and then because you've jumped

524
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:07,640
to it, the consistency and commitment tendency makes you lock in. Boom, that's error number one.

525
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,560
Or if something is very vivid, which I'm going to come to next, that will really pound in.

526
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:22,600
And the reason that the thing that really matters is now unavailable and what's extra vivid wins is,

527
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:33,080
I mean, the extra vividness creates the unavailability. So I think it's much better

528
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:39,080
to have a whole list of things that cause you to be less like Zach Houser than it is just to jump

529
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:50,440
on one factor. Here, I think we should discuss John Gutfrid. This is a very interesting human

530
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,320
example which will be taught in every decent professional school for at least a full generation.

531
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:07,240
Gutfrid has a trusted employee and it comes to light, not through confession but

532
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,960
by accident, that the trusted employee is lied like hell to the government and manipulated the

533
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:23,640
accounting system and it was really equivalent to forgery. And the man immediately says,

534
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,800
I've never done it before, I'll never do it again. It was an isolated example. And of course,

535
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:35,560
it was obvious that he was trying to help the government as well as himself because he thought

536
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:41,640
the government had been dumb enough to pass a rule that he'd spoken against. And after all,

537
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,840
if the government's not going to pay attention to a bond trader at Solomon, what kind of a

538
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:52,680
government is it going to be? But at any rate, and this guy has been part of a little clique

539
00:45:52,680 --> 00:46:01,320
that has made, well, way over a billion dollars for Solomon in the very recent past

540
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,520
and it's a little handful of people. And so there are a lot of psychological forces

541
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:14,600
at work and you know the guy's wife and he's right in front of you and there's human sympathy and he's

542
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:22,120
sort of asking for your help, which is a form which encourages reciprocation and there are

543
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,520
all these psychological tendencies that are working. Plus the fact he's part of a group

544
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:34,920
that'll pay a lot of money for it. At any rate, Good Friend does not cashier the man.

545
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:43,080
And of course, he had done it before and he did do it again. Well, now you look as though

546
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:50,040
you almost wanted him to do it again. Or God knows what you look like, but it isn't good.

547
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:59,400
And that simple decision destroyed John Good Friend. And it's so easy to do. Now let's think

548
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:08,520
it through like the Bridge Flare, like Zekhauser. You find an isolated example of a little old lady

549
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,440
in the Seas Candy Company, one of our subsidiaries, getting into the till. And what does she say?

550
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,080
I never did it before. I'll never do it again. This is going to ruin my life. Please help me.

551
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,480
And you know her children and her friends and she's been around 30 years and standing behind

552
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:30,440
the candy counter with swollen ankles. And you're an old lady, isn't that glorious a life?

553
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,800
And you're rich and powerful and there she is. I never did it before. I'll never do it again.

554
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,680
Well, how likely is it that she never did it before? If you're going to catch

555
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:49,160
10 embezzlements a year, what are the chances that any one of them, applying what Tversky and

556
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,600
Kahneman call baseline information, will be somebody who only did it this once?

557
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,280
And the people who have done it before and are going to do it again, what are they all going to

558
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:07,320
say? Well, in the history of the Seas Candy Company, they always say, I never did it before.

559
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:14,440
I'm never going to do it again. And we cashier them. It would be evil not to

560
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,960
do. Because terribly behavior spreads. Remember, what was it, Serbco?

561
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,120
I mean, you let that stuff, you got social proof, you got

562
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,480
incentive-caused bias, you got a whole lot of psychological factors

563
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,000
that will cause the evil behavior to spread. And pretty soon the whole damn,

564
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,320
your place is rotten, the civilization is rotten. It's not the right way to behave. And

565
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:47,320
I will admit that I have, when I knew the wife and children, I have paid severance pay when I fire

566
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:55,000
somebody for taking a mistress on an extended foreign trip. It's not the adultery, I find,

567
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:05,400
it's the embezzlement. But there, I wouldn't do it where a good friend did it, where they've been

568
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,360
cheating somebody else on my behalf. There, I think you have to cashier. But if they're

569
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,240
just stealing from you and you get rid of them, I don't think you need the last ounce of vengeance.

570
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,560
But I don't think you need any vengeance. I don't think vengeance is much good.

571
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:31,000
Now we come bias from over-influence by extra evidence. Here's one, I'm at least $30 million

572
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,560
poorer as I sit here giving this little talk because I once bought 300 shares of a stock

573
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:42,360
and the guy called me back and said, I've got 1500 more. I said, will you hold it for 15 minutes

574
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:49,320
while I think about it? The CEO of this company, I have seen a lot of vivid peculiarities in a long

575
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:57,080
life, but this guy set a world record. I'm talking about the CEO and I just misweighed it. But two of

576
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:02,520
the matters, his situation was foolproof, he was soon going to be dead. I turned down the extra

577
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:09,640
1500 shares and that's now cost me $30 million and that's life in the big city. It wasn't something

578
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:17,000
where stock was generally available. So it's very easy to misweigh the vivid evidence and a good

579
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,920
friend did that when he looked into the man's eyes and forgave the colleague.

580
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,600
And 22, stress-induced mental changes, small and large, temporary and permanent.

581
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:41,080
Oh no, no, no, I've skipped one. Mental confusion caused by information not arrayed in the mind in

582
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:46,760
theory structures creating sound generalizations developed in response to the question why. Also

583
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,800
misinfluence from information that apparently but not really answers the question why. Also

584
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,320
failure to obtain deserved influence caused by not properly explaining why. But we all know people

585
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,440
who flunk and they try and memorize and they try and spout back and they just doesn't work. The

586
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,360
brain doesn't work that way. You've got to array facts on theory structures answering the question

587
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:15,400
why. If you don't do that, you just, you cannot handle the world. And now we get to Forstein,

588
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,360
who was the general counsel of Salomon when Goodfriend made his big error and Forstein knew

589
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:26,200
better. He told Goodfriend, you have to report this as a matter of morality and prudent business

590
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,840
judgment. He said, it's probably not illegal. There's probably no legal duty to do it, but you

591
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:36,120
have to do it as a matter of prudent conduct and proper dealing with your main customer.

592
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:42,840
And he said that to Goodfriend on at least two or three occasions and he stopped. And of course,

593
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:48,040
the persuasion failed. And when Goodfriend went down, Forstein went with him and ruined

594
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:54,520
a considerable part of Forstein's life. Well, Forstein was a member of the Harvard Law Review,

595
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:01,480
made an elementary psychological mistake. You want to persuade somebody, you really tell them why.

596
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,680
And what did we learn in lesson one? Insanities really matter.

597
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,960
He should have told Goodfriend, you are likely to ruin your life and disgrace your family and lose

598
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:24,440
your money. And is Mosher worth this? I know both men, that would have worked. So Forstein flunked

599
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:31,640
elementary psychology, this very sophisticated, brilliant lawyer. Don't you do that. It's not

600
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:41,720
very hard to do, you know, just do. Remember that why is terribly important. Other normal

601
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,720
limitations of sensation, memory, cognition and knowledge. Well, I don't have time for that.

602
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:53,720
Stress induced mental changes. Here, my favorite example is, is the great Pavlov and the LA's dogs

603
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,080
and cages, which had all been conditioned into change behavior. And he said, well,

604
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:01,240
the great Pavlov and the LA's dogs and cages, which had all been conditioned into change

605
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:07,160
behaviors. And the great Leningrad flood came and the just went right up and the dogs in a cage.

606
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:14,440
And the dog was had as much stress as you can imagine a dog ever having. And the water receded

607
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,480
in time to save some of the dogs. And Pavlov noted that they'd had a total reversal of their

608
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:25,880
conditioned personality. Being a great scientist, he was he spent the rest of his life giving

609
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:33,480
nervous breakdowns to dogs. And he learned a hell of a lot that I regarded. It's very interesting.

610
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,080
I have never known any Freudian analysts to do anything about the last work of Pavlov. And I

611
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:45,240
never met a lawyer who understood that what Pavlov found out with those dogs had anything to do with

612
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,880
programming and deprogramming and cults and so forth. I mean, the amount of elementary

613
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:55,960
psychological ignorance is out there in high levels is very significant. Then we've got other

614
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,960
common mental illnesses and declines temporary and permanent, including the tendency to lose

615
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:05,080
ability through disuse. And I've got mental and organizational confusion from say something

616
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:10,680
syndrome. And here my favorite thing is the honeybee. And honeybee goes out and finds the

617
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,320
nectar and he comes back. He does a dance that communicates to the other bees where the nectar

618
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,480
is and they go out and get it. Well, some scientists who was clever like B.F. Skinner

619
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:28,520
decided to do an experiment. He put the nectar straight up, way up. Well, in a natural setting,

620
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:33,560
there is no nectar way the hell straight up. And the poor honeybee doesn't have a genetic program

621
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,520
that is adequate to handle what he now has to communicate. And you'd think the honeybee would

622
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:44,360
come back to the hive and slink into a corner, but he doesn't. He comes into the hive and does

623
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,720
this incoherent dance. And all my life I've been dealing with the human equivalent of that honeybee.

624
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:58,360
And it's a very important part of human organization to set things up so the noise

625
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:03,640
and the reciprocation and so forth of all these people who have what I call say something syndrome

626
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:14,440
don't really affect the decisions. Now, the time has come to ask two or three questions.

627
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,360
This is the most important question in this whole talk. What happens when these standard

628
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:25,960
psychological tendencies combine? What happens when the situation or the artful manipulation of

629
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,240
man causes several of these tendencies to operate on a person toward the same end at the same time?

630
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:37,400
The clear answer is the combination greatly increases power to change behavior compared

631
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,840
to the power of merely one tendency acting alone. Examples are Tupperware parties.

632
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,480
Tupperware has now made billions of dollars out of a few manipulative psychological tricks.

633
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,080
It was so schlock that directors of Justin Dart's company resigned when he crammed it down his

634
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,080
board's throat. And he was totally right, by the way, judged by economic outcomes.

635
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:05,000
Mooney conversion methods. Boy, do they work. He just combines four or five of these things together.

636
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:12,520
The system of Alcoholics Anonymous, a 50% no drinking rate outcome when everything else fails.

637
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:17,320
It's a very clever system that uses four or five psychological systems at once toward,

638
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,520
I might say, a very good end. The Milgram experiment. See, Milgram, it's been widely

639
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:28,360
interpreted as mere obedience. But the truth of the matter is that the experimenter who got

640
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:35,160
the students to give the heavy shocks in Milgram, he explained why was a false explanation. We need

641
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:39,960
this to look for scientific truth and so on. That greatly changed the behavior of the people.

642
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:45,400
And number two, he worked them up. Tiny shock, little larger, little larger. So commitment

643
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:51,800
and consistency tendency and the contrast principle were both working in favor of this

644
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:57,160
behavior. So again, it's four different psychological tendencies. That's when you

645
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,880
get these Lollapalooza effects. You will almost always find four or five of these things working

646
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,920
together. When I was young, there was a whodunit hero who always said, share sale a family.

647
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,760
What you should search for in life is the combination. The combination is likely to do you

648
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,240
in. Or if you're the inventor of Tupperware parties, it's likely to make you enormously rich

649
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:26,280
if you can stand shaving when you do it. Then one of my favorite cases is the McDonald Douglas

650
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:33,800
airliner evacuation disaster. The government requires that airliners pass a bunch of tests,

651
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,880
one of them is evacuation. Get everybody out, I think 90 seconds or something like that. It's

652
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,600
some short period of time. The government has rules, make it very realistic, so on and so on.

653
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:49,400
You can't select nothing but 20-year-old athletes to evacuate your airliner. So

654
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,080
McDonald Douglas schedules one of these things on a hanger and they make the hanger dark

655
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,720
and the concrete floor is 25 feet down and they got these little rubber shoots and they got all

656
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:05,640
these old people and they ring the bell and they all rush out and in the morning when the first

657
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,560
test is done, they create, I don't know, 20 terrible injuries before they go off to hospitals.

658
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,440
Of course, they scheduled another one for the afternoon.

659
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,880
By the way, they didn't meet the time schedule either in addition to causing all the injuries.

660
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:26,200
Well, so what do they do? They do it again in the afternoon. Now they create 20 more injuries

661
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:32,040
and one case of a severed spinal column with permanent unfixable paralysis. These are engineers,

662
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,120
these are brilliant people, this is thought over through in a big bureaucracy. Again,

663
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,040
it's a combination of attendance. Authorities told you to do it. They told you to make it

664
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:48,840
realistic. You've decided to do it. You've decided to do it twice. Incentive cost bias.

665
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,160
If you pass, you save a lot of money. You've got to jump this hurdle before you can sell your new

666
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:57,800
airliner. Again, three, four, five of these things work together and it turns human brains into mush

667
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,840
and maybe you think this doesn't happen in picking investments.

668
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:07,960
If so, you're living in a different world than I am. Finally, the open outcry auction.

669
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,360
The open outcry auction is just made to turn the brain into mush.

670
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,240
You get social proof, the other guy is bidding, you get reciprocation tendency,

671
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,360
you get deprival super reaction syndrome, the thing is going away. I mean, it's just absolutely

672
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:31,960
designed to manipulate people into idiotic behavior. Finally, the institution of the

673
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,400
board of directors of the major human American company. Well, the top guy is sitting there,

674
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:43,000
he's an authority figure. He's doing asinine things. You look around the board,

675
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,520
nobody else is objecting social proof. It's okay. Reciprocation tendency. He's raising the

676
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,440
director's fees every year. He's flying you around in the corporate airplane to look at

677
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:59,560
interesting plants or whatever in hell they do and you go and you really get extreme dysfunction

678
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:07,320
as a corrective decision-making body in the typical American board of directors. They only act,

679
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,240
again, the power of incentives. They only act when it gets so bad that it starts reflecting,

680
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,640
making them look foolish or threatening legal liability to them. That's Munger's rule.

681
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:27,160
I mean, they're occasional things that don't follow Munger's rule, but by and large,

682
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,640
the board of directors is a very ineffective corrector if the top guy is a little nuts,

683
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:37,080
which of course frequently happens. The second question, isn't this list of standard psychological

684
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:41,720
tendencies improperly tautological compared with a system with Euclid? That is, aren't there

685
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:46,360
overlaps and can't some items on the list be derived from combinations of other items?

686
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,960
The answer to that is plainly yes. Three, what good is in the practical world is the thought

687
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,280
system indicated by the list? Isn't practical benefit prevented because these psychological

688
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:01,800
tendencies are programmed into the human mind by broad evolution, so we can't get rid of broad

689
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:07,080
evolution. I mean, the combination of genetic and cultural evolution, but mostly genetic.

690
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:13,000
Well, the answer is the tendencies are partly good and indeed probably much more good than bad,

691
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,200
otherwise they wouldn't be there. By and large, these rules have worked pretty well for man given

692
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:23,880
his limited mental capacity and that's why they were programmed in by broad evolution.

693
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:30,440
At any rate, they can't be simply washed out automatically and they shouldn't be. Nonetheless,

694
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:36,200
the psychological thought system described is very useful in spreading wisdom and good conduct

695
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,600
and when one understands it and uses it constructively. Here's some examples.

696
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:46,440
Carl Braun's communication practices. He designed oil refineries with spectacular skill and integrity.

697
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:54,440
He had a very simple rule. Remember I said why is important? You got fired in the Braun company.

698
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:59,080
You had to have five doubles. You had to tell who, what you wanted to do, where and when,

699
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,720
and you had to tell him why. If you wrote a communication and left out the why, you got fired

700
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,520
because Braun knew it's complicated building an oil refiner and it can blow up. All kinds of things

701
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:13,640
can blow up. All kinds of things happen. He knew that his communication system worked better

702
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:19,960
if you always told him why. That's a simple discipline and boy does it work. Two, the use

703
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:27,080
of simulators in pilot training. Here again, abilities attenuate with disuse. The simulator

704
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:32,280
is God's gift because you can keep them fresh. The system of alcoholics anonymous. That's certainly

705
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,120
a constructive use of somebody understanding psychological tendencies. I think they just

706
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:41,400
blundered into it as a matter of fact. So you can regard it as kind of an evolutionary outcome,

707
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,040
but just because they blundered into it doesn't mean you can't invent its equivalent when you

708
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:52,920
need it for a good purpose. Clinical training in medical schools. Here's a profoundly correct way

709
01:02:52,920 --> 01:03:00,200
of understanding psychology. The standard practice is watch one, do one, teach one.

710
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:07,000
Boy, does that pound in what you want pounded in. Again, the consistency and commitment tendency

711
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,680
and that is a profoundly correct way to teach clinical medicine. The rules of the U.S.

712
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:21,800
Constitutional Convention. Totally secret, no vote until the final vote, then just one vote on the

713
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:27,640
whole constitution. Very clever psychological rules and if they had a different procedure,

714
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:34,120
everybody would have been pushed into a corner by his own pronouncements and his own oratory

715
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:39,240
and his own and no recorded votes until the last one and they got it through by a whisker

716
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:44,520
with those wise rules. They wouldn't have had the constitution if our forefathers hadn't been so

717
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:53,160
psychologically acute and look at the crowd we've got now. Six, the use of granny's rule.

718
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,680
I love this. One of the psychologists who works with the Senate gets paid a fortune running around

719
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:04,760
America and he teaches executives to manipulate themselves. Now granny's rule is you don't get

720
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,160
the ice cream unless you eat your carrots. Well granny was a very wise woman. That is a very good

721
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:15,320
system and so this guy, very eminent psychologist, he runs around the country telling executives

722
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:20,360
to organize their day so they force themselves to do what's unpleasant and important

723
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:26,760
by doing that first and then rewarding themselves with something they really like doing. He is

724
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,280
profoundly correct. Seven, the Harvard Business School's emphasis on decision trees. When I was

725
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:37,480
young and foolish, I used to laugh at the Harvard Business School. I said they're teaching 28 year

726
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:42,280
old people that high school algebra works in real life. We're talking about elementary probability.

727
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:48,360
But later I wised up and I realized that it was very important and they do that and better late

728
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:54,440
than never. Eight, the use of postmortems at Johnson & Johnson. At most corporations if you

729
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:59,000
make an acquisition and it works out to be a disaster, all the paperwork and presentations

730
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:05,240
that cause the dumb acquisition to be made are quickly forgotten. You got denial, you got

731
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:09,000
everything in the world. You got Pavlovian association tenants and nobody wants to be

732
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,840
associated with the damn thing or even mention it. Johnson & Johnson, they make everybody revisit

733
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:21,880
their old acquisitions and wade through the presentations. That is a very smart thing to do

734
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:28,280
and by the way, I do the same thing routinely. Nine, the great example of Charles Darwin is he

735
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:34,920
avoided confirmation bias. Darwin probably changed my life because I'm a biography nut.

736
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:42,280
Darwin probably changed my life because I'm a biography nut. When I found out the way he

737
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:47,000
always paid extra attention to the disconfirming evidence and all these little psychological

738
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,560
tricks, I also found out that he wasn't very smart by the standards, the ordinary standards

739
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:56,200
of human acuity, yet there he is buried in Westminster Abbey. That's not where I'm going,

740
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:02,840
I'll tell you. I said my God, here's a guy that by all objective evidence is not nearly as smart

741
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:08,200
as I am and he's in Westminster Abbey. He must have tricks I should learn and I started wearing

742
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:14,280
little hair shirts like Darwin to try and train myself out of these subconscious psychological

743
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,600
tendencies that cause so many errors. It didn't work perfectly as you can tell from listening to

744
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:27,400
this talk but it would have been even worse if I hadn't done what I did and you can know these

745
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,880
psychological tendencies and avoid being the patsy of all the people that are trying to manipulate

746
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,920
you to your disadvantage like Sam Walton. Sam Walton will let a purchasing agent take a

747
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:43,480
handkerchief from a salesman. He knows how powerful the subconscious reciprocation tendency is.

748
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:49,240
That is a profoundly correct way for Sam Walton to behave. Then there's the Warren-Buffett rule

749
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:57,320
for open outcry auctions. Don't go. We don't go to the closed bid auctions too because they,

750
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,280
that's a counterproductive way to do things ordinarily for a different reason

751
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:08,280
which Zechauser would understand. Four, what special knowledge problems lie buried in the

752
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:14,200
thought system indicated by the list? Well one is paradox. Now we're talking about a type of

753
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:19,560
human wisdom that the more people learn about it the more attenuated the wisdom gets.

754
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:26,680
That's an intrinsically paradoxical kind of wisdom but we have paradox in mathematics and

755
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:31,080
we don't give up mathematics. I say damn the paradox. This stuff is wonderfully useful

756
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:37,560
and by the way the granny's rule when you apply it to yourself is sort of a paradox in a paradox.

757
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:43,880
The manipulation still works even though you know you're doing it and I've seen that done

758
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,640
by one person to another. I drew this beautiful woman as my dinner partner

759
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:53,400
a few years ago and I'd never seen her before. Well she's married to a prominent Angelino and

760
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,520
she sat down next to me and she turned her beautiful face up and she said

761
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:05,240
Charlie she said what one word accounts for your remarkable success in life. Now I knew I was being

762
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:13,640
manipulated and that she'd done this before and I just loved it. I never see this woman without a

763
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:19,320
little lift in my spirits and by the way I told her I was rational.

764
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:31,640
You'll have to judge yourself whether that's true. I may be demonstrating some psychological

765
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:37,480
tendency I hadn't planned on demonstrating. How should the best parts of psychology and economics

766
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:43,640
interrelate in an enlightened economist's mind? Two views. That's the thermodynamics model.

767
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:51,560
You know you can't derive thermodynamics from Newtonian gravity and laws of mechanics

768
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:56,440
even though it's a lot of little particles interacting. Here's this wonderful truth that

769
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:02,440
you can sort of develop on your own which is thermodynamics and some economists and I think

770
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:07,240
Milton Friedman is in this group but I may be wrong on that sort of like the thermodynamics model.

771
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,960
I think Milton Friedman who has a Nobel Prize is probably a little wrong on that.

772
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:20,120
I think the thermodynamics analogy is over strained. I think knowledge from these different

773
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:27,240
soft sciences have to be reconciled to eliminate conflict. After all there's

774
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:33,960
nothing in thermodynamics that's inconsistent with Newtonian mechanics and gravity and I think that

775
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:40,360
some of these economic theories are not totally consistent with other knowledge and they have

776
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:45,320
to be bent and I think that these behavioral economics or economists are probably the ones

777
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:50,440
that are bending them in a correct direction. Now my prediction is when the economists take a

778
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:56,120
little psychology into account that the reconciliation will be quite endurable and here my model is the

779
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:02,520
procession of the equinoxes. The world would be simpler for a long-term climatologist if the

780
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:09,480
angle of the axis of the earth's rotation compared to the plane of the eucliptic were absolutely

781
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:15,480
fixed but it isn't fixed. Over every 40,000 years or so there's this little wobble

782
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:24,280
and that has pronounced long-term effects. Well in many cases what psychology is going to add is

783
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:31,560
just a little wobble and it will be endurable. Here I quote another hero of mine who of course

784
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:37,400
is Einstein where he said the Lord is subtle but not malicious and I don't think it's going to be

785
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:46,520
that hard to bend economics a little to accommodate what's right in psychology. The

786
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:51,880
final question is if the thought system indicated by this list of psychological tendencies has great

787
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:58,040
value not widely recognized and employed what should the educational system do about it? I am

788
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:06,120
not going to answer that one now. I like leaving a little mystery. Have I used up all the time so

789
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:27,560
there's no time for questions? By the way the dean of the Stanford Law School is here today

790
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:33,240
Paul Bress and he is trying to create a course at the Stanford Law School that tries to work

791
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:40,920
stuff similar to this into worldly wisdom for lawyers which I regard as a profoundly good idea

792
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,280
and he wrote an article about it and you'll be given a copy along with Sealdini's book. Questions?

793
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:58,120
Yes, I presumed I would be one curious man

794
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,920
and I haven't. I'll put it over there on the table but don't take more than one because I

795
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,880
didn't anticipate such a big crowd and if we run short I'm sure the center is up to making

796
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:13,720
other copies and

797
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:36,040
you told us how you would have dealt with one of these issues for example with the

798
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:42,200
unfortunate lady from seas but you didn't tell us how these tendencies affected you and what's

799
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,040
probably the most important one of the most important elements of your success which was

800
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:51,960
deciding where to invest your money and I'm wondering if you might relate some of these

801
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:58,360
principles to some of your past decisions that way. Well of course an investment decision

802
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:05,400
in the common stock of a company frequently involves a whole lot of factors interacting

803
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:14,600
usually of course there's one big simple model and a lot of those models are

804
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:19,320
are microeconomic and I have a little list of it wouldn't be nearly 24

805
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:24,120
of those but I don't have time for for that one and I

806
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:29,080
I don't have too much interest in teaching other people how to get rich

807
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,720
my personal and that isn't because I fear the competition

808
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,000
or anything like that Warren has always been very open about

809
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:47,480
about what he's learned and I share that ethos my personal behavior model is Lord Keynes

810
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:53,480
I wanted to get rich so I could be independent and so I could do other things like give talks on the

811
01:13:53,480 --> 01:14:00,920
intersection of psychology and economics I didn't want to turn it into a total obsession yeah

812
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:13,800
I would say the one thing that causes the most trouble is when you combine a bunch of these

813
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:19,400
together you get this Lollapalooza effect and if you again if you read the psychology textbooks

814
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:24,920
they don't discuss how these things combine at least not very much do they multiply do they add

815
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:29,720
what how does it work I think would be just an automatic subject for for research but it doesn't

816
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:35,400
seem to turn the psychology establishment on I think this is a like this is a man for Mars

817
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:40,440
approach to psychology I just reached in and took what I thought I had to have

818
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:48,120
that is a different set of incentives from rising in an economic establishment where the rewards

819
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:54,360
where the reward system again the reinforcement comes from being a truffle hound that's what

820
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:59,400
Jacob Viner the great economist called it the truffle hound an animal so bred and trained for

821
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:03,720
one narrow purpose that he wasn't much good at anything else and that is the reward system

822
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:08,200
in a lot of academic departments it is not necessarily pretty good it may be fine if you

823
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:12,520
want new drugs or something you want people stunted in a lot of different directions so

824
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:17,000
they can grow in one narrow direction but I don't think it's good teaching psychology to

825
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,640
them the masses in fact I think it's terrible
