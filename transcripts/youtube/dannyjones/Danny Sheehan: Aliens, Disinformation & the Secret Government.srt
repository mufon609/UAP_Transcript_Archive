1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,120
The first time I learned about you was when I was watching a John Mack documentary.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,120
Oh, far out.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,120
Yeah.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,920
And you were talking about John and he had a lot of interesting things to say and I thought

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,520
that you would be a fascinating person to talk to.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,960
So I'm glad you're finally here.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,400
Yeah, I've gotten only more fascinating since then.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,640
Lou Elizondo retained me and then we get to do the help with the legislation and things

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,760
are really hot right now.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,400
Things are very hot right now and you're being very outspoken.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,520
Why have you all of a sudden decided to start doing podcasts?

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,200
Well, because once we got the attention of Congress, you know, the Congress pays attention

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,760
to people around the country when they start knowing about stuff.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,680
And so our people now, what we've put together, the New Paradigm Institute to actually mobilize

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,080
people to educate people, to get them past the supposition that, well, somebody says

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,520
they're there, you can't really tell, they don't ever have any real pictures of them.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,640
You know, they got buzzed over the December 2017 videos, you know, that Lou Elizondo and

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,760
Chris Mellon brought to the New York Times and they're going, whoa, okay, then they've

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,800
seen those a hundred times, you know, but the fact is there's a lot more, a lot more

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,720
information in firsthand witnesses that are extraordinarily credible, there are deep insiders

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,240
that have been coming to the Senate Intelligence Committee now and testifying under oath, you

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,080
know, and giving them a documented proof and other references to corroborate what they're

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
saying.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,360
I mean, you know, it's rolling right now.

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,000
And so we all, people put together the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,320
Services Committee staff, you know, Armed Services Committee under Jack Reed and the

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,200
Intelligence Committee on the Senate side, you know, under Mark Warner, who's the chairman,

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,680
and also Mark Rubio, Marco Rubio, you know, they've all been on board this thing and they

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,280
crafted this 64 page bill.

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:11,080
It was just like comprehensive in how we would go about undertaking a really responsible,

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,560
controlled disclosure of all of this information, giving the president ultimate authority to

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,000
recommend that a certain piece be, if he said one piece of information to be postponed from

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,640
immediate public release, but he has to give reasons and he has to have a written report

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,320
on why he's doing that.

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,120
And there can be a classified portion of it that he can provide to the Intelligence Committee,

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,520
but there also has to be a public document acknowledging that he's withheld a particular

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,320
piece of information and explain why he's doing it.

38
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,440
So it was a really comprehensive bill that was put together by people who were definitely

39
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,920
in favor of disclosing virtually everything that's more than 25 years old, which is the

40
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,560
kind of a standard rule for even intelligence information, as long as you don't disclose

41
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,120
anybody's particular identity, et cetera.

42
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,200
You know, but so we got into the bill that presumably everything is 25 years old or more

43
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,040
going all the way back to January of 1945 has to be revealed to the public.

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,160
And we set up a time schedule for it.

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,600
You know, they got 300 days to gather everything all together and put it into digital form

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,720
with an outline and have it be retrievable, computer retrievable.

47
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,680
And then they had to turn it over to the National Archives.

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,400
And then the National Archives was directed by Congress to, within 180 days, release it

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,760
all to the public, you know, unless the president personally intervened and made a provision

50
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,160
for a particular piece of information to be postponed.

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,800
It was really comprehensive.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,520
And there was a nine person board that was put together to review all this permanently

53
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,960
with staff, had a 20 million dollar budget, you know, to put together all the information

54
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,600
and to comb through it.

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,000
And we were one of the groups that was to nominate people to that board, that our New

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,800
Paradigm Institute was the citizens group that was to be nominating people for the president

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,680
to appoint to this board.

58
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,120
And, you know, it was the majority and minority leader of the Senate, the majority and minority

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,000
leader of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of Defense, the head of the National

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Archives and us as the citizens group that we were referred to as the UAP Disclosure

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Foundation.

62
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,840
That's one of our domains.

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,880
But it's the New Paradigm Institute that's set up as a 501C3, it's a wholly integrated

64
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,720
project of our 40 year 501C3, you know, that did the Iran-Contra case, that did the Karen

65
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,160
Silkwood case, you know, that I did the Pentagon Papers case for the New York Times, all that

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
Hey guys, I want to ask you a quick favor.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,760
Over the last few months, almost 70% of the viewers of this podcast are not subscribed

68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
to the channel.

69
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,360
The most important common denominator that allows me to keep creating these podcasts

70
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,440
every single week is you hitting that subscribe button below the videos.

71
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,920
I want to thank every single one of you who watches and supports these podcasts.

72
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,760
I would not be able to do it without you.

73
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,880
Please hit that subscribe button if you enjoy it.

74
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Now back to the show.

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,360
You know, we did all that through the 501C3 and so we've set up a full project under

76
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,080
our 501C3 tax exempt organization to act as the citizens watchdog on this process.

77
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:40,160
So that we're in Washington DC, we're the only civilian office right within the federal

78
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,560
enclave on Capitol Hill with all the Senate and House buildings and the United States

79
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,320
Supreme Court and the Congress building.

80
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
We're right there.

81
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,000
So we can have regular meetings with the staff.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,400
We have lunch with the staff, you know, and are going through the details of what was

83
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,120
in the bill.

84
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,920
And when it went over to the House side, you know, we knew, for example, that there was

85
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:07,800
a 17-0 vote in favor of the 64-page bill in the Senate Intelligence Committee, all eight

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,440
Republican senators, all nine Democratic senators, you know, we had all the major heads of all

87
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,560
the committees in charge of it, and it passed overwhelmingly in the Senate.

88
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,840
And we sent it over to the House side and it had of the 435 members, you know, like

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,360
420 of them, you know, were instantaneously supportive of the whole 64-page bill.

90
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,480
And it was actually called the UFO Controlled Disclosure Campaign Plan.

91
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,560
I mean, it was a full-scale mandate from Congress that there be a plan put in place to disclose

92
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,560
all of this information, and it had a seven-year period that was covered.

93
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,840
So that we had a seven-year period within which to disclose all of it, but there was

94
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,920
a 300-day period that they had to gather up all of the information that's 25 years old

95
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,520
or more and get it made public.

96
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,720
Now, that's a huge thing because actually from the date of the enactment, which was

97
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:18,200
December 22nd of last year, of 2023, that would have fallen on October 18th of 2024,

98
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,880
right this year, like two weeks before the election.

99
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,480
Oh, that perfect timing.

100
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,680
Yeah, I mean, it was just that we had it all set up so that this information is coming

101
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,280
forward so that people will have it, you know, in helping to make their decisions as to who

102
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,480
ought to be their senators, who ought to be their president and vice president, et cetera.

103
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,920
This is an extraordinary event.

104
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,640
I mean, when you have, when you have, and everybody knows now about Colonel Grush testifying

105
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:53,320
in the House Oversight Committee under oath that we are in possession of a non-human extraterrestrial

106
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,960
spacecraft and the bodies that are non-human.

107
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,920
The DNA tests have shown that they're non-human, and now that's a big story.

108
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,600
The DNA tests have shown, but have we seen any DNA tests?

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
They've got them.

110
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
The Senate Intelligence Committee's got it.

111
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,720
So with Grush, how many total witnesses did he bring forward?

112
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
There are 40 of them.

113
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Forty.

114
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,280
So I was just talking to my friend Jeremy Riss on, we do a little Patreon pre-show before

115
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,320
this, and I was asking him, because he's a historian in the UFO thing, you know Jeremy?

116
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
He's a great guy.

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,920
I was asking him about you, and he had a great way, a great question.

118
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,880
I'm going to try to, I'm going to botch this, but he basically said, Danny Sheehan's a Harvard

119
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
lawyer.

120
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Ask him this.

121
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,040
If I broke into, or if anyone broke into anybody's house, if I broke into your house, right,

122
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,880
and there were two witnesses that were neighbors, and they both said they saw you, saw me breaking

123
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,880
into your house, you would go to jail, right?

124
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
I wouldn't go to jail.

125
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
You'd go to jail.

126
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
I own their house.

127
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
You'd go to jail.

128
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
That's what I meant, right?

129
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,080
So whoever broke in would go to jail based on those two witnesses who saw you breaking

130
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
into the house?

131
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,760
If the jury believed the two witnesses.

132
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,400
So we have 40 witnesses with this whole UFO dog and pony show.

133
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,920
And is the issue that the jury doesn't believe the witnesses?

134
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,160
No, it's that the jury has been the Senate Intelligence Committee, and they do believe

135
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
them.

136
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
That's the whole point.

137
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,440
That's why they passed this law, you know, saying, look, okay, now it's time to have

138
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,600
a full disclosure of this information to the American people so that we can formulate what

139
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,820
to do about all this.

140
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:42,120
So why can't we get, based on those 40 whistleblowers or witnesses, why can't we get a search warrant

141
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,980
of the blue room at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base or Battelle Memorial Institute?

142
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,120
That's basically what this statute was.

143
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,520
This statute was basically a search warrant that was issued by the Senate Intelligence

144
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,560
Committee ratified by the United States Senate, saying that there is subpoena power that they

145
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,680
have, that they're commanding them to turn over the information to the Senate Intelligence

146
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,300
Committee and specifically to the National Archives, okay?

147
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,000
So they're ordered to cough it up, and if they don't cough it up, there is subpoena

148
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
power.

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,520
And they have the power to subpoena them, to make them cough it up, and they have the

150
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,200
power to undertake sworn depositions so they can subpoena people to come to depositions

151
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,760
and interrogate them under oath subject to perjury charges against them if they try to

152
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,320
pretend they don't have the information or, you know, their dog ate the homework, you

153
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,120
know, whatever they want to come up with for their lame excuses as to why they haven't

154
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,420
produced it, you know, and they, very importantly, had the power of eminent domain, which was

155
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,980
to actually seize, order the seizure of the crafts to take them back into the possession

156
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,500
of the United States government.

157
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,620
Or any material, right?

158
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,900
Or any material, any biologics or anything.

159
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,260
They had the power of eminent domain to take them back.

160
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:05,860
So this was a real search warrant, subpoena, that was issued by Congress, basically, to

161
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,380
take this stuff into possession for the Congress, because it's an absolute violation of the

162
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,820
Constitution to deprive the Congress of the United States, which is actually the fundamental

163
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,780
government, the elected government of the United States.

164
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,300
The other people are appointed, you know, these are employees, the people in the Defense

165
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,180
Department, you know, they're not elected by anybody, you know, and so they don't have

166
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
the authority.

167
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,980
You know, the President has the authority, and under the statute, the President had the

168
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,540
authority to review this, because we've discovered that a number of the Presidents were not briefed

169
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,220
in on this, even when they tried to get it.

170
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,660
They were, that's how I got started in this whole thing, back in 1977.

171
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,940
Jimmy Carter got elected in November of 1976, November 4th.

172
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,140
On November 19th, he sent the message to the CIA director and ordered him to come down

173
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,940
to Plains, Georgia, to his home.

174
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
Was that Bush?

175
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,880
That was George Bush, Sr., and ordered him to come down and demanded that he turn over

176
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,460
the information to him about UFOs and what connection they had to extraterrestrial life.

177
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,940
George Bush refused to give it to him and said he didn't have a need to know.

178
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,380
And so what President Carter did is he went to the Congress and got the House Science

179
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,800
and Technology Committee to issue a directive to the Congressional Research Service to gather

180
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,780
all the information together and provide it to the President.

181
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,140
And that's when I got called.

182
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,220
I was at the Jesuit headquarters at the time, and I got contacted by Dr. Marsha Smith, who

183
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,660
was the head of the Science and Technology Division of the Congressional Research Service

184
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,740
of the Library of Congress.

185
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,180
And she called me and asked me if I would be special counsel to the investigation, the

186
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,900
research, initially to see if we could get the Vatican, because I was at Jesuit headquarters,

187
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,420
to see if we could get the Vatican to agree to allow us to have access to the archives

188
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,740
of whatever information they had on UFOs and the ET phenomenon.

189
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,940
And so that's how I got involved in it back in the early spring of 1977.

190
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,860
What made you guys want to go to the Vatican?

191
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,340
They wanted to go to the Vatican because they thought that given the fact that there's a

192
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:24,060
thousand, two thousand years almost, of records that have been kept there, they thought that

193
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,380
they suspected that there may be information in the Vatican archives about the issue of

194
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:37,580
extraterrestrial intelligence, mainly because the Vatican was, for many centuries, one of

195
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:44,340
the primary sources of intelligence gathering for the Roman pontiffs.

196
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:50,860
They had intelligence services, which were primarily Jesuit, actually, since 1547.

197
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,460
Yeah, it's wild.

198
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,180
The Vatican has a space observatory.

199
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,700
A lot of people don't know that.

200
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,700
Yeah, they do.

201
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:02,060
It's a pontifical observatory at Castel Gandolfo, just outside of Rome.

202
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,060
So what did they say to you when you asked them for access to the archives?

203
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
They said no.

204
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,060
They just said no?

205
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,580
Yeah, they said no.

206
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,980
So I sent them a second letter saying, let me make clear, this is Jesuit headquarters

207
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:19,860
in Washington, D.C., we're contacting you, as the largest order in the Catholic Church.

208
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,540
We've been contacted by a person who's been designated by the president to get this information.

209
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,380
They'd like to have the information.

210
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,620
And they just said no, that we couldn't have it.

211
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,660
And so I contacted Dr. Marsha Smith and told her that they were not willing to give it

212
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
to us.

213
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:47,860
And then she asked me if I would go and brief the top 50 scientists at SETI, out at the

214
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,620
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL, out in Pasadena, if I would go and brief them on the theological

215
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,900
implications of contact with an extraterrestrial civilization, which I did.

216
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,580
And I got clearance from the Jesuit order to do that.

217
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:10,900
And so then I was, we went to the National Council of Churches and met with the leaders

218
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,080
of the 54 major religious denominations in the United States and proposed to them from

219
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,900
Jesuit headquarters that they agree to set up a task force to look into this, to get

220
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,540
out ahead of the power curve so that we wouldn't have another, you know, Copernicus and Galileo

221
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:32,200
kind of event of people, you know, freaking out and thinking that somehow science was

222
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,820
somehow going to be contradicting basic theological tenets.

223
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,020
So we said, look, we ought to get busy on this.

224
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,460
And then the National Council of Churches didn't want to do it.

225
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,540
So that was what we were doing there at the headquarters.

226
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:54,540
And then I was contacted later after that by Dr. John Mack to represent him when he

227
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
—

228
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,540
What year were you contacted by him?

229
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
1994.

230
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,860
I was contacted in 1994 by John Mack to represent him at Harvard because I'd graduated from

231
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,060
the college and the law school and had gone to do my master's and Ph.D. work at Harvard.

232
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,700
And so he figured that, you know, we'd kind of wave the school tie at them and get them

233
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,920
to lay off him, you know.

234
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,520
So that's the next kind of major event that I was engaged in.

235
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,440
And John and I had gone to see Lawrence Rockefeller and Rockefeller had agreed to finance an entire

236
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,180
Grand Rounds at Harvard to present all of the information and evidence to them.

237
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:37,520
And so I was actually in a position of interviewing virtually everybody in the field on behalf

238
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,560
of Dr. John Mack to prepare them as witnesses to be part of this Grand Rounds at Harvard

239
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
in 1994.

240
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,160
So you interviewed the people that were in his abduction book, the people that —

241
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
I met some of those people, yeah.

242
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,600
But I also interviewed all the major researchers, you know, I got to meet Stanton Friedman,

243
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:02,160
I got to meet Bud Hopkins, I got to meet David Jacobs, I got to meet virtually everybody.

244
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,960
I got to meet Stephen Greer, I got to meet Linda Moulton Howe, I got to meet all the

245
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,040
folks that were researchers.

246
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,240
And then I got to meet all kinds of the direct experiencers because I also became legal

247
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,480
counsel for the Project for Extraordinary Experience Research.

248
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,840
That's the peer group that John Mack put together in Cambridge.

249
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,880
So I got to meet the people in that context.

250
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,320
And so that's why Stephen Greer ended up asking me in 2001 to be legal counsel for the Disclosure

251
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,560
Project.

252
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,680
And I was legal counsel for the Disclosure Project for 20 years.

253
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,880
So I got to meet a lot more people in vetting the witnesses that we were going to present

254
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,520
at the National Press Club in 2001.

255
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,920
Yeah.

256
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,400
So going back to John Mack, when he first reached out to you, what was — he wanted

257
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,960
you to represent him for the stuff that Harvard was coming down on him for, for the research

258
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
that he was doing.

259
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,280
That's right.

260
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,320
What did you guys end up doing when you first met with him, and how did you approach that

261
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
case with him?

262
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,160
Well, it was interesting.

263
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,440
I actually got contacted initially by Ron Robertson.

264
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,000
Ron Robertson is John Mack's best friend.

265
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,400
He was his best man for him and Sally at their wedding and everything.

266
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,720
He was out in Santa Barbara, and I was teaching at the University of California in Santa Barbara.

267
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
And Ron Robertson contacted me.

268
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,520
He was the head of the art department at the Santa Barbara City College.

269
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,520
And he had come to a number of my lectures on the Ron Contra case and the Karen Silkwood

270
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,200
case and Three Mile Island case and other cases that we had done.

271
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,760
And so he was kind of a follower of the Christchurch Institute at the time.

272
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,140
So he called me and asked me to come and see him and then asked me, you know, what I thought

273
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,880
about the UFO issue.

274
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,280
And I told him I thought it was extraordinarily important.

275
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,880
It was probably one of the most important public policy issues that one could be involved

276
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
in.

277
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,380
And he said, oh, well, look, I should tell you that my best friend John Mack has just

278
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:12,100
been dragged up in front of this kind of tribunal at Harvard University that's completely secret

279
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,620
right now, but that they're excoriating him for having written this book about his

280
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:22,820
interviews with people who held sincere beliefs that they'd had direct contact with extraterrestrial

281
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,300
spacecraft, et cetera.

282
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:31,660
And he said, would you be willing to take a call from John and consider representing

283
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
him?

284
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
And I said, yes, absolutely.

285
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,500
So John called me, had me fly to Cambridge, and we sat down to talk about this.

286
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:46,500
And we looked into it, and this was not an AAUP panel, it was not an Association of American

287
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,600
University Professors authorized panel of any kind.

288
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,420
It was just this kind of rump gathering that they put together.

289
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:01,620
And then I found out that what had happened is that the United States Air Force and the

290
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:08,060
Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency had been engaged for decades in a covert

291
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:14,140
program of trying to smear people inside the military or inside government offices who

292
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,940
tried to actually do anything about the UFO issue.

293
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,980
And what had happened is that one of the first things they would do if a high ranking officer

294
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,380
insisted upon filing an official UFO report, one of the first things they would do is order

295
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:33,940
him to go get a psychiatric exam, which is not a career builder in the military.

296
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,820
And so that a few of these guys who would actually pushed all the way through and insisted

297
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,660
upon filing an official report.

298
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:50,980
For example, Arne Arnoldson, Colonel Arnoldson was the commander at the Molestrum Air Force

299
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,780
in Montana back in 1968, when the UFO came up over the over the Minuteman site and shut

300
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,420
off all 10 of the Minuteman missiles.

301
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,020
And Arne Arnoldson was the guy that called NORAD about it and said, you know, that we've

302
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,980
got this the craft of some sort that's come up over our site and has closed off all of

303
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,980
our missiles.

304
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,380
And they said, Are you trying to file a UFO report?

305
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,780
And he said, Yes, yes, I am.

306
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,460
And they said, Well, that's interesting, because both the Minuteman site to your west

307
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,220
and to your east have both reported the same thing.

308
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,740
They've had their missiles shut off too, which people don't know about, don't talk about.

309
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,380
But I talked to Colonel Arnoldson.

310
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,500
But it was fellows like that who insisted upon going forward, they would be ordered

311
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,440
to get a psychiatric exam.

312
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,780
And so a number of them had been sent to Harvard Medical School to get this kind of top level

313
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,700
psychiatric exam.

314
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,460
And John Mack, being the chairman of the department, was actually tasked to do that.

315
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,460
So he did that.

316
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,260
And he says he told me later, he said, you know, I did all the interviews with them and

317
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,260
did all the tests.

318
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,260
This wasn't by choice.

319
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,500
No, no, no, no, they were ordered to do it.

320
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,820
And so when John said, I mean, I mean him, but it wasn't his choice to interview these

321
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
people.

322
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,940
Well, no, they were they were sent there to be to be tested.

323
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,600
My guess is that that he, as the chairman of the department, had some discretion in

324
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,740
who would be assigned to actually do the exams.

325
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,540
And so he chose to do those.

326
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:30,740
Do you do you know if before he started interviewing these people, these military people, if he

327
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,980
had any sort of interest in this topic?

328
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,620
No, no, he did not.

329
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,620
He did not.

330
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,020
He had no he assumed it was all nutty, actually.

331
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,100
And he actually suspected that these guys had something wrong with him.

332
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,900
And he did the interviews and then he said, you know, but each one of them tested out

333
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,740
to be within the normal parameters of normalcy.

334
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,020
And yet they had this story that they kept insisting upon going forward with and they

335
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,540
felt compelled to talk about it and were ordered to be silent about it.

336
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:07,380
And so he he actually called his mother, John, John, who was like, I don't know, probably

337
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,660
60 years old at that time.

338
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,300
He called his mother, who was like 90 years old, and tells her about this.

339
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,220
And she said, oh, well, you should you should go see the Hopkins boy.

340
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,300
You know, they were the family friends.

341
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,660
The the the Mac family were family friends with the with the Hopkins family.

342
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:31,020
And she said the Hopkins boy has got been interviewing a lot of people who believe that

343
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:37,580
they've seen these UFOs or had direct contact with the pilots or the occupants.

344
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,380
And so he ended up calling Bud Hopkins and getting to talk to Bud and Bud sent some other

345
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:48,660
people to him, police officers and, you know, teachers and lawyers and librarians, people

346
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,100
who were in kind of positions in the community that it would not have been in their interest

347
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,180
to make up something like that.

348
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,660
And so he started interviewing them.

349
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:02,940
And as he started interviewing them, he got so fascinated by by the stories that he began

350
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,420
actually conducting like an investigation.

351
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:11,220
What he would do is he never hypnotized John, never hypnotized anybody.

352
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,220
He didn't want to do that.

353
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
He never did.

354
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
No, he did not.

355
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,300
What he what he does is he did a thing called holotropic breathing.

356
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,580
Holotropic breathing was a method that was developed by Stanislav Graf to actually get

357
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,420
people super relaxed.

358
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,860
And they would do like sort of like Hindu breathing through the different nose things.

359
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,540
And they would they would get into a kind of an elevated state of consciousness and

360
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,260
get very, very relaxed.

361
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,540
And that was the key for them to remember things that any kind of anxiety that they

362
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,340
had that was blocking into their memory.

363
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,380
So he would do the holotropic breathing and interview the people.

364
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,540
And what he would do, what he would do is he he would actually start asking them kind

365
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,620
of ancillary questions, you know, they would tell what was happening.

366
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:01,340
OK, now, are you you're you're where they say, well, I'm inside some kind of a room.

367
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,860
You know, I'm on this table and I'm getting examined.

368
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,360
And he said, now, will you look around a little bit?

369
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,740
Tell us, do you what do you see?

370
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,220
Then he would have them describe like the equipment in the room.

371
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,900
What type of equipment do you see?

372
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,500
You know, what does it look like?

373
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,780
And he would get like details of some of the stuff that they were seeing.

374
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,860
So that when he had another person who was in a similar situation,

375
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,660
he would ask them things that nobody would have ever asked him about.

376
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,700
But like particular little details about what was happening.

377
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,300
And it started being correlating.

378
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,780
And so he started to suspect that this was something that that was extraordinarily

379
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,820
strange because it seemed like it was real, what was happening to them.

380
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,940
And so he wrote an article.

381
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,740
He wrote an article for the New England Journal of Medicine.

382
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,140
How many people had stories that were very similar that like

383
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,020
and what kind of objects did they talk about seeing?

384
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,140
They would talk about some of the instruments, for example,

385
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,540
that were being used to examine them.

386
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,340
He would ask him to describe in detail what the instruments looked like.

387
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,860
Was there any kind of equipment in the room?

388
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,060
You know, what what kind?

389
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,180
Did you see any kind of navigation equipment in there?

390
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,140
Any kind of, you know, computers?

391
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,300
What did you see?

392
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,340
You know, and they would describe in some detail some of the stuff that they were seeing.

393
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,180
I had a guy on here named Randall Nickerson.

394
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,180
Yeah, Randy Nickerson.

395
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,340
He explained to me something about some sort of like like pole or stick.

396
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,980
Yeah, it was a rod. A rod.

397
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,660
There's a rod. There's a rod that a number of them reported having them.

398
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:43,980
It was usually the tall, tall grays, they call them, that had this rod

399
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:50,060
and that they would they would seem to actually give them control over people.

400
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,820
Actually, it was like it seemed to like amp up kind of their telepathic capacities,

401
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,460
which were quite considerable to begin with.

402
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,660
But it was like that.

403
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,780
So John, so John ended up sending the sending in this this report

404
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,940
that he did for an article for the New England Journal of Medicine.

405
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,500
And after several days, it got sent back to him

406
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,740
with a note saying they weren't going to publish this.

407
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,660
Well, he was kind of taken aback by this.

408
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,260
You know, he's the chairman of the Department of Clinical Psychiatry

409
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,900
at Harvard Medical School. This is a very professional piece.

410
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,740
So he decided what he would do is he would would beef it up.

411
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,380
He would put in more footnotes and more details

412
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,300
of the stuff to make it really full scale professional.

413
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,300
Then he he sent it back to him.

414
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,220
And within two days, the executive assistant

415
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:46,220
for Arnold Relman, who was the head of the who was the editor in chief

416
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,860
of the New England Journal of Medicine, sent his executive assistant

417
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,500
back to Harvard to go into the office of John and hand it back to him

418
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,220
and to tell him to note that it had not been opened.

419
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,020
And they weren't going to open it and they weren't going

420
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,660
to even consider publishing it.

421
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,620
And John got upset about it.

422
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,100
And so John called a publisher.

423
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,420
He'd won the Pulitzer Prize already. Right.

424
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,020
For the writing Lawrence of Arabia, the T.E. Lawrence thing,

425
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,700
the psychobiography.

426
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,660
And so he contacted a publisher and the publisher agreed to write it,

427
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,340
to print it, and it was published.

428
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,940
And then, like within a couple of days of it hitting the stands,

429
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,780
the dean of the medical school came in and said, John,

430
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,900
you know, I hear that you've published a new book.

431
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,060
And he said, yes, he said, this is a very interesting topic.

432
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,620
You know, why don't you why don't you come by, you know,

433
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,740
and let's talk about this?

434
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,780
It's very interesting.

435
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,700
And he said, look, and as long as you and I are going to be talking about it,

436
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,100
why don't we invite some of the other faculty people to come on over

437
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,740
who might be interested in this?

438
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,820
So John was excited about this.

439
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,260
John thought that was a cool idea.

440
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,700
So he was going to he went he went to the where the assigned place

441
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
was to go and meet the dean.

442
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,660
And he comes into the room and here's this tribunal

443
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,140
sitting there that there is not only the dean himself,

444
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,860
but it turns out that that Arnold Relman,

445
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,820
the the editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine,

446
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,620
was chairing the committee.

447
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,700
And then there was the legal counsel for Harvard University sitting there.

448
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,780
And then there were three other professors,

449
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,620
all of whom John thought were people who really didn't like him

450
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,380
for some reason in the faculty.

451
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,980
He had some experience with them.

452
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,060
And they were all there.

453
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,300
And they began to excoriate him

454
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,220
for besmirching the name of Harvard University,

455
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,700
writing about this ridiculous thing, that it was clear that these people

456
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,780
were mentally ill, you know, and that if he had written an article,

457
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,780
you know, about this weird mental illness,

458
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,020
then that would have been OK.

459
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,620
But he seemed to give the impression that he was attributing

460
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,700
some sort of dimension of reality to this whole the whole experience.

461
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,580
And so he was taken completely aback by what they were doing.

462
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,420
So he called his mother again and his his mother said,

463
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,620
Well, why don't you just go to the family lawyer?

464
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,260
You know, they were a fairly wealthy family.

465
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,180
And, you know, and his his father was a doctor

466
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,340
and his grandfather's a doctor.

467
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,620
They were kind of wealthy family.

468
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,300
So he goes to the local lawyer in Boston, the family lawyer.

469
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,140
And the lawyer says, Oh, just give them anything they want.

470
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,020
You know, if you want the recordings of your sessions, did you bill them?

471
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,540
Did they get insurance?

472
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,820
You were were you doing this as a clinical treatment to them?

473
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,340
Or were you doing research?

474
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,340
You know, just tell them whatever they want to know.

475
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,300
And he was kind of surprised.

476
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,060
He said he wasn't expecting that kind of advice.

477
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,740
And then he checked and found out that the lawyer, the law firm

478
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,620
Ropes and Gray was the lawyer for Harvard University.

479
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,940
Oh, no.

480
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,300
And he felt betrayed by the whole thing.

481
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,820
This episode of the podcast is brought to you by Bubs.

482
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,220
I've recently gotten into collagen supplementation

483
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,940
because after the age of 25, your natural collagen production

484
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,220
dramatically drops off, which severely impacts your skin.

485
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,540
By supplementing with collagen, you're actually increasing

486
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,500
your body's natural production of collagen.

487
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,420
This increases your skin health, your skin elasticity,

488
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,020
which improves the overall quality of your skin.

489
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,100
Secondly, if you're someone who's into lifting heavy weights,

490
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,860
collagen is one of the major building blocks to joint and connective tissues.

491
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,580
Collagen protein can help reduce joint inflammation and improve joint function.

492
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,900
And finally, collagen is amazing for your hair growth

493
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,060
because it increases the production of keratin,

494
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,540
helping to promote stronger, healthier hair.

495
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,020
Bubs is a tribute company to Glenn Bubs Dority,

496
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,140
who was a Navy SEAL and CIA contractor

497
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,220
who died defending American freedom in Benghazi, Libya.

498
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,860

502
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,980

It's linked below.

507
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,460
Now back to the show.

508
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,700
And so he called his best friend, Ron Robertson.

509
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,500
Who called you?

510
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,420
Who ended up calling me, saying,

511
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,700
why don't we get Danny and see if he's interested in helping you on this?

512
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,300
And John said, oh, no, no.

513
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,340
He did like the Ron Contra case and the Big Silk Road.

514
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,780
He's done all those other big cases.

515
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,900
He probably wouldn't even be interested in this subject,

516
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,420
because that's why Ron Robertson called me, asked me to come to dinner

517
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,620
and asked me, what do you think about this?

518
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,860
You know, and so that's how that's how I got to be on the case.

519
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,260
So I go with John to the next session of the tribunal.

520
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,740
And we come in, we sit down, right?

521
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,380
And in there's there's Rellman up there with all the

522
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,220
the the dean of the medical school and the lawyer and all these guys.

523
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,220
And so Rellman just starts in trying to interrogate him.

524
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,580
And so I said, well, excuse me.

525
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,900
I said, excuse me here.

526
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,940
You know, you know, I don't know, you know, I didn't do the potted plant routine

527
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,140
that I'm not just a potted plant, you know.

528
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,420
I said, you know, look, I said, look, I don't know what the nature of this

529
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,740
this tribunal is.

530
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,900
It's certainly not an AAUP convened tribunal.

531
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,300
I said, but whatever the nature of it is, can you tell me, you know, are

532
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,260
are any of the either one of the two following fact questions

533
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,140
going to be at issue here?

534
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,180
Number one, whether or not extraterrestrial life exists.

535
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,380
And secondly, whether at least some of these sightings of the UFOs

536
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,580
might actually be a vehicle from an extraterrestrial

537
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,220
civilization. And Rellman says, well, the two of them are

538
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,940
absolutely going to be relevant.

539
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,460
He said, and it's totally ridiculous to think that either one of those things

540
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,860
could be true. That's what he says to me.

541
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,260
You know, 1994, Harvard University says it's completely ridiculous

542
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,540
to think that there would be life anywhere else in the universe.

543
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,700
I mean, that's where they were.

544
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,020
So I said to him, well, I said, in that case, you know, in the spirit of cooperation,

545
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,580
let's let's just tell me who is it that called the dean?

546
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,860
And there was this big, dead silence over the room.

547
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,820
And he looked around like this and the lawyer for Harvard University looks at him

548
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,900
and goes like that, shakes her head no.

549
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,780
And he says, well, I'm sorry, we're not we're not at liberty to discuss that.

550
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,780
And I said, oh, OK.

551
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,940
I said, well, look, in the spirit of cooperation here, you said

552
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,460
they ask a bunch of questions and he wasn't really able to to answer the question.

553
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,340
So what were the questions?

554
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,860
Another big, long pause.

555
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,020
He looked at the lawyer, the lawyer shook her head no.

556
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,380
He said, I'm sorry, we're not at liberty to discuss that.

557
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,900
So I said, all right.

558
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,580
Well, then, look, let me just tell you in the spirit of openness

559
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,660
that that John and I have just spent the weekend with Lawrence Rockefeller,

560
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:56,140
and he's agreed to finance a complete grand rounds here on this subject

561
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,380
at Harvard University that we'll bring in the chief investigator

562
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,420
for the Federal Aviation Agency, we'll bring in military personnel,

563
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,540
we'll bring in police officers and things that have filed these reports

564
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,300
in the lawyer for Harvard University just leaped to her feet.

565
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,460
And she said, absolutely not.

566
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,340
She said, we're not going to allow this procedure to be turned

567
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,380
into some kind of a circus, she said.

568
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,380
So I said, well, I said, you know, we've made the offer, you know,

569
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,060
we're perfectly willing to answer your questions and stuff.

570
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,980
But we're going to present the witnesses to support these two fact questions

571
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
that you think are at issue here.

572
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,500
And so we're ready to proceed.

573
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,580
And they said, no, we're not going to do any of that.

574
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,540
So I said to John, that's it, John, we're out of here.

575
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,940
You know, this is not an official tribunal of any kind.

576
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,820
You don't have to be here.

577
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,940
So I reached out and kind of help pick him up

578
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,620
out of the chair and walked out on him.

579
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,260
You know, and so I went around doing all the interviews of all these people

580
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,420
that we could present.

581
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,020
We just kept going straight forward, saying, you know, I kept saying,

582
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:00,100
this is a great opportunity, you know, to present to Harvard University

583
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,900
what the evidence is and the information is that we have.

584
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,220
And so I had to have a local council

585
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,220
because I was admitted in the Southern District of New York

586
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,900
and in Washington, D.C., but I wasn't admitted in Massachusetts.

587
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,780
So I went to I went to Dershowitz, Al Dershowitz,

588
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,420
who was one of my professors at Harvard,

589
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,180
and said because he I had the course with him on

590
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,060
psychiatry and the law.

591
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,540
He and Stone, Professor Alan Stone.

592
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,100
So I'd taken a year course in that at Harvard.

593
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,700
And so I went to see him and I said, you know,

594
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,420
who should we have to be just local council for me here?

595
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,780
So he recommended Harvey Silverglate.

596
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,660
And Harvey was in the middle of a trial and he couldn't do it.

597
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,980
So he recommends this young guy, Eric McLeish,

598
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,900
who had just gotten into the bar in Massachusetts.

599
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,500
And so he could just, you know, be there to be local council.

600
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,780
So we brought him on board.

601
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,180
And then he right away started working at trying to figure out

602
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,260
how to settle the case.

603
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,700
To say, well, look, why don't we just do whatever they tell you to do?

604
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,940
Why don't you just? Right.

605
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,980
And I said, no, stop it.

606
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,260
You know, we're not going to do that.

607
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,860
We're not going to turn over all the tape recordings of these things to them.

608
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,860
I said, you know, that we're going to do the grand rounds.

609
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,900
So he kept on figuring out how to solve this thing and settle it

610
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,900
and make him leave him alone.

611
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,020
And John's wife was upset.

612
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,180
Sally was really upset because he was being ostracized.

613
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,860
You know, at Harvard, he wasn't invited to any of the social events anymore.

614
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,300
And she wasn't getting invited to any of the women's things.

615
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,580
And so she was getting really upset about what was happening to him.

616
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,020
And it was all secret, you know, because they kept saying,

617
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,020
you know, we want this kept secret that we're doing this hearing.

618
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,420
I kept saying to myself, why the hell should we keep this secret?

619
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,460
This is ridiculous.

620
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,260
They don't have any right to be doing this.

621
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,780
But so what I was doing is I was respecting John's wish to keep a secret.

622
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,180
So what I did is I was reaching out to all these different potential witnesses

623
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,940
to come in and start preparing.

624
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,100
And one of the people that we reached out to

625
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,540
that had been in the University of Colorado,

626
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,340
because they were very, very familiar with the Condon report

627
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,140
that came out of the University of Colorado years earlier.

628
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,500
And so and he got terribly upset that this was going on.

629
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,020
And he called the newspaper and told them that this was happening.

630
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,780
Condon? No, no, no.

631
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,620
It was this other guy. It was a professor there that just knew all about the condon.

632
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,820
Oh, I understand.

633
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,100
And so I was going to have him testify all about it.

634
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,060
And so he told somebody about it.

635
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
And so they threw a big fit.

636
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,180
You know, the committee threw a big fit over the fact that it had been made public.

637
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,220
And so that the this fellow, Eric McLeish,

638
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,820
kept getting in there trying to get it settled.

639
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,660
And it turns out this Eric McLeish is later on

640
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,220
after this, after they stopped and left, left John alone.

641
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,500
I I was the one that initiated the first litigation

642
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,060
against the Catholic Church for the pedophile priests in Boston.

643
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,980
And I got a hold of Eric McLeish to to do the case for us. Right.

644
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,900
Pull that mic back.

645
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,140
And and he and he ended up starting settling all these cases.

646
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,620
He was the guy in Spotlight, the the movie Spotlight. Right.

647
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,180
That that Ruffalo, Mark Ruffalo was in where they played

648
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,140
told all about the Boston Globe in the the

649
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,620
the investigation they conducted about all the priests.

650
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,740
And they discovered that this guy, Eric McLeish,

651
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,500
was the guy settling all the cases for the Catholic Church

652
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,660
and getting a huge portion of the the settlement that was given to the people,

653
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,260
but making them sign statements that they would keep completely secret.

654
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,300
Any of the accusations they made against the church,

655
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,580
you know, which totally pissed me off, you know.

656
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,860
So was he like working as like a double agent with the church?

657
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,020
Yeah, he was. That's what he was doing.

658
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:07,620
Yeah, he was he was settling all the cases and he was basically engaging

659
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,700
in covering for the church and but getting money for all the people

660
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,060
that had filed complaints against these pedophile priests.

661
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,660
But he was getting a share of the money, you know.

662
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,100
And so I was really mortified by that.

663
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,500
But but it started, you know, it started with him, you know,

664
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:29,500
successfully settling the case for John Mack and making them leave John alone.

665
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,660
But it stifled our ability to bring all the witnesses on.

666
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,940
You know, it's just it's a little known fact about a well-known subject.

667
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,860
But the bottom line is that that's how I ended up after they

668
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,260
they apologized to John and left him alone.

669
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,340
He had me become legal counsel for his project on extraordinary experience

670
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,180
research, the peer group that he had there in Cambridge.

671
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,700
And John and I started working on trying to set up

672
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,140
what we were calling the New Paradigm Institute

673
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,740
that was going to be examining the worldviews clash that occurred,

674
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,540
that this is an entirely different worldview that Harvard University has.

675
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,500
It's the scientific, logical, positivist, materialist worldview

676
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,300
and that the assertion that it was completely impossible to believe

677
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,700
that that any spacecraft could actually come from a distant star system

678
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,220
and come to our planet just couldn't be true because, you know,

679
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,780
they can't go faster than the speed of light and therefore they can't get there.

680
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,140
What did John think about all of this?

681
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,980
Did he really think that this was like

682
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,060
spacecrafts coming from another star system or did he think

683
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,540
this was something like inside the human mind?

684
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,980
No, it wasn't inside the human mind.

685
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,420
What he started thinking about was that he thought it was quite clear

686
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,220
that there was evidence that that some of these events

687
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,380
involved a spacecraft from some other planetary system.

688
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,260
For example, the Betty and Barney Hill case.

689
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:57,340
Betty Betty Hill actually got one of the people on the craft

690
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,420
that she believed that they'd been abducted and brought on to to show her a map.

691
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,140
You probably heard about that showed in the star map. Right.

692
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:11,260
And she did get hypnotized by a guy in Boston, a professional hypnotist.

693
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,740
And she re-drew the star map that was shown to him.

694
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,140
And nobody could figure out where it was.

695
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,340
And it turns out that it wasn't later until they had the computers that could do it,

696
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:26,660
that they reversed the star chart to figure out the perspective

697
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,020
from which the star map was drafted, was drawn,

698
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,220
that came from their planet, which turned out to be Zeta reticuli.

699
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,940
And when that happened, that was kind of a further confirmation

700
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,620
because there wasn't any way she could have drawn something like that.

701
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,140
She didn't know anything about stuff like that. Right.

702
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,460
And so John said, OK, now there's there's some solid evidence

703
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,620
that at least some of this is coming from an extraterrestrial civilization somewhere.

704
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,460
But he thought that there was other stuff going on as well,

705
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,860
that it wasn't that this was a delusion on their part,

706
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,220
but that in fact, there was something going on

707
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,300
that had to do with what is normally considered to be religion.

708
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,460
And apparitions of the Saints see and the apparitions of Mary,

709
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,580
you know, that these kind of things that are happening in the.

710
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,820
And so he started exploring it and going to interview indigenous people

711
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:29,700
around the world who who believe that they have direct encounters with star people.

712
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,460
You know, in the Lakota tribe, for example, the Lakota people

713
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,220
believe that they come from the Pleiades originally

714
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,780
and that they came down from the Pleiades in this in this light chamber,

715
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,380
came down into the the Black Hills, into the wind caves

716
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,980
and came up through the wind caves.

717
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,380
It's a very specific tradition that they believe in their other indigenous tribes.

718
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,060
So John started interviewing people and put together this thing

719
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,940
called the Project on Extraordinary Experience Research.

720
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:03,780
Just one of the extraordinary experiences was these encounters

721
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:08,260
with what they experienced as being an extraterrestrial being,

722
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,900
you know, in a spacecraft.

723
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,060
But there were other experiences that people had that made it appear

724
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,460
that it was like interdimensional, that they thought that these beings

725
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,900
were coming from some other dimension.

726
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,660
In fact, in fact, we got called,

727
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,500
John got called by Bob Bigelow out from the Skinwalker Ranch.

728
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,340
This is back in nineteen ninety five or so. Right.

729
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,580
And he got a call from Bigelow and Bigelow said,

730
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,380
ask John to come fly out and see him right away and bring your lawyer

731
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,140
who helped you at Harvard.

732
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,740
So we flew out to see Bigelow.

733
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:49,020
And when we arrived, even like a day later after this event had taken place,

734
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,740
we arrived and met with him and he didn't want to talk about it anymore.

735
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,820
He decided, I don't want to talk about it.

736
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,620
And Colm Kelleher was there

737
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,500
and Colm took me aside

738
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,380
and stepped into the room next door and told me all about what had happened

739
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,740
there at the ranch and had to do with this kind of portal

740
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,740
that was like at the ranch and that this portal had opened.

741
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,540
And one of their people had seen this other this person,

742
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,900
you know, a big, tall, seven foot tall being,

743
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,460
you know, that had big kind of shaggy hair,

744
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,980
looked almost like a yeti kind of character.

745
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,100
And Colm told me all about it, you know.

746
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,580
And so I went back out and was talking to to Bigelow

747
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,780
to see whether he wanted to do it,

748
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,180
because what happened is Bigelow brought in a scientific team

749
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,060
right away to try to see what it is that was going on here to measure.

750
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,300
And these two helicopters flew in, two helicopters flew in

751
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,900
and landed in and ordered the scientific team to get away.

752
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,700
And they couldn't come to where this event took place.

753
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,260
And the scientists kept saying, no, you know, we're here from Mr.

754
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,940
Bigelow, he owns this place.

755
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,900
And they said, they don't care. You get the hell out of here.

756
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,180
They were American guys. Black helicopters.

757
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,380
They were unmarked helicopters.

758
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,380
But they, you know, they were just regular jumpsuits,

759
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,380
all black jumpsuits, no insignia on them, no names on them and anything.

760
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,660
But they were American guys talking.

761
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,140
He knew that they were they could recognize they were American military guys.

762
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,780
You know, and when when the scientists kept trying to assist upon

763
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,220
going in and setting up their equipment, they began to get beaten up

764
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,420
by these guys and breaking their equipment and broke their cameras

765
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,420
and scared, scared the crap out of them.

766
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,580
This is on Skinwalker Ranch? Yes. Yes.

767
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:37,340
Yeah. And I was I was right there, like within two days of when this happened,

768
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,340
you know, of them beating up the scientists and stuff.

769
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,020
And so that originally he was so upset that Bigelow wanted to sue them

770
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,100
and wanted John to bring his lawyer out to do something about this.

771
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,900
But by the time we got there, just a couple of days later,

772
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,380
he just was not going to do anything at all.

773
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,860
And as I say, it was Colin Callagher told told me all about the details

774
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,620
of what it is that had just happened.

775
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,940
Who do you who do you guys suspect these people were?

776
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,300
I I don't get paid to guess.

777
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,580
You know, if people want to investigate it and want to do it

778
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,900
so I can retain professional investigators and the proper people

779
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,620
to do the investigation, we do it.

780
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,340
Does anybody have any ideas?

781
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,980
Does Bigelow have any clue? Does anybody speculate?

782
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,540
Oh, all kinds of people speculate.

783
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,780
I mean, what do people say?

784
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,580
This whole field is filled with speculation in private contractors.

785
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:34,620
Are they it's it's it's, you know, that I'm assuming that I'll be in position

786
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,540
since we've set up the new institute, the New Paradigm Institute,

787
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:42,260
that will be funded to investigate things like this and do it professionally

788
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,660
full scale, you know, with psychological stress evaluators

789
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,540
and professional investigators that are licensed gun toters.

790
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,460
We that's what we work with.

791
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,460
You know, that's what we did in the Karen Silkwood case.

792
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,660
That's how we found out who killed Karen Silkwood.

793
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,940
It's how we found out that they were smuggling the plutonium

794
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,980
out of the facility to Israel.

795
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,220
You know, it's how we did the Iran Contra case, how we caught them

796
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,660
smuggling the weapons to the Contras and smuggling the cocaine.

797
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,420
We had we had we had where they were smuggling the cocaine, too.

798
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,060
And, you know, put the refrigio de fico, the Punta Arenas,

799
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,940
these little shrimp boats, they were bringing it into Miami.

800
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,740
We had the house where they were bringing it.

801
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,420
We had the unlisted private telephone number for the house.

802
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,420
We had the code words you use to be able to call and get an order of the drugs.

803
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,620
We knew that it was Gambino's daughter that was running the place.

804
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,300
That's what we do.

805
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:36,260
I mean, that was what the Christic Institute was for 20 years in Washington.

806
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,140
That's what the Romero Institute has been for 20 years out in California.

807
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,980
And that's what our New Paradigm Institute brings to this.

808
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,780
That's what we brought to John Mac.

809
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,580
It's what we brought to the review of the vetting, the people

810
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,980
that were going to be witnesses for this closure project.

811
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,260
So with John Mac, all of those people that you guys interviewed

812
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,820
and all the people that he did this holotropic breathing with

813
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,220
and had them kind of recount these experiences, things like

814
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,060
what Betty and Barney Hill encountered.

815
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,660
How many of those people were foolish?

816
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,780
A few of them.

817
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,900
There had to have been a few of them.

818
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,940
Yeah, yeah, there were.

819
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,180
But some of them were foolish.

820
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,780
Some of them were foolish.

821
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,420
Some of them were were mentally ill,

822
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,140
you know, which is different than being foolish.

823
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,100
Yeah. But there were others that were just fakes, you know,

824
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,980
they just wanted celebrity or wanted to be involved in it.

825
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,900
And so I vetted these people out, you know, that was what I did

826
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,620
for the for the peer peer group.

827
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,340
You know, that was part of my responsibility.

828
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,060
And that's what I did for the for the disclosure project.

829
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,940
As I said, no, these are not people that we want to vouch for.

830
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,420
Right. You know, right.

831
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,740
And so that we could we could call through the people

832
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,780
and present just the most credible people

833
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,180
with a kind of verifiable evidence that you would you would

834
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,700
conduct a rule 11 preliminary investigation

835
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,580
before you would be willing to file a complaint, you know,

836
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,020
asserting that the facts are true to the best of your belief.

837
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,660
You know, that that's what we bring to this this whole field,

838
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,860
which is new, is a rule 11 standard of professional investigation.

839
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,180
And the fact of the matter is that we can, in fact,

840
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,540
bring adequate numbers of witnesses who are completely credible,

841
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,260
completely verifiable, who've got corroborating evidence

842
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,740
and documented proof, you know, and those are the kind of people

843
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,860
that are being presented to the United States Senate.

844
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:31,300
Are you familiar with the guy who he was a Air Force officer,

845
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,820
I believe, at the what was the name of that base in California?

846
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,580
Vandenberg. Vandenberg.

847
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,180
There was a story of a rocket that went up with a dummy.

848
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,580
Oh, yes. Clear warhead on it.

849
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,260
Oh, yes. This guy was like arguing with Bill Nye

850
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,580
on live TV about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

851
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,900
Was he one of your witnesses?

852
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,340
No, he hasn't. He hasn't gone in front of the Senate yet.

853
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,700
He did. He came to the National Press Club, though.

854
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,980
He came. He came with with Bob Salas.

855
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,700
Bob Salas came in who was the captain

856
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,540
at the Maltstrom Air Force base with the Minutemen.

857
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,580
And there were there were two other guys who came with him.

858
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,820
One of them was that guy and he presented the entire information about

859
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,900
and showed showed a mock up of the video that he took.

860
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,780
He was mock up of the video.

861
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,220
He showed what it looked like.

862
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:24,300
What it was is that he he was he was actually videoing

863
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:28,740
the the the launch and watched the launch go

864
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,380
with the big gigantic telescope that they had.

865
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,540
He had it mounted to be able to watch the whole ascent of the rocket.

866
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,260
Yeah. And he saw the thing.

867
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:43,780
And what he did is he he drew a a reenactment of what it looked like

868
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,580
and where was the original video?

869
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,380
Well, it was it was top secret.

870
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,300
It was it was kept by the people.

871
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,500
He was working for Vandenberg Air Force base.

872
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:57,020
He was actually part of the team that was monitoring the flight, you know.

873
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:00,180
And so he was in an official position to be doing it.

874
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,540
And so he's the one that saw the video

875
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,740
and turned it over to the officials in the Air Force about what it is

876
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,660
that had happened.

877
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,460
But and he waited for years.

878
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,460
This was just let's see.

879
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,180
We're in February of 2024.

880
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,020
Now, this was like in, I guess,

881
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,940
early June, probably a little earlier than that.

882
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,820
May, May, perhaps May of 2023.

883
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,700
He came with Bob Solace to the National Press Club

884
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,940
and actually had a press conference and in showed his

885
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,540
re-creation of what the video looked like.

886
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,300
You know, so he he did talk about that.

887
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,940
Yeah, there's been lots of recreations of that video online.

888
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,860
You can find on YouTube.

889
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,820
Yeah, it's it's for people that aren't familiar with it.

890
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:47,620
Apparently some sort of a saucer came up around this fake nuke

891
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,900
that was being launched in the atmosphere and it like shot laser beams into it.

892
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,260
And then it just fell into the ocean.

893
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,180
Yeah. And they just showed it like a beam of light coming out of it.

894
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,060
And then it went in the rocket was going up.

895
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,220
I mean, it was accelerating, you know, like, I don't know,

896
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,180
a thousand miles an hour or something in this this craft, whatever it was,

897
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,460
was just doing circles around it and zapped it with these three

898
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,780
different beams of light.

899
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,980
And then the whole thing just, you know, went all off course

900
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,140
and ended up crashing, I guess.

901
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:23,660
Yeah. And we were talking a little bit earlier about

902
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:29,020
like the misinformation and what the military was trying to do

903
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:32,260
with some of these people at these bases by, you know, giving them

904
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,620
these psych exams by John Mack, because obviously, like you put it,

905
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,460
well, it's not it's not good for a career builder.

906
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,100
Exactly. Yeah, right.

907
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,540
So are you like I wonder how much of that is going on now

908
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:48,540
with people that come out and or are publicly talking about

909
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,700
like witnessing UFOs or having these sort of abduction experiences?

910
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,380
How many of these people are being contacted by people in the government

911
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,180
or people in the military and being fed

912
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,940
disinformation so they can basically be a conduit to the media,

913
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,100
giving them sort of like like a limited hangout type thing?

914
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,780
Well, it's it's a it's an important fact question,

915
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,820
but it's one that we have to investigate.

916
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,140
I mean, all kinds of people speculated about it.

917
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:21,580
And there's a mixture of people who are who are making stuff up.

918
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,700
There's a mixture of people who are speculating.

919
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,260
There are people who are getting third hand reports

920
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,060
and then embellishing them.

921
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,780
What we're what we're doing at the New Paradigm Institute,

922
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,420
in addition to organizing and educating people

923
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:39,940
about the kind of really concrete cases that are really verifiable,

924
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,700
that what we're going to do is investigate some of these other cases

925
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:48,620
to vet them and decide which ones of those that we can vouch for.

926
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,820
OK, because we're in the process of presenting people to the Senate,

927
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,380
you know, into the House Oversight Committee.

928
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,900
So we're we're trying to make sure that, you know,

929
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,020
you could have five really absolutely credible witnesses.

930
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,740
But if you let one real ringer get in there, you know,

931
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,300
who's mentally ill or just faking it, you know, like this guy,

932
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,460
Corey Good, you know, that was going around, you know, pretending that

933
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,300
he was on, you know, interstellar spacecraft that we'd back engineered

934
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,660
and he'd been to other galaxies.

935
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,460
And who's this guy?

936
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,020
This guy, Corey Good, that he was around for about two years.

937
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,460
And Dave Wilcock was, you know, flogging him all around

938
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,660
and putting him on Gaia and everything.

939
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,980
You know, there are people that are just complete phonies

940
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,780
that have Dave Wilcock. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

941
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,540
That guy's that guy's a wacko. That's right. That's right.

942
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,700
But these two guys were all the rage.

943
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:44,220
I mean, they were they were showing up at, you know, going on Gaia television.

944
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,100
They were going to the International UFO Congress.

945
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,380
They were going to the, you know, all these different events

946
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,380
where people are gathering together and they were attracting big, huge crowds.

947
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,820
You know, and it was just this totally sensationalist stuff.

948
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,260
I mean, and I just I ended up refusing to go to any.

949
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:05,620
I refuse to participate in anything that they were at.

950
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,860
That guy Wilcock was like in the beginning of the trailer

951
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,700
of one of Stephen Greer's documentary is calling Greer a genius.

952
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,420
Well, he was like, Stephen Greer is a genius.

953
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,860
Well, as I say, people are say all kinds of things, you know,

954
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:24,420
and this this area has been rife with people who are hoaxing

955
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,860
and people do it just it's just like the kids who use to cut people's clotheslines

956
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,100
on Halloween, you know, or poop in a bag and light it on fire

957
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,580
and put on people's porches. Right.

958
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,780
You know, I mean, there are people who are just reckless.

959
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,460
Well, are you I'm sure you're I'm sure you're familiar

960
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,980
with the the Paul Benowitz case, right?

961
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:45,140
There's a movie there's an amazing documentary called Mirage Men.

962
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,220
And it's about this guy named Paul Benowitz.

963
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,660
I believe this was in Steve.

964
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,100
You could probably find this, but I think it was in the 70s,

965
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,020
mid to late 70s.

966
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,820
He was living in Nevada.

967
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,060
And here's the yeah, here's the document.

968
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:04,860
It is one of if not the best UFO documenter I've ever seen.

969
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,900
Shout out Jeremy Rees told me about this.

970
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,740
Anyways, he was living near an air force base right over the hill in Nevada.

971
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:15,700
And this guy was a devout UFO guy, right?

972
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,420
He was he was in the community going to all the talks.

973
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,580
And he was seeing these crafts,

974
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,700
these UFOs flying over the mountains

975
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,100
near where this air force test range was.

976
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,380
And he was sharing them with the UFO community in the area.

977
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,980
Anyways, the Air Force got wind of the people at the base got wind of this.

978
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,980
And they sent a counterintelligence guy over to his apartment

979
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,260
to check it out, see what he knew.

980
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,500
And the guy they sent over what his name was.

981
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,300
This is Rick Doty of Doty.

982
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,340
Oh, yeah.

983
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,340
And he went over there and he found out what he had.

984
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:55,540
And Doty was Doty was feeding him fake information.

985
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,380
This is right in line when they were testing the stealth bomber.

986
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,300
And Doty saw what he knew and asked him what he thought.

987
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,220
And he said he thought there were UFOs and Doty said, you know what?

988
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,700
I think you're right.

989
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,860
I think these are aliens.

990
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,420
And he used Benowitz

991
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:17,660
as a conduit into the UFO community to disseminate this misinformation

992
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:21,700
because they knew there were Soviet spies embedded in the UFO community

993
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:26,100
that were trying to figure out what sort of military or like blue sky

994
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,580
research that we were testing and developing over there at those air force.

995
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,460
Yes. Yeah.

996
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,260
This episode of the podcast is brought to you by Rocket Money.

997
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:37,260
Do you ever feel like money is just flying out of your bank account each month

998
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,420
and you have no clue where it's going?

999
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,140
Well, I do. It's to all those subscriptions you have.

1000
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,580
Think about it between all your streaming services,

1001
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:48,620
productivity tools, fitness apps, meditation, guided apps.

1002
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,620
It's endless. And I'm guilty of this.

1003
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,420
So I ended up using Rocket Money to figure out which subscriptions

1004
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,620
I'm still paying money for every month.

1005
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,300
And they helped me cancel all the ones I no longer use.

1006
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,060
If you're unfamiliar with Rocket Money, it's a personal finance app

1007
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:05,220
that helps you cancel your unwanted subscriptions, monitor your spending

1008
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,100
and helps lower your bills.

1009
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,020
And it's not just about canceling subscriptions.

1010
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,500
It's about monitoring and controlling your spending.

1011
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,780
You can see all your subscriptions in one place.

1012
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,740
No more digging through bank statements or suffering these long,

1013
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,980
grueling calls with customer service people.

1014
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:22,380
They'll even work on getting you refunds on subscriptions that you haven't used.

1015
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,260
They're very skilled negotiators.

1016
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,460
Rocket Money can potentially lower your bills by up to 20 percent.

1017
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,700
Just snap a photo of your bill, send it to them, and they will handle the rest.

1018
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,460
The bottom line is Rocket Money has already helped over five million users

1019
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:37,220
save an average of seven hundred and twenty dollars per year.

1020
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,580
That's over five hundred million dollars in cancel subscriptions.

1021
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:44,180
Stop wasting money on things you don't use and cancel all those unwanted

1022
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,180
subscriptions by going to RocketMoney.com slash DJP.

1023
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,540
Again, that's RocketMoney.com slash DJP.

1024
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,740
It's linked below. Now back to the show.

1025
00:59:54,740 --> 01:00:00,100
I remember I met Dodie before, you know, and I always thought Dodie was a phony,

1026
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:05,020
you know, and people didn't like me because saying I don't I don't attack

1027
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:10,420
people as a rule unless I become just completely convinced that they're lying.

1028
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,580
And that they're engaged in active disinformation and in trying to discredit

1029
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:19,700
the whole movement. And Dodie was one of those guys.

1030
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:24,300
And there have been a handful of others like Wilcock and Corey Good and a couple

1031
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:28,620
others that we've we've been involved in exposing.

1032
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,780
There was some one guy, I can't remember his name or nobody.

1033
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:36,420
He had this whole cockamamie story where he and his dog were out walking in the woods

1034
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,820
and they came upon this craft that was crashed in the woods.

1035
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,940
And it shot out a ray and froze his dog.

1036
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,820
And so he got really angry.

1037
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:50,660
And he picked up a big branch and clubbed this little UFO guy

1038
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,060
and put him in his freezer and was keeping him there.

1039
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:57,980
And he had this big mechanism that he put on his wrist and could shoot rays.

1040
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:02,860
It was just total lying, you know, and one of my professional

1041
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:07,220
investigators actually followed this guy around and finally caught him,

1042
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,540
you know, reporting to some friends of his how he was bullshitting everybody.

1043
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,140
Yeah. And and I told John Mack about it.

1044
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:18,460
And John then issued a statement discrediting the guy.

1045
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:22,900
Yeah. And then. What is that?

1046
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,460
Someone driving that was a loud car driving.

1047
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,540
There's also like when on Groom Lake, when the Air Force

1048
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:39,420
or the CIA was testing the first jet propelled, you know, the first jet airplanes,

1049
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:44,940
they sent up the pilots with gorilla masks in the cockpit.

1050
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:49,940
So in the case where they flew within visual distance

1051
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,180
of a civilian airplane, they would put on gorilla masks

1052
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,980
so that when this pilot goes to the bar to tell his buddies about this jet airplane

1053
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,060
he saw, he's going to say he saw a gorilla flying a jet airplane.

1054
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:05,740
So it's like it's like purposely planning these false,

1055
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:08,660
these fake seeds to cover up top secret information.

1056
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:11,660
Oh, yeah. Yeah, they definitely were doing it.

1057
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,740
And they they very definitely consider the whole UFO issue

1058
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,980
a major top secret program and that they've been actively engaged

1059
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,460
in sowing disinformation and discrediting individual people

1060
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,980
who who have genuinely seen things.

1061
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,220
They've destroyed people's family lives.

1062
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,700
They destroyed their professional careers.

1063
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,860
You know, they've just they've destroyed their military careers.

1064
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:40,140
You know, there's a very active, aggressive counter intelligence program

1065
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:46,620
that's mounted to stop people from reporting genuine UFO incidents.

1066
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:54,700
And I connect all of this to to Bob Lazar in the fact that in his story,

1067
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:58,460
specifically when he talks about walking past a window and seeing an alien body,

1068
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,780
like if they were going to bring him in

1069
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,380
to potentially try to back engineer some sort of technology, they dug up.

1070
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:06,420
It would make it.

1071
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:09,980
It really would make sense that let's walk him through a room

1072
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,340
with a little alien in it.

1073
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,940
So that way, if he ever tries to blow the whistle on this program,

1074
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,020
people aren't going to believe him.

1075
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:22,900
No, that's that there's there's dozens of individual cases

1076
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:27,380
where it bears analysis, professional analysis.

1077
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:32,420
You know, for example, all you have to do is is is get him Bob Lazar

1078
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:37,060
and put him on a psychological stress evaluator, which no one has done.

1079
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:41,220
They put him on lie detector tests and he's passed the lie detector test.

1080
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,940
But those are pretty crude.

1081
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,940
You know, you know, I mean, the little things on your fingers

1082
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,700
and the little belt on your chest.

1083
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:52,020
Those are those are not even close to the precision of a psychological

1084
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:56,820
stress evaluator that measures tension, involuntary tension in your vocal cords.

1085
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,860
It's it's a very professional way of going about this.

1086
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,660
And I was in F. Lee Bailey's office this developed this.

1087
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:08,020
We used it in Bailey's office when I was there in seventy four, seventy five.

1088
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,460
So but but not very many people knew about him.

1089
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:15,180
You know, I mean, Bailey also had a had a briefcase,

1090
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,420
satellite phone, et cetera.

1091
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:24,060
We discovered only later that he was actually on the index four for the CIA.

1092
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,260
He was one of the four lawyers in the United States

1093
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:30,900
that the CIA is supposed to contact if one of their people is caught

1094
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:35,420
engaging in domestic covert operations, which is totally forbidden

1095
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,020
by the National Security Act in 1947.

1096
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:41,900
So I was one of the three trial lawyers in his office and we didn't know it.

1097
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:46,420
And as soon as we discovered it, you know, I left and had a number

1098
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:50,220
of the investigators leave with me because we didn't want to be associated with that.

1099
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:54,140
Can you break it down for people listening?

1100
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:58,860
What the Pentagon Papers were and how that led into the Watergate

1101
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,820
burglary and how you got involved in it?

1102
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,380
Well, it's it's it wasn't.

1103
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:08,820
Well, what happened is the they were separate cases that the Pentagon Papers.

1104
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,980
I had initiated the case.

1105
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:16,140
I was the co-founder of the Harvard Civil Rights Law Review in 1968.

1106
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:22,740
I was taking doing constitutional law with Lawrence Tribe and others.

1107
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,500
And and we set up the Harvard Civil Rights Law Review.

1108
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:31,140
And I wanted the law review to be something more than just writing academic

1109
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:33,380
thought pieces.

1110
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:37,140
And so I wanted to have a provision in the Harvard Civil Rights Law Review

1111
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:41,380
where we were helping young lawyers figure out how to become civil rights lawyers.

1112
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:46,020
And so we sent out letters to around to a lot of the major bar

1113
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:49,620
associations and things, letting people know that if the if any lawyers

1114
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:53,140
had really important civil rights cases, they could contact us

1115
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:54,860
at the Harvard Civil Rights Law Review.

1116
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:58,060
And we would get a bunch of little eager beavers at Harvard

1117
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,820
to work on those briefs. Right. Right.

1118
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,220
And so the bottom line is

1119
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:08,580
I ended up being contacted by a guy

1120
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:14,020
in the name of Pappas, John Pappas, who was a NBC television journalist

1121
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:19,700
in New Bedford during the riots that followed the assassination

1122
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:22,300
of Martin Luther King in April of 68.

1123
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,140
And the the

1124
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:30,700
riots broke out in New Bedford after the assassination of Martin Luther King.

1125
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,940
And the white mayor issued a shoot on sight

1126
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:38,180
order to the police to shoot any looters

1127
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,340
that were engaged in looting in the context of those riots.

1128
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,260
So the Black Panthers had set up barricades

1129
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:49,140
around the ghetto area to keep all the police out of there.

1130
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,540
And their big standoff occurred

1131
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:54,420
because they built barricades.

1132
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:57,060
And then the police came in and they brought in the helicopters.

1133
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:00,140
And, you know, they thought there was going to be gunplay that was going on

1134
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,660
because they were armed, the Panthers.

1135
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,540
Bottom line is, long story short,

1136
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:09,780
that the the Panthers agreed to give an interview, an off the record interview

1137
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:14,620
to the John Pappas, who Paul Pappas, I'm sorry, Paul Pappas

1138
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:19,020
would give them an interview if he would keep it off the record.

1139
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:21,060
And he went in and interviewed them.

1140
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,820
And then the district attorney subpoenaed him to make him cough up

1141
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:27,500
the confidential interviews that he'd had with the Panthers.

1142
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:32,900
And then he contact they contacted us at the Harvard

1143
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:38,300
Civil Rights Law Review through a guy by the name of John Flynn to write.

1144
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,540
So I asserted the First Amendment right of journalists

1145
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:44,620
to protect their confidential news sources in the case,

1146
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,500
went all the way up the United States Supreme Court right away.

1147
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,540
And so I was only a second year law student.

1148
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:54,900
So I got recruited by the Wall Street law firm that represents NBC

1149
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,020
to come down to do the briefs for the United States Supreme Court.

1150
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:02,220
And in doing that, I also wrote the amicus briefs

1151
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,460
at the Supreme Court level for CBS and ABC

1152
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,620
and also for The Washington Post and The New York Times.

1153
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,820
They all filed amicus briefs on that important issue, right?

1154
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,980
In the Supreme Court, because no one had ever asserted the right before.

1155
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,780
And so it had never been litigated.

1156
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:20,220
So we were litigating it in front of the Supreme Court.

1157
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,860
In that context, I got to meet Jim Goodell, who was the general counsel

1158
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,140
and vice president for The New York Times.

1159
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,340
So when they got the Pentagon Papers

1160
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:33,540
brought to them, their firm, Lord Day and Lord,

1161
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,740
it represents The New York Times most of the time,

1162
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:39,540
threatened to turn them into the FBI if they didn't give them back right away.

1163
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,660
And so Jim Goodell called me over at the Cahill firm.

1164
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:45,860
So I got the call.

1165
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:48,980
And then Jim Goodell came in to talk with with me and us,

1166
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,900
and we agreed to represent them to publish the papers.

1167
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,860
So we went ahead and did the Pentagon Papers case

1168
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:59,580
for The New York Times and won the case in the United States Supreme Court

1169
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,100
and got to publish all 47 volumes.

1170
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,860
But what happened is I got to read.

1171
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:10,380
I was one of the few human beings on the planet that actually read all.

1172
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:13,820
You read all of the 47 volumes of this is we were trying to determine

1173
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,820
what we were going to publish and what we weren't.

1174
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,700
We're vetting what we're going to publish.

1175
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,100
Why would you publish all of it?

1176
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:23,140
Well, because you didn't want to reveal names of people.

1177
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,460
For example, the thing that Snowden gotten all the trouble for. Right. Right.

1178
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:29,740
So so so the bottom line is I was doing all that.

1179
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:34,300
And Bailey had already contacted me earlier before I went to the Cahill firm,

1180
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,860
wanting me to join his firm.

1181
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:39,780
But all he wanted me to do is write legal briefs

1182
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:43,540
on behalf of constitutional rights to protect fucking criminals.

1183
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:45,260
Did Bailey have anything to do with the Pentagon Papers?

1184
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,140
No, I would imagine that he would not want nothing.

1185
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:49,420
No, he did not. He did not have anything to do with it.

1186
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,420
But he knew that I was doing all that stuff.

1187
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,940
And he had asked me first to be the good guy to recruit.

1188
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:58,740
And so the bottom line is when he got retained by by McCord

1189
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:03,140
to defend McCord in June of 1972,

1190
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:07,420
June 17th, when the burglary took place, Bailey gets retained

1191
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:11,580
because he was on index four, along with William Bennett Williams

1192
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:16,420
and two other attorneys that he was on index four.

1193
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,700
What do they call index four?

1194
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,660
It was just a code name they had for the list.

1195
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,740
CIA code name. Yes, the CIA code.

1196
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:25,420
There were four lawyers that were on retainer by the CIA

1197
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:29,420
so that if they got caught, engaged in domestic covert operations,

1198
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:32,820
which is illegal, that they would call these lawyers. Right.

1199
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,780
And so Bailey was one of them.

1200
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:38,620
And so Bailey called me and asked me if I would come out of the Cahill firm

1201
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:41,380
and come to his firm to be on the case.

1202
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:44,780
So when we got there, when we got there,

1203
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:48,740
I realized that these three of these Cubano guys

1204
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:52,780
from our interviews with McCord, that they were Traficante guys.

1205
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:57,900
So I was kind of saying, look, I'm responsible for trying to monitor

1206
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,940
the hearings that are becoming at the Watergate hearings.

1207
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:02,140
Who is Traficante?

1208
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:05,100
Santos Traficante was the Don of the Mafia in Havana.

1209
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:10,340
And in January of 59, when Batista was overthrown

1210
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:14,740
by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, et cetera, that Traficante fled

1211
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:18,980
and came to Tampa, actually came to Tampa and was here.

1212
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,140
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1213
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:25,060
And that was Santos Traficante, the mob boss, you know, for for all of Havana,

1214
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,060
which was a key area because it had the gambling casinos.

1215
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,940
It had the the houses of prostitution, et cetera.

1216
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,180
Was it Meyer Lansky big shot down there?

1217
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:37,260
Miami. Miami National Bank is a Lansky bank.

1218
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,980
It was a mafia bank.

1219
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:42,820
You know, but he ran a bunch of the casinos and whorehouses down there.

1220
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,820
That's right.

1221
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,140
And they had the heroin.

1222
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:48,420
The main heroin trafficking was coming in from Southeast Asia,

1223
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:52,700
coming in through Traficante was also partners with Vang Pao

1224
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,540
and over in Laos.

1225
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,900
And they were bringing in the heroin into Havana.

1226
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:03,020
And the the three person partnership was Batista,

1227
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:07,140
Santos Traficante and this guy, Paul Helliwell, for the CIA,

1228
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,540
are the ones that handled all the heroin coming in through Havana.

1229
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,740
From Laos, from Laos.

1230
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,340
That's right. Through Vang Pao.

1231
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:16,900
Yeah. And so.

1232
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:20,020
So the bottom line, the bottom line is I came into the office

1233
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:24,900
and we ended up, you know, participating in getting McCord

1234
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:26,900
to blow the whistle on them.

1235
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,900
He wrote the letter to Judge Sirica

1236
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:33,380
explaining to him who they who the burglars were and what they were doing,

1237
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:37,980
because he thought that they were actually coming in to try to protect.

1238
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,780
They thought that, well, the story that he told

1239
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:46,380
was that they thought that the Democratic Party

1240
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:50,460
was coddling people that were illegally

1241
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,980
opposing the Vietnam War, which they thought was undermining national security.

1242
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:58,740
That was that's what James McCord was talking about.

1243
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:01,260
But the bottom line, as it turns out,

1244
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:05,260
we found out through our interview of Traficante directly

1245
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:10,260
that the reason they'd gone into the Watergate Hotel was because Larry O'Brien,

1246
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,500
who had just been made the new head of the Democratic National Committee

1247
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:18,940
in the Watergate Hotel in Washington for 25 years, had been the previously

1248
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,940
was the chief lobbyist in Washington for Howard Hughes.

1249
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,300
And Howard Hughes is the guy that Richard Nixon

1250
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:31,740
contacted to set up the assassination team to kill Castro in Che Guevara.

1251
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,820
And the bottom line is that's the group that killed the president.

1252
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,980
And that's what the Watergate burglar was all about,

1253
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:43,100
is Nixon was terrified that that they were going to find out that

1254
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:46,580
because Larry O'Brien had worked for for Howard Hughes,

1255
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:51,180
that Larry O'Brien may have found out that Nixon is the one who who created

1256
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:54,180
the assassination team that ended up killing the president,

1257
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:58,540
and that if that ever got out, that nobody would believe that he wasn't behind

1258
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:00,740
killing the president, which he wasn't.

1259
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:03,180
But he was behind trying to kill Castro.

1260
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:06,620
And it was that same unit that killed the president in sixty three.

1261
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,620
All right, we're going to have to rewind a little bit.

1262
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,660
Yeah, we're going to have this off the UFO subject.

1263
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,820
We're going to have to go a little slower over this for a second.

1264
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:18,700
Oh, yeah. So the guys you interviewed.

1265
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,300
Traficante. Yeah.

1266
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:27,860
And found out that the Cuban guys were going into the hotel to find they were

1267
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,140
hired by who?

1268
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:33,460
I'll take it from the top and I'll tell you, so you'll know the details of it.

1269
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:37,260
What happened when I realized that there were

1270
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,260
Traficante guys that were in the hotel and I was saying,

1271
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,060
what the hell has that got to do with anything?

1272
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,460
Why are they there?

1273
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:46,300
So I get a hold of Bill Taylor, who was my investigator,

1274
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:49,660
assigned to me in the firm of Bailey.

1275
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:53,060
And Bailey gets a hold of bad Andy Tooney,

1276
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:56,780
who was the chief investigator for Moriarty and the Social Security Department.

1277
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:00,540
Who was the chief investigator for Moriarty and Associates,

1278
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:03,300
which is Bailey's investigation firm. Right.

1279
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:07,420
And he interviews he interviews Traficante at

1280
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:12,700
Hank's house, Henry Gonzalez, at his house here in Tampa.

1281
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:16,300
He sets up an interview and interviews him at length.

1282
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,620
And he explains what's happened here.

1283
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:23,300
What happened is back in in early

1284
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:26,020
late May, actually, of 1960.

1285
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,260
This is the 1960 presidential campaign.

1286
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:33,340
And Richard Nixon is the vice president under Eisenhower. Right. Right.

1287
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:37,860
And he is campaigning to get the Republican Party nomination in 1960.

1288
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:41,980
And in late May of 1960, Nelson Rockefeller

1289
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:46,980
withdraws from the campaign in Michigan.

1290
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,300
And therefore, Nixon knew he was going to win the nomination

1291
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:53,260
because Nixon was now because

1292
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:56,820
Nelson Rockefeller was out of the competition and Nixon was going to be

1293
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:00,780
the nominee. And they were certain they were going to win because, you know,

1294
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:05,060
there was this kid, Kennedy, that had been was going to be the nominee for the

1295
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,020
Democrats. So they were all convinced that he was going to win.

1296
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:12,260
What Richard Nixon did is he was the head of the 5412 committee,

1297
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:16,060
which is the subcommittee of the National Security Council that does covert

1298
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:20,980
operations under Section 5412 of the National Security Act of 1947

1299
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:25,220
that authorizes the CIA to engage in activities from time to time

1300
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,940
at the request of the president to protect national security.

1301
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:32,020
And so they he Nixon ran.

1302
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:35,500
He chaired the 5412 committee of the National Security Council.

1303
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:39,500
So he knew that Howard Hughes was a secret consultant

1304
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:42,180
to the National Security Council.

1305
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,740
He was running special operations.

1306
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:49,420
He, for example, had designed and created the the Goldmar Explorer,

1307
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:53,340
which was the ship, special ship that was able to pick up submarines

1308
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:55,780
off the bottom of the ocean, the Russian machine.

1309
01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:01,220
He also did the C5A cargo plane out of the Suma Corporation.

1310
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:06,100
And he was also doing other stuff for the National Security Council, 5412.

1311
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:08,980
We're talking about Howard Hughes, the guy who plays an aviator.

1312
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:11,060
This is this is Howard Hughes.

1313
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:15,300
And he's living in Las Vegas, you know, at the the one of the major

1314
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:19,180
mob hotels. And he's living in the penthouse suites up there.

1315
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,020
Right. Right.

1316
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:22,980
And so the bottom line is Richard Nixon contacts him.

1317
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:26,700
As soon as Richard Nixon knew that Nelson Rockefeller had withdrawn

1318
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,460
and he was going to be the nominee and he contacted Howard Hughes

1319
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:35,540
and on the the secret phone for the 5412 committee,

1320
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:40,260
talked with him by phone and asked him to set up an assassination team

1321
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:44,740
to kill Fidel Castro, Raul Castro in five of the commandantes

1322
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:47,220
that they wanted assassinated.

1323
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,740
And he said, but you got to keep it completely away from the White House.

1324
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,780
So that if you could get that done,

1325
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:56,260
that I would deeply appreciate that when I become president. Right.

1326
01:17:56,660 --> 01:18:01,980
But if Howard Hughes, why would Howard Hughes set up an assassination team?

1327
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,460
Well, when you know the nature of what some of the things were

1328
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:07,660
that Howard Hughes was doing with with the 5412 committee,

1329
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:13,420
it was the deepest, darkest, most secret stuff that they were doing.

1330
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:16,060
And he was part of it.

1331
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:18,900
It wouldn't help for me to go into what that one was.

1332
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:23,460
But there was an extremely, extremely supersensitive program

1333
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:27,220
that Howard Hughes was working on with them, in addition to the Glomar Explorer

1334
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,300
and the C5A and all that.

1335
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:34,580
But because of the the depth of the darkness of that relationship that he had,

1336
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:39,420
he knew that he could go in under that umbrella of that super dark program

1337
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:43,660
and to get Hughes to do this, Hughes doesn't agree

1338
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:47,220
or disagree with with Nixon on the phone, whether he's going to do it or not.

1339
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,260
He's not that's not done.

1340
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,660
So but what he did is he got one of our one of his lawyers, Bob Mayhew.

1341
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:57,780
And Bob Mayhew, he assigned to go get this done,

1342
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,860
see if they could put this team together.

1343
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:02,100
Bob Mayhew meets with Johnny Roselli.

1344
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:06,300
Johnny Roselli is the bag man at the Sands Hotel

1345
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,820
that's owned by the mob.

1346
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:13,500
And Johnny Roselli is in Las Vegas, where where Howard Hughes is.

1347
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,620
And where Bob Mayhew was.

1348
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:18,780
And so he so Bob Mayhew gets a hold of Johnny Roselli

1349
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:23,740
and says, look, use guys, you know, have every reason in the world

1350
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:25,460
to try to get rid of Castro.

1351
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,420
You know, he shut down the whorehouses, he shut down the gambling casinos.

1352
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,780
And very important, he's cut off the heroin supply

1353
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:34,220
that's coming in to the to the C Supply Corporation.

1354
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:39,100
So if you guys would do this, you know, the president would be really grateful.

1355
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,460
And they started referring to Nixon's president

1356
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,380
because everybody assumed he was going to win.

1357
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:46,780
Right. And so so what so Frank.

1358
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:50,820
So Johnny Roselli says, look, I'm going to have to go and see Giancana.

1359
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:53,940
You know, who's my principal here? I can't do this.

1360
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:56,980
So I have to clear this through Giancana.

1361
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:00,740
So so Johnny Roselli goes back to Chicago and meets with Giancana

1362
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:04,620
and says, look, here's the Nixon who's going to get to be president now.

1363
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,300
Well, it's this assassination team put together.

1364
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,260
Can we do this?

1365
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:13,300
And in in Giancana says, well, that's Traficante's territory.

1366
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:17,500
That's he's the Don of Havana, you know, and even though he's fled

1367
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:21,260
and he's up in Tampa now, he said, we're going to have to go meet with him

1368
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,460
to see whether he would OK this.

1369
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:28,220
And so what they do is they set up a meeting and Sam Giancana goes

1370
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,860
and Johnny Roselli goes and Bob Mayhew goes.

1371
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:34,460
And they meet down at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami

1372
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,340
with Traficante, and they hold two meetings.

1373
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:42,660
They're to persuade him to do this, to set this thing up.

1374
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,900
And then Traficante says to us, you know, he said,

1375
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:48,260
but I didn't fall off in the melon wagon.

1376
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,820
He said, he said, so I'm going to I'm going to check to make sure

1377
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:56,020
that this is coming directly from Nixon, not some, as he said, brain fire,

1378
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:01,100
you know, of Giancana or of of Howard Hughes or anybody else.

1379
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:04,860
I wanted to so that they the third meeting, they send a guy

1380
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,180
using the nom de guerre of Mr. Ed.

1381
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:09,180
And it was Sheffield Edwards.

1382
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:13,340
Sheffield Edwards was the chief of security for the Central Intelligence Agency

1383
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:16,300
under Eisenhower and Nixon administration.

1384
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,060
And so he comes to the meeting and gives them the green light

1385
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,340
to put this assassination team together.

1386
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,460
So they put the assassination team together.

1387
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:28,380
And Traficante is the guy that's going to put together the team.

1388
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,020
And Traficante picks 15 guys

1389
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:34,460
that are former shooters for him out of Havana.

1390
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:38,420
But he gets guys who have been recruited by the CIA

1391
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:41,580
to participate in a thing called Operation 40,

1392
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:46,020
which is a covert operation that they were running guerrilla raids into Cuba,

1393
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:50,140
burning bridges and blowing up, you know, burning sugar fields.

1394
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,940
Right. And doing that stuff that they were doing.

1395
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,500
That's Operation 40.

1396
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:56,620
And they had recruited a whole bunch of former Traficante guys

1397
01:21:56,860 --> 01:22:01,180
to participate in that, who had fled from Havana and were up in Tampa and Miami.

1398
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:05,220
This was the anti Castro Miami right wing hardball,

1399
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:11,260
anti Castro Cuban refugee community, Alpha 66, you know, the 2506 Brigade.

1400
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:12,380
You know, that crowd.

1401
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:13,700
Do you know Felix Rodriguez?

1402
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,500
I sure do know Felix Rodriguez.

1403
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,100
I've taken Felix Rodriguez's deposition.

1404
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,220
You took his deposition. Yeah.

1405
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:21,860
Can you tell me about Felix Rodriguez?

1406
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,340
Felix Rodriguez is a shooter.

1407
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,540
He's one of the guys on the team that killed the president.

1408
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,060
He and he and Rafael Chichi Quintero.

1409
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,740
I'm going to interview him tomorrow.

1410
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,860
Oh, well, that's who he is.

1411
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:34,140
You know, Felix Rodriguez, he'll know exactly who I am

1412
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:38,660
because he was he was he was the number he was the number one guy

1413
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:43,140
at Ilepongo running the the contra weapon supply operations,

1414
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,340
along with Rafael Chichi Quintero.

1415
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:49,500
He and he and Rafael he and Rafael Quintero were in the security division

1416
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,980
at Pemex in Mexico City where all the assassins hung out in Operation Condor.

1417
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:56,380
He's a cold blooded fucking killer.

1418
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:59,460
You know, that's who he is.

1419
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:02,300
Yeah. Felix Rodriguez.

1420
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:05,020
He was so he was on.

1421
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,340
Yeah, he was one of the Cuban assassins.

1422
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,540
That's right. That's exactly right.

1423
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:11,700
That's exactly right.

1424
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,820
And just ask me about Rafael Chichi Quintero.

1425
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:15,940
Tell him we've interviewed Rafael Chichi Quintero

1426
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:18,580
so we know exactly what we're talking about.

1427
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:21,460
You know, so ask him who Carl Jenkins is.

1428
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:26,820
You know, say, tell me about Carl Jenkins and tell me about how you got trained down

1429
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:30,140
in the the down in Oaxaca, Mexico,

1430
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:35,940
at Clint Murchison Jr.'s ranch as part of the Triangular Fire Team to kill Castro.

1431
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:38,780
Tell us about that, Felix.

1432
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:42,980
That's incredible how the universe just like falls into place.

1433
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:44,980
He says about that. Yeah.

1434
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,740
Oh, my God.

1435
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:50,140
So a lady we just had in here by the name of Annie Jacobson

1436
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,500
is how I learned about Felix.

1437
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,860
She wrote a book called Surprise Kill Vanish,

1438
01:23:56,180 --> 01:24:03,380
all about the like the creation of the Title 51 CIA assassination teams.

1439
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:08,260
And she followed a guy named Billy Wah around different countries,

1440
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,260
who was like he started out in Vietnam.

1441
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,460
Really, he got just passed away.

1442
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,660
But he was a CIA paramilitary guy

1443
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:19,300
who was like doing some brutal stuff in multiple different countries.

1444
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,620
And he was the guy who captured Carlos the Jackal.

1445
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:25,660
And one of the guys that she interviewed in that book was Felix Rodriguez.

1446
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:32,460
And, yeah, she talks about how like some of the things he did

1447
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:35,380
didn't say anything you said, just none of the stuff you just said.

1448
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:38,100
But she talks about some of the operations he did during the Bay of Pigs.

1449
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:40,820
Yeah. And how he captured Che Guevara.

1450
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,900
Yeah. Ask him about a wristwatch when he's sitting there.

1451
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:47,300
Ask him. He took Che's wristwatch? He's got Che's wristwatch.

1452
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,860
He wears it. Wow. Yeah.

1453
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,140
He wears it to this day.

1454
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:55,820
One in five Americans has learning a new language on their bucket list.

1455
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:59,100
And if that's you, make 2024 your year

1456
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,460
by checking that off your bucket list with Babel.

1457
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:06,100
Babel's quick 10 minute lessons are handcrafted by over 200 language experts

1458
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:09,460
to help you start speaking a new language in as little as three weeks.

1459
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:12,500
I always binge Babel's courses when I'm gearing up to go on a trip.

1460
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,100
It helps me to prepare my conversational skills

1461
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,940
so I can deal with real people in real life situations

1462
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:21,540
when I'm ordering food or asking for directions or dealing with merchants.

1463
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:25,060
And to me, what helps set Babel above the rest is their speech recognition

1464
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,380
technology, which helps hone in your accent and pronunciation.

1465
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:32,460
Studies from Yale, Michigan State and others continue to prove Babel is better.

1466
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:35,700
One study found that using Babel for 15 hours is equivalent

1467
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,500
to a full semester at college.

1468
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,620
Babel has over 16 million subscriptions sold.

1469
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:42,620
Plus, all of Babel's 14 award winning language courses

1470
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:45,140
are backed by their 20 day money back guarantee.

1478
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,780
Now back to the show.

1479
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:13,660
So, OK, how did you learn about Felix?

1480
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,460
Like initially, how did you find out who he was?

1481
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:21,020
Here's what happened is that is that here's Traficante telling us

1482
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,420
explaining how they did this. Right.

1483
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:27,860
So what they did is is Traficante takes 15 of his guys,

1484
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:32,140
all of whom had been shooters for him down in Havana. Right.

1485
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:36,220
Gun guys. And they are all he takes guys that are all been recruited

1486
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:39,700
by the Central Intelligence Agency to work in Operation 40,

1487
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:42,420
which is running the raids down into Cuba. Right.

1488
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:45,060
And they've got five paramilitary bases.

1489
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:48,740
They've got one out on Swan Island, one at No Name Key,

1490
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:52,900
one of them in the Everglades and two of them at Lake Pontchartrain,

1491
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:55,300
one on the southern border and one on the northern border.

1492
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,300
The northern the northern base at Lake Pontchartrain

1493
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:04,180
is where Lee Harvey Oswald was working, you know, with the guys in New Orleans.

1494
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:05,420
Right. OK.

1495
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:09,140
And so so the bottom line is they put 15 guys on this assassination team.

1496
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:12,460
And the way they do it is they they're all spread out

1497
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:15,100
in these five paramilitary operations. Right.

1498
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:19,460
And what they do is they send private planes around and pick them up

1499
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:22,900
individually and they fly them to Fort Huachuca in Arizona.

1500
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,900
And they sign them in and then they all disappear.

1501
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:30,420
And they take them down to Oaxaca, Mexico,

1502
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,060
at Clint Murchison Jr.'s ranch down there.

1503
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:35,540
And they have a triangular fireteam base down there.

1504
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:38,340
And a guy named Carl Jenkins is training them.

1505
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:40,220
What does triangular fireteam mean?

1506
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,220
They're they're high powered rifles.

1507
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:46,340
They set up a triangular crossfire to to get three different angles

1508
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:49,780
coming in to shoot and kill a target, a moving target.

1509
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:52,860
OK. OK. And and they were trained down there.

1510
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:56,740
And they were they were tasked to kill Castro.

1511
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:00,300
And that was that and they were called the S-Force was their code name.

1512
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:03,060
You know, say that to Felix and watch how he responds to that one.

1513
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:05,420
The S-Force. The S-Force. That's who they were.

1514
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:11,500
And and and so that they they were tasked to try to kill Castro.

1515
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:16,780
And what what happened is that they they were put together.

1516
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:17,860
They were assembled.

1517
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:21,620
He picked the guys who were also in Operation 40 working with the CIA

1518
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:24,460
so that if any of them got caught,

1519
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:26,940
the agency would have to move in to protect them

1520
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:29,540
because people would think they're the ones that did it.

1521
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,580
But they weren't. But they did.

1522
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:36,100
I mean, but it was it was Nixon that was asking to have it set up.

1523
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,300
But it was set up by Howard Hughes and then Traficante set it up.

1524
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:43,060
But he got to go ahead from from Sheffield Edwards,

1525
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:46,500
who was chief of security for the CIA under Nixon. Right.

1526
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,220
And so that's that's how the thing was set up.

1527
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:54,180
And they but lo and behold, it turns out Nixon didn't get elected.

1528
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,940
And Kennedy got elected.

1529
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:58,860
But Kennedy was not briefed on the existence of this group.

1530
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,780
OK. And what they did is they they set up

1531
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:03,860
going to love this part.

1532
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:06,740
They they set up a mechanism for funding them.

1533
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:10,940
And what they were doing is they were to to fund the Triangular Fire Team

1534
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:14,300
base down in Oaxaca at their at the ranch at Mercheson's Ranch.

1535
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:18,100
What they did is they skimmed cash off the casinos in Vegas.

1536
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:21,380
They would put them into these brand new suitcases.

1537
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:24,100
They put them in the trunks of brand new Cadillac automobiles,

1538
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:27,260
and they would drive them from Las Vegas through New Orleans,

1539
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:31,980
where all the money would be audited, you know, by Marcelo's people. Right.

1540
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,860
And then they drive the money all the way to Miami

1541
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:38,020
and deposit it into Meyer Lansky's National Bank of Miami.

1542
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,380
And then what they would do.

1543
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,540
Here it comes.

1544
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:43,940
What they would do is they would wire some of that money

1545
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:47,220
down to the Banco Internacional down in Mexico City.

1546
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,660
And there was a lawyer there by the name of Ogario,

1547
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,380
and they put it into his account.

1548
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:56,740
And that's where they wrote the checks from to pay for all the costs

1549
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,740
for the Triangular Fire Team base.

1550
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:02,580
And that was the bank on which the money that was caught

1551
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:06,060
found in Bernard Barker's pocket in the Watergate Burglary

1552
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:08,900
came directly from that account.

1553
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,500
And that's where that's where Mark Felt was headed for.

1554
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:14,540
Mark Felt was getting set to go down to the bank to find out

1555
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:17,140
what the hell the story is with that account.

1556
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:21,260
When when Pat Gray, who had become the new head of the FBI,

1557
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,420
instead of Mark Felt,

1558
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,260
freaked out about the fact that he was getting set to go down

1559
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:31,580
the next day on the 23rd of June,

1560
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:34,900
following the 17th of June break in. Right.

1561
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:38,780
So he goes on the 21st of June.

1562
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:40,740
Pat Gray goes to the White House

1563
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:44,100
to meet with John Dean

1564
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:47,580
and says to Dean, you know, we got a problem here.

1565
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:51,380
You know, Mark Felt is getting set to go down to Mexico,

1566
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:54,260
to this bank down there to track them,

1567
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:58,180
the sequentially numbered bills that were in Bernard Barker's pocket,

1568
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:00,260
one of the Watergate burglars.

1569
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:03,900
And and so so John Dean goes in and tells

1570
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:07,860
tells most of the chief of staff.

1571
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:09,500
What was his name?

1572
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:12,700
The guy with a crew cut anyway,

1573
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,740
tells him about the the fact that Felt's getting set to go down to the bank

1574
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:19,540
and he needs to find out whether that's going to be a problem.

1575
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:23,260
And so so the what's the guy's name?

1576
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:24,500
Talking about the Mexico City Bank, right?

1577
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,700
Yeah, the Mexico Bank Banko Internacional. Right.

1578
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:31,900
And and so the the bottom line is the chief of staff comes in

1579
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,540
to talk with Richard Nixon in the Oval Office.

1580
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:38,140
And he says, Mr. President, he says, I think we've got a problem here.

1581
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:41,180
And Nixon says, what is it, John? Right.

1582
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:44,620
And he says, you know,

1583
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:48,500
Pat Gray has just come in, has talked with with John Dean

1584
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:52,580
and said that this guy, Mark Felt, is getting set to go down to this bank

1585
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:57,100
down in Mexico City to track these money that was in Bernard Barker's pocket.

1586
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:59,980
Says he wants to know if that's going to cause any trouble.

1587
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,180
There's a big long delay on the tape.

1588
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,900
And Nixon says, look, you've got to go.

1589
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,540
You've got to go and get a hold of Ericman right away.

1590
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:13,180
And you've got to go on over to the agency and you've got to sit down.

1591
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:17,260
You've got to talk to Dick Helms and to Vernon Walters, both.

1592
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:20,740
Make sure they're in the meeting and tell them both that they've got to contact.

1593
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,460
They've got to contact the FBI.

1594
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,780
The agency's got to contact the FBI.

1595
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:28,300
Dick Helms is the head of the right.

1596
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,860
Because you've got to contact the FBI and tell them to get the hell out of that

1597
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:32,780
part of the investigation.

1598
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:35,660
And so the chief of staff, I'm trying to remember his name still,

1599
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:37,900
says to him, well, what is it?

1600
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:39,100
What am I going to tell them?

1601
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,540
What am I going to tell them to say to make them get out of there?

1602
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:47,020
He says, just tell them if you you can't tear off that scab,

1603
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:51,460
if tear off that scab, it's going to it's going to reveal an awful lot of things

1604
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,380
that can't get revealed.

1605
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:55,820
So you just tell Dick Helms and Vernon Walters

1606
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:58,660
that if they don't get out of that right away,

1607
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:03,180
all the Mexico stuff is going to come out about the Bay of Pigs guys.

1608
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:04,980
That's what he said.

1609
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:09,500
That's the smoking gun conversation that nobody can figure out what it means.

1610
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,660
Nobody can figure out what it means.

1611
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:13,780
But that's exactly what he said.

1612
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:18,340
Because as it turns out, the the the guys, the guys in the Watergate Hotel,

1613
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:22,940
in addition to the Cubans were Howard Hughes and Frank Sturgis,

1614
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,220
as you may recall, along with G.

1615
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:27,140
Gordon Liddy. OK.

1616
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:31,940
But it turns out that Frank Sturgis was in control of one of the five

1617
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:35,180
paramilitary bases on no name key. Right.

1618
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:37,260
No, on Swan Island.

1619
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:38,820
He was on Swan Island.

1620
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:41,100
And the other one in the Everglades was the Howard Hunt.

1621
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:45,420
These were the CIA liaisons to those Cubano groups

1622
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,300
that were doing the assaults into into Cuba.

1623
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:52,820
And they were the liaison to the team of people that were put together

1624
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:55,220
to be the assassination team. Right.

1625
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:58,820
And so these are Castro for Castro. Right. That's right.

1626
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:03,420
And so what happened is is that it wasn't the Bay of Pigs thing.

1627
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:05,860
People think, oh, the CIA must kill them because the Bay of Pigs,

1628
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:07,580
they were so upset. That wasn't it.

1629
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:09,940
It was the Cuban Missile Crisis.

1630
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:13,820
The Cuban Missile Crisis in October of sixty two, that what had happened

1631
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:19,860
is the the the Khrushchev and Kennedy had become so totally traumatized

1632
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:23,740
by the fact that they'd come within minutes of a complete

1633
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:26,780
total nuclear annihilation of the planet,

1634
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:31,020
that the two of them started having these secret communications.

1635
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:35,020
And they were actually they they exchanged 18 letters

1636
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:40,180
that people don't know about through through cousins.

1637
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:44,380
His name was that was moving, was delivering the letters back and forth

1638
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,060
between Khrushchev and Kennedy.

1639
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:50,260
And what they were doing is they were the two of them were discussing

1640
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:55,220
disassembling the nuclear warheads of the entire nuclear arsenal

1641
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:57,740
of the United States and Russia.

1642
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:01,740
And they just freaked out when they found out about this

1643
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:03,660
and said, this guy's got to go.

1644
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:05,420
Kennedy, Kennedy's got to go.

1645
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:07,060
We can't wait for the election.

1646
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:10,900
You know, this is this is November of sixty two or sixty three rather.

1647
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,020
You know, it's a whole year before the election.

1648
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:16,820
He's going to exercise his executive authority as the commander in chief

1649
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:19,260
to order the disassembling of the nuclear warheads.

1650
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:22,500
And Khrushchev is going to do the same for the Soviet Union.

1651
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:25,980
And it's going to be brokered by John the 23rd.

1652
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:30,860
Pope John the 23rd is going to be the broker of making sure they both comply

1653
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:33,820
with this because Khrushchev liked him and trusted him.

1654
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,900
And of course, Kennedy did, too.

1655
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:38,460
And that's the process that was underway.

1656
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:43,060
And so what happened is the the Cuban guys wanted wanted to kill

1657
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:48,180
wanted to kill Kennedy because when when the when the Cuban

1658
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:51,980
Missile Crisis had happened, that he was so freaked out

1659
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:55,820
that he ordered the shutting down of all five of the bases.

1660
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:01,100
And it was freaked out that that Kennedy was so freaked out

1661
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:05,660
about how close they had come to having nuclear war that he promised Khrushchev

1662
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:08,700
that he was because what happened is after the Bay of Pigs,

1663
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:14,300
Kennedy apologized, right, for for having authorized the attempted invasion

1664
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:16,140
at the Bay of Pigs.

1665
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:18,340
Yeah. And there was also there was declassified.

1666
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:20,860
There was there was two operations.

1667
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:23,340
I think one was called Northwoods and there was another one.

1668
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:25,580
Maybe it was just Northwoods where they were going to have Northwoods.

1669
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:27,420
They were going to have they were going to fly a plane,

1670
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:30,460
a remote controlled plane and blow it up and say the Cubans did it.

1671
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:33,340
And they were also going to have some attacking Cubans

1672
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:36,260
killing people in Miami and three things.

1673
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:39,820
They were going to blow up an airplane and say that it had been done by Castro.

1674
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,380
They were going to attack Guantanamo base.

1675
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:45,460
They were actually going to dress up a number of

1676
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:50,540
Cuban refugees in Cuban military uniforms and attack and kill

1677
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:53,380
personnel at the Guantanamo military base.

1678
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:57,540
And they were going to blow up shopping malls in Miami,

1679
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:01,980
is specifically targeting members of the Cuban,

1680
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:05,540
anti Castro Cuban refugee community to blow them up,

1681
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:10,820
to totally make them hysterical so that they would then be able to blame it on

1682
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,220
Castro. Right.

1683
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:15,540
So all of that all that stuff was going on.

1684
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:18,740
But after the after the the Bay of Pigs

1685
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:23,900
fiasco, Kennedy apologized and took responsibility for it.

1686
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:28,260
Right. And then what he did is he promised Khrushchev

1687
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:33,500
that he would stand down Operation 40 that was running the attacks

1688
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:36,460
under Nixon that had been running the attacks on the island.

1689
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:38,340
Right. And against Cuba.

1690
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:41,140
And so Kennedy said he was going to stand them down.

1691
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:45,540
And then he went down to Miami and in the Orange Bowl did a big presentation

1692
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:49,820
to the Cuban community that he gave them his solemn word

1693
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:54,340
that the flag of a free Cuba would fly over the island by the end of his second

1694
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:57,380
term. He gave them that promise, that solemn promise.

1695
01:37:57,380 --> 01:38:01,540
Right. And the problem is he didn't he didn't order them shut down.

1696
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:06,580
He had lied to to Khrushchev and they just transformed Operation 40

1697
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,340
into a thing called J.M.

1698
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,300
Wave and they ran it off the Miami base.

1699
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:14,340
They had a great big base called J.M.

1700
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:19,020
Wave and they they changed it from Operation 40 to Operation

1701
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:21,340
Mongoose was the code name for it.

1702
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:23,700
Right. Right. OK. But he continued to run it.

1703
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:28,420
And so what happened is when when Khrushchev realized that Kennedy had lied to him

1704
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:31,780
after the Bay of Pigs and he was not standing down the operation,

1705
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:34,060
that's when he started sending the missiles in.

1706
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:37,100
Right. OK. And so he put all those missiles in.

1707
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:40,980
And when Kennedy later in October of 62 found out about it,

1708
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:45,940
that's that's from April of 1960 when they actually had the Bay of Pigs thing

1709
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:50,820
happened. There was almost two years later in October when they discovered that

1710
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:51,900
the missiles were there.

1711
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:58,340
But in the interim, what had happened is is that when the missile crisis

1712
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:00,900
came down in October of 62,

1713
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:06,420
Kennedy and Khrushchev, I said, were so freaked out by it that they started exchanging

1714
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:10,660
these these letters and that they were trying to have a detente.

1715
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:16,420
And they were going to be not only not only was Kennedy going to

1716
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:24,140
to agree to shut down the bases, but he ordered the shutting down of the bases.

1717
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,260
And he said, this is for real this time.

1718
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:29,340
You know, he had lied before saying they were going to close him down and they

1719
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:31,580
didn't. But now he ordered him to close down.

1720
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:37,020
And Frank Sturgis from Swan Island, after receiving the order from the president

1721
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:41,500
to shut down all those bases, Frank Sturgis launched another attack against

1722
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:46,340
Cuba and sank a Russian ship in the harbor of Havana

1723
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:49,900
that could have caused a total shit storm, you know,

1724
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:53,380
and would have caused Khrushchev to think that Kennedy was lying to him again.

1725
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:57,620
So Bobby and John sent in six helicopter gunships

1726
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:02,180
filled with U.S. Marshals and burnt out Swan Island,

1727
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:06,700
the base and arrested the people there, including Frank Sturgis and the guys.

1728
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:09,700
And they arrested them and charged them with the Violation Neutrality Act.

1729
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:12,220
And the guys were furious at him. Right.

1730
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:16,100
And then he released them after three days saying, that's a shot across the bow.

1731
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,860
Knock it off. Right. But then E.

1732
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:24,100
Howard Hunt over in the Everglades started planning a second attack against Cuba

1733
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:28,140
in complete defiance of the orders of the president to shut down those bases and

1734
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:29,900
cease and desist from that program.

1735
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:33,260
And Howard Hughes was getting set to do it again.

1736
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:37,900
And Kennedy and Bobby and John sent in the helicopter gunships and burnt out

1737
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:42,260
the base in the Everglades and arrested them all and charged them.

1738
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:45,300
And these guys were dedicated. They're going to kill this asshole. Right.

1739
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:50,300
And so that was that was all in October, November, December,

1740
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:53,620
actually, December of 1962. All that happened. Right.

1741
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:59,820
And and when Kennedy was then mounted,

1742
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:02,620
he was exchanging these letters with Khrushchev. Right.

1743
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:06,940
These 18 letters with Norman Cousins delivering the letters back and forth.

1744
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:08,340
And they were planning to do this thing.

1745
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:13,020
And one of the things that Kennedy was going to do as a show of good faith is on

1746
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:16,060
June 5th of 1963,

1747
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:21,780
same day that Walter Sullivan ended up reporting to Bobby that there was an

1748
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:25,700
assassination team that had been fielded to kill Castro,

1749
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:28,820
which they didn't even know about. It's all total bullshit.

1750
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:32,860
People trying to lie and say that the Kennedys put together the assassination

1751
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,700
team to kill Castro. Totally untrue.

1752
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:38,580
It was Richard Nixon and we've got it directly from Santos Traficante that gave

1753
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:42,540
us all the details of how it was done and when it was done and who was in it and

1754
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:45,300
everything. Right. And so what,

1755
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:49,100
what Kennedy did is on June 5th of 1963,

1756
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:53,820
Walter Sullivan tells Bobby Kennedy about the assassination team.

1757
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:58,500
Kennedy orders them to stand that operation down and what they do is in

1758
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,420
defiance of the, of the order,

1759
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:05,580
they put together one last attempt to go into the Island of Cuba and assassinate

1760
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:10,220
Castro. That took place between June 13th and 19th of 1963.

1761
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:14,540
You know, and it was guys from the assassination team, guys from the S force.

1762
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:18,700
And they, they were under the, under the leadership.

1763
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,260
We know exactly who ran them all.

1764
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:24,980
One of my investigators was on the boat with them.

1765
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:27,380
Actually, when they went down there,

1766
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:30,660
when they went down to the assassination. Cause he, at the time was the,

1767
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:34,500
was the head of the Miami office of life magazine.

1768
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:40,540
And, and what's it said? The, the guy, the loose,

1769
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:44,620
Henry loose, who's the head of a time magazine in life magazine,

1770
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:48,700
wanted to have a person on board when they got it so they could get the pictures

1771
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:51,860
of the people that went and assassinated Castro. Right.

1772
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:55,940
And so Dick Billings is on the boat assigned to go on the boat with them.

1773
01:42:56,260 --> 01:43:00,460
And so we know perfectly well that they tried another assassination attempt

1774
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:02,740
against Castro on, on the fifth of,

1775
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:07,420
from the order to stand down on June 5th of 1963.

1776
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:10,900
And on the same day, Kennedy, you know,

1777
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:14,540
demanded from the CIA all their UFO information.

1778
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:19,540
Wanted to have all the UFO information cause he was going to give that to, to,

1779
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:22,580
to Khrushchev because they wanted to show,

1780
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:25,740
of show good faith and they wanted to join together in the space,

1781
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:26,900
the space program.

1782
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:32,180
Kennedy offered Khrushchev partnership in the joint U S Soviet

1783
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:36,780
space program and was going to send to him the information about the UFO stuff,

1784
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:39,980
which has caused all kinds of people in the UFO community to go, Oh,

1785
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,420
that's why they killed him.

1786
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:43,500
The reason they killed him is cause he was going to give up the UFO.

1787
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:44,340
That wasn't it.

1788
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:45,180
You know, John Newman?

1789
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:46,300
Yes, I know John.

1790
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,500
He was just sitting here a couple of days ago. Yeah. He is,

1791
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:51,700
he's got a, I mean, he's written, like he's written the books.

1792
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:54,460
He's written all the books on, he's read all the documents,

1793
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:58,100
all the documents. I know he hates when people talk about daily Plaza.

1794
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:00,140
He's like, it's the daily Plaza water cooler.

1795
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:02,460
It's all a distraction from what really happened.

1796
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:06,260
He talks about the, the Colonel Lemitzer and Maxwell Taylor,

1797
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:09,420
who were the joint chief of staff who had the sire and Curtis,

1798
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:13,540
and Curtis Lamey, Curtis Lamey. Yeah. Big Curtis, big Curtis Lamey.

1799
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:14,540
Absolutely. Right.

1800
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:18,580
And they had a big plan for a total and nuclear annihilation of the Soviet

1801
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:21,980
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, absolutely. Oh, absolutely.

1802
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:26,220
No, that whole operation is going down and they were almost completely out of

1803
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:30,420
him under control of Kennedy, you know, and, and, and so, so the,

1804
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:33,900
but the bottom line is, is that what happened is that when,

1805
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:37,540
when they learned of the exchange of these letters and what Kennedy was getting

1806
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:41,740
ready to do, the team was all ready to want to kill him. In fact, on the boat,

1807
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:45,740
on the Flying Tiger, which was William B. Pauley,

1808
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:50,980
William D. Pauley, big honcho owned the big sugar mills

1809
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:55,820
down in, in Cuba and owned the private bus transportation lines in

1810
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:58,660
Cuba. You know, William D. Pauley,

1811
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:02,740
it was on his boat that they went down to try to do that assassination in the

1812
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,740
middle of June of 1963.

1813
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:09,140
And Dick Billings is standing on the deck of the boat, the Flying Tiger II,

1814
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:12,940
along with William D. Pauley in Johnny Marino,

1815
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,180
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny Martini,

1816
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:20,100
Johnny Martini is standing on the boat with him. And

1817
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:26,220
what was the guy's name? Rip Robertson was the guy's name.

1818
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:30,660
Rip Robertson was the actual field commander for the S-Force. It wasn't Carl,

1819
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:34,340
Carl Jenkins didn't, wasn't the field commander. He was the trainer for them.

1820
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:38,820
But Rip Robertson was the field director for these guys, right?

1821
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:43,300
And so, so he's, he's, Rip Robertson is standing on the boat.

1822
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:47,500
William D. Pauley is standing there and Johnny Martino, Martino,

1823
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:50,940
his name was, and Dick Billings are all standing there.

1824
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:55,340
And, and Johnny Martino is just raging about the Kennedys,

1825
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:58,300
about what rotten bastards they are and how they lied.

1826
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:01,300
And they gave their word that they were going to have a free flag of Cuba flying

1827
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:03,780
over there, over the, and he was raging like this.

1828
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:08,780
And William D. Pauley turned to Johnny Martino in the presence of all

1829
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:12,820
those guys and said, don't worry, Johnny, we're going to kill that motherfucker.

1830
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:19,020
And that was, that was on June, that weekend of June 13th,

1831
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:24,220
14th, 15th of 1963 on board the Flying Tiger II with Dick Billings

1832
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:25,420
standing right there next to him.

1833
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:29,940
And Dick has told me the entire story in detail and the first person

1834
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:34,700
proof of it being there, you know? And so that, that's,

1835
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:37,580
so when, as soon as he heard that the president had been killed, he knew,

1836
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:39,340
he said, I knew exactly who had done it.

1837
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:44,100
And he became the chief of staff for the house select committee on assassinations.

1838
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:47,140
So do you think that these,

1839
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:50,940
these Cubans really wanted, I mean,

1840
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:55,500
do you think that had anything to do with the actual assassination of Kennedy?

1841
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:58,460
Or do you think it was the military just using these guys?

1842
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:01,460
No, I mean, they're the ones that did it. I mean,

1843
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:04,260
they're the ones that pulled the trigger, but it was, it was Alan Dulles.

1844
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:08,340
It was Alan Dulles, not because he was disgruntled because he'd been fired as

1845
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,180
the head of the CIA.

1846
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:12,860
The reason he was the head of the CIA is because he was general counsel for

1847
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:16,500
Brown Brothers Harriman. Brown Brothers Harriman is the key to this thing.

1848
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:21,500
Yeah. It's going to sip us up liquid death. Murder your thirst.

1849
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:27,860
Yeah. Brown Brothers Harriman is the key to this thing.

1850
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:33,540
Because Brown Brothers Harriman was the group of like 20 of the richest

1851
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:35,340
families in the, in the country.

1852
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:40,700
The robber barons all came together and this informed this group called the

1853
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:44,420
Brown Brothers Harriman. They were based in New York city.

1854
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:47,820
And the heads of all of the, you know, the, the,

1855
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:50,740
the Carnegie's and the Rockefellers and the, the

1856
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:56,700
Harriman, they owned the rail lines and they owned the steel mills.

1857
01:47:56,940 --> 01:48:01,940
They owned the agribusiness corporations. They owned the cattle association.

1858
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:07,300
They owned these key elements of the major economy of the entire United States

1859
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:12,500
during the robber baron era. You know, openly, I mean, that's who they were.

1860
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:15,020
And they sat and they made policy together.

1861
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,860
And the bottom line is the chief,

1862
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:22,060
the CEO for Brown Brothers Harriman was George Herbert Walker.

1863
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:24,540
That's who he is.

1864
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:28,700
That's the maternal grandfather of George Herbert Walker Bush and the great

1865
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:33,500
grandfather of George Herbert W or George W Walker Bush. Okay.

1866
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:38,500
He's the guy and they, and Alan Dulles was the legal counsel for Brown Brothers

1867
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:40,940
Harriman.

1868
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:45,940
That's why he was appointed to be the first civilian head of the CIA and the guy

1869
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:51,660
who wrote the original memo to Truman recommending the creation of the CIA was

1870
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:55,180
Robert Lovett, who was the senior partner of Brown Brothers Harriman.

1871
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:59,140
This was the crowd in the, just so you,

1872
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:04,220
just so you'll know that George Herbert Walker in 1924 stepped down as the CEO at

1873
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,140
the end of World War I.

1874
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:13,340
He stepped down in 1924 and handed over the CEO position to his brother,

1875
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:17,340
his son-in-law Prescott Bush. Right.

1876
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:20,940
And then he went and set up the union bank of New York,

1877
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:26,180
which was capitalized by the major corporate guys that were the funders and the

1878
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:28,620
supporters of Brown Brothers Harriman. Right.

1879
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:31,060
They were the members in the investment group.

1880
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:33,820
They capitalized the union bank of New York.

1881
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:39,100
They set up a foreign subsidiary of the union bank of New York in the Netherlands

1882
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:43,340
called the bank of shipping and commerce held up by Fritz Theisen.

1883
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:47,180
They completely financed the construction of the international headquarters of

1884
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:52,180
the third Reich. Right. Absolutely stone cold verified.

1885
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:53,180
Right.

1886
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:58,060
Because there was their intention to have the Germany rise to power again after

1887
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:59,380
the end of World War I.

1888
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:05,220
And then they would become the bulwark against Bolshevism in Europe because the

1889
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:10,660
Bolsheviks had taken over in ousted czar Nicholas II at the end of World War I

1890
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:12,980
and withdrawn Russia from World War I.

1891
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:17,500
And the secretary of state under Wilson,

1892
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:19,980
whose name was Robert Lansing,

1893
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:25,740
Robert Lansing was married to the oldest daughter of John W. Foster,

1894
01:50:28,340 --> 01:50:33,340
who was the grandfather of John Foster Dulles and Alan Dulles that he was the

1895
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:41,540
secretary of state in 1893 that that overthrew the Hawaiian islands and the

1896
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:43,940
or through Guam.

1897
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:48,700
Their whole plan was to have Germany stand to stride all of Europe is the

1898
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:53,700
bulwark against Bolshevism and they would go westward out into the Pacific and

1899
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:55,900
they would develop the entire Asian market.

1900
01:50:56,180 --> 01:50:58,860
That was what Brown Brothers Harriman was all up to.

1901
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:00,420
That's what they were going to be doing.

1902
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:04,420
They were funding the rise of the third Reich to control Germany.

1903
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:06,860
And what they did, you love this one.

1904
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:11,980
What they did is Robert Lansing, who was his son-in-law, right.

1905
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:15,140
Of John W. Foster or yeah,

1906
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:20,420
that that he is secretary of state under under Wilson is the one that dispatched

1907
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:28,060
the foreign missionary for the foreign expeditionary force into Russia to try to

1908
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:29,940
crush the Bolsheviks.

1909
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:35,580
There was a straight up military operation run by the United States to send a

1910
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:39,780
foreign military expeditionary force into Russia to try to crush the Bolshevik

1911
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:43,020
revolution in the cradle, which you almost never hear about.

1912
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:43,980
The reason I know about it,

1913
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:47,340
because I had Gov 122 from Henry Kissinger at Harvard college.

1914
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:50,620
He was my professor in foreign United States, American foreign policy.

1915
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:52,140
So we know about this.

1916
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:54,380
Right. And so John W.

1917
01:51:54,380 --> 01:51:56,500
Foster, his son-in-law,

1918
01:51:57,020 --> 01:52:00,660
Robert Lansing is the one that ordered them in to try to crush the Bolshevik

1919
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:04,380
revolution. And he is the guy that supervised the treaty,

1920
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:08,220
the treaty of Versailles in 1918. Right.

1921
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:12,380
And he took his two nephews who were John W.

1922
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:17,540
John Foster Dulles and Alan Dulles, who were the grandsons of John W. Foster.

1923
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:21,700
He was their maternal grandfather. Right. And he put them into,

1924
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:25,060
they were on the staff of the Versailles treaty negotiations.

1925
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:28,420
They're the ones that drafted into the Versailles treaty,

1926
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:32,180
the reparations demands against Germany. Okay.

1927
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:36,900
And so they imposed the reparations demands on Germany had lost World War I.

1928
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:42,300
And then what they did is they turned around and negotiated loans from

1929
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:47,060
the people that were in Brown Brothers Harriman, the investors, to pay,

1930
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:50,940
give loans to the German government to pay the reparations,

1931
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:55,620
which were being paid to corporations who had lost property in the war.

1932
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:58,820
Okay. And then what they did is in exchange for the loans,

1933
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:01,580
they took stock in their major war industry,

1934
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:06,460
the Krupp ball bearing factories and IG Farben chemical core. Right.

1935
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:11,060
So these guys ended up owning major shares of the war industry in

1936
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:11,900
Germany.

1937
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:15,780
And what they were doing is financing the rebuilding of the entire military

1938
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:16,900
machine of Germany.

1939
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:20,740
At the same time they were actually funding through the union bank of New York

1940
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:25,100
in the bank of shipping and commerce in the Netherlands,

1941
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:30,100
building and financing the entire rise of the third Reich to establish them as

1942
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:32,540
the bulwark against Bolshevism in Europe.

1943
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:37,180
When they turned their attention westward to go out into the Pacific and take over

1944
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:39,860
the Hawaiian islands and Guam and the Marshall islands, et cetera,

1945
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:43,980
marching their way onto Asia so they could develop the Asian markets there.

1946
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,860
That's what they call the China lobby.

1947
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:48,340
That's the group that was at Brown Brothers Harriman.

1948
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:53,540
And the reason it's so important is because when Kennedy was talking about

1949
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:56,820
disassembling the warheads of the nuclear arsenal of the United States,

1950
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:57,660
along with Russia's,

1951
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:03,100
that totally freaked them out because they knew that they needed to

1952
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:06,140
have the nuclear weapons, not against Russia,

1953
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:11,740
against China because China could put a billion men in uniform in

1954
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:16,020
the field against them. As they showed them at Incheon in Korea,

1955
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:19,460
they had already showed. And so that's, that's what they were worried about.

1956
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:20,220
Okay.

1957
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:21,500
But also this was the time,

1958
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:24,860
this was a specific time when we had the most nuclear weapons in Russia,

1959
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:25,980
Russia had the least.

1960
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:29,980
That's right. And Russia was willing to disband all the Russian missiles.

1961
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:34,860
And China was agreeing to never build any missiles if the United States would

1962
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:37,660
just stop building them and would disarm.

1963
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:41,700
And just like with poison gas at the end of World War I, the mustard gas,

1964
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:44,460
don't do this anymore. It's completely, you know,

1965
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:47,900
a violation of all the rules of war. You know,

1966
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:50,100
it's a complete violation of the just war theory.

1967
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:54,380
Nuclear weapons are inherently designed to destroy civilian populations by the

1968
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:55,660
millions. You know,

1969
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:59,620
it's a complete and total violation of the just war theory.

1970
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:03,020
And we wrote about this at Jesuit headquarters when I was there as general

1971
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:04,940
council in their social ministry office,

1972
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:08,340
Brian Hare wrote a major piece about their just war theory.

1973
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:13,620
And we got the Jesuit order to agree to condemn the mere possession of nuclear

1974
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:15,580
missiles as a mortal sin,

1975
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:21,460
because it's inherently designed to violate the premises of the just war theory.

1976
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:24,140
Oh, this is a little more complex than you need, but the bottom,

1977
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:29,340
the bottom line is that we've been on top of this for years of monitoring what

1978
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:33,460
these people have been doing. Okay. And that's what they did in that.

1979
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:35,060
So that whole operation, when,

1980
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:39,940
when Kennedy was being so traumatized at the coming right to the brink of

1981
01:55:39,940 --> 01:55:44,860
thermonuclear Holocaust started exchanging the letters with Khrushchev to

1982
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:49,900
disassemble the nuclear warheads of the United States nuclear arsenal and all of

1983
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:54,700
Russia's, these guys said, that's it. This guy's got to go.

1984
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:58,060
We can't leave him in place because he's going to have another whole year to do

1985
01:55:58,060 --> 01:56:00,180
this. And that's why they ordered the killing.

1986
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:04,460
And the fact is the team was there. It was fully prepared, fully trained.

1987
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:08,780
They had maintained a, an arm's length relationship from them.

1988
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:12,740
It wasn't tracked directly to the white house unless somebody ratted out Richard

1989
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:14,740
Nixon. Right. And so,

1990
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:18,780
so what happened is when Kennedy ends up getting killed and people said,

1991
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:21,900
holy shit, it's the S force that killed him.

1992
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:25,860
The agency rolled right into place and started covering up everything,

1993
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:28,500
started destroying evidence, started lying,

1994
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:32,260
started doing everything because they were terrified that they'd be blamed for

1995
01:56:32,260 --> 01:56:35,380
killing the president. And Richard Nixon did the same thing.

1996
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:38,860
He was terrified that he was going to get blamed for killing the president.

1997
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:41,740
You know, and so what happened is Lyndon Johnson,

1998
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:46,940
Lyndon Johnson reached out to, to, uh, Warren, Earl Warren,

1999
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:50,180
the chief justice of the Supreme court and said,

2000
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:54,220
we need to have you head up the Warren commission to investigate the

2001
01:56:54,220 --> 01:56:55,060
assassination.

2002
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:59,580
But the one thing you can't do do not reveal the fact that there was an

2003
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:04,020
assassination team that was in the field to kill Fidel Castro.

2004
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:05,860
Because if that ever leaks out,

2005
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:09,900
people are going to think that Castro found out about the assassination team,

2006
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:14,500
that the Kennedys put together to kill him and probably killed him.

2007
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:17,260
And if they do that, we're going to be into world war three.

2008
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:21,500
And that's how he got real foreign to agree to chair the Warren commission.

2009
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:24,540
And who he put on it to run the commission is Alan Dulles.

2010
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:26,460
Yeah. Why did they get Alan Dulles to run the commission?

2011
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:30,180
Because you would be able to totally total, keep it locked down. Right.

2012
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:33,980
Absolutely. And that's what, and that's what they did. You know,

2013
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:37,260
Felix Rodriguez wasn't a part of that team that killed Kennedy though, right?

2014
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:40,380
Yes, he was. Stop. That's what I just got there telling you.

2015
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:44,220
He was on the S force. It was the S force there in daily plasma. Yes,

2016
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:47,540
he was. Yeah. As was Ed Lansdale, as was,

2017
01:57:47,780 --> 01:57:51,780
as was a rip Robertson or photographs of rip Robertson standing right there.

2018
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:53,980
Are there photographs of Felix there? No.

2019
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:55,820
Then how do we know for sure he was there?

2020
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:57,780
Because he was a major part of the S force.

2021
01:57:57,820 --> 01:58:00,900
Yeah. But we have no proof. He was actually there. No photos. No.

2022
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:04,780
If you don't have photos, it doesn't mean you don't have the proof. I mean,

2023
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:08,140
the fact is no, no. Oh wait. Oh, you need, but you need other kind of evidence.

2024
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:12,060
You need other evidence, paper trail, all kinds of evidence of who the S force

2025
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:16,740
was, you know, and there's one guy remaining living who could tell everybody

2026
01:58:16,740 --> 01:58:19,740
about it, you know, but he hasn't done it yet.

2027
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:24,380
What, what evidence do we have that he was, that Felix was actually there though?

2028
01:58:24,860 --> 01:58:28,500
Cause Rafael Chichi-Quintero told us so. Oh, oh.

2029
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:30,260
Rafael Quintero.

2030
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:33,140
Cause Quintero was there too in the Morales.

2031
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:35,900
The Indian was the guy that pulled the trigger that killed him from the,

2032
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:38,100
from the Noel. That was Roger Morales.

2033
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:43,100
He was the, the, a shooter for the, for the S force, you know.

2034
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:47,420
What did Felix say when you deposed him?

2035
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:50,100
Well, he wouldn't talk about it. All the, all they ever said,

2036
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:52,340
all they ever said is, you know, I take the fifth amendment.

2037
01:58:52,580 --> 01:58:55,700
Has he ever acknowledged anything about the, uh,

2038
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:59,220
the team that was sent to Cuba to kill Castro or?

2039
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:03,700
He's never even admitted that he was in charge of the Ilopango operation,

2040
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:06,700
providing weapons to the Contras. Really? Yeah.

2041
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:11,500
Are you aware of the, uh, the Kiki Camarena case? Oh, sure. I am. Sure. I am.

2042
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:13,420
Do you think Felix was part of that? Was there?

2043
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:18,780
Well, the, the, it was operation Condor that killed him in Condor was based out

2044
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:23,780
of Pemex out of the Mexican national oil corporation. It, uh, uh,

2045
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:26,780
Jose Diaz Sorano. Yeah.

2046
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:31,940
Jose Diaz Sorano who was the head of Pemex was the former business partner

2047
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:36,140
with George Bush senior in the Zapata oil corporation. Uh,

2048
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:41,180
and they, they hid out the assassination team in Pemex's security department.

2049
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:45,900
That's where I feel Chichi Quintero and Felix Rodriguez, you know,

2050
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:48,100
ask Felix about that, you know, ask him, what,

2051
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:52,780
what were you doing in the Pemex security department in Mexico city?

2052
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:57,260
You know, and that's Condor. That's that whole operation.

2053
01:59:57,260 --> 02:00:01,260
The assassination teams that were deployed in South America were all run out of

2054
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:02,580
Pemex, you know,

2055
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:06,060
and the reason they wanted to get a Kiki Camarena is cause he was like being

2056
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:08,220
really loud about Iran Contra.

2057
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:11,860
Well, no, the drug was the, the drug smuggling stuff. I mean,

2058
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:15,860
Kiki Camarena was a major DEA guy. He was a close,

2059
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:19,900
he was a close friend of Michael Levine's Michael Levine was one of the,

2060
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:23,620
the top undercover guys in DEA, you know,

2061
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:27,100
and Kiki Camarena was killed for that reason. But there, there's a,

2062
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:30,980
there's a guy because, but B because he was stopping the drugs, right?

2063
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:33,580
And we wanted, we didn't want that to be stopped.

2064
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:38,180
Not that we didn't want them to be stopped. They were running them. Right. Right.

2065
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:41,820
I interviewed face to face the deputy CIA station chief,

2066
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:44,460
Joseph Berkholder Smith,

2067
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:47,140
who sat right there and told me all about the details.

2068
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:51,940
He had been actually brought to a meeting, you know, in Mexico city,

2069
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:57,060
by, by, what's his name? The guy that was head of the DFS in Mexico.

2070
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:00,660
Nasser Haro. Oh, pull your mic closer. Yeah. Yeah. He was, he was,

2071
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:05,660
he was the Joseph Berkholder Smith, Joseph Berkholder Smith was

2072
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:09,100
brought to a meeting actually by, by Nasser Haro,

2073
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:13,380
who was the head of the DFS in Mexico and sat down right in,

2074
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:17,980
I've been a place called Salta in the Northern Northern tip of,

2075
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:20,380
of Argentina, you know,

2076
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:24,180
sat in the meeting with these guys sitting right there and talking about the

2077
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:25,300
you know,

2078
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:27,700
sat in the meeting with these guys sitting right at the table,

2079
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:32,660
this big open table with the big stone fireplace behind them with the swastika

2080
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:37,060
on the mantle, you know, in there and said, look at, he said, you know,

2081
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:42,060
there's, there's been some discussion that Tom Polgar has just been made the new

2082
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:44,580
head of the station here in Mexico city.

2083
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:49,700
And it's not clear whether you're going to be left on Joe Joseph Berkholder Smith.

2084
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:51,980
It's not clear you're going to be left on as his deputy.

2085
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:54,420
So what we wanted to do is have a talk with you. You know,

2086
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:58,740
we have spent a lot of time and energy creating a major cocaine cartel down in

2087
02:01:58,740 --> 02:01:59,580
Columbia.

2088
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:03,460
And we're going to be moving the cocaine into the United States and a portion of

2089
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:07,860
those funds are going to be used to help finance our war without boundaries

2090
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:10,300
against your enemies and ours.

2091
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:13,220
And we want to make sure that if you're going to be left in place,

2092
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:15,140
that you aren't going to do anything to interfere with that.

2093
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:18,660
Joseph Berkholder Smith said to me, look, Danny, he said,

2094
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:22,820
I don't know what I'd ever done in my life that would have led them to believe

2095
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:25,300
that I would have gone along with that. And I said,

2096
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:29,460
how about being the deputy CIA station chief in Mexico city for a start?

2097
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:33,860
And he turned to Dick Billings, who was sitting there with me,

2098
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:37,700
who was the chief of staff for the house select committee on assassinations by

2099
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:40,340
that time. And he said, Hey,

2100
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:43,220
I thought this guy was going to cooperate with us. And Dick said, look,

2101
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:45,220
I just met the guy. You know,

2102
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:49,660
so that's, those are all detailed stories of people with firsthand knowledge of,

2103
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:52,540
of what it is that they've been doing, you know, now they are,

2104
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:55,060
that they feel perfectly righteous about it. You know,

2105
02:02:55,060 --> 02:02:59,940
I don't doubt that the Rafael Chichi Quintero and Felix Rodriguez and Morales

2106
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:03,180
and Rolando Martinez and, and Ricardo Chavez,

2107
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:06,340
and all the guys that were on the shooter team thought that they were totally

2108
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:09,220
righteous, you know, and doing what they were doing. They were,

2109
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:13,540
they ended up stopping the guy who was a, in their mind,

2110
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:18,060
a total whoremonger, you know, and a lying sack of shit who was president,

2111
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:22,100
you know, basically father bought him the, you know,

2112
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:24,980
the offices that he got. That's how they viewed Kennedy. Yeah.

2113
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:26,900
That's how they viewed Kennedy, you know?

2114
02:03:27,580 --> 02:03:32,340
And he was getting set to use his power to disassemble the nuclear warheads of

2115
02:03:32,340 --> 02:03:36,540
our entire nuclear arsenal, you know? And so that they, they said, you know,

2116
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:38,420
button, put the button on this guy.

2117
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:43,380
Wow. You are like,

2118
02:03:43,620 --> 02:03:48,100
you're like a, a walking historical information machine.

2119
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:51,820
Well, I was at Jesuit headquarters for 10 years, you know, I mean,

2120
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:53,420
they didn't get their reputation for nothing.

2121
02:03:56,940 --> 02:04:00,460
The amount of knowledge you have is incredible, man. It is,

2122
02:04:00,460 --> 02:04:03,820
it is amazing to sit here and listen to you talk about some of this stuff.

2123
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:04,260
There are very,

2124
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:08,180
there are very few people who have got direct firsthand information directly

2125
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:10,340
from Santos Traficante, you know,

2126
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:14,460
about the details of putting together the entire assassination team, you know,

2127
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:19,260
and what his direct relationship is to the, to the Watergate burglary, you know,

2128
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:21,660
nobody, nobody knows about the, the,

2129
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:25,220
the sequentially numbered bills in Bernard Barker's pocket coming from the

2130
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:29,340
Banco Internacional, except for, except for Mark, Mark Flint,

2131
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:33,580
you know, that he knew, he knew it, you know,

2132
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:38,140
and he's deep throat. Wow. That's who he is.

2133
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:42,260
You know, Mark felt, you know, that's the guy. Why they call him deep throat.

2134
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:47,700
That was the nickname that Bob Woodward gave him.

2135
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:51,420
Cause he was the, he was the source of deep throat in the Watergate burglary.

2136
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:55,020
He's the one that kept meeting with Bob Woodward in the garage and,

2137
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:58,940
and pointing him towards, I said, follow the money. He said, follow the money.

2138
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:02,580
And as soon as they got to the money and they discovered the money,

2139
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:07,260
that, that had been deposited into the committee to reelect the president,

2140
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:10,020
had been deposited down in the,

2141
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:14,620
the Ogarrio account in Mexico city and the Banco Internacional, you know,

2142
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:19,500
they said, Oh, bingo. We've got, we've got Richard Nixon's president,

2143
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:23,060
a committee to reelect the president funding the people in the Watergate

2144
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:26,220
hotel. That's it. Bingo. They were stopping right there.

2145
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:29,980
And they never went in deeper and discovered what the hell's the story on that

2146
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:31,460
particular fund that's down there.

2147
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:35,060
It would lead right back to the assassination team that killed the president,

2148
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:37,900
you know, and they, and they, and they settled for it.

2149
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:42,700
Bob Woodward and Bernstein settled for the half a story.

2150
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:46,020
I mean, it was a big hat, a big story that they,

2151
02:05:46,060 --> 02:05:50,820
they got funds that had been given a check from, what's his name?

2152
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:54,500
He wrote the check that went into the bank, into the,

2153
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:58,020
into the Banco Internacional down in Mexico city, you know,

2154
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,220
from the committee to reelect the president.

2155
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:03,220
Now McCone was the head of the CIA.

2156
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:07,180
Yeah, he didn't need no shit. They didn't, they wouldn't tell him anything.

2157
02:06:07,420 --> 02:06:11,060
But was Helms before Cone, Richard Helms?

2158
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:15,620
No, Helms got, Helms got, got indicted, you know,

2159
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:19,460
for lying, for lying to the, to the Congress for that.

2160
02:06:19,460 --> 02:06:23,260
He, he was lying and saying that, that,

2161
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:27,180
that one of the things he lied about is that they,

2162
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:30,740
the Phoenix program only killed 20,000 people,

2163
02:06:31,820 --> 02:06:33,460
whereas they killed vastly more than that.

2164
02:06:33,620 --> 02:06:34,780
Remind me of the Phoenix program.

2165
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:37,940
Phoenix program was the political assassination program that was run by

2166
02:06:37,940 --> 02:06:42,460
Theodore Shackley, who was the CIA station chief in Saigon that,

2167
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:45,540
in that they were using money from the Vang Pao,

2168
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:49,780
the drug money from Vang Pao to finance the Phoenix program.

2169
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:55,380
In Helms, Helms, the man who, who guards the secrets, you know,

2170
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:58,100
he's the one that committed perjury to the,

2171
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:02,540
to Congress to hide the family jewels ended up getting ousted.

2172
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:05,820
He was also the guy who burned all the MK ultra documents, right?

2173
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:11,940
Well, the, it was under him. It was under him personally. Yeah.

2174
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:12,740
Just, just like,

2175
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:17,460
just like the CIA burned all the videos of the Abu Ghraib torture sessions.

2176
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:20,780
You know, they were ordered by Congress to cough them up and they burned them all.

2177
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:22,060
Right. You know what I mean?

2178
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:25,340
So that what we're dealing with is a national security state that's out of

2179
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:27,660
control here, you know, and they're,

2180
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:30,980
they're completely self righteous about what it is they think they're doing,

2181
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:33,260
you know, and, you know,

2182
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:37,340
that any anybody who grew up in the same way that Felix Rodriguez did and

2183
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:40,220
Rafael Chichi Quintero and those guys, you know, their,

2184
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:43,540
their whole world is, you know, is,

2185
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:47,060
they're knowledgeable about the,

2186
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:51,500
what they view as the corrupt nature of Kennedy, you know, I mean,

2187
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:53,340
and they were all sharing the stories about, you know,

2188
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:57,460
I'm fucking anybody who would bend over and, you know, and he was on drugs and he was,

2189
02:07:57,540 --> 02:08:01,300
you know, he, his back was out and he was half on drugs. You know, that's,

2190
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:04,980
that's the kind of stories that are going around inside all about them, you know,

2191
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:09,580
and Chichi Quintero and, and, and these guys were sitting at the kitchen table

2192
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:11,620
with my guy, Gene Wheaton,

2193
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:16,900
who was the chief of security for the US military mission in Tehran and who was a,

2194
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:21,820
who was supplying airplanes to the Contras to fly the drugs and guns around,

2195
02:08:22,220 --> 02:08:26,060
you know, sitting right at the table listening to them talk about the plans that

2196
02:08:26,060 --> 02:08:27,180
they had to kill the president.

2197
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:31,580
That is nuts, man.

2198
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:35,220
Yeah, but it's not, that's the problem.

2199
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:37,740
It really is, man. Like, like, how do you,

2200
02:08:40,580 --> 02:08:47,420
your, what is your worldview of the United States of America and the security state

2201
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:51,020
and like the whole military industrial complex and where we're headed?

2202
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:54,380
Are you at all optimistic with all this information that you know,

2203
02:08:54,380 --> 02:08:57,580
and the people that you've talked to and the cases that you've been involved with,

2204
02:08:57,580 --> 02:09:02,340
like, and, and even going back to like the, the,

2205
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:06,460
the Pentagon papers, like, look at where we're at now in the media.

2206
02:09:07,180 --> 02:09:09,180
Like, I'm sure you're familiar with the Twitter files, right?

2207
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:09,900
Oh, yes.

2208
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:12,180
Where do you think all this is headed?

2209
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:17,060
Well, that I think to be pointed,

2210
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:23,340
I think that the UFO issue presents the greatest possible opportunity for

2211
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:28,380
unveiling the lengths to which the national security state has gone in taking

2212
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:32,260
over the control of the government of the United States,

2213
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:35,420
in that they're fascists, you know,

2214
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:39,260
I mean, that the people who created the central intelligence agency, you know,

2215
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:42,100
they're fascists.

2216
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:51,940
And they believe that the most effective way of running the government is to

2217
02:09:51,980 --> 02:09:56,860
deploy the instrumentalities of the state on behalf of the interests of the major

2218
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:57,700
corporations.

2219
02:09:58,980 --> 02:10:02,180
They believe that what's good for General Motors is good for the country.

2220
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:05,260
And that if you can, and they've got a,

2221
02:10:05,580 --> 02:10:09,220
you ought to get a copy of the 1992 United States Defense Department policy,

2222
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:13,980
planning guidance document that was put out directly after Gorbachev stood back.

2223
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:17,700
You know, Gorbachev disassembled the Soviet Union on March 30,

2224
02:10:17,980 --> 02:10:22,860
on December 31st of 1991. He released all of them. The following Monday,

2225
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:27,380
you know, Paul Wolfowitz, you know, under Dick Cheney,

2226
02:10:27,380 --> 02:10:30,980
who's the secretary of defense for, for George Bush senior, you know,

2227
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:34,860
convenes his group of people in the West wing of the White House.

2228
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:40,660
And you got Paul Wolfowitz and it's under Dick Cheney.

2229
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:46,140
You got Scooter Libby. You got Doug Fife. You got Richard Pearl.

2230
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:50,140
You know, they're all there and they're all the special group inside the

2231
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:52,900
defense department, right? Under Dick Cheney, under Bush.

2232
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:57,420
And they draft up the 1992 United States Defense Department policy,

2233
02:10:57,420 --> 02:10:59,940
planning guidance document. And they're saying, oh good,

2234
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:04,660
the Soviet Union has stood back out of the cold war. They've stood down.

2235
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:08,900
And now we're going to have all kinds of pressure put on us to try to cut the

2236
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:12,460
military budget because for the last 50 years, you know,

2237
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:17,180
we've been justifying spending now up to $700 billion a year on the

2238
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:20,820
military because we have to stop the Soviet Union from taking over the world.

2239
02:11:21,220 --> 02:11:24,300
Right. And that's the rationale that's been put forth for all this time for

2240
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:27,180
this massive military program. You know, the United States,

2241
02:11:27,220 --> 02:11:31,460
the United States spends more money on the military every year than the next 10

2242
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:33,580
countries in the world. It's insane. Right.

2243
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:37,260
We've got 800 military bases all around the world, you know,

2244
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:39,420
and we're invading places all over the place.

2245
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:42,780
Most people don't even know about, like everyone focuses on Ukraine and what's

2246
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:46,140
going on in Palestine, but there's so many other wars that are going on.

2247
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:50,980
And what I'm saying is, is that the, that this,

2248
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:54,500
this operation has this, this,

2249
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:58,980
from the age of the robber barons in the age of the robber barons that began in

2250
02:11:59,020 --> 02:12:03,300
1868 after the American civil war, right by 1872,

2251
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:07,300
they had actually come up with this concept of creating this new private,

2252
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:11,820
private shareholder owned corporations in that this,

2253
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:16,540
this business entity actually immunizes the owners of the

2254
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:21,420
company from any personal liability whatsoever for whatever the corporation

2255
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:22,260
does.

2256
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:26,700
That that's an essential element of the creation of the new business vehicle of

2257
02:12:26,700 --> 02:12:29,220
the private shareholder owned corporation.

2258
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:33,940
So that the corporation itself is the only thing that's liable for anything the

2259
02:12:33,940 --> 02:12:38,660
corporation does is the shareholders are completely immunized and the,

2260
02:12:38,660 --> 02:12:42,180
the, the board of directors are personally immunized. Okay.

2261
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:44,980
And even the management people are personally immunized.

2262
02:12:44,980 --> 02:12:49,140
You can only sue the company itself because the company itself is a person,

2263
02:12:50,140 --> 02:12:54,580
you see. Now it wasn't the citizens United was the first time that they came up

2264
02:12:54,580 --> 02:12:55,980
with that idea. You know,

2265
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:59,340
that was what the whole fight was about back in 1934 when they,

2266
02:12:59,340 --> 02:13:01,820
the whole court packing issue with Franklin Roosevelt,

2267
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:03,140
when he was offering to,

2268
02:13:03,180 --> 02:13:05,860
was threatening to appoint more people to the Supreme court.

2269
02:13:06,180 --> 02:13:10,300
It was because the United States Supreme court kept ruling consistently that

2270
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:15,540
corporations were persons who were entitled to fundamental rights under the,

2271
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:19,980
under the constitution. And therefore you couldn't interfere with, you couldn't,

2272
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:24,940
you couldn't regulate their advertising because it's free speech, you know,

2273
02:13:24,940 --> 02:13:27,340
and you couldn't interfere with their right to contract,

2274
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:31,620
which is a constitutional right that people have the freedom of the contracts

2275
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:32,780
right in the constitution.

2276
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:37,180
And so therefore you can't support labor unions because it's interfering with

2277
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:41,580
the right of the corporation to negotiate one-on-one with people for a contract

2278
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:44,740
for their employment. And they were ruling this over and over again,

2279
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:48,500
all right after the 1929 crash, you know,

2280
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:52,260
by 1932 when, when Franklin Roosevelt was elected,

2281
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:55,780
Franklin Roosevelt started issuing all of these executive orders,

2282
02:13:56,100 --> 02:14:00,980
trying to get control over the excesses of the corporate investors

2283
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:04,660
in the corporations that had run rough shot over things. Right.

2284
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:08,260
And so what he was doing is issuing all kinds of federal executive orders.

2285
02:14:08,620 --> 02:14:12,820
And this group of people, Brown brothers, Harriman people, the Duponts,

2286
02:14:13,060 --> 02:14:18,020
particularly were engaged in planning a military overthrow of

2287
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:22,100
Franklin Roosevelt in 1934. That whole thing with General Butler,

2288
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:23,940
that he, he was,

2289
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:28,500
they tried to recruit him to mount a major military coup against the

2290
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:31,180
against the United States government. So, I mean,

2291
02:14:31,180 --> 02:14:35,580
this thing comes right out of the robber barons who had created this particular

2292
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:40,420
device, this business vehicle of a private shareholder owned

2293
02:14:40,420 --> 02:14:43,940
corporation that was deemed to be its own independent person.

2294
02:14:44,260 --> 02:14:47,980
And liability ran just to the corporation and all the rest of the people were

2295
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:51,500
immunized against any personal liability. And their,

2296
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:55,740
their mandate was to maximize the short-term profits

2297
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:59,500
for the purposes of giving shareholders, you know,

2298
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:02,820
income from the income that they made.

2299
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:05,460
And that vehicle is a sinful structure.

2300
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:08,260
That's what we designated as a Jesuit headquarters.

2301
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:12,740
It's an inherently sinful structure because it's driven by greed and self-interest

2302
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:15,460
and avarice. In fact,

2303
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:19,500
you can be dismissed as a member of the board of a corporation.

2304
02:15:19,740 --> 02:15:22,340
If you take into account the public interest,

2305
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:27,220
it's called the doctrine of ultra various. It's called, you know,

2306
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:31,940
and it's a specific doctrine. It's in the books of the law over corporations.

2307
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:35,540
And so what happened is those corporations between 1872,

2308
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:38,460
when they first established that as a new business vehicle,

2309
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:43,100
between 1872 and 1898 when McKinley

2310
02:15:44,060 --> 02:15:48,420
came to power in 1898 and his,

2311
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:52,140
Mark Hanna was his, his,

2312
02:15:53,660 --> 02:15:57,180
his kind of major advisor. And Mark Hanna

2313
02:15:58,740 --> 02:16:02,980
said that the greatest ambition that any human being could possibly have to is

2314
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:06,060
earn as much money as he possibly can before he dies. That's,

2315
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:10,380
that's the quote from Mark Hanna and that's, that's, that's McKinley, right?

2316
02:16:10,700 --> 02:16:15,700
And they had, they had risen to the power in 1898 where it became the age of the

2317
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:19,580
robber barons, right? And it was also not coincidentally,

2318
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:24,180
the age of American imperialism. And it's called that in history books.

2319
02:16:24,380 --> 02:16:26,180
It's the age of American imperialism.

2320
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:30,700
And it was the person who sort of supervised that whole age of American

2321
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:33,260
imperialism was John W.

2322
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:36,180
Foster, who was the secretary of state.

2323
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:38,860
And he's the one that, that, as I said,

2324
02:16:39,380 --> 02:16:42,860
overthrew the Hawaiian islands, Guam, the Marshall islands,

2325
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:47,140
all moving out across the Pacific. That was what their whole objective was.

2326
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:51,700
And they were operating right out of Brown brothers Harriman who were in charge

2327
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:56,420
of organizing the Versailles treaty, you know, under Robert Lansing, you know,

2328
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:58,980
who was the son-in-law of, of John W.

2329
02:16:58,980 --> 02:17:02,460
Foster, who was the grandfather of John Foster Dulles and Alan Dulles.

2330
02:17:02,780 --> 02:17:06,180
And Alan Dulles was the legal counsel for Brown brothers Harriman,

2331
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:11,020
where these families were all together cooperating in planning how to take over

2332
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:15,820
the American government and how to put the instrumentalities of the government at

2333
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:18,540
the behest of the interests of the private corporations.

2334
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:23,260
That's why they sent the United States military expeditionary force in 1903 into

2335
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:27,340
Nicaragua to overthrow the government down there on behalf of United Fruit,

2336
02:17:28,180 --> 02:17:30,260
who was a client of Sullivan and Cromwell.

2337
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:35,100
Sullivan and Cromwell was the law firm that Alan Dulles and John Foster Dulles

2338
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:39,020
were members, were partners in, being legal counsel for Brown brothers Harriman.

2339
02:17:39,300 --> 02:17:41,140
That's who these people are. I mean,

2340
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:43,500
these people get up and put their pants on one leg at a time,

2341
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:46,740
just like anything else. If you investigate them closely enough, you'll find it.

2342
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:50,220
If you can remember the names of everybody,

2343
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:53,500
if you can remember the pattern of where they are, they go, oh yeah,

2344
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:56,860
there they are again. You know, oh, here they are again. Here's the bank.

2345
02:17:56,900 --> 02:18:00,540
That's they're the ones doing it, you know? And so we know who they are.

2346
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:05,060
We know what their lineage is. And we know that these are the people,

2347
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:08,340
for example, that in 1945,

2348
02:18:08,780 --> 02:18:13,580
in 1945 December after the dropping of the atomic

2349
02:18:13,580 --> 02:18:17,700
bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, remember the, the,

2350
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:22,060
the Nazis in Germany had surrendered in May of 1945,

2351
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:23,660
but the Japanese had not.

2352
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:29,340
And so the Japanese knew that the entire allied forces were going to turn their

2353
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:31,220
attention to Japan, right?

2354
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:36,100
And so they started removing all the gold and silver and platinum and jewels and

2355
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:41,140
stuff that had been garnered over a 30 year period by the

2356
02:18:41,140 --> 02:18:45,700
Japanese empire had been sweeping all through South Asia, you know,

2357
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:50,380
in taking all the gold and silver and platinum and everything and bringing it

2358
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:55,340
into Japan as their war chest for the major imperial war

2359
02:18:55,340 --> 02:18:58,100
that the Japan was getting ready to mount. Okay.

2360
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:00,460
And they had all of those riches that were there.

2361
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:03,420
So what they did is they smuggled them out and they moved them into the

2362
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:07,300
Philippines and they buried them in 176 separate

2363
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:10,260
tranches in the Philippines, like, you know,

2364
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:15,260
like 700 feet deep, the huge mine shafts that they built,

2365
02:19:15,540 --> 02:19:17,700
you know, and they did it with slave labor.

2366
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:23,180
And the people who dug the mine shafts and they buried a hundred.

2367
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:24,300
The Japanese were doing this.

2368
02:19:24,340 --> 02:19:29,180
Japanese are doing this a hundred, a hundred billion

2369
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:33,500
dollars each, each trove,

2370
02:19:33,740 --> 02:19:38,220
176 troves of a hundred billion dollars each

2371
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:42,100
in gold. I mean, the photographs that you can see in the, they're,

2372
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:46,060
they're shoulder high stacks of gold bullion, as big as football fields.

2373
02:19:46,060 --> 02:19:49,740
You can see them and they buried them under the, in the Philippines. Right.

2374
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:51,980
And in the G two,

2375
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:56,420
the G two for the United States army in Manila was Ed Lansdale.

2376
02:19:56,820 --> 02:20:01,700
Edward Lansdale had been an OSS guy and Truman disbanded the OSS as

2377
02:20:01,700 --> 02:20:05,860
soon as the Nazis surrendered in May of 1945.

2378
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:10,860
So he just, he distributed everybody from the OSS out around the world. Right.

2379
02:20:10,900 --> 02:20:14,180
And Ed Lansdale ended up being the G two in Manila.

2380
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:19,780
And he knew that the guy who was in charge of gathering all of

2381
02:20:19,780 --> 02:20:23,260
that gold and silver together was a guy named General Yakushima.

2382
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:28,740
General Yakushima was the guy who ran a thing called the golden lily was

2383
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:30,740
the Chinese code name for the,

2384
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:35,620
for the unit that was into pilfering all the gold and silver and platinum all

2385
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:38,380
through Asia and bringing it into Japan.

2386
02:20:38,620 --> 02:20:43,220
And he supervised the burying of these 176 troves in the Philippines.

2387
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:45,580
And what happened is Ed Lansdale,

2388
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:50,180
when General Yakushima turned himself in surrendered after the Japanese

2389
02:20:50,180 --> 02:20:51,020
surrendered,

2390
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:56,060
he kidnapped the driver for Yakushima

2391
02:20:56,940 --> 02:21:01,340
and torch had him tortured to find out where some of these treasures were.

2392
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:02,460
And they actually,

2393
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:06,020
they actually found 12 of these out of the 176,

2394
02:21:06,460 --> 02:21:10,580
$1.2 trillion at

2395
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:15,740
$32 an ounce of gold, which is now like $1,400 an ounce. Right.

2396
02:21:16,220 --> 02:21:21,060
And what they did is they, they punched one of those, those, and he,

2397
02:21:21,380 --> 02:21:25,740
yeah, there they are. That this, this is the people, people,

2398
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:27,500
people don't understand it. Yamashita.

2399
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:32,300
Generally Yamashita is the guy that, that stored all this gold there.

2400
02:21:33,060 --> 02:21:37,780
And Ed Lansdale got his hands on 12 of 12 of these troves for

2401
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:42,780
$1.2 trillion in true. He had Truman McCarthy,

2402
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:45,980
MacArthur, General MacArthur set up a private,

2403
02:21:46,060 --> 02:21:50,660
they set up a private trust under Truman that was run by

2404
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:53,580
Brown Brothers Harriman for $1.2 trillion.

2405
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:58,260
They, they, they took the 12 of them, the $1.2 trillion,

2406
02:21:58,540 --> 02:22:01,900
and they shipped it all out and they put it in the international credit and

2407
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:03,900
international credit bank in Geneva,

2408
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:08,060
Switzerland and issued gold certificates on it to pay for covert operations,

2409
02:22:08,540 --> 02:22:10,420
you know, completely independent from Congress.

2410
02:22:10,420 --> 02:22:12,780
Never told Congress about it at all to this day.

2411
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:15,340
I've never told Congress about it, you know,

2412
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:17,500
and they've been using it as covert operations.

2413
02:22:18,540 --> 02:22:20,940
You know, they got, they've got all of it still.

2414
02:22:22,420 --> 02:22:25,140
Because what they did is they issued gold certificates. They didn't,

2415
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:28,140
they didn't have to do anything with the gold. They left it there.

2416
02:22:28,340 --> 02:22:31,740
What they did is they issued gold certificates that are just like bearer bonds

2417
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:33,260
and they use them for cash.

2418
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:37,660
And it's a, it's a major source of funds for the covert operations.

2419
02:22:38,380 --> 02:22:41,540
You know, I mean, that's what we've been dealing with all this time.

2420
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:42,740
That's how people kept saying,

2421
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:45,300
how in the world did these people know all this stuff? You know,

2422
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:46,900
they were going crazy because we set up,

2423
02:22:47,060 --> 02:22:50,220
we set up the Christchurch Institute out of Washington, DC,

2424
02:22:50,220 --> 02:22:51,540
out of the Jesuit headquarters.

2425
02:22:51,860 --> 02:22:55,740
We set up the Christchurch Institute as a 501c3 public interest law firm.

2426
02:22:56,140 --> 02:23:00,060
And I had access to all these investigators out of Bailey's office. You know,

2427
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:05,420
we had, we had like 30 class a licensed gun toters that were investigators for

2428
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:06,540
us, you know,

2429
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:10,740
and we're in the public interest domain because most all of these guys want to

2430
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:15,180
be good guys, you know, and that they gotten, they've gotten perverted. You know,

2431
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:18,380
they, they come in to try to, try to do,

2432
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:23,260
do right and they discover that the people they work for major corporations,

2433
02:23:23,580 --> 02:23:27,260
you know, CIA or government agencies that they're corrupted.

2434
02:23:27,660 --> 02:23:29,620
And so we set up the Christchurch Institute,

2435
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:32,820
which gave everybody a chance to be good guys, you know,

2436
02:23:32,820 --> 02:23:36,540
and try to just find out what's going on and what they're doing, you know,

2437
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:41,060
and if you disagree with what they're doing, you know, then tell us, you know,

2438
02:23:41,780 --> 02:23:44,540
so that, you know, so,

2439
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:46,700
so the bottom line is we've been doing,

2440
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:50,300
we've been in this business now for like 50 years, you know,

2441
02:23:50,300 --> 02:23:53,540
and we ran the Christchurch Institute for 20 years in Washington, DC.

2442
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:55,940
We've run the Romero Institute, you know,

2443
02:23:55,940 --> 02:23:59,220
for 20 years in California because George H.W.

2444
02:23:59,220 --> 02:24:04,220
Bush ordered the revocation of our 501c3 tax exempt charter for the Christchurch

2445
02:24:05,020 --> 02:24:09,580
Institute because of our bringing the Iran-Contra federal criminal racketeering

2446
02:24:09,580 --> 02:24:12,060
charges against the off the shelf enterprise.

2447
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:15,500
And we just exposed everything about them and their drug smuggling and the

2448
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:20,500
assassination programs and everything. And and when the judge in Miami,

2449
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:25,940
dismissed our case because he,

2450
02:24:25,940 --> 02:24:30,940
he excluded four eyewitnesses who in the case who could verify this case we

2451
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:35,540
brought under the federal criminal racketeering act, he dismissed the case.

2452
02:24:36,380 --> 02:24:41,380
And George Bush contacted his politically appointed head of the internal

2453
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:47,100
revenue service and directed him to yank our 501c3 tax exempt charter on the

2454
02:24:47,860 --> 02:24:52,740
grounds that nobody had been ultimately criminally convicted of the charges that

2455
02:24:52,740 --> 02:24:53,820
we made against them,

2456
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:58,900
even though six of them had already been indicted by the special prosecutor,

2457
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:02,860
Lawrence Walsh, right? For exactly what we charged them with.

2458
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:08,180
And then he pardoned them after he was beaten in the 1992 election in November

2459
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:13,660
by, by, you know, Bill Clinton,

2460
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:19,020
but more importantly by Ross Perot who took 19% of the vote away from George Bush

2461
02:25:19,580 --> 02:25:24,580
because Ross Perot was a guy I was flying around in his Learjet with him telling

2462
02:25:26,300 --> 02:25:27,260
him all about this.

2463
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:31,660
And in Ross Perot was the guy that brought the complaint to the FBI,

2464
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:33,940
to Bill Webster. And that's why,

2465
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:37,140
that's why they initiated the investigation of the Iran Contra people.

2466
02:25:37,740 --> 02:25:38,420
And so,

2467
02:25:38,420 --> 02:25:42,220
so Ed Meese caught his hair on fire and freaked out and ran in and held an

2468
02:25:42,220 --> 02:25:45,060
immediate press conference going, Oh, what do you know? Faith and Bogota.

2469
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:48,740
We discovered that there's this young renegade Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North,

2470
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:53,340
who's run off and basically gone recruiting old retired military people,

2471
02:25:53,340 --> 02:25:53,580
you know,

2472
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:57,580
on the golf courses around Virginia and set up this kind of off the shelf

2473
02:25:57,580 --> 02:26:01,540
enterprise. Oh, you know, we better have a special prosecutor appointed.

2474
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:03,180
And I, Ed Meese,

2475
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:08,420
will draft up the charter to limit their investigation to whether the president

2476
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:15,500
directly authorized the transfer of the profits that were generated by the sale

2477
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:21,060
of tow missiles to the Hezbollah, to the Contras, you know,

2478
02:26:21,060 --> 02:26:24,460
under Adolfo Calero, whether he did that, you know,

2479
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:27,620
and whether the president authorized that in writing. And if he did,

2480
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:30,660
then he could get in trouble. But if he didn't, then we're all okay.

2481
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:34,820
And so he crafted the, the, the, uh, he,

2482
02:26:35,060 --> 02:26:39,340
he crafted the charter for the special prosecutor in the, in the, the, uh,

2483
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:43,580
Iran Contra case so narrowly that he thought he was going to get away with it.

2484
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:44,500
And not only that,

2485
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:48,860
but the person they selected to be the special prosecutor to investigate it was

2486
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:52,300
Lawrence Walsh, you know, a noted repug,

2487
02:26:52,580 --> 02:26:57,580
and it turns out Lawrence Walsh was the Lawrence Walsh was the senior partner in

2488
02:26:57,740 --> 02:26:59,980
Crow Dunleavy, which is the law firm.

2489
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:03,340
We kicked the absolute out of in the Karen Silkwood case for 10 and a half

2490
02:27:03,340 --> 02:27:04,300
million dollars.

2491
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:08,020
And they thought that he was just furious with us because we destroyed his

2492
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:09,380
reputation as a law firm.

2493
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:13,020
And we just mopped the floor with them in that case because we had everything on

2494
02:27:13,380 --> 02:27:14,340
them. You know, and the,

2495
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:18,780
and they picked him to be the special prosecutor and it backfired because he

2496
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:20,260
knew we were right. I mean,

2497
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:23,540
he'd already paid the price for not understanding that we knew what we were

2498
02:27:23,540 --> 02:27:24,180
doing.

2499
02:27:24,180 --> 02:27:28,020
And so we were the very first ones contacted by Lawrence Walsh to fill him in on

2500
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:30,420
what was going on. And he indicted the shit out of these people.

2501
02:27:31,020 --> 02:27:34,100
I was going after all of them and he was going after George Bush,

2502
02:27:34,100 --> 02:27:37,980
senior because who was totally involved in it. You know, George,

2503
02:27:37,980 --> 02:27:40,140
George Bush, who was the vice president under,

2504
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:44,060
under Reagan is the one who coordinated the whole off the shelf enterprise

2505
02:27:45,060 --> 02:27:49,500
as the head of the 5412 committee, just like, just like Nixon had been under

2506
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:50,340
Eisenhower.

2507
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:54,300
He was the head of the 5412 committee as the vice president in Nixon's,

2508
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:58,420
Nixon's national security or Bush's national security advisor,

2509
02:27:58,620 --> 02:28:03,420
Donald P. Greg was having direct face to face meetings with Felix Rodriguez.

2510
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:08,060
Okay. Who was running the Ilepongo air operations,

2511
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:12,660
delivering the weapons and smuggling the cocaine right on the same airplanes.

2512
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:13,820
In fact,

2513
02:28:13,820 --> 02:28:18,820
the head of the DEA took photographs of them loading the cocaine onto the

2514
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:22,620
planes and gave them to us, you know, so that we had them.

2515
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:26,300
Another guy I've had on here who I have, I'm nervous.

2516
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:28,260
You might know who he is. Is Rick Prado.

2517
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:32,020
I've heard of Rick Prado, but I don't, I've not interviewed him.

2518
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:36,340
Yeah. Okay. He was not working directly with,

2519
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:39,540
I don't think he was working with Felix, but he knows Felix. Yeah.

2520
02:28:39,580 --> 02:28:44,580
And Rick was sent down to Honduras to train the Sandinistas or the Contras.

2521
02:28:48,660 --> 02:28:51,340
No, the Contras. The Contras. The Contras. Yeah. He was sent down under Jack

2522
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:54,380
Singalow. Right. Yeah. He was sent down there to train the Contras. Yeah.

2523
02:28:54,620 --> 02:28:59,180
And that's Prado. Yeah. And yeah. And he, and he was, you know,

2524
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:03,180
part of that whole paramilitary operation. And after that,

2525
02:29:03,220 --> 02:29:07,140
he was actually sent back to CIA and put through the whole spy class,

2526
02:29:07,140 --> 02:29:12,060
spy school. And then he went down to Costa Rica.

2527
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:15,980
Yeah, for sure. To be on the southern border of Nicaragua and like doing all

2528
02:29:15,980 --> 02:29:17,500
kinds of... That's where Hull's Ranch was.

2529
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:21,220
That's John Hull's Ranch in Costa Rica where they flew the stuff in and out of

2530
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:26,100
all the time. That was the guy. Yeah. He was there doing all kinds of crazy shit.

2531
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:28,740
Yeah. No, he was. I've done his deposition too.

2532
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:33,180
Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. Oh my Lord.

2533
02:29:34,260 --> 02:29:36,460
You've been everywhere. Not everywhere,

2534
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:40,620
but just enough to be able to tell what's going on. Yeah.

2535
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:43,180
One of the things I think about a lot is

2536
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:49,660
if the military or some of these military

2537
02:29:49,660 --> 02:29:54,340
contractors had information or had

2538
02:29:54,340 --> 02:29:59,780
technology that would render

2539
02:30:00,660 --> 02:30:03,100
them useless, or render,

2540
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:09,540
that would render any sort of nuclear weapon or any

2541
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:13,820
sort of war machine completely useless, right?

2542
02:30:13,860 --> 02:30:18,740
Like if there was some sort of technology they had that they didn't

2543
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:22,860
fully understand how to use, that we knew was real, right?

2544
02:30:23,540 --> 02:30:26,140
Not even... I'm not even going to talk about where it was from.

2545
02:30:26,140 --> 02:30:27,940
Like say it was... Who knows where it was from.

2546
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:31,140
Yeah. Let's not pretend it's from the UFOs. Right. Let's pretend it.

2547
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:35,660
Let's just say they found it washed up on a beach somewhere and we

2548
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:39,220
had multiple of these things and we knew other countries had these things too.

2549
02:30:42,140 --> 02:30:46,020
What would they do if they had the

2550
02:30:46,020 --> 02:30:50,780
technology and they knew if whatever

2551
02:30:51,180 --> 02:30:56,100
is behind the technology would completely change the

2552
02:30:56,100 --> 02:31:01,140
world and it would completely change the dynamic of

2553
02:31:01,180 --> 02:31:05,460
nation states, right? Like if war was no longer a driving

2554
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:09,940
factor and it would destroy their business model,

2555
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:14,460
because that's how they survive is from developing weapons and doing all this

2556
02:31:14,460 --> 02:31:19,340
blue sky research on how to do all this sci-fi shit that DARPA is doing.

2557
02:31:21,180 --> 02:31:23,100
It makes sense that they would want to keep it a secret.

2558
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:29,260
And I don't know what it would take to

2559
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:34,220
make that stuff come to light. And I don't see,

2560
02:31:34,780 --> 02:31:36,180
I don't see them letting go of it.

2561
02:31:36,700 --> 02:31:39,940
Well, the problem is it's even worse than that.

2562
02:31:40,460 --> 02:31:41,860
It's one step worse than that.

2563
02:31:42,180 --> 02:31:45,820
That in the 1992 United States Defense Department of Policy Planning

2564
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:48,940
Guidance document that I told you about, that they drafted up, you know,

2565
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:52,860
starting on the Monday morning after the dissolution of the Soviet Union,

2566
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:57,140
what they did is they put this document together and they said that the reason

2567
02:31:57,140 --> 02:32:00,260
that we don't want to step back and reduce our military budget,

2568
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:03,580
just because the Soviet Union has been disbanded now and that we've been

2569
02:32:03,580 --> 02:32:07,900
rationalizing the $700 billion a year on the grounds that we had to protect

2570
02:32:07,900 --> 02:32:10,380
ourselves against them. The reason that we want to have,

2571
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:14,020
we want to increase the military budget because now we have the chance to

2572
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:18,380
establish full spectrum dominance over the planet.

2573
02:32:18,940 --> 02:32:21,740
And the purpose of this will be to maintain, quote,

2574
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:26,900
to maintain our continued privileged access to the strategic raw materials

2575
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:30,340
needed by our major corporations. Okay.

2576
02:32:30,900 --> 02:32:35,260
Cause that's what they do. And they view that as they are Rome.

2577
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:39,260
They are the aggressor. You asked me what,

2578
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:41,100
what my idea about the national security is.

2579
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:44,940
They are the aggressors on the planet. Okay.

2580
02:32:45,300 --> 02:32:48,620
And what they're doing is they're working at the behest of the major

2581
02:32:48,620 --> 02:32:53,180
corporations and the wealthiest families that own the shares of stock.

2582
02:32:53,420 --> 02:32:57,020
It's just as bad as you think it is, you know, is that they view their,

2583
02:32:57,060 --> 02:33:02,100
they view their job as securing their continued privileged access to the

2584
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:03,540
strategic raw materials.

2585
02:33:03,780 --> 02:33:07,540
I've sat and had direct conversations with the people that'll tell you that if

2586
02:33:07,540 --> 02:33:11,020
there's some third world country that is sitting on some sort of major resource

2587
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:15,980
that turns out to be of real value economically or militarily for us,

2588
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:20,140
if we don't go get it first, China or Russia, we'll go get it.

2589
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:24,500
So we'll go get it first. And that's aggressive war.

2590
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:29,620
That is a violation of every single premise of a just war theory.

2591
02:33:30,020 --> 02:33:34,420
You are the aggressor. You are the bad guy, you know, that, uh,

2592
02:33:34,460 --> 02:33:38,340
that's I had the experience when I got ready to leave to go to college,

2593
02:33:38,580 --> 02:33:42,700
I grew up with my aunt and uncle and my uncle was the head of the Republican

2594
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:45,500
County committee up in Warren County, up in Northern New York, right?

2595
02:33:45,660 --> 02:33:48,260
And I'm getting set to leave to go down to Boston to go to college.

2596
02:33:48,980 --> 02:33:50,620
He brings me out. He's the head of the civil,

2597
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:52,500
he's the civil defense director for the whole County.

2598
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:56,900
And he goes out and we stand in our front yard and from our front yard,

2599
02:33:56,900 --> 02:33:59,260
you look North into Canada and for a hundred miles,

2600
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:01,900
all there are is forest, the Adirondack forest preserve, right?

2601
02:34:02,260 --> 02:34:05,740
And uncle Jim says to me, Danny says, you're going down to college now.

2602
02:34:05,740 --> 02:34:09,540
I don't want you to become a communist, you know, going down there. He said,

2603
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:11,260
you know, I want you to look out here now.

2604
02:34:11,420 --> 02:34:15,580
There's going to be a day we'll come when the Russians are parachuting into our

2605
02:34:15,580 --> 02:34:16,420
hometown.

2606
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:20,180
And I want you to commit to me right now that if they're in the rush,

2607
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:24,980
when the Russians parachute into our town, that you will fight against them.

2608
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:26,820
And I said, look, Jim, I said,

2609
02:34:27,900 --> 02:34:30,780
Russians aren't going to be parachuting into our hometown. I said,

2610
02:34:30,900 --> 02:34:32,020
but I'll tell you what I will do.

2611
02:34:32,060 --> 02:34:37,060
I will take an oath to protect the constitution of the United States against

2612
02:34:37,220 --> 02:34:40,260
all enemies, foreign and domestic.

2613
02:34:43,660 --> 02:34:46,980
And then I left. Okay. I go back down to go to college, right? I'm in,

2614
02:34:47,860 --> 02:34:50,740
before I get to Harvard college, I'm in special forces, right? For two years,

2615
02:34:50,740 --> 02:34:54,060
right? In fifth special forces. And I'm out at Fort Devens.

2616
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:57,340
We're getting set to do the halo jump, you know, the high altitude look,

2617
02:34:57,660 --> 02:35:01,420
we get set to do the halo jump. They bring us back four from a fifth army.

2618
02:35:02,060 --> 02:35:04,700
Special forces. And he's sitting there telling us to look, okay,

2619
02:35:04,700 --> 02:35:07,860
now you gotta, you gotta remember now, uh, you know, when you're,

2620
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:10,900
you jump into the night, you know, you're up at like 38,000 feet.

2621
02:35:10,900 --> 02:35:14,300
You jump out, you know, you time your drop. And he said, when you drop in,

2622
02:35:14,300 --> 02:35:18,220
he said, uh, you gotta make sure anybody who sees you come in,

2623
02:35:19,220 --> 02:35:22,860
you gotta kill them immediately and bury them with your shoot.

2624
02:35:24,380 --> 02:35:27,500
Cause they were trained to drop in behind the lines in Vietnam. Right.

2625
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:31,340
And he said, and I said, I'm standing there with our unit. And I say,

2626
02:35:32,020 --> 02:35:35,780
what if it's women or children? Kill them. He said,

2627
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:36,940
and bury them with your shoot.

2628
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:40,700
We're the Russians. I said,

2629
02:35:41,940 --> 02:35:46,500
that's exactly what uncle Jim was hypothesizing of them jumping into our

2630
02:35:46,820 --> 02:35:52,260
neighborhood. Right. Uh, and here we are going 8,000 miles away,

2631
02:35:52,580 --> 02:35:57,300
jumping into the neighborhood of people that have been there for 5,000 years.

2632
02:35:57,540 --> 02:36:01,380
And we're jumping into their neighborhood and I'm sitting here being told at Fort

2633
02:36:01,380 --> 02:36:02,820
Devon's, you know,

2634
02:36:02,820 --> 02:36:06,700
in special forces that you jump in and you kill the women and children if you

2635
02:36:06,700 --> 02:36:09,740
have to and bury them with your shoot. And I turned around right then,

2636
02:36:09,740 --> 02:36:12,820
and I walked right out of the place, turned around, walked away.

2637
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:15,980
And Captain Campbell, our commander said, Sheehan, where the f**k do you think

2638
02:36:15,980 --> 02:36:18,580
you're going? I turned around. I said, look it,

2639
02:36:18,820 --> 02:36:22,620
somebody around here is f**king nuts. I said, and it ain't me.

2640
02:36:23,900 --> 02:36:26,060
And I turned around and walked out and never went back.

2641
02:36:26,260 --> 02:36:30,980
You know, they freaked out and drafted me and, and you know, all that s**t.

2642
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:33,620
And I ended up going to Harvard college. F**k you. I said,

2643
02:36:33,980 --> 02:36:36,860
I go to Harvard college and I studied American foreign policy under Henry

2644
02:36:36,860 --> 02:36:39,660
Kissinger. I studied all about the Vietnam war. You know,

2645
02:36:39,660 --> 02:36:43,500
I got to be one of the point briefers from Harvard law school to the United

2646
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:44,500
States Senate,

2647
02:36:44,780 --> 02:36:47,260
briefing them on the Cooper church amendment as to how they could

2648
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:50,940
constitutionally cut off all the funds for the Vietnam war. Right.

2649
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:54,940
And I ended up being the lawyer for the Pentagon papers case to reveal all of

2650
02:36:54,940 --> 02:36:59,020
this so we could stop the war. Right. And so I,

2651
02:36:59,180 --> 02:37:01,900
I took this personally, you know,

2652
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:05,260
this is a violation of everything that we've been taught. You know,

2653
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:08,300
what these people are doing is a violation of everything that we've been taught.

2654
02:37:08,460 --> 02:37:10,340
They are the bad guys.

2655
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:14,380
They are the bad guys and they're decent guys that go into the military because,

2656
02:37:14,380 --> 02:37:18,020
you know, they need a job or they need training and they get tasked to do all

2657
02:37:18,020 --> 02:37:22,100
this stuff. And by the time they get buried into this, this military culture,

2658
02:37:22,420 --> 02:37:25,580
you know, all they're doing is blindly doing whatever it is they're told,

2659
02:37:26,220 --> 02:37:29,060
you know, and they invade places and kill people, you know,

2660
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:32,260
and then they end up justifying killing somebody because they killed my buddy,

2661
02:37:32,660 --> 02:37:35,820
you know, and here you are 8,000 miles away. What are we doing?

2662
02:37:35,820 --> 02:37:38,820
Invading the middle Eastern oil fields. It's just completely obvious.

2663
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:43,100
We invaded the middle Eastern oil fields based on a complete absolute fabricated

2664
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:47,740
lie. This Saddam Hussein was in possession of nuclear weapons and we go ho hum.

2665
02:37:47,780 --> 02:37:50,180
Oh, well, okay. I guess that was a big fat lie.

2666
02:37:50,580 --> 02:37:53,140
We've been in, killed tens of thousands of people, you know,

2667
02:37:53,140 --> 02:37:57,860
it's spent hundreds and hundreds of lives of American men and women, you know,

2668
02:37:57,860 --> 02:38:01,580
for what? To occupy the middle Eastern oil fields. Why?

2669
02:38:01,660 --> 02:38:06,220
So that we could control the middle Eastern oil for our country and keep China

2670
02:38:06,220 --> 02:38:10,940
from getting it. Okay. So, I mean, that's what's happening here,

2671
02:38:11,220 --> 02:38:13,300
you know? So that's the answer to your question.

2672
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:15,580
What do you think about all this national security state?

2673
02:38:15,940 --> 02:38:18,020
I think the national security state is fascist.

2674
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:22,980
I think that they are devoted to the proposition that the entire

2675
02:38:25,460 --> 02:38:29,420
instrumentalities of the state should be put at the disposal of the private

2676
02:38:29,420 --> 02:38:33,180
interests of corporations, you know? And that is fascism.

2677
02:38:33,180 --> 02:38:37,420
That's exactly what Mussolini wrote his major essay about on fascism. You know,

2678
02:38:37,420 --> 02:38:41,420
that is exactly what the idea of fascism is. Okay.

2679
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:45,500
And that's what they're doing. And they're justifying aggressive wars, you know,

2680
02:38:45,500 --> 02:38:47,620
to go get the resources because somebody else will do it.

2681
02:38:47,820 --> 02:38:51,620
And they keep on buffaloing everybody that the Soviet Union was planning on

2682
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:55,740
taking over the world. You know, that's our job. As,

2683
02:38:55,940 --> 02:39:00,060
as George Carlin used to say, you know, that's our job, you know?

2684
02:39:00,500 --> 02:39:01,620
And that's what they're doing.

2685
02:39:01,740 --> 02:39:05,820
They're attempting to establish full spectrum dominance over the planet through

2686
02:39:05,820 --> 02:39:10,100
800 military bases through over a trillion dollars a year now,

2687
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:15,300
a trillion dollars a year in major military operations.

2688
02:39:15,580 --> 02:39:19,900
You know, with, with, with young men and women of complete good faith that are,

2689
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:22,740
Americans have been raised believing in the fundamental rights of the

2690
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:25,700
constitution and liberty and democracy and all that stuff.

2691
02:39:26,020 --> 02:39:30,900
And they're being deployed to go kill people, you know, uh, over oil,

2692
02:39:31,220 --> 02:39:34,020
you know, that is so that Donald Trump and the guys say,

2693
02:39:34,180 --> 02:39:38,020
we are the number one producers of energy now in the world.

2694
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:42,020
We are producing more oil than Saudi Arabia, you know,

2695
02:39:42,060 --> 02:39:45,580
and who's there are allies, Saudi Arabia, you know?

2696
02:39:46,660 --> 02:39:50,460
So it's, uh, you know, that's what I think, you know,

2697
02:39:50,460 --> 02:39:55,140
and that's why I went to the Jesuits to have to be legal counsel for them

2698
02:39:55,740 --> 02:39:56,860
because they,

2699
02:39:56,900 --> 02:40:01,580
they're the ones that are devoted to trying to instill the fundamental Judeo

2700
02:40:01,580 --> 02:40:05,780
Christian social ethics that we've all been taught as young men and women,

2701
02:40:05,820 --> 02:40:08,940
you know, in our high school civics courses and everything else.

2702
02:40:09,220 --> 02:40:12,860
Our job is to make that stuff real, you know, and you can,

2703
02:40:12,860 --> 02:40:16,900
you can hold them up to it. You can confront them with it, you know, uh,

2704
02:40:16,940 --> 02:40:19,300
to say, look, here's the promises that we've been made.

2705
02:40:19,980 --> 02:40:23,380
Here's the promises we've been made all through our raising being raised in

2706
02:40:23,380 --> 02:40:27,220
high school and college and everything else, you know, and we intend to do that.

2707
02:40:27,700 --> 02:40:31,100
And, you know, and that's why we're still alive is because the guys say,

2708
02:40:31,220 --> 02:40:36,380
wait a second, you know, these kids actually believe this stuff. You know,

2709
02:40:36,380 --> 02:40:39,060
that's, that's who they, that's who we are. And they say,

2710
02:40:39,100 --> 02:40:42,300
who the hell are these people? You know, they're getting all this information.

2711
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:45,620
It was Felix Rodriguez. They said, how, how, how,

2712
02:40:45,820 --> 02:40:47,020
I hate that we keep bringing him up.

2713
02:40:47,380 --> 02:40:51,700
No, they said, they said, they said that they catch this, uh, Oliver North,

2714
02:40:51,940 --> 02:40:55,780
Oliver North believed, and I know this because he told,

2715
02:40:55,860 --> 02:41:00,980
he told, uh, Ross Perot of this, that they believed that the source of our

2716
02:41:00,980 --> 02:41:05,340
information in the Iran Contra case was Felix Rodriguez.

2717
02:41:06,900 --> 02:41:07,460
Really?

2718
02:41:07,460 --> 02:41:08,220
That's what they thought.

2719
02:41:08,420 --> 02:41:10,380
And they were going to have to try to get rid of him as the head of the

2720
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:14,060
Ilepongo air operation. Cause we had such good information about the,

2721
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:16,660
we knew the flight numbers. We knew the tail numbers. We knew,

2722
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:20,260
we had the shipping invoices over the serial numbers on the weapons,

2723
02:41:20,860 --> 02:41:24,420
those people, man. I mean, we had these guys dead to rights and they said,

2724
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:28,540
it has to be Felix. Okay. It wasn't, it was Chi Chi,

2725
02:41:29,020 --> 02:41:32,220
who was his number two, who was just giving us the,

2726
02:41:32,300 --> 02:41:36,780
Pantero. Yeah. Cause he was talking all the time to, to, uh,

2727
02:41:36,820 --> 02:41:41,660
to Gene Wheaton and Gene Wheaton was working with us because he got really

2728
02:41:41,660 --> 02:41:43,420
pissed off. He'd given him his airplanes.

2729
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:47,460
He gave him like a dozen of his, his airplanes to fly, uh,

2730
02:41:47,660 --> 02:41:50,660
weapons down to the Contras. He said, you know, fuck the Contras, you know,

2731
02:41:50,660 --> 02:41:53,580
they're fucking, you know, they're the fuck the Sandinistas, you know,

2732
02:41:53,580 --> 02:41:54,300
they're all communists.

2733
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:58,060
So he let them use his airplanes until he found out that they were flying

2734
02:41:58,060 --> 02:42:02,180
cocaine back into the United States on his airplanes. Uh, in the,

2735
02:42:02,220 --> 02:42:05,700
in one of them crashed on the way back and he got ready to file an insurance

2736
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:08,700
claim. He says, no, no, no nurses. Don't do that. Don't do that.

2737
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:11,900
Cause if they send investigators to try to find the plane and they'll find it

2738
02:42:11,900 --> 02:42:13,060
and it's filled with cocaine.

2739
02:42:13,900 --> 02:42:18,780
And so Gene got really pissed off, uh, and came to us, came to us.

2740
02:42:19,060 --> 02:42:21,100
Paul Hoeven brought him to meet with me.

2741
02:42:21,380 --> 02:42:26,060
Paul Hoeven was a copter jock in Vietnam, you know, and he ran the,

2742
02:42:26,060 --> 02:42:29,860
the project on military procurement, which I chaired the fund for

2743
02:42:29,860 --> 02:42:33,820
constitutional government in Washington, DC. Uh, and we had,

2744
02:42:33,820 --> 02:42:38,780
we instituted the fund for, uh, for military spending, right?

2745
02:42:38,980 --> 02:42:42,620
And we were overseeing the whole project on military spending to go after the

2746
02:42:42,620 --> 02:42:46,100
$500 coffee pots, the $300 hammers, you know,

2747
02:42:46,100 --> 02:42:49,620
the $800 screwdrivers that they have all that shit, you know?

2748
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:51,220
And so we were doing,

2749
02:42:51,220 --> 02:42:56,020
we put together the project on military procurement and Paul Hoven was one of

2750
02:42:56,100 --> 02:43:00,940
the consultants we had because he was an expert on military

2751
02:43:00,980 --> 02:43:02,340
hardware, right?

2752
02:43:02,460 --> 02:43:06,860
And so he would tell us exactly what the, like the Bradley fighting machine,

2753
02:43:07,660 --> 02:43:09,900
the Bradley fighting machine, you know, if,

2754
02:43:09,900 --> 02:43:12,020
if it took a direct hit a midships,

2755
02:43:12,020 --> 02:43:15,260
it would totally blow up and kill everybody all around it. Uh, because,

2756
02:43:15,420 --> 02:43:16,900
because, because it was,

2757
02:43:16,940 --> 02:43:21,500
it could be defeated with an armor piercing shell and it was loaded with,

2758
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:25,980
with the military, uh, uh, uh, uh, what do you call it?

2759
02:43:26,420 --> 02:43:31,100
Anyway, provisions, they kept, they kept the shells inside the tank,

2760
02:43:31,340 --> 02:43:33,900
you know? And so you hit the, you hit the Bradley fighting machine.

2761
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:36,820
It could go 60 miles an hour on the open highway.

2762
02:43:37,100 --> 02:43:38,780
But the fact is it could, it could,

2763
02:43:38,780 --> 02:43:42,820
it could be penetrated by one armor person shell and blow up and kill everybody

2764
02:43:42,820 --> 02:43:46,740
all within like 150 yards of it, which all the guys who were around it,

2765
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:48,460
you know, would get killed, you know,

2766
02:43:48,460 --> 02:43:51,820
and still they just kept pushing it forward because it was a multimillion

2767
02:43:51,820 --> 02:43:55,940
dollar project, you know? And so that I was, I was, uh, uh,

2768
02:43:56,180 --> 02:43:59,780
there is the, is the head of that program. We put that together.

2769
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:04,540
We put together the, uh, the, uh, uh, Institute for corporate responsibility,

2770
02:44:04,820 --> 02:44:08,460
which was the original whistleblower protection group for the fund for

2771
02:44:08,460 --> 02:44:09,420
constitutional government.

2772
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:11,940
We did all that out of the fund for constitutional government.

2773
02:44:11,940 --> 02:44:15,220
When I was at the Jesuit headquarters, I got recruited by the people to,

2774
02:44:15,220 --> 02:44:17,860
if Stuart Mott helped fund that, that thing.

2775
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:20,820
So they asked me to become the chair of it because they knew I was a serious

2776
02:44:20,820 --> 02:44:24,460
person when it comes to the constitution. And so we, we,

2777
02:44:24,500 --> 02:44:27,900
we set up all those different programs then, you know, and that's how I got to,

2778
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:32,660
that's how I got to meet Paul Hoeven and Paul Hoeven was at a meeting of the,

2779
02:44:32,660 --> 02:44:36,460
uh, the heritage foundation. If you know what that is,

2780
02:44:36,740 --> 02:44:40,420
the heritage foundation is somewhere to the right of Attila, you know, uh,

2781
02:44:40,460 --> 02:44:44,900
and, uh, they've got this foundation in Washington, DC, where they're all, you

2782
02:44:44,900 --> 02:44:49,580
know, they're, they're the ones that built the, the entire, uh, was it a mandate

2783
02:44:49,580 --> 02:44:52,500
for leadership, that great big 500 page, uh,

2784
02:44:52,540 --> 02:44:56,180
book that they gave to Ronald Reagan when he became president. Uh,

2785
02:44:56,220 --> 02:45:00,380
and he instituted all those beliefs and stuff. And, and, uh,

2786
02:45:00,420 --> 02:45:04,220
and Hoeven was at one of these soirees they were having there and there,

2787
02:45:04,220 --> 02:45:07,780
and there was Gene Wheaton standing there at the bar drinking and they got

2788
02:45:07,780 --> 02:45:08,860
talking back and forth.

2789
02:45:09,180 --> 02:45:13,060
And Wheaton started crying in his beer over the fact that his airplane had been

2790
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:17,860
shot down filled with cocaine. And so, so Paul Hoeven knew me,

2791
02:45:17,860 --> 02:45:21,260
cause he was our consultant at the project on military procurement.

2792
02:45:21,700 --> 02:45:23,580
And so he came to me, he said, Danny said,

2793
02:45:23,580 --> 02:45:27,700
I know that you guys have been looking into this, uh,

2794
02:45:27,740 --> 02:45:30,620
weapons smuggling operation going on down to the Contras,

2795
02:45:30,940 --> 02:45:35,780
which everybody's denying is happening. Uh, and you're sure it is happening. Uh,

2796
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:38,780
but I've got, I've got a guy who I think may know something about it.

2797
02:45:39,020 --> 02:45:41,940
So he sets up the meeting to in a safe house out in Virginia.

2798
02:45:42,220 --> 02:45:46,540
And I go out and sit down with, uh, with Gene Wheaton, uh, in, you know,

2799
02:45:46,540 --> 02:45:49,380
after probably half an hour, 45 minutes,

2800
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:52,580
he realized that, uh, I knew a lot.

2801
02:45:53,020 --> 02:45:54,580
I knew a lot, uh,

2802
02:45:54,620 --> 02:45:59,420
and then he became convinced that I was serious about this and I was no spy for

2803
02:45:59,460 --> 02:46:02,460
Cuba or, you know, Soviets or anybody.

2804
02:46:02,460 --> 02:46:07,100
I was just an absolute American who believed in the constitution and had been

2805
02:46:07,140 --> 02:46:09,900
given the privilege of getting to go to Harvard college and Harvard law school

2806
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:11,020
and Harvard divinity school.

2807
02:46:11,340 --> 02:46:15,300
And I had all kinds of contacts cause I'd been in Bailey's office and I knew all

2808
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:17,340
kinds of stuff from being on the Pentagon papers.

2809
02:46:17,980 --> 02:46:22,180
And so he agreed to work with us cause he was pissed off about what they were

2810
02:46:22,180 --> 02:46:26,020
doing. Uh, and that's how we learned that Theodore Shackley,

2811
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:28,860
who was the CIA station chief in Saigon,

2812
02:46:30,180 --> 02:46:33,420
was also the guy who put together the off the shelf enterprise.

2813
02:46:33,820 --> 02:46:36,780
It wasn't Oliver North at all. It was Theodore Shackley,

2814
02:46:37,100 --> 02:46:41,780
who was the handpicked head of covert operations for the CIA

2815
02:46:41,780 --> 02:46:44,540
worldwide by George H.W. Bush.

2816
02:46:44,700 --> 02:46:47,100
When he was the director of the central intelligence agency.

2817
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:50,500
And this guy was the fucking protege of Reinhard Galen,

2818
02:46:50,500 --> 02:46:54,740
who was the head of the Waffen SS third Reich anti Soviet and anti Eastern block

2819
02:46:54,740 --> 02:46:58,300
intelligence for the third Reich. And this guy, Theodore Shackley,

2820
02:46:58,300 --> 02:47:02,660
was his protege in Europe and the 101st counter intelligence core.

2821
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:06,740
When, when Galen turned himself in at the end of world war two and Shackley was

2822
02:47:06,740 --> 02:47:10,740
his translator and he went with him and translated stuff and brought him to Fort

2823
02:47:10,740 --> 02:47:15,740
Hunt at the end of world war two and help persuade everybody to let him become

2824
02:47:15,740 --> 02:47:19,540
the head of West German intelligence. And so Reinhard Galen,

2825
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:23,460
who was the head of the Waffen SS third Reich anti Soviet and anti Eastern

2826
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:28,220
block intelligence was the head of West German intelligence for 26 years and

2827
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:28,780
provided,

2828
02:47:28,780 --> 02:47:33,300
was the primary source on intelligence against the Soviet Union to our,

2829
02:47:33,300 --> 02:47:35,420
to our United States central intelligence agency.

2830
02:47:35,780 --> 02:47:38,420
And Theodore Shackley was, was his protege.

2831
02:47:38,940 --> 02:47:41,820
It was in the original class of the central intelligence agency,

2832
02:47:41,860 --> 02:47:43,180
along with Michael Harari,

2833
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:47,740
who was chief of security for Noriega and his drug smuggling. You know,

2834
02:47:48,100 --> 02:47:50,700
these are the guys that, these are the guys that we're talking about here,

2835
02:47:51,140 --> 02:47:53,940
you know, and, and, and what I'm saying is the,

2836
02:47:53,940 --> 02:47:56,820
I think that the UFO issue is,

2837
02:47:57,100 --> 02:48:02,100
is it's got the widest constituency of any issue of public policy.

2838
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:07,620
Everybody, everybody wants to find out about the UFOs.

2839
02:48:07,940 --> 02:48:11,100
Everybody wants to find out about the fact that there's extraterrestrial

2840
02:48:11,100 --> 02:48:13,140
intelligence and they're coming and going from the planet.

2841
02:48:13,860 --> 02:48:16,500
All the Republican senators are in support of our bill.

2842
02:48:16,660 --> 02:48:20,780
All the democratic senators in charge in support of our bill, except for,

2843
02:48:21,060 --> 02:48:26,060
except for McConnell, Mitch McConnell, in one guy from Alabama,

2844
02:48:27,260 --> 02:48:31,580
you know, one, one of the senators from Alabama, all the other senators,

2845
02:48:31,740 --> 02:48:36,260
you know, all 98 other senators are supportive of our 60 page bill, you know,

2846
02:48:36,260 --> 02:48:39,340
and virtually all the members of the house, you know,

2847
02:48:39,500 --> 02:48:44,500
I've got meetings with AOC sitting there with, with Gates,

2848
02:48:45,940 --> 02:48:48,340
with Matt Gates sitting,

2849
02:48:48,340 --> 02:48:52,740
having cordial conversations about how they agree that the Congress has the

2850
02:48:52,740 --> 02:48:57,300
right to have all this information because it's rotten and unconstitutional for

2851
02:48:57,300 --> 02:49:00,100
this, the, the unelected people in the,

2852
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:04,060
in the military and in the intelligence community to be secreting this

2853
02:49:04,060 --> 02:49:08,340
information. What do you think about the, the story?

2854
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:09,940
I don't know if you've heard, I'm sure you've heard of it,

2855
02:49:09,940 --> 02:49:13,260
but Annie Jacobson talks about in her book Area 51, she has a source,

2856
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:15,660
a major source for her who was an EG&G engineer.

2857
02:49:16,380 --> 02:49:19,300
Yeah, I know EG&G. Yeah. He, he told her,

2858
02:49:19,740 --> 02:49:23,660
he was like towards the very end of his life when he was giving her information

2859
02:49:23,660 --> 02:49:24,500
for her book.

2860
02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:29,660
But he said that the Roswell crash was a drone piloted by Stalin containing a,

2861
02:49:32,780 --> 02:49:36,500
a humanoid, there was a guy, a Nazi guy that Stalin got,

2862
02:49:37,220 --> 02:49:40,460
that was like a, I always forget his name,

2863
02:49:40,460 --> 02:49:42,260
but he was like a surgery guy.

2864
02:49:42,260 --> 02:49:44,260
He was in charge of like doing all this crazy,

2865
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:46,860
like surgical experiments, manipulating people.

2866
02:49:47,100 --> 02:49:51,620
And he did this surgical manipulation on like kids with Down syndrome and made

2867
02:49:51,620 --> 02:49:55,460
them look like aliens and crashed them in there to sow panic and chaos in the US.

2868
02:49:55,500 --> 02:49:58,900
What do I think about that? And then hold on. Yeah. And then, um,

2869
02:50:00,580 --> 02:50:03,780
he, she went back towards the end of her research years later and she goes,

2870
02:50:04,140 --> 02:50:05,780
she goes, um,

2871
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:10,980
why wouldn't you say something about this? She's like,

2872
02:50:10,980 --> 02:50:12,580
this makes them look terrible.

2873
02:50:12,860 --> 02:50:16,780
If you guys found out the truth and could find evidence proving that Stalin was

2874
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:18,380
behind this, why wouldn't you do that?

2875
02:50:19,180 --> 02:50:23,420
And the EG&G engineer said, because we started doing the same thing.

2876
02:50:24,100 --> 02:50:27,820
He literally said that they started doing the surgical stuff,

2877
02:50:27,820 --> 02:50:29,340
experimenting on kids.

2878
02:50:29,460 --> 02:50:32,020
It's all a total brain fart. Total. I mean,

2879
02:50:32,260 --> 02:50:36,940
you can get extraordinarily intricate stories by people who are total

2880
02:50:36,940 --> 02:50:38,220
psychopaths. Uh,

2881
02:50:38,260 --> 02:50:41,620
and they're completely convincing because they made some of them believe it

2882
02:50:41,620 --> 02:50:46,420
themselves. It's not true. I, I, I'm the guy, I'm the guy that helped, uh,

2883
02:50:47,300 --> 02:50:50,940
expand the, the telegram in the hand of general Ramey,

2884
02:50:51,540 --> 02:50:54,740
the famous picture of him kneeling down next to the weather balloon,

2885
02:50:55,860 --> 02:51:00,020
kneeling down there. And he's got a telegram, a cable in his hand.

2886
02:51:00,420 --> 02:51:02,660
You can see it. I always saw,

2887
02:51:02,660 --> 02:51:06,500
I said that guy's got a cable of some sort in his hand there. I, I,

2888
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:10,540
I can't read it from the photograph. And so like 1995,

2889
02:51:10,580 --> 02:51:14,820
I'm doing a talk, giving everybody a briefing on the John Mack case, you know,

2890
02:51:15,380 --> 02:51:16,860
uh, that was still underway at that time.

2891
02:51:16,860 --> 02:51:20,700
I'm out at the international UFO Congress out in Laughlin, Nevada.

2892
02:51:21,060 --> 02:51:25,260
And a guy comes up to me after I do my, my briefing on the, on the Mack case.

2893
02:51:25,980 --> 02:51:29,660
And he says, Mr. Sheehan, he said, uh, I've got something really important.

2894
02:51:29,660 --> 02:51:33,140
I need to talk with you about, uh, could you come up, meet me up in my room?

2895
02:51:33,580 --> 02:51:36,580
And I went, uh, I think I better bring somebody with me.

2896
02:51:36,820 --> 02:51:39,700
So I get into the friend mind, we go up and he says,

2897
02:51:39,900 --> 02:51:44,660
I think I have found the photographer from the Roswell

2898
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:49,300
newspaper who the editor called him at two o'clock in the morning

2899
02:51:49,580 --> 02:51:54,460
after the July 8th, you know, headline banner headline in the Roswell paper

2900
02:51:54,460 --> 02:51:58,220
that everybody's seen about flying saucer that they found a flying saucer.

2901
02:51:58,220 --> 02:52:01,060
It went out over the AP wires and everybody was going ballistic, right?

2902
02:52:01,500 --> 02:52:05,340
And he gets a call at two o'clock in the morning from the editor of the paper

2903
02:52:05,580 --> 02:52:10,660
and says that general Ramey has flown in from Texas and he's demanding that he

2904
02:52:10,660 --> 02:52:13,620
sent, we send a photographer out right now because they want to get the

2905
02:52:13,620 --> 02:52:18,020
photographs, uh, uh, and put them on the front page of the paper for the morning.

2906
02:52:18,620 --> 02:52:24,460
And he goes out and here's Ramey, you know, uh, with, uh, uh, with, uh, Marcel

2907
02:52:24,540 --> 02:52:28,180
and the rest of the guys and they're all still up and they've got a weather

2908
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:30,180
balloon kind of spread out on the floor.

2909
02:52:30,500 --> 02:52:33,300
Uh, and he's kneeling down next to the weather balloon and he's got

2910
02:52:33,300 --> 02:52:34,620
this cable in his hands.

2911
02:52:34,620 --> 02:52:36,260
You can see the, the telegram.

2912
02:52:36,740 --> 02:52:41,060
Uh, and so this guy says, I think I may have found the photographer that took

2913
02:52:41,060 --> 02:52:43,500
the picture and I said, great.

2914
02:52:43,780 --> 02:52:47,340
I said, if you, if you can find out and it's the right guy, see if he's got the

2915
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:53,060
negatives, if he's got the negatives, we might be able to digitize them and blow

2916
02:52:53,060 --> 02:52:56,340
these things up and we can read the telegram, right?

2917
02:52:56,540 --> 02:52:58,260
So he does, he goes and finds the guy.

2918
02:52:58,260 --> 02:53:01,860
Sure enough, as the guy, sure enough, he's got the, he's got the negatives.

2919
02:53:02,180 --> 02:53:04,780
Sure enough, we get them blown up and digitized, right?

2920
02:53:05,780 --> 02:53:09,620
And it says right in them, we had to do some computer stuff with, you know,

2921
02:53:09,620 --> 02:53:12,780
where the consonants and vowels were to be able to fill in where some of the

2922
02:53:12,780 --> 02:53:14,340
wrinkles were that were in the thing.

2923
02:53:14,340 --> 02:53:21,460
But it says, bring the disc to right field and bring the bodies.

2924
02:53:22,420 --> 02:53:22,860
Okay.

2925
02:53:23,140 --> 02:53:26,340
Now, and so that we, we know that it was real.

2926
02:53:26,340 --> 02:53:30,500
It wasn't any weather balloon, you know, the, and all the guys, the guys that are

2927
02:53:30,500 --> 02:53:32,660
there, I mean, they know what a weather balloon looks like.

2928
02:53:32,660 --> 02:53:35,540
Well, that story would fit in with the EG&G engineer story.

2929
02:53:35,620 --> 02:53:37,620
It's not, it's not even close to a weather balloon.

2930
02:53:37,820 --> 02:53:39,100
I mean, this was a huge crap.

2931
02:53:39,100 --> 02:53:39,900
He said it was a drone.

2932
02:53:39,900 --> 02:53:43,140
He said it was like a flying saucer that they literally piloted the bodies.

2933
02:53:43,180 --> 02:53:44,580
Anybody can make anything up.

2934
02:53:45,060 --> 02:53:46,220
Anybody can make anything up.

2935
02:53:46,220 --> 02:53:46,940
And we've seen them.

2936
02:53:46,940 --> 02:53:50,620
I mean, look at Corey Good, the guy, what I told you about Corey Good went on and

2937
02:53:50,660 --> 02:53:53,020
on for dozens of appearances.

2938
02:53:53,020 --> 02:53:56,460
He went on and went into great detail about how we had interstellar craft.

2939
02:53:56,460 --> 02:54:00,740
Yeah, but this, this source, he was completely, he was a confidential source.

2940
02:54:00,740 --> 02:54:02,780
He was completely remained anonymous.

2941
02:54:02,780 --> 02:54:04,380
She never named the guy or anything.

2942
02:54:04,380 --> 02:54:08,580
And she said that he was, why would he admit the fact that he went and did it too?

2943
02:54:08,580 --> 02:54:12,700
Do you realize, do you realize how many people that have come to me to tell me that

2944
02:54:12,700 --> 02:54:16,940
they knew what the Watergate burglar was about and what the Kennedy, who killed

2945
02:54:16,980 --> 02:54:20,860
Kennedy, you know, and all that, and the people hiding in the drain and all that

2946
02:54:20,860 --> 02:54:25,380
shit. I mean, they go on and on and on, you know, and it's just, that's what I'm

2947
02:54:25,380 --> 02:54:30,620
saying, why you have to have the ability to, I mean, we could slap this guy on a,

2948
02:54:30,740 --> 02:54:36,980
on a psychological stress evaluator in, you know, it's just that they notice that

2949
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:42,500
we've got, we've got like a dozen witnesses who have, who've participated in

2950
02:54:42,500 --> 02:54:46,900
that, who saw the crash debris, you know, and it's not a weather balloon at all.

2951
02:54:47,100 --> 02:54:50,860
You know, and they, they, they, and they've got, they've got multiple bodies.

2952
02:54:50,860 --> 02:54:55,340
They've got multiple bodies, you know, and they, they didn't, they didn't, you

2953
02:54:55,340 --> 02:54:58,980
know, find a bunch of people that were kind of human mutants and they kind of

2954
02:54:58,980 --> 02:55:03,060
operated on them and put them in a, in a weather balloon and flew, or a drone and

2955
02:55:03,060 --> 02:55:06,860
flew, they didn't even have drones then, you know.

2956
02:55:07,620 --> 02:55:10,980
Well, they had the Horton, was stuff the Horton brothers were working on the Horton.

2957
02:55:10,980 --> 02:55:14,260
Have you seen the, the, the flying saucer type object that the Horton brothers

2958
02:55:14,260 --> 02:55:14,780
developed?

2959
02:55:14,980 --> 02:55:18,420
Well, there, there were a number of them that were, were trying to be developed.

2960
02:55:18,420 --> 02:55:23,020
The, the Russians there, the Nazis were working on, which may well have, had been

2961
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:28,060
a result of the, the craft in 1933 that was recovered in, in, in Italy.

2962
02:55:28,420 --> 02:55:32,260
So, but, but they weren't able, they weren't able to figure out the

2963
02:55:32,260 --> 02:55:36,860
technology of this thing, you know, that, yeah, see, that's it there.

2964
02:55:37,540 --> 02:55:39,300
So this, what are we looking at right here?

2965
02:55:39,340 --> 02:55:40,740
That's the telegram right there.

2966
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:43,260
This is the telegram that was in the guy's hand in the photograph.

2967
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:44,380
And Ramey's right there.

2968
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:45,500
See it?

2969
02:55:46,380 --> 02:55:46,780
Yeah.

2970
02:55:50,300 --> 02:55:50,980
Oh, wow.

2971
02:55:51,380 --> 02:55:51,780
See it?

2972
02:55:52,020 --> 02:55:53,340
That's not a weather balloon.

2973
02:55:53,500 --> 02:55:55,500
That's not a conversation about a weather balloon.

2974
02:55:56,580 --> 02:55:57,620
They're talking about the disk.

2975
02:55:57,620 --> 02:55:59,020
Where does it say Wright-Patterson?

2976
02:55:59,380 --> 02:56:00,460
It says Wright Field.

2977
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:01,420
Oh, Wright Field.

2978
02:56:01,660 --> 02:56:02,820
See, that's what it was.

2979
02:56:02,820 --> 02:56:04,460
It was Wright Field at that time.

2980
02:56:04,460 --> 02:56:05,580
It wasn't Wright-Patterson.

2981
02:56:05,620 --> 02:56:06,540
Oh, wow.

2982
02:56:06,580 --> 02:56:07,940
But it's taken to Wright Field.

2983
02:56:08,460 --> 02:56:10,820
And here's, here's all the stuff that, see.

2984
02:56:12,820 --> 02:56:13,140
Yep.

2985
02:56:13,660 --> 02:56:14,380
Wright Field.

2986
02:56:14,860 --> 02:56:17,580
They talk about, we're going to send out, send out a weather balloon

2987
02:56:17,580 --> 02:56:19,580
story for it to cover that.

2988
02:56:20,220 --> 02:56:20,580
Right.

2989
02:56:20,740 --> 02:56:21,100
Yeah.

2990
02:56:21,260 --> 02:56:22,020
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2991
02:56:22,260 --> 02:56:24,420
It was definitely a, it was definitely a cover up.

2992
02:56:24,420 --> 02:56:24,700
Yeah.

2993
02:56:24,780 --> 02:56:27,860
So, and it's, so, and it's, it's one of those, it's one of those kind of things

2994
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:31,660
where, where, you know, not in a thousand years would they think that you can see

2995
02:56:31,660 --> 02:56:35,540
this, would you would ever be able to see the telegram that he had in his hand.

2996
02:56:35,540 --> 02:56:35,820
Right.

2997
02:56:35,900 --> 02:56:40,140
You know, so I say that nobody, nobody's going to be smart enough to, to do that,

2998
02:56:40,380 --> 02:56:46,460
to have a fake telegram in his hand and think that, you know, 30 years later,

2999
02:56:46,460 --> 02:56:50,700
somebody's going to find the technology to read it, you know, it's, you know, it's,

3000
02:56:50,700 --> 02:56:54,740
it's just like, you know, eventually we'll be able to get the Zapruder film and

3001
02:56:54,740 --> 02:56:59,300
we'll be able to have a technology that can track the heat signatures of the

3002
02:56:59,300 --> 02:57:03,580
bullets in, in the emulsion on, on the negatives that they're going, we're

3003
02:57:03,580 --> 02:57:04,540
going to be able to do that.

3004
02:57:04,940 --> 02:57:08,500
And we'll be able to find the actual heat, heat signatures of the bullets.

3005
02:57:08,820 --> 02:57:10,940
And so you'll know exactly where the bullets came from.

3006
02:57:11,460 --> 02:57:12,820
And by that time they'll all be dead.

3007
02:57:13,540 --> 02:57:17,260
And, and you know, that's, that's what did that say, Steve?

3008
02:57:17,900 --> 02:57:20,260
However, this book written, oh, this is, okay, this is talking about

3009
02:57:20,260 --> 02:57:21,580
the EG&G engineer, right?

3010
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:27,100
In this book written by Andy Jacobson, a respected investigator reporter offers

3011
02:57:27,100 --> 02:57:30,540
such contrasting explanation of the, for the Roswell mystery that I suggest you

3012
02:57:30,540 --> 02:57:32,220
clutch something solid right now.

3013
02:57:32,260 --> 02:57:32,420
Yeah.

3014
02:57:32,420 --> 02:57:33,660
This is what I explained to you.

3015
02:57:34,500 --> 02:57:37,780
According to the Telegraph, Jacobson suggests that the flying object

3016
02:57:37,780 --> 02:57:40,620
crashed into a, was an earthly machine.

3017
02:57:40,620 --> 02:57:43,860
She also reported a suggestion it was sent by Stalin, blah, blah, blah.

3018
02:57:44,140 --> 02:57:46,500
Down here is where it gets interesting.

3019
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:48,420
Maybe it's right here.

3020
02:57:49,220 --> 02:57:50,220
She's in children.

3021
02:57:50,340 --> 02:57:50,860
Stalin.

3022
02:57:50,860 --> 02:57:51,260
Yeah, yeah.

3023
02:57:51,260 --> 02:57:54,620
Stalin apparently believed that it could have been said they sent a plane full of

3024
02:57:54,620 --> 02:57:59,340
these children created with the already exiled Ming, Mingel, Mingel.

3025
02:57:59,340 --> 02:58:00,100
That was the guy's name.

3026
02:58:00,100 --> 02:58:00,580
The Nazi.

3027
02:58:00,580 --> 02:58:05,620
Mengele, Mengele, Mengele's help over to the U S in order to create mass hysteria.

3028
02:58:05,620 --> 02:58:10,900
However, the remote piloted plane, which wasn't a flying saucer crashed, but yeah.

3029
02:58:10,900 --> 02:58:14,500
So, so the Horton brothers and a bunch of these guys that were working with the

3030
02:58:14,500 --> 02:58:18,900
Nazis, they had all kinds of crazy sci-fi looking shit they were working on.

3031
02:58:19,460 --> 02:58:20,820
That looked like flying saucers.

3032
02:58:21,980 --> 02:58:27,260
No, I mean, what I'm saying is that we've got, we've got 40, you know, above

3033
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:32,980
top secret witnesses testifying to the recovery of the UFOs, you know, and that

3034
02:58:32,980 --> 02:58:34,460
these are not, these are not.

3035
02:58:35,140 --> 02:58:37,060
So that's made by the Soviets or.

3036
02:58:37,100 --> 02:58:40,580
So it goes back to my, my, my original question is if we have 40 of these people,

3037
02:58:40,580 --> 02:58:44,100
do you really think we're going to get these people to let the cat out of the bag?

3038
02:58:44,260 --> 02:58:45,220
They've already given it.

3039
02:58:45,220 --> 02:58:48,660
They've already given sworn testimony to the Senate intelligence committee under oath.

3040
02:58:48,700 --> 02:58:52,660
I'm talking about the, the, um, the private contractors, but tell, I'm

3041
02:58:52,660 --> 02:58:54,580
talking about these, these companies.

3042
02:58:55,140 --> 02:58:59,420
Once, once we get subpoena power to go after them and you know, they, I can

3043
02:58:59,420 --> 02:59:04,140
tell you, you know, they, the people all the time don't want to talk.

3044
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:08,100
They have every, in any case you're going to do are going to lie or going to

3045
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:10,780
cheat and hide the stuff they're going to do all that you have to have

3046
02:59:10,780 --> 02:59:14,460
professionals that know how to get that stuff, you know, and as long as the

3047
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:18,340
Congress has made the decision that they're going to get it, they'll get it.

3048
02:59:18,980 --> 02:59:21,860
You know, now they'll do everything in their power to try to stop it because

3049
02:59:21,860 --> 02:59:23,420
it's worth trillions of dollars.

3050
02:59:23,740 --> 02:59:29,260
If they, if they can get the patents on, on, you know, anti-gravity technology, if

3051
02:59:29,260 --> 02:59:34,460
they can get a patent on superluminal speeds of a vehicle, if they can get a

3052
02:59:34,460 --> 02:59:38,860
patent on the metals that can withstand that, that kind of G forces and stuff, if

3053
02:59:38,860 --> 02:59:42,260
they can do that, it'll be worth trillions of dollars for them, you know?

3054
02:59:42,380 --> 02:59:46,460
So they'll go to almost any lengths to, to refuse to do this.

3055
02:59:46,780 --> 02:59:52,420
So that's why we have to have the power of the institution of Congress to be

3056
02:59:52,420 --> 02:59:53,540
able to get behind this.

3057
02:59:53,540 --> 02:59:57,180
And that's why, you know, it's a slow process of being able to bring these

3058
02:59:57,220 --> 03:00:03,020
people on, but we've, we've now gotten the virtually unanimous support from the

3059
03:00:03,020 --> 03:00:07,020
Democratic and Republican senators and almost unanimous support from the members

3060
03:00:07,020 --> 03:00:13,580
of the house, you know, but for these few guys, you know, Mike Turner, Mike Turner,

3061
03:00:13,620 --> 03:00:18,500
who is the head of the Republican head of the, of the intelligence committee, who

3062
03:00:18,500 --> 03:00:23,540
comes from the 10th congressional district in Ohio, Wright-Patterson, and,

3063
03:00:23,540 --> 03:00:26,620
and that is the chief field office for radiant technology.

3064
03:00:27,700 --> 03:00:28,940
You know, that's where they are.

3065
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:34,580
And the other guy that he brought on is Mike Rogers, who's the head of the, the,

3066
03:00:34,580 --> 03:00:39,260
uh, uh, the armed services committee in the house, who comes from the second

3067
03:00:39,260 --> 03:00:43,020
district in Alabama, right next door to the red stone rocket range.

3068
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:43,780
Okay.

3069
03:00:43,780 --> 03:00:49,100
And that's the home office of, of, uh, of radiant technology.

3070
03:00:49,540 --> 03:00:53,140
And they've got the program, which is called prompt global strike.

3071
03:00:54,020 --> 03:00:58,500
They're the ones that are trying to use the technology of the craft to propel

3072
03:00:58,580 --> 03:01:03,580
nuclear American nuclear missiles that can be launched Stateside and hit into

3073
03:01:03,580 --> 03:01:09,220
the, in the center of China or Russia within two minutes, you know, I mean,

3074
03:01:09,220 --> 03:01:10,300
and sure they'll do that.

3075
03:01:10,540 --> 03:01:13,780
I mean, that's, that's perfectly logical that they, they will, they're, they're,

3076
03:01:14,060 --> 03:01:17,540
you know, the old Sufi saying is when, when a pickpocket meets a Saint,

3077
03:01:18,380 --> 03:01:20,020
all he sees are his pockets.

3078
03:01:20,860 --> 03:01:25,820
And so these, these guys live in the world of, as soon as they see, oh, a crash

3079
03:01:25,820 --> 03:01:30,620
UFO, man, we can make a weapon out of that, because that's their life.

3080
03:01:30,620 --> 03:01:31,500
That's their job.

3081
03:01:31,500 --> 03:01:33,660
That's the prison through which they see everything.

3082
03:01:33,940 --> 03:01:37,300
So you can't really hold it against them that they want to do that.

3083
03:01:37,540 --> 03:01:38,380
That's their mission.

3084
03:01:38,620 --> 03:01:43,420
What sort of terms do you think they'd be willing to negotiate with to let the cat

3085
03:01:43,420 --> 03:01:46,100
out of the bag or to let this, to disclose all this stuff?

3086
03:01:46,420 --> 03:01:47,540
Like would you have to sell it?

3087
03:01:47,540 --> 03:01:48,860
Look, you can still control it.

3088
03:01:48,860 --> 03:01:49,940
You can still control it.

3089
03:01:49,940 --> 03:01:50,860
You guys still own it.

3090
03:01:51,060 --> 03:01:54,540
If you, if you could, if you would give them the patents, if you'd give them the

3091
03:01:54,540 --> 03:01:58,340
patents on it and you'd let them own it for in perpetuity, so they could make

3092
03:01:58,340 --> 03:02:02,260
trillions of dollars, they could, they could be making billions of dollars on

3093
03:02:02,260 --> 03:02:07,060
every single craft that the United States built, you know, that use that technology.

3094
03:02:08,100 --> 03:02:12,340
And they could give the money to their shareholders so that they'd be all, could

3095
03:02:12,340 --> 03:02:17,220
have more yachts, you know, or more country houses or, or give their great,

3096
03:02:17,220 --> 03:02:21,940
great, great grandchildren and nephews, you know, in Mercedes for their 16th

3097
03:02:21,940 --> 03:02:26,420
birthday, I mean, these people are completely insatiable because, because

3098
03:02:26,420 --> 03:02:27,940
they've got a hole in their soul.

3099
03:02:28,180 --> 03:02:32,020
You know, I mean that they, they do not experience any kind of

3100
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:33,500
unitive experience.

3101
03:02:33,700 --> 03:02:38,180
I mean, experientially that somehow that the, the universe is some kind

3102
03:02:38,180 --> 03:02:42,060
of harmonic unified hole that they don't have any sense of that at all.

3103
03:02:42,260 --> 03:02:43,580
Everything is dialectical.

3104
03:02:43,580 --> 03:02:46,980
Everything's confrontational that there's bad guys all around all the time.

3105
03:02:47,220 --> 03:02:52,060
You know, that they develop an entire worldview in that they, and what does

3106
03:02:52,060 --> 03:02:58,900
that do to your, to your mind and to your psyche when you have these secrets and

3107
03:02:58,900 --> 03:03:02,580
you know about these secrets and you know, nobody else does, only you and a very

3108
03:03:02,580 --> 03:03:05,940
few people on earth know that this exists.

3109
03:03:05,940 --> 03:03:08,580
I wonder like what that does to your worldview.

3110
03:03:09,540 --> 03:03:14,500
Well, it's, I mean, the people who are into power, you know, it's a, it's a

3111
03:03:14,500 --> 03:03:18,420
chakra, it's, you know, it's a, it's the third chakra, the third chakra in the

3112
03:03:18,420 --> 03:03:23,780
human body is, is, you know, rooted in power, the, the lust for power and

3113
03:03:23,780 --> 03:03:30,860
control and, and it, it satisfies that, you know, people, people feel privileged

3114
03:03:30,940 --> 03:03:35,980
and, you know, people all, I mean, if you, if you have a Superbowl ticket and get

3115
03:03:35,980 --> 03:03:39,780
Sid in the box, you know, the head of the NFL with them to watch the Superbowl

3116
03:03:39,780 --> 03:03:42,900
game, you know, why are people getting off on that?

3117
03:03:42,980 --> 03:03:45,500
Why, why, why is that, why is that exciting?

3118
03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:48,740
Some people so much, you know, and other people are ho hum.

3119
03:03:48,740 --> 03:03:52,100
They don't care about that at all, you know, but a worldview is

3120
03:03:52,100 --> 03:03:53,620
extraordinarily important thing.

3121
03:03:53,620 --> 03:03:58,060
That's how I ended up eventually at Harvard Dunany school is that, you know,

3122
03:03:58,060 --> 03:03:58,940
the, I'm in F.

3123
03:03:58,940 --> 03:04:01,460
Lee Bailey's office, you know, I'll tell you a story.

3124
03:04:01,620 --> 03:04:02,140
I'm sitting in F.

3125
03:04:02,140 --> 03:04:03,340
Lee Bailey's office, right?

3126
03:04:03,540 --> 03:04:08,900
And it turns out that what had happened is the, this little old man who had

3127
03:04:09,140 --> 03:04:14,780
owned a little mom, pa grocery store in Boston, in the North end of Boston, you

3128
03:04:14,780 --> 03:04:20,860
know, a Friday afternoon, two big no net guys come into his, into his store and

3129
03:04:20,860 --> 03:04:26,820
say, they want to sell him Angelo fire insurance company, you know, and he said,

3130
03:04:26,820 --> 03:04:27,900
I don't need fire insurance.

3131
03:04:27,900 --> 03:04:29,180
I've already got fire insurance.

3132
03:04:29,180 --> 03:04:31,900
And they said, well, you don't have kind of fire insurance that'll keep your

3133
03:04:31,900 --> 03:04:34,100
place from being burnt down next Friday night.

3134
03:04:34,620 --> 03:04:39,460
And, uh, and he, and he looked at them like that and he just, he just rolled

3135
03:04:39,460 --> 03:04:43,540
up his sleeve and he said, look at, you see these numbers right here, the tattooed

3136
03:04:43,540 --> 03:04:45,700
on my arm, I got those at Auschwitz.

3137
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:49,060
He said, you people don't fucking scare me at all.

3138
03:04:49,460 --> 03:04:54,100
Cause I've been through the worst big mistake on his part.

3139
03:04:54,740 --> 03:04:58,940
Cause what they, what they did is they found out that he had a, a daughter,

3140
03:04:59,860 --> 03:05:05,380
single child who was like nine months, eight months pregnant with her first baby.

3141
03:05:05,740 --> 03:05:10,020
And they tracked her down on the mass pike and chased her down on the pike.

3142
03:05:10,020 --> 03:05:13,300
And she pulled off the road and went into a phone booth to try to call the

3143
03:05:13,300 --> 03:05:15,380
emergency call to get help.

3144
03:05:15,980 --> 03:05:18,940
And they got out of the car and shotgunned her right through the glass and

3145
03:05:18,940 --> 03:05:22,460
killed her and the baby and she was dead.

3146
03:05:22,860 --> 03:05:26,780
And the, the shit hit the fan and it was in all the newspapers, you know,

3147
03:05:26,780 --> 03:05:28,420
the Boston Globe all over the place.

3148
03:05:28,620 --> 03:05:28,940
Right.

3149
03:05:29,220 --> 03:05:34,860
Uh, and the ones that killed her that, uh, that, well, it was the Angelo brothers,

3150
03:05:34,860 --> 03:05:39,820
Mikey Angelo, you know, gave the order to killer, you know, and I'm sitting in

3151
03:05:39,820 --> 03:05:44,620
the office, I'm sitting in the office with, with, uh, with, uh, with Lee Bailey.

3152
03:05:44,620 --> 03:05:44,980
Right.

3153
03:05:45,340 --> 03:05:50,940
Uh, and, uh, I get a call from Lee and he says, Danny, he said, uh, have you

3154
03:05:50,940 --> 03:05:54,620
seen the stuff in the papers there about the killing out on the pike?

3155
03:05:54,820 --> 03:05:56,820
And I said, yeah, he says, come on in here, come on down.

3156
03:05:56,820 --> 03:05:58,460
So I go down the hall to his office.

3157
03:05:58,740 --> 03:06:02,780
I come down and here's Al Johnson, who's the managing partner at the

3158
03:06:02,780 --> 03:06:07,700
firm, uh, and bad Andy Tooney, who's, uh, Andy Tooney, who was the head of

3159
03:06:07,700 --> 03:06:12,340
the Strangler Bureau that caught the DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler, right.

3160
03:06:12,820 --> 03:06:17,100
Bailey got appointed by the court to defend him and Bailey stole, stole Andy.

3161
03:06:17,140 --> 03:06:19,700
He was the head of the Strangler Bureau for the Massachusetts state police.

3162
03:06:19,980 --> 03:06:21,420
So they're sitting in the office, right.

3163
03:06:21,660 --> 03:06:24,980
And, uh, and, uh, they're, they're saying, oh yeah, did you see this thing?

3164
03:06:24,980 --> 03:06:30,420
You know, I'm, I'm anticipating getting a call from Mikey Angelo to ask us

3165
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:34,100
to defend him on this thing, because what's happened here is catch this.

3166
03:06:34,420 --> 03:06:38,060
It's like a three, three to four days after the killing.

3167
03:06:38,300 --> 03:06:42,860
And with all this roaring going on in all the news media, you know, somebody

3168
03:06:42,900 --> 03:06:46,700
drives past the place where she was killed, like a hundred miles an hour

3169
03:06:46,700 --> 03:06:51,060
and tosses this guy out of the car and bounces down the highway.

3170
03:06:51,500 --> 03:06:53,820
And he's laying there dying beside the highway.

3171
03:06:54,180 --> 03:06:58,980
Uh, and, uh, well, the Massachusetts state patrol, highway patrol, find him,

3172
03:06:59,260 --> 03:07:01,020
pull up and find him laying by the road.

3173
03:07:01,020 --> 03:07:04,900
And they recognize him as one of Tony, uh, of Mikey Angelo's people.

3174
03:07:05,140 --> 03:07:08,300
He says, he said, Joey, it's just, you know, you're dying.

3175
03:07:08,300 --> 03:07:11,420
He said, tell me, tell me who did this, who, what's this about?

3176
03:07:11,660 --> 03:07:14,340
He says, are you the guy that pulled the trigger on this lady?

3177
03:07:14,380 --> 03:07:15,820
And he said, yes, I am.

3178
03:07:15,820 --> 03:07:17,500
He said, well, who, who told you to do it?

3179
03:07:17,500 --> 03:07:18,340
Who gave you the order?

3180
03:07:18,340 --> 03:07:20,140
And he said, Mikey Angelo.

3181
03:07:20,820 --> 03:07:23,940
And then they, they bring the ambulance, they bring them to mass general

3182
03:07:23,940 --> 03:07:26,020
and he survives, he lives.

3183
03:07:26,380 --> 03:07:29,740
And so now they're getting set to prosecute him and they're going to turn

3184
03:07:29,740 --> 03:07:31,140
him on Mikey Angelo, right?

3185
03:07:31,500 --> 03:07:36,060
And so, so Lee calls me into his office and I'm sitting there with, with, with

3186
03:07:36,060 --> 03:07:40,340
Lee and, uh, Al Johnson and, and bad, Andy, and we're sitting there.

3187
03:07:40,660 --> 03:07:43,300
Uh, and he said, I'm anticipating, he's probably going to call us or try

3188
03:07:43,300 --> 03:07:44,940
to retain us to represent him.

3189
03:07:44,940 --> 03:07:48,500
He said, and Danny, you wrote your, uh, honor thesis at Harvard college, right?

3190
03:07:48,500 --> 03:07:51,860
On like the fifth amendment and the right against self-incrimination.

3191
03:07:51,860 --> 03:07:52,740
So I said, yeah, I did.

3192
03:07:52,740 --> 03:07:56,940
I was predicting the Miranda decision and my thesis at the college, you know?

3193
03:07:56,940 --> 03:08:00,340
And he says, uh, you know, so he says, you know, that, uh, I want you to stay here

3194
03:08:00,340 --> 03:08:03,980
because I, I'm expecting a call from him and the door opens and his secretary

3195
03:08:03,980 --> 03:08:07,020
says, uh, Lee, she said it's Mikey Angelo.

3196
03:08:07,940 --> 03:08:11,500
So I'm sitting here in the office and he goes, look, here, he goes over

3197
03:08:11,500 --> 03:08:14,740
and he picks up the telephone and you can hear him say, yeah, Mikey.

3198
03:08:14,780 --> 03:08:15,220
Yeah.

3199
03:08:15,260 --> 03:08:15,500
Yeah.

3200
03:08:15,500 --> 03:08:16,020
I saw that.

3201
03:08:16,060 --> 03:08:16,620
Oh shit.

3202
03:08:16,620 --> 03:08:16,860
Yeah.

3203
03:08:17,180 --> 03:08:17,900
That's really terrible.

3204
03:08:17,900 --> 03:08:18,180
Yeah.

3205
03:08:18,220 --> 03:08:19,460
No, I hear you.

3206
03:08:19,460 --> 03:08:20,100
I hear you.

3207
03:08:20,340 --> 03:08:21,900
No, no, we'll, we'll, yeah, we'll do that.

3208
03:08:21,900 --> 03:08:23,460
We'll, we'll represent you.

3209
03:08:23,820 --> 03:08:27,380
Uh, yeah, no, that'll be, uh, $1 million cash.

3210
03:08:28,140 --> 03:08:33,740
Uh, anyways, he says, and that's for us, but for the investigation thing, you

3211
03:08:33,740 --> 03:08:37,900
know, the, uh, uh, Moriarty and associates, that's another million dollars.

3212
03:08:38,180 --> 03:08:38,780
Whoa.

3213
03:08:38,820 --> 03:08:40,300
No, Mikey, uh, no way.

3214
03:08:40,300 --> 03:08:41,980
Hey, well, Mikey will fuck you too.

3215
03:08:42,220 --> 03:08:44,940
He said, you know, look at, if you want to call it, and he slams the

3216
03:08:44,940 --> 03:08:45,860
phone down on him like that.

3217
03:08:46,260 --> 03:08:47,700
And so he's sitting there and he's laughing.

3218
03:08:48,060 --> 03:08:51,420
And he's saying, oh, he says, look at, and he reaches, he reaches in his

3219
03:08:51,420 --> 03:08:54,140
fight, he takes out his wallet and he takes out a hundred dollar bill.

3220
03:08:54,140 --> 03:08:56,460
And he lays it on the table and he says, a hundred bucks.

3221
03:08:56,460 --> 03:08:58,180
He calls back within 15 minutes.

3222
03:08:58,700 --> 03:09:03,020
And Al Johnson reaches in his wallet, it takes out a couple of $50 bills.

3223
03:09:03,020 --> 03:09:06,700
And he says, okay, a 10, I'll take, I got a hundred on 10.

3224
03:09:06,700 --> 03:09:08,020
He'll call within 10 minutes.

3225
03:09:08,380 --> 03:09:10,900
And in bad Indy band, he says, I'll take a piece of that.

3226
03:09:10,900 --> 03:09:14,180
He says, look, uh, I'll, I'll take the, uh, I'll take the five minutes.

3227
03:09:14,180 --> 03:09:14,900
I'll take five minutes.

3228
03:09:15,300 --> 03:09:20,700
So, and so Bailey turns to me and he says, Danny, you want a piece of this?

3229
03:09:21,460 --> 03:09:23,060
That's literally, you want a piece of this?

3230
03:09:23,060 --> 03:09:23,660
Yeah.

3231
03:09:23,780 --> 03:09:28,460
I said to myself, what the fuck am I doing in this room with these people?

3232
03:09:28,940 --> 03:09:30,540
I said, you know, I do not want to be here.

3233
03:09:30,540 --> 03:09:33,420
I, you know, and we'd already found out that he was on index four.

3234
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:34,340
Anyway, I already told you.

3235
03:09:34,580 --> 03:09:36,140
So I get up and leave the office.

3236
03:09:36,140 --> 03:09:36,420
Right.

3237
03:09:36,980 --> 03:09:42,260
And, uh, so a day later I'm sitting, I'm sitting in my office and, uh, it must

3238
03:09:42,260 --> 03:09:43,420
be five o'clock in the afternoon.

3239
03:09:43,540 --> 03:09:46,300
I mean, in walks Lee with Mikey and Julo.

3240
03:09:47,460 --> 03:09:52,780
He comes walking in, uh, in Mikey and he says, Danny, this is Mikey and Julo.

3241
03:09:52,780 --> 03:09:55,540
And Julo walks over and sticks his hand out at me like that.

3242
03:09:55,700 --> 03:10:00,420
And I sit there and I just look at him and I say, yeah, I know, I know who you are.

3243
03:10:00,460 --> 03:10:01,220
I know who you are.

3244
03:10:01,580 --> 03:10:06,220
And Julo says, Oh, you know, Lee says that you are, you don't want to help me.

3245
03:10:06,220 --> 03:10:08,100
You don't want to do anything on this case.

3246
03:10:08,100 --> 03:10:10,980
You know, he says, everybody's got a right to, everybody's got a right to have a

3247
03:10:10,980 --> 03:10:11,500
defense.

3248
03:10:11,780 --> 03:10:13,420
And I said, not from me.

3249
03:10:15,340 --> 03:10:18,740
And he says, well, look, I want to have you kind of help me on this.

3250
03:10:18,740 --> 03:10:20,060
I said, look, let me be really clear.

3251
03:10:20,060 --> 03:10:20,300
Mr.

3252
03:10:20,300 --> 03:10:23,300
Angelo, I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire.

3253
03:10:25,660 --> 03:10:26,340
You understand?

3254
03:10:26,900 --> 03:10:30,620
And he just looked at me and it'd be, uh, Lee almost cracked his pants.

3255
03:10:31,500 --> 03:10:35,100
I said, cause look, I said, you know, I know who you are and I know what you do.

3256
03:10:35,340 --> 03:10:38,980
And I think that you kill people, you know, who you think betray you.

3257
03:10:39,620 --> 03:10:42,340
So I don't ever want to be in a position where you're ever going to think that I'm

3258
03:10:42,340 --> 03:10:46,380
going to betray you because I won't put a piece of, I won't put a pencil to paper

3259
03:10:46,380 --> 03:10:46,940
to help you.

3260
03:10:47,420 --> 03:10:49,900
So, and I'll never have to worry about betraying you.

3261
03:10:50,860 --> 03:10:53,980
And he just looked at me and he just burst out laughing like that.

3262
03:10:55,300 --> 03:10:58,380
And, you know, but, and I just would not have anything to do with these people,

3263
03:10:58,700 --> 03:10:59,060
you know?

3264
03:10:59,340 --> 03:11:03,580
Uh, and so I realized that that it's just a completely different worldview.

3265
03:11:03,580 --> 03:11:07,860
And so I would talk with Lee about why you, you, you, you got this whole practice,

3266
03:11:07,860 --> 03:11:09,340
you know, you're a great criminal defense attorney.

3267
03:11:09,340 --> 03:11:12,740
You got this entire private investigation firm, you know, of Moriarty.

3268
03:11:12,740 --> 03:11:15,860
And so it's just, just to do, figure out all the facts on everything.

3269
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:16,140
Right.

3270
03:11:16,580 --> 03:11:20,180
You know, and, uh, I said, why don't you do something good?

3271
03:11:20,740 --> 03:11:24,620
You know, about this, that you've got a whole lot of, you got a lot of notoriety.

3272
03:11:24,620 --> 03:11:25,780
You can do really good things.

3273
03:11:26,060 --> 03:11:29,820
It was like talking to a wall, you know, it was like, uh, you know, uh, and he

3274
03:11:29,820 --> 03:11:32,820
said, no, everybody's got a right to a defense, you know, and I said, yeah, but

3275
03:11:32,820 --> 03:11:34,220
these are professional criminals.

3276
03:11:34,220 --> 03:11:36,500
I mean, you know, they're total gangsters, these people.

3277
03:11:36,740 --> 03:11:39,460
He said, well, everybody's entitled to a defense, you know?

3278
03:11:39,460 --> 03:11:42,340
And so I, I got into this kind of row with him.

3279
03:11:42,580 --> 03:11:46,620
So I leave that, that Friday afternoon, I'm, I'm standing in his place

3280
03:11:46,620 --> 03:11:48,140
over on Beacon Hill, right?

3281
03:11:48,580 --> 03:11:51,820
Uh, and he's living out in Walpole or something, because he's now

3282
03:11:51,820 --> 03:11:56,260
married to his third wife, uh, you know, in the, so I'm staying at the place.

3283
03:11:56,260 --> 03:12:01,540
So I go to church on Sunday morning over at, uh, uh, uh, with St.

3284
03:12:01,540 --> 03:12:03,140
Cecilia's, so I go over to St.

3285
03:12:03,180 --> 03:12:07,980
Cecilia's and I'm, I come out of church and I'm kind of wandering back over to

3286
03:12:07,980 --> 03:12:11,140
her Beacon Hill and I stop in at a bookstore and I'm kind of looking around

3287
03:12:11,140 --> 03:12:12,740
at the books like I do sometimes.

3288
03:12:12,740 --> 03:12:15,940
And I found John Rawls theory of justice.

3289
03:12:16,180 --> 03:12:19,220
John Rawls is the head of the department of philosophy at Harvard university.

3290
03:12:19,620 --> 03:12:23,540
And he's written this major treatise on, uh, on justice.

3291
03:12:24,020 --> 03:12:28,300
It was long story short, I read through the thing and he says that there's this

3292
03:12:28,300 --> 03:12:33,060
whole group of people, which he calls the intuitionists who are the ones who

3293
03:12:33,060 --> 03:12:36,420
make these kinds of statements, like all men are created equal endowed by their

3294
03:12:36,420 --> 03:12:39,700
career or certain enable rights and their life, liberty and pride, you know,

3295
03:12:39,700 --> 03:12:41,100
they've got all these rights and stuff.

3296
03:12:41,340 --> 03:12:45,300
And they are a counter force in our country to what they call the

3297
03:12:45,300 --> 03:12:50,460
majoritarian unitara, utilitarians who, if they're, if our people are faced

3298
03:12:50,460 --> 03:12:53,900
with a choice between one policy or another, they will pick the one

3299
03:12:53,980 --> 03:12:56,980
theoretically that generates the greatest good for the greatest number, right?

3300
03:12:56,980 --> 03:13:00,500
John Stuart milled, you know, utilitarianism, you know, but he

3301
03:13:00,500 --> 03:13:01,860
says it doesn't happen that way.

3302
03:13:02,180 --> 03:13:06,180
He says, if that were true, what Rawls says in his theory of justice that, you

3303
03:13:06,180 --> 03:13:09,580
know, then the 90% of us that are white was still owned the 10% of the people

3304
03:13:09,580 --> 03:13:13,460
that are black, he said, but we don't because there's this other group called

3305
03:13:13,460 --> 03:13:18,060
the intuitionists who keep making these kind of proclamations about natural law

3306
03:13:18,060 --> 03:13:19,660
and their natural rights and all that.

3307
03:13:20,340 --> 03:13:22,220
And, uh, and so I saw it.

3308
03:13:22,220 --> 03:13:24,620
So I bring it home, I buy a copy and I go home and I read it.

3309
03:13:24,900 --> 03:13:29,300
Uh, and I call up John Rawls, you know, and I talked to his secretary and I'm

3310
03:13:29,300 --> 03:13:32,460
saying, you know, I graduated from Harvard college and Harvard law school,

3311
03:13:32,460 --> 03:13:35,420
and I did this and did that, and I'm waving the school tie through the phone

3312
03:13:35,420 --> 03:13:39,540
at her as I'd like to get a chance to talk to professor Rawls, you know, about

3313
03:13:39,540 --> 03:13:41,060
this, about his new book.

3314
03:13:41,380 --> 03:13:44,580
Uh, and so she calls me back a little bit later and she says, okay, you

3315
03:13:44,580 --> 03:13:47,260
can get 30 minutes, you know, Wednesday afternoon.

3316
03:13:47,780 --> 03:13:50,780
So I go over and sit down with John Rawls, the head of the department of

3317
03:13:50,780 --> 03:13:52,140
philosophy at Harvard university.

3318
03:13:52,540 --> 03:13:55,700
And I started talking to him about what's caused me to come and talk with him

3319
03:13:55,700 --> 03:13:58,420
about this, cause you know, I've got this thing with Lee Bailey, I've been

3320
03:13:58,420 --> 03:14:02,260
to Cahill firm, Cahill firm was trying to get me to represent the Arkansas

3321
03:14:02,260 --> 03:14:06,660
Missouri power company that was trying to buy an all black company and raise

3322
03:14:06,660 --> 03:14:08,980
the rates and I wouldn't do it, you know?

3323
03:14:09,100 --> 03:14:13,100
And, uh, and so the bottom line is I was explaining this all to him and he ended

3324
03:14:13,100 --> 03:14:16,340
up talking me into coming back to Harvard, to coming back and doing a

3325
03:14:16,340 --> 03:14:21,380
master's and PhD in comparative social ethics, uh, comparing, contrasting

3326
03:14:21,380 --> 03:14:22,340
different worldviews.

3327
03:14:22,620 --> 03:14:26,580
And it was there that I began to really study and find out that people have

3328
03:14:26,580 --> 03:14:29,700
completely different worldviews, uh, about things.

3329
03:14:29,740 --> 03:14:34,380
Uh, and we got to understand what the underlying premise was of different

3330
03:14:34,380 --> 03:14:36,820
people's worldviews that are even unconscious.

3331
03:14:36,820 --> 03:14:39,300
They don't even know sometimes what they believe.

3332
03:14:39,900 --> 03:14:42,100
And so I ended up doing the work there.

3333
03:14:42,100 --> 03:14:46,580
And that's why I got recruited by Jesuit national headquarters because I've been

3334
03:14:46,580 --> 03:14:50,780
writing some papers and stuff from my master's work in father Roger Couture,

3335
03:14:50,780 --> 03:14:54,820
who teaches the course at Harvard loss, Harvard divinity school on the

3336
03:14:54,820 --> 03:14:59,460
theological underpinnings of human rights, you know, called me in and said,

3337
03:14:59,500 --> 03:15:03,660
uh, he said, look, uh, I'm a son of shared these papers you've been writing

3338
03:15:03,660 --> 03:15:07,340
and the, the, the work that you've been doing on this, you know, uh, are you

3339
03:15:07,340 --> 03:15:11,900
aware of the fact I can tell that you're Catholic from the way you're writing?

3340
03:15:12,180 --> 03:15:15,820
He said, but, uh, and I checked out, you know, you're not married or anything.

3341
03:15:15,820 --> 03:15:20,020
He said, you know, uh, are you aware of the fact that, uh, that the Jesuits,

3342
03:15:20,260 --> 03:15:24,860
that the father general of the Jesuits Pedro Arrupe has called all 100

3343
03:15:24,860 --> 03:15:30,860
provincials of the Jesuit order into Rome, uh, to do some major treatise on

3344
03:15:30,860 --> 03:15:34,860
social justice, and they're going to create a new national headquarters in

3345
03:15:34,860 --> 03:15:39,860
Washington, DC, and they're looking for a general council, uh, and I've recommended

3346
03:15:39,860 --> 03:15:43,580
you, uh, would you be willing to do an interview with them?

3347
03:15:44,100 --> 03:15:46,300
And so I said, sure.

3348
03:15:46,340 --> 03:15:49,940
You know, and so I did, and they asked me to become general counsel.

3349
03:15:50,340 --> 03:15:51,940
Uh, at the Jesuit headquarters.

3350
03:15:51,940 --> 03:15:54,500
So we had 10,000 Jesuits all around the world.

3351
03:15:54,500 --> 03:15:58,740
We got doing social justice documents in the, the turns out that the Jesuit

3352
03:15:58,740 --> 03:16:05,060
order has, has become a huge source of all the social justice documents that

3353
03:16:05,060 --> 03:16:08,740
are being published by the Catholic church and Francis, Pope Francis, who's

3354
03:16:08,740 --> 03:16:12,820
the first Jesuit in history to ever become Pope, you know, and so that I was

3355
03:16:12,820 --> 03:16:16,660
right there at the, at the international headquarters where we were dealing with,

3356
03:16:16,660 --> 03:16:20,180
you know, liberation theology, you know, all the stuff in South America.

3357
03:16:20,460 --> 03:16:22,100
Uh, and I knew all the people.

3358
03:16:22,100 --> 03:16:23,100
I knew Gutierrez.

3359
03:16:23,100 --> 03:16:24,700
I knew everybody who writes these things.

3360
03:16:25,020 --> 03:16:28,540
You know, I got to go to Rome and meet with the, the superior general

3361
03:16:28,540 --> 03:16:32,900
with Pedro Arrupe, you know, uh, and so that I was right in the catbird seat.

3362
03:16:33,180 --> 03:16:37,620
And what I brought in was I brought in the professional investigators from

3363
03:16:37,620 --> 03:16:40,540
Lee Bailey's office, the people that were in Moriarty and associates,

3364
03:16:40,540 --> 03:16:44,220
cause they all knew me and they knew that I had thrown this big shit fit

3365
03:16:44,540 --> 03:16:47,100
and that I wouldn't work for the organized crime people.

3366
03:16:47,100 --> 03:16:48,180
I wouldn't do any of that stuff.

3367
03:16:48,500 --> 03:16:50,900
And so these guys were all calling me up saying, Oh, you've got

3368
03:16:50,900 --> 03:16:52,100
anything I can do to help you.

3369
03:16:52,380 --> 03:16:55,140
Can I, can I help you with some stuff that, you know, you're doing the

3370
03:16:55,140 --> 03:16:57,340
kind of things that I always hoped that I could really do.

3371
03:16:57,660 --> 03:17:02,260
And so we became this source of them getting to do good things together.

3372
03:17:02,260 --> 03:17:02,540
Right.

3373
03:17:02,820 --> 03:17:04,660
And so here I was at Jesuit headquarters.

3374
03:17:04,820 --> 03:17:07,420
So I had access to all the Jesuit guys around the world.

3375
03:17:07,420 --> 03:17:11,820
I had the investigators from Bailey's office, you know, and I, so we

3376
03:17:11,820 --> 03:17:15,020
started putting together a group and I had access.

3377
03:17:15,020 --> 03:17:19,860
The secret that I had, you know, uh, is that, that, uh, William

3378
03:17:19,860 --> 03:17:23,340
Johnstone Taylor, who was appointed to me to be my chief investigator,

3379
03:17:23,580 --> 03:17:27,700
three tour Vietnam Marine Corps, CID, criminal investigation division,

3380
03:17:28,060 --> 03:17:33,420
you know, uh, liaison to the CIA and in Saigon, you know, was, was my

3381
03:17:33,420 --> 03:17:37,740
investigator, uh, and he had, he'd been there three tours in Vietnam.

3382
03:17:37,740 --> 03:17:41,580
So he knew all the guys coming through army CID office of special

3383
03:17:41,580 --> 03:17:46,100
investigations for the air force, the naval intelligence guys, he knew

3384
03:17:46,100 --> 03:17:50,020
everybody in these guys, after they would do like a two year tour in

3385
03:17:50,020 --> 03:17:53,780
Vietnam, they would leave, leave the military and they go into secret

3386
03:17:53,780 --> 03:17:58,900
service and the FBI and the CIA, US marshals offices, you know, uh, district

3387
03:17:58,900 --> 03:18:01,140
attorneys, investigators all over the country.

3388
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:01,900
Wow.

3389
03:18:02,020 --> 03:18:06,860
And so I had all these guys who, that when Taylor would call them up and

3390
03:18:06,860 --> 03:18:09,860
say, look, I got a, I got a job for you.

3391
03:18:09,900 --> 03:18:11,100
I want you to help us.

3392
03:18:11,420 --> 03:18:13,740
And on board they were like that.

3393
03:18:14,060 --> 03:18:18,660
And we had guys, I had, I had the commander for United States army CID,

3394
03:18:19,100 --> 03:18:23,780
uh, you know, working with us, you know, telling us everything, you know, I had

3395
03:18:23,780 --> 03:18:27,780
to, you know, Gene Wheaton, the head of the U S military mission in Tehran, you

3396
03:18:27,780 --> 03:18:30,660
know, who, who had been the chief of security of United States Marine Corps

3397
03:18:30,660 --> 03:18:35,220
at Kaysan, you know, I mean, these are the guys, you know, and some of it had

3398
03:18:35,220 --> 03:18:38,900
to do with the fact that I was from Harvard law school and Lee Bailey's office.

3399
03:18:38,900 --> 03:18:41,140
And they all said, whoa, shit, you know, this would be cool.

3400
03:18:41,500 --> 03:18:44,340
And so I got all these people to come in to work with us.

3401
03:18:44,580 --> 03:18:47,100
And this was the best thing they'd ever done in their whole life.

3402
03:18:47,100 --> 03:18:50,940
Everything we did, they were just totally delighted that they finally

3403
03:18:50,940 --> 03:18:53,100
got to do something good, you know?

3404
03:18:53,100 --> 03:18:54,820
And so that's, that's what we are.

3405
03:18:54,940 --> 03:18:59,100
I mean, that's what the Christchurch Institute was until Bush ordered them to

3406
03:18:59,100 --> 03:19:04,300
yank our 501 C three saying that we were engaged in political activity because

3407
03:19:04,300 --> 03:19:07,740
nobody had been ultimately criminally convicted of the charges we made against

3408
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:10,460
them because he pardoned them, you know?

3409
03:19:11,220 --> 03:19:14,620
And so that, so I don't mind, you know, people go, Oh, you know, he

3410
03:19:14,620 --> 03:19:16,100
yanked your 501 C three.

3411
03:19:16,140 --> 03:19:19,660
So what, you know, we'll get another 501 C three and we'll become the Romero

3412
03:19:19,660 --> 03:19:22,140
Institute, which we do, you know?

3413
03:19:22,140 --> 03:19:23,340
And so we just keep going.

3414
03:19:23,420 --> 03:19:30,060
And so that, that's why, that's why Lou Elizondo called me when the, he brought

3415
03:19:30,060 --> 03:19:33,660
the, the videos and stuff, he and Chris Mellon brought the videos to the New York

3416
03:19:33,660 --> 03:19:35,580
Times and showed them all to them.

3417
03:19:35,580 --> 03:19:38,980
And the Pentagon started shitting on him, you know, and say, we don't know

3418
03:19:38,980 --> 03:19:43,220
who Lou Elizondo is, he's never been any such thing, there's no such project at

3419
03:19:43,220 --> 03:19:48,940
the Pentagon, we were not investigating UFOs, he called me up and asked me to

3420
03:19:48,940 --> 03:19:49,580
represent him.

3421
03:19:50,100 --> 03:19:53,940
And so we put together the complaint with the inspector general's office of

3422
03:19:53,940 --> 03:19:58,060
the defense department, you know, it wasn't just a whistleblower defense, you

3423
03:19:58,060 --> 03:20:02,740
know, it was, it was challenging them for lying to the American people and lying

3424
03:20:02,740 --> 03:20:07,340
to Congress that this is unconstitutional for you guys to be lying to Congress and

3425
03:20:07,340 --> 03:20:09,180
concealing this information from them.

3426
03:20:09,420 --> 03:20:13,820
So we brought, we brought in this huge complaint into the United States

3427
03:20:13,820 --> 03:20:17,380
inspector general for the defense department and basically sat there

3428
03:20:17,380 --> 03:20:19,300
briefing the inspector general.

3429
03:20:19,500 --> 03:20:24,180
And as we started briefing him on what was really going on for the UFO issue, he

3430
03:20:24,180 --> 03:20:31,100
was just flabbergasted, you know, in, in, instead of being mad at, at, at Lou for

3431
03:20:31,300 --> 03:20:35,700
having blown the whistle on these people, he started bringing in officers in full

3432
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:39,220
uniforms sitting around the desk and we would sit there briefing them on what was

3433
03:20:39,220 --> 03:20:42,980
going on, and their eyes were like big as saucers, you go, holy shit, you mean

3434
03:20:42,980 --> 03:20:43,980
this is really true?

3435
03:20:44,220 --> 03:20:47,660
I mean, the, the J2, the guy that was the head of intelligence for the joint

3436
03:20:47,660 --> 03:20:51,380
chiefs of staff was, was briefed out of this thing.

3437
03:20:51,620 --> 03:20:54,620
He, he wasn't allowed to ask any questions about it at all.

3438
03:20:54,980 --> 03:20:57,780
And he was the chief of intelligence for the joint chiefs of staff, and he

3439
03:20:57,780 --> 03:20:59,700
wasn't even allowed to ask any questions about it.

3440
03:21:00,060 --> 03:21:01,620
You know, and these guys were furious.

3441
03:21:01,820 --> 03:21:05,100
So, so we've got guys all through the military that are pissed off at these

3442
03:21:05,100 --> 03:21:08,260
guys, we've got all the people in Congress and the House and Senate that

3443
03:21:08,260 --> 03:21:12,220
are pissed off at these guys for lying to them and saying there's no such program

3444
03:21:12,220 --> 03:21:16,980
going on at all, and they're, and they're embezzling billions of dollars, billions

3445
03:21:16,980 --> 03:21:20,620
of dollars out of the defense budget, saying that they've appropriated the

3446
03:21:20,620 --> 03:21:24,620
money for some particular project and they really putting it over into trying

3447
03:21:24,620 --> 03:21:28,860
to back engineer the technology so they can build a weapon system, you know, to

3448
03:21:28,860 --> 03:21:32,780
be able to strike into the heart of Russia, you know, in two minutes, which

3449
03:21:32,780 --> 03:21:37,020
is going to totally destabilize the entire geopolitical structures that have

3450
03:21:37,020 --> 03:21:39,260
been put together to stop nuclear war.

3451
03:21:40,100 --> 03:21:43,700
You know, nobody's, nobody's, they've signed an agreement that they won't

3452
03:21:43,700 --> 03:21:48,420
have first strike weapons, you know, and this is an attempt to get around, you

3453
03:21:48,420 --> 03:21:50,940
know, the whole treaty because they consider the people in the state

3454
03:21:50,940 --> 03:21:54,300
department commies, you know, I mean, that's what they do.

3455
03:21:54,540 --> 03:21:59,020
They think that they're not really solely in, in, in defense of our

3456
03:21:59,020 --> 03:22:02,340
national interests, you know, that they're trying to make treaties with

3457
03:22:02,340 --> 03:22:05,700
people and negotiate, they hate the United Nations, you know, they, they,

3458
03:22:05,700 --> 03:22:11,860
they hate treaties with other countries, NATO, you know, that they're into, they're

3459
03:22:11,860 --> 03:22:16,260
fucking fascists is what they are, you know, and that's what they're into.

3460
03:22:16,700 --> 03:22:20,900
And they, they think that it's perfectly appropriate if they think it's

3461
03:22:20,940 --> 03:22:25,580
perfectly appropriate to, to engage in utilizing their military and their

3462
03:22:25,580 --> 03:22:30,820
intelligence resources to garner a privileged access to the strategic raw

3463
03:22:30,820 --> 03:22:31,980
materials of the planet.

3464
03:22:32,220 --> 03:22:33,180
What else is there?

3465
03:22:34,460 --> 03:22:36,500
I mean, that's, that's what they think is okay.

3466
03:22:36,860 --> 03:22:37,740
And that's their job.

3467
03:22:37,740 --> 03:22:41,900
And unfortunately, the way the institutions are set up is that is in

3468
03:22:41,900 --> 03:22:43,660
fact what they've been tasked to do.

3469
03:22:44,340 --> 03:22:47,900
And so they're totally loyal to that and they're totally devoted to doing it.

3470
03:22:48,260 --> 03:22:51,620
And they view the elected representatives as temporary employees,

3471
03:22:52,180 --> 03:22:53,220
you know, who come and go.

3472
03:22:53,220 --> 03:22:57,260
They're the BMOC types, you know, the big men on campus that used to be the

3473
03:22:57,460 --> 03:23:00,500
president of their fraternities and they're a bunch of phonies, you know, and

3474
03:23:00,500 --> 03:23:04,420
all they want to do is, is, you know, parade around and be celebrities, you

3475
03:23:04,420 --> 03:23:08,260
know, and they, they hold them basically in disdain, you know, including

3476
03:23:08,260 --> 03:23:11,980
the presidents, you know, and you say, no, what does that mean from a

3477
03:23:11,980 --> 03:23:13,500
constitutional point of view?

3478
03:23:13,940 --> 03:23:16,620
You know, I don't believe that I'm naive about it.

3479
03:23:16,900 --> 03:23:20,660
I don't believe that I'm, you know, fell off some melon wagon, like I'm

3480
03:23:20,660 --> 03:23:24,700
some country bumpkin or something, you know, I happen to believe this stuff.

3481
03:23:25,020 --> 03:23:27,420
And I believe that it, that we can make it true.

3482
03:23:27,660 --> 03:23:31,100
Um, thank you so much for coming all the way down here and doing this.

3483
03:23:31,180 --> 03:23:33,620
We just did almost four hours and that was incredible.

3484
03:23:33,940 --> 03:23:38,300
The amount, like I said before, the amount of knowledge and history that

3485
03:23:38,300 --> 03:23:44,620
you have in your mind and is, is absolutely astonishing and, uh, I'm

3486
03:23:44,620 --> 03:23:45,940
really grateful for you coming down here, man.

3487
03:23:46,100 --> 03:23:47,500
No, I'm delighted to come.

3488
03:23:47,860 --> 03:23:52,060
I want to talk to the people about these things, you know, that we haven't,

3489
03:23:52,100 --> 03:23:55,300
I haven't been talking about these things for people for years, but I

3490
03:23:55,300 --> 03:23:57,620
said, you know, this is the, this is the issue.

3491
03:23:58,300 --> 03:24:02,340
I'm just going to bring all of that to bear because the, the misdeeds of the

3492
03:24:02,340 --> 03:24:06,220
national security state, which I've talked about in a number of different

3493
03:24:06,220 --> 03:24:10,420
areas, all come to roost on this thing, you know, that they believe that they

3494
03:24:10,420 --> 03:24:14,180
actually are entitled to keep secret from the people, the fact that there's

3495
03:24:14,180 --> 03:24:18,580
an extraterrestrial civilization of people coming and going from our planet,

3496
03:24:18,980 --> 03:24:23,220
you know, and that our people are engaged in trying to back engineer their,

3497
03:24:23,260 --> 03:24:26,100
their craft to, to develop weapons systems.

3498
03:24:26,100 --> 03:24:30,660
You know, I'll do one story in closing on this is that, uh, help put off.

3499
03:24:30,660 --> 03:24:35,420
I don't know if you know how help put off told us that, uh, he was, uh, he

3500
03:24:35,420 --> 03:24:39,540
was meeting with Bill Clinton back during 1992 and the Clinton administration.

3501
03:24:39,820 --> 03:24:42,980
When they, when the Lawrence Rockefeller and the people were talking about trying

3502
03:24:42,980 --> 03:24:47,060
to consider putting this information out, right.

3503
03:24:47,780 --> 03:24:51,100
He's at a meeting in the science advisor for Bill Clinton is there.

3504
03:24:51,500 --> 03:24:55,100
And so Hal says to me, he says, what's, what's, what do you think is really

3505
03:24:55,100 --> 03:24:58,380
the source of all the pushback that we're getting on trying to get this information

3506
03:24:58,380 --> 03:25:01,940
out and the science advisor says, you know, let's go outside where I can talk

3507
03:25:01,940 --> 03:25:05,540
to you, which tells you something about what they're worried about, the kind

3508
03:25:05,540 --> 03:25:08,540
of surveillance and stuff that's going down against the political people.

3509
03:25:08,900 --> 03:25:12,260
He said, he said, so he goes outside and he said, here, let me, let me give you

3510
03:25:12,420 --> 03:25:13,100
an analysis.

3511
03:25:13,100 --> 03:25:17,220
He said of what I think the problem is here of why they're pushing back so hard.

3512
03:25:17,220 --> 03:25:21,100
He said, he said, there's a story about this old man, little old man who's on his

3513
03:25:21,100 --> 03:25:24,500
way back from somewhere, he's coming home at night early in the evening and he's

3514
03:25:24,500 --> 03:25:28,220
walking through this field and he looks down and he sees this light like in the

3515
03:25:28,220 --> 03:25:33,100
grass and he leans down and it's a frog and the frog has this little light like

3516
03:25:33,100 --> 03:25:36,940
on top of his head and he reaches down and picks, this is how put off telling me

3517
03:25:36,940 --> 03:25:37,340
the story.

3518
03:25:37,340 --> 03:25:40,460
He said, he said, this is the answer that the, this is what the science

3519
03:25:40,460 --> 03:25:44,500
advisor told him is the answer for why they're pushing back like this.

3520
03:25:44,820 --> 03:25:48,100
He said, and the little man reaches out and picks up the frog and he

3521
03:25:48,100 --> 03:25:49,780
recognizes that it's a crown.

3522
03:25:50,020 --> 03:25:53,620
The little light is a crown on the head of the frog and the frog looks up at

3523
03:25:53,620 --> 03:25:55,300
him and says, I'm not a frog.

3524
03:25:55,300 --> 03:25:56,180
I'm a princess.

3525
03:25:56,220 --> 03:25:59,700
I'm a beautiful princess and I've been turned into a frog by this evil

3526
03:25:59,700 --> 03:26:04,620
sorcerer and all you have to do is kiss me, you kiss me and I'll turn back into

3527
03:26:04,620 --> 03:26:08,060
this beautiful princess and you and I'll be married and we'll have many great

3528
03:26:08,060 --> 03:26:11,700
children and we'll be able to rule our, our place with priests and justice.

3529
03:26:12,020 --> 03:26:15,780
And the little man looks at her and he says, at my age, I think I'll

3530
03:26:15,780 --> 03:26:17,620
settle for having a talking frog.

3531
03:26:23,060 --> 03:26:23,620
That's good.

3532
03:26:24,300 --> 03:26:24,620
Okay.

3533
03:26:24,980 --> 03:26:26,380
That's what we've got happening here.

3534
03:26:26,740 --> 03:26:29,460
These people are willing to settle for talking frog.

3535
03:26:29,860 --> 03:26:32,540
You know, just, just like Woodward and Bernstein were willing to

3536
03:26:32,540 --> 03:26:37,100
settle for just that they caught creep money going to the people that

3537
03:26:37,100 --> 03:26:40,620
burglarized the water gate, you know, and let the whole other thing go.

3538
03:26:40,940 --> 03:26:44,780
You know, they're missing out on this astonishing opportunity for our

3539
03:26:44,780 --> 03:26:49,300
entire human family to enter into an entire new era, you know, of, of safe

3540
03:26:49,300 --> 03:26:54,980
energy and plenty for everybody and a positive relationship with an entire

3541
03:26:54,980 --> 03:26:59,260
extraterrestrial civilization and all they can think of do is how to make

3542
03:26:59,260 --> 03:27:03,620
weapons out of it so that we can shoot a missile into Russia in two minutes.

3543
03:27:04,580 --> 03:27:05,780
That's a serious problem.

3544
03:27:06,020 --> 03:27:09,340
And I don't think the American people are going to support that.

3545
03:27:09,940 --> 03:27:12,900
I think the American people want to know the information about this.

3546
03:27:12,900 --> 03:27:16,900
I think that they, they want to, and I want to have the people understand that

3547
03:27:16,900 --> 03:27:21,900
the national security state has to be disassembled because the United

3548
03:27:21,900 --> 03:27:28,620
States has become the Russians has become the bad guys that are applying their

3549
03:27:28,620 --> 03:27:33,460
trade all on behalf of establishing full spectrum military dominance over the

3550
03:27:33,460 --> 03:27:33,900
planet.

3551
03:27:34,340 --> 03:27:36,100
You know, we're living at the heart of Rome.

3552
03:27:36,420 --> 03:27:39,220
You know, people all like to believe that, Oh, if I were in Rome, I would

3553
03:27:39,220 --> 03:27:41,420
have opposed slavery, human slavery.

3554
03:27:41,980 --> 03:27:45,020
If I'd been in the South in the 1800s, I would have opposed slave.

3555
03:27:45,020 --> 03:27:45,700
No, you wouldn't.

3556
03:27:46,300 --> 03:27:49,780
They would be just as passive as a lot of the people are now because they

3557
03:27:49,780 --> 03:27:50,900
don't think they're involved.

3558
03:27:50,900 --> 03:27:53,300
They don't think they can have any effect upon anything.

3559
03:27:53,580 --> 03:27:57,060
That's what the, that's what the new paradigm Institute is going to be saying.

3560
03:27:57,340 --> 03:27:58,700
You have to be citizens.

3561
03:27:58,700 --> 03:28:00,020
You have to step forward.

3562
03:28:00,020 --> 03:28:02,620
You have to pay some attention to what's going on here.

3563
03:28:02,780 --> 03:28:04,500
You know, you got jobs, you got everything else.

3564
03:28:04,500 --> 03:28:06,300
We're not asking you for an awful lot of time.

3565
03:28:06,660 --> 03:28:10,700
What we're saying is all you have to do is go to new paradigm Institute.org and,

3566
03:28:10,700 --> 03:28:13,420
you know, get as much information as you want or as little as you want.

3567
03:28:13,620 --> 03:28:18,260
It's going to be very informative, very entertaining, you know, and, and you can

3568
03:28:18,260 --> 03:28:23,620
be actively participating in helping to get the Congress to do the right thing

3569
03:28:23,620 --> 03:28:27,580
about all this, you know, and you can, you can, you can tell your great, great,

3570
03:28:27,580 --> 03:28:30,100
great grandchildren that you were there.

3571
03:28:30,340 --> 03:28:34,020
I mean, we're, we're, we're at the time where the protocols are going to be

3572
03:28:34,020 --> 03:28:37,460
established, they're going to control our relationship with an extraterrestrial

3573
03:28:37,460 --> 03:28:39,980
civilization for 10,000 years in the future.

3574
03:28:40,020 --> 03:28:40,500
I'm ready.

3575
03:28:40,780 --> 03:28:41,420
I'm ready for it.

3576
03:28:41,460 --> 03:28:45,500
You know, this next year is going to be, uh, quite a whirlwind.

3577
03:28:45,620 --> 03:28:48,900
I have a feeling, especially with the presidential elections coming up and

3578
03:28:48,900 --> 03:28:53,140
everything that's going on in Congress with this grush guy and I can't wait.

3579
03:28:53,300 --> 03:28:56,940
And, uh, thanks again for enlightening me on all this amazing information.

3580
03:28:56,980 --> 03:28:58,900
You're more than welcome paradigminstitute.org.

3581
03:28:58,940 --> 03:29:03,940
I'll link all your stuff below and also I want to ask you a couple more quick

3582
03:29:03,940 --> 03:29:07,020
questions, but I'm going to do it after we wrap up this podcast because I don't

3583
03:29:07,020 --> 03:29:10,780
want to get my, I don't want to get this video nuked by YouTube for asking you

3584
03:29:10,780 --> 03:29:13,740
these questions, so it's going to be on our Patreon, so that's also linked below.

3585
03:29:14,060 --> 03:29:14,660
Goodnight everybody.

3586
03:29:15,300 --> 03:29:16,180
Goodnight everybody.
