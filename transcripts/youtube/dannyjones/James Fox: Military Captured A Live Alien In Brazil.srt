1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,520
It's an honor to have you here. I really appreciate you coming down and doing the show.

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:21,040
You have a phenomenal body of work behind you from Phenomenon, all the works before

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:28,920
that, your latest film. It's totally, absolutely mind-bending, some of the stuff that you do.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,080
For people that aren't familiar, I doubt there's any, but for people that don't know or aren't

5
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,160
familiar with your work, just give me a brief background on how you got into this subject,

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
filmmaking.

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
How brief?

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,480
Yeah, we got plenty of time.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,760
Okay, because I could actually give you a slightly less brief version because it's kind

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,280
of funny how I got into it all.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,680
Were you into filmmaking? Were you originally just a filmmaker first and just got obsessed

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,200
with this topic of UFOs and UAVs?

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Kind of, kind of.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,760
Because I can tell just by your work, the way you produce your films, the style and

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,240
everything, I'm a big fan of that in a totally separate bubble of the topic. If you even

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,760
separate the UFO topic, which is fascinating, the style of your films and the way you cut

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,040
them and the way you shoot them, I'm a huge fan of that.

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,960
Thank you. I strive for credibility with the Phenomenon because I used to always tell people

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,520
they're like, oh, you got to add the green smoke and the, you know, the cheesy lights.

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:38,520
And I'm like, no, you don't. The story itself, any UFO story is so fascinating, so otherworldly,

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:46,120
excuse the pun there, but that I would always say if you could add credibility to a fascinating

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:56,160
story, like someone coming in contact allegedly with a UFO, then that will succeed, you know,

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:04,360
because that's the story's already so incredible and already so unbelievable that if you could

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:12,080
add that element of credibility to your production, then that's a winning recipe.

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,040
And so I developed that very, very early on. I remember having like shouting matches with

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,440
the two older guys that I was working with. They're like, you don't know anything about

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,120
filmmaking and we're going to put, you know, you need to add overproduce and put cheesy

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,040
effects in and just, just stuff that was just makes you want to puke in a bucket. You know

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
what I mean?

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,640
Yeah. We talked about this before. There's a lot of, there's a lot of shows out there

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,040
on the big networks that they go so far overboard with the graphics, the motion graphics and

32
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,760
all that stuff and the production of it. And it's just so for people like, I don't know

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,200
for normal people what it's like, but for people like you and me, it's just, you can

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,960
see right through it. It just makes it, I don't think it does the subject any favors.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,560
I find it unwatchable when I look at it, because if this, if the story's not compelling enough

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,200
to carry itself and you have to add those so-called bells and whistles or whatever to

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,160
keep people's attention, then, then don't do that story. You know what I mean?

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Let me back up. My father was a mainstream journalist. His name was Charles Fox. He wrote,

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,440
we lived on the East coast. He wrote for Car and Driver magazine in the sixties and he

40
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,320
was born in England and he got multiple sclerosis when, when I was born. And so I, as I grew

41
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:32,640
up, I became sort of his, his legs, his secretary, his chauffeur, his assistant, and I traveled

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,440
all around and got to do these really cool stories, watching my father perform as a journalist.

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,480
And it was a lot of hard work. I remember thinking like all the writing for the stories

44
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,040
and all the copy editing that goes into it. It was more work than you'd expect when it's

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,520
just words. And so I kind of was exposed to journalism at an early age, more so than it

46
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,520
would have been because of my father's condition. And people would be like, oh, you're so lucky

47
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,280
you got to travel around the world and do all these cool things. I'm like, you try traveling

48
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,320
with a quadriplegic sometime. Okay. And see how, how hard that is, you know, because it's

49
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,000
basically like, you know, having a, you know, a 200 pound baby trying to make a living.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,780
And I'm not referring to my dad as a baby. He was an amazing guy, but I had to take care

51
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,160
of all of his needs because he couldn't move, but he would travel and he was incredibly

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,680
driven and he was hilarious and fun to be around. And so we had a kind of a different

53
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,680
relationship, father-son relationship very early on because of his dependence on me and

54
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,080
my dependence on him. It was a co-dependency thing, but we got along great and we had a

55
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,040
lot of fun. We traveled all around the world and I was driving on the Autobahn when I was

56
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,440
like 15, you know, basically doing stuff that I shouldn't have been doing until I was, I

57
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,520
remember driving to go see this guy, Dan Gurney was a race car driver. He, there was films

58
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,520
about him even on now, I think Mustang versus Ford or no Ford versus Ferrari. Anyway, my

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,800
dad goes, God, my legs are really bad today. I can't drive, you know, and I was like 12

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,000
or 13. We were in Southern California and he goes, you're going to have to take the

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,600
wheel. I said, dad, I've never driven on the freeway. He goes, just keep it. I'll never

62
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,400
forget this. He goes, just keep it between the lines. So I've got this big van and my

63
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,400
dad in his chair and I'm like, you know, because with multiple sclerosis, he couldn't, he got

64
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,160
to the point where he couldn't walk anymore, but he could still like move his legs a little

65
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,720
bit on a good day where he could, you know, activate the accelerator. Eventually he lost

66
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,680
all movement, but there was a period of, I don't know, five or 10 years where on a good

67
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,040
day things were going well. You know, he could drive if you could get him behind the wheel.

68
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,960
He could push the accelerator pedal and the brake pedal and all that stuff. But I just

69
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,040
remember like, and then we pulled up to interview this guy, Dan Gurney, and who won LeMans,

70
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,040
I think in the sixties. And he goes, uh, how old your son driving, you know? So my point

71
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,040
is, is that I got to, uh, share a, intimately share my father's career as a journalist very

72
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,280
early on because of his, his condition. And so I, um, I remember, uh, finding the video

73
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,200
camera, like just discovering the video camera and what a great tool that was for instant

74
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:37,480
playback and communication and documentation of stuff. And it seemed to me a really nice

75
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,160
alternative than all the hard work that my father used to have to do with writing stories.

76
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,320
I mean, I was shocked at how much work went into writing an article. Of course, later,

77
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,520
I realized, you know, once you document things, you've got to edit them in the edit room and

78
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,480
that process is very tedious. But any case, I picked up a video camera and, um, I thought,

79
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,320
wow, this is great. I could really get into this, you know, documenting stories. I, uh, I did,

80
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:10,600
I did some PSAs, public service announcements, just basic editing. And then a very good friend

81
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,080
of mine turned me on and I'll give you guys, I don't want to give you the super long version

82
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,920
of it because I'm, you know, you guys would, your eyes would glaze over, but, uh, uh, it turned me

83
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:28,920
on to UFOs. And he was like, this is back in the nineties when it wasn't really out that much,

84
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,320
like the early nineties, you know? And, and, and I went to high school with this guy and I

85
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,360
remember thinking, boy, too bad this friendship's over because he's lost his mind. And he was talking

86
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,120
about Roswell. He goes, Oh, you haven't heard about Roswell, the UFO that crashed and the recovery.

87
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,480
And I just dismissed him as quickly as you could. I mean, I literally was like,

88
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,280
what a pity. My very dear friend, Renee, I'm gonna have to write our friendship off because

89
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:59,480
he's lost his mind. And then I was, um, I was apprenticing at a video production company in

90
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,200
Northern California. And I started talking to this guy, Richard Van Sickle, who's running the

91
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,600
company. And I had a lot of respect for, I looked up to him a lot and I said, yeah, my buddy, Renee,

92
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,520
started leaving UFOs and Roswell. He goes, Oh, you don't know about that? I was like, no, I don't

93
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,400
know Roswell. I mean, an alien spaceship crashed. He goes, yeah, you didn't know about that?

94
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,680
I was like, no, how am I supposed to know about that? You know? And so I started to look into it

95
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,840
and I realized, you know, wow, the military really did put out an official statement

96
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,120
that this happened. And then I went to a couple of conferences and I met some ex-military guys

97
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,000
that were talking about, you know, gun cam footage of UFOs in the fifties. And I thought, wow,

98
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,800
these guys are really credible. Maybe there's something to this. And I was just kind of,

99
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,400
kind of interested. And so I was like, I got my video camera. I'm going to make a documentary

100
00:08:51,400 --> 00:09:00,440
on UFOs. And, and, um, my father was horrified. I mean, he was like, son, please come back. Like,

101
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,880
what happened? What did I do wrong? You know? And he was begging me. He said, literally, I'll never

102
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,080
forget it. He goes, it's a dead end street, son. There's nothing to it. It's going nowhere.

103
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:18,840
Don't waste your life. And I thought, my father's been so supportive of so many things for so long.

104
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,160
He used to say to me when I was a kid, I don't care if you want to be a garbage man or if you

105
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,640
want to be a teacher or whatever it is that makes you happy. That's what I will support always.

106
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,680
That's the only thing that matters in life. And yet this, he was so opposed to it. And he had

107
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,840
members cause I was born in England. He had members of my family writing letters to say,

108
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,200
please, your father's begging you to reconsider it. Don't waste your life, you know, kind of thing.

109
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,440
And I'm like a Taurus. I'm kind of stubborn. And I thought, well, I'll, I'll show him. And so I

110
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,400
probably worked like 10 times harder than I've ever worked in my life just to kind of show him,

111
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,880
you know? And it was hard, boy, it was really hard. And, um, it took me about four and a half years

112
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,120
and I got some incredible interviews. And the, the final coup for me was I got to,

113
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,440
I got the opportunity to do a phone interview with Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell.

114
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:15,080
And that really kind of solidified, um, the credibility of the film. It kind of

115
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,280
stepped it up a few notches. And I went to Roswell for the 50th anniversary towards the tail end of

116
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:27,560
production. And I got some, some never before seen testimony from, uh, alleged army officials

117
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,120
that were involved in Roswell. Cause like in 1997, that was the tail end of when the people

118
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,000
were dying off. You know what I mean? Was Roswell, right? Like it was, it had been 50 years. So the

119
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,280
people that were, you know, they were like in their, excuse me, they were in their like, uh,

120
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,320
twenties, they would have been in their seventies. So 50 years was kind of the last, the 50th

121
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,680
anniversary of Roswell. You could actually go there and meet a handful of people that were directly

122
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,760
involved with the incident. They're all dead now pretty much. I don't think there's anybody left

123
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,080
alive. So anyway, I went there and I, and I, and I made this film and I ended up selling it to

124
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:13,240
Discovery Channel. And I was so burnt out by the process. I had no idea what it took to make a

125
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,320
documentary and how long it took and how much work it took and all the B-roll and the editing

126
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,360
and the writing and the researching. My God, you know, it just really kind of caught me off guard.

127
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,120
But it was about four and a half years and I sold it to Discovery Channel and everyone was kind of

128
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,200
shocked, my dad included. And I thought, well, never again am I doing any UFOs. I've, you know,

129
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,040
that's, this is, this was it. And then, um, and if I'm going on too long, just, just tell me,

130
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,680
because just trying to tell you how I got involved with this whole thing. And I never intended to be

131
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,760
where I'm at today, nearly 30 years later of still producing documentaries on UFOs because

132
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,840
never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I'd be that guy. And I never wanted to be that guy. But

133
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,440
when the film sold to Discovery, everyone was shocked, myself included, and doors started to

134
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,800
open like, oh, here's an independent guy who treated the subject matter seriously, who didn't

135
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:15,000
ridicule and add green smoke to production. Hey, if you want to meet with anyone, meet with this guy.

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And so suddenly doors started opening. I was invited to Russia and I thought, gosh, um,

137
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I can't not go to Russia and meet with like Pavel Popovich, cosmonaut. I went to Star City.

138
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,240
I got to meet with generals. This is the nineties and you know, uh, okay, well, I guess I'm going

139
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,560
to do another film on UFOs. How could I not? Like, I mean, these doors are opening. And so

140
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,120
I worked another and, and raising the money was always incredibly challenging. Oh my God. I learned

141
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,120
how to operate cameras and how to edit and how to do the sound, all those things completely on my

142
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,840
own. Cause I couldn't possibly afford to pay somebody else to do any of it. And so even though

143
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,280
I sold my film to Discovery, I didn't make, I would have made more flipping burgers at the end

144
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:06,840
of the day. You know what I mean? So anyway, so then I, I made another film called out of the blue

145
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:14,280
and it was, it was really funny. When do you know a film is done? You know, and, and it's, it's a

146
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,040
tough moment to when do you actually realize, Hey, this film is done. Cause I never really feel

147
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,760
satisfied with any work I ever do. It always feels like I can make it better. So I'm looking

148
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,920
at out of the blue. We're about five years into production and my buddy, this guy,

149
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,400
Boris Zuboff was kind of my mentor. He was in a fetal position crying and his wife and his wife

150
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,760
is not really that funny, but his wife's like, you're killing my husband. Stop it with this movie.

151
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,920
Stop it. You're killing him. You know, and he's like, Oh, cause I'm pushing so hard everybody.

152
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,960
Right. And there was not enough money. And so I was like, all right, well, I guess I'll put out,

153
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,200
you know, out of the blue. And then I sold out of the blue to NBC universal and aired on sci-fi. It

154
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,320
was again, just a total coup, you know, like I just completely locked out right place, right time.

155
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,760
I don't know. This guy, Larry Lansman at sci-fi, I saw it and he was like, you know, came in at me.

156
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,800
I didn't even have a lawyer. I didn't have an agent. And I have these like people at acquisitions

157
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,000
at NBC universal asked me, so kid, like, what do you want for your movie? I'm like, I have no idea.

158
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,120
Like what I, I didn't know how to negotiate with any people. I know what I was doing, you know?

159
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,520
And so I sold it, I sold it, but I sold it reluctantly because I felt like it wasn't the film that I,

160
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,080
that I envisioned when I set out, when you embark on a certain project, you have a vision of how

161
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,560
you want something to be, you know, whether you're building a house or designing a bar or doing a

162
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:52,040
podcast, whatever it is, excuse me. And, um, it didn't, it never materialized. You know what I mean?

163
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:59,560
Like I, I just, I was, I was unsatisfied when it came out. So I sold the film. I did. Okay.

164
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,160
Probably again, flipping burgers at the end of the day, you tally it up all the hours and, uh, and

165
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:12,360
about about three years after the film came out, I got a letter from NBC, NBC universal. And they

166
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,760
said, they're not going to renew the broadcast option. So guess what? I owned the movie again.

167
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,160
So I was like, well, I'll, I'm going to make a checklist of all the things that I was unhappy

168
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,360
about. I'm going to redo this film. And I remember at the time my partner was like, you know,

169
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,200
what are you doing? What are you talking about? Redo the movie. We did that movie. We sold it.

170
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,640
It's done. I was like, yeah, but there's never the movie I wanted it to be. So they were like,

171
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,920
you're out of your mind. Okay. Go sell crazy somewhere else. We're done. And so I ended up

172
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,480
having to bring in new investors and new partners and to redesign out of the blue and raise more

173
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:55,880
money. So I made a checklist of things that I wanted to accomplish for, um, the film out of the

174
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,520
blue to revise it, make a director's cut. And that was about 10 people long. And the ninth one,

175
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,960
one was like, I wanted to get more direct eyewitness accounts of the Rendlesham forest

176
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,320
case back in December of 1980 that happened in England at a joint U S British air base

177
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,960
that housed nuclear weapons that had a UFO land. It's a fascinating case. You can look it up bent

178
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:26,040
waters, Rendlesham forest. And then, um, there was a very, very compelling close encounter,

179
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:33,000
like a mass sighting that happened in 1997 in March in Arizona. And it's commonly referred

180
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,960
to as the Phoenix lights. If you talk to witnesses, they say, don't call it the Phoenix lights,

181
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:44,040
call it the massive, you know, UFO flyover because the object was not lights. It was a massive

182
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,560
boomerang shaped object that was one to two miles across. And that's something that you wanted to

183
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,680
include in that film. Well, I investigated the case and I did include it in the film, but in,

184
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,840
in, uh, I think it was like June, the sighting happened in March 13th, 1997. And then in,

185
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:07,000
I think it was June, there was mounting pressure from the people, from witnesses. It got like a

186
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,640
national story and the governor of Arizona, the then governor of Arizona, five Simonton was like,

187
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,920
you know, we're going to get to the bottom of it. We're going to find out what it was.

188
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,200
I'm contacting the local Luke air force base and the, you know, Pentagon above them all.

189
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,720
Isn't that the guy, is that the guy who like walked out of the press conference dressed like

190
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,280
an alien or something? So a couple of hours later, he has one of his aides and I was investigating

191
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,480
this case when this was all going down, you know, I was into production on it's either 50 years or

192
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,520
out of the blue, probably out of the blue. But in any case, I was in, in deep investigating this

193
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,960
case and that little, so, so five Simonton, the governor, then governor was like, we're going to

194
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,560
get to the bottom of it. And he was serious. Like he really was. You could look at the press

195
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:55,960
conference it's in out of the blue or, and, and, um, a couple hours later, he has this unscheduled

196
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,320
press conference and he has one of his aides dressed up in an alien suit and makes a joke out

197
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,320
of the whole thing. And I'll tell you, man, the witnesses that all the witnesses that I were

198
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,160
talking to, they were pissed. They were like, I put you in office, you know, we're your constituents.

199
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,840
How dare you like make fun of us like that? What's wrong? You know, and it was, it was, this object

200
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,160
was witnessed by a lot of people because everybody was out under the night sky, trying to get a

201
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,120
glimpse of the hell bob comment at the time. So, and this object flew from the north all the way

202
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,160
across to the south of the entire state of Arizona. It's a fascinating case. Anyway,

203
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,880
my goal was to get Fife Symington on camera and find out, you know, why the hell he did what he

204
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:42,920
did. Right. So this all takes many years to do all this stuff. And so to my complete astonishment

205
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:50,120
or shock, um, I got nine out of the 10 objectives done for that film, including an interview with

206
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,760
governor Fife Symington. He was no longer governor at the time, but I got an interview with the

207
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:02,520
governor Fife. Nobody ever got an interview with Fife. Right. So I'm driving down. I'll never

208
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,680
forget it. I had my, one of my partners and he goes, he's, he's like, uh, well, what's Fife going

209
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,720
to say? I said, who cares what he's going to say? You know, we got the former governor of Arizona

210
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,800
willing to meet with us, like, you know, so on the way down to meet, to meet with him and send

211
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,680
in Santa Barbara, he was like, well, I, I have a house in Arizona, but I also live in, in Santa

212
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,560
Barbara. If you want to come down and, and, and, uh, meet me in Santa Barbara, say that, that'll be

213
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,640
a little easier for me. So I'm sure I'll, I'll meet with you. So on the way down to meet with the

214
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,800
former governor of Arizona, Fife Symington, I, uh, pulled the car over the side of the road,

215
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,200
got out my pocket tape recorder, and I contacted one of the witnesses, this woman, Stacy Rhodes,

216
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,240
who literally was driving on interstate 10 with her daughter, Emily, and they got out of their car

217
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,760
and they said there were all the cars stopped on both sides and it was like maybe seven o'clock

218
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,680
in the evening, 6 37, something like this. And she said that every car on interstate 10 between

219
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:08,440
Phoenix and Tucson were stopped and they got out of the car and this massive boomerang shaped thing

220
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:15,320
like this, like a big Chevron floating like a city, super slowly. We were just sat there

221
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,680
just looking at it as it floated right over huge, like a mile. She goes, if I, excuse me, if she

222
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:28,600
goes, if I held up and opened up newspaper like this directly over my head, I could not have blocked

223
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,480
out this craft. That's how big it was. Okay. And a lot of people saw it. I mean, I interviewed

224
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,240
people all across the state of Arizona that saw this thing. So in any case I pull over, I was like,

225
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,880
you're not going to believe, and she was furious at the stunt that the governor had pulled.

226
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,080
So I was like, you're not going to believe who I'm going to go meet with right now. And she's like,

227
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,440
who? Take a guess. She couldn't. I said, governor 5 Simonton, is there anything you'd like to say to

228
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,720
him? She's like, you're damn right I would. Like I said, well, hold on, let me get my tape recorder

229
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,200
out. And so I pressed record and I recorded her statement and it was directed directly at the

230
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:10,040
governor. And who better to ask a question than a former constituent of his and witness to the event.

231
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,480
So I get into the interview and I thought, well, I'm not going to like spring this on him

232
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,960
right away because I'm worried this guy's going to just, you know, get up and walk out. So let me

233
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:28,280
get what I can get out of him. And then when the time is right, I'll put the squeeze on him and

234
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:34,360
I'll do a little bit of an ambush with this, you know. So the interview was going great. He was

235
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,040
like, you know, I was, he talked about the reason why he pulled the stunt, that he was just trying

236
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,960
to find some like, trying to calm the people down. A little bit of levity is the word he used.

237
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:53,960
Didn't mean to like make fun of anybody, you know, this kind of thing. So then I said, hey,

238
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,560
governor, I've got a little something I'd like to share with you. It's one of your former

239
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,640
constituents and a witness to the event. And she'd like to ask you a question if you don't mind.

240
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,600
He's kind of squirmed in his seat a little bit. And, you know, he's like, it's been a while since

241
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,760
I've been kind of, you know, ambushed or whatever. So I press play and she kind of lays into him

242
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,560
pretty heavily. Like, how dare you like, you know, make fun of all the witnesses. There were

243
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:24,360
thousands of us, you know, it was a serious event. And we voted you in office and you just like,

244
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,440
you know, left us out to dry. And the one representative, Frances Barwood of Sydney

245
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,000
Councilwoman, you made fun of her when she was to try to make serious inquiries into the whole

246
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,800
thing. And he sat there for a moment. I thought, well, I probably blew it. He's probably going to

247
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:50,200
get up and leave. To my amazement, he admits right there that for the first time ever that he too,

248
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,200
as a former Air Force pilot, that he too saw this thing. And he knew immediately it was not of this

249
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Earth. And he said that because of the sheer size of it, because it was so big, this big V-shaped

250
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,960
thing. He said, there's just nothing terrestrial that could be that big and fly that quietly. And

251
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,920
you know, all this stuff. And so I knew the story was going to be big, but I didn't realize how big.

252
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,280
And that story came out as I wasn't even done yet with the revision of Out of the Blue. And we were

253
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,640
just catapulted all over the headlines. I was on Larry King seven, eight, nine times. I was on

254
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,480
every talk show, nightline, dateline, you name it. Right. Which is great. I mean, you get, you know,

255
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,360
you get in the spotlight a little bit and you can make some moves. You got a little influence,

256
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:47,240
you know, people are watching you suddenly. And so I'm probably definitely boring you guys to death.

257
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:54,600
No, no, not at all. So anyway, because I'm just on this ride, right? I don't really know where I'm

258
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,720
going. You know, I don't know where this is leading. I'm, you know, I'm just a curious Joe. I'm just a

259
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,440
guy that really wanted to know what the hell was going on. Yeah. You know? And so I was just asking

260
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,440
a lot of questions. And every now and again, I got some traction. Now I'm in the limelight

261
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:16,360
and I'm on Larry King with the former governor of Arizona. We were on together, you know what I mean?

262
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:23,320
And I'm on all of these shows. I mean, I had like, my phone memory was full. I mean, they were

263
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,400
calling, everybody was calling me, Jay Leno, like you name it. So anyway, I figured, well, hey, let

264
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:36,440
me capitalize on this. Well, then I decided, God, you know, I might not ever have the spotlight

265
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:43,720
like this again. I should do something big. I should capitalize on this moment. So I woke up

266
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:51,960
in the middle of the night and I saw this press conference in, I know it sounds crazy, but I saw

267
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,400
this press conference and I don't think I had like two dimes to rub together at the time. I think it

268
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,200
maybe had like 500 bucks in my bank account max. And I had a little room on my credit card. I was

269
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:09,320
living with my sister at the time. And I woke up in the middle of the night and I had this dream.

270
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,400
I had this kind of like, I just saw this event at the National Press Club where I got military and

271
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,880
government officials from all these different countries to come and testify and do this thing

272
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,400
right at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Well, I had the attention of a lot of the

273
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:32,600
media at that point. I had their numbers in my pockets and I think I called my contact at

274
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,920
Larry King and I said, hey, I'm thinking about doing this event. I didn't get many details and

275
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,280
I had no money. I was like, I'm thinking about doing this event at the National Press Club.

276
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,480
And if I did it, would you guys cover it? And they said, yeah, we'll give you a full hour.

277
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,560
I said, fantastic. So then I contacted this woman, Leslie Kane, who helped break the story

278
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:58,600
of the New York Times article in 2017. It catapulted this whole phenomenon on the front

279
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,480
page of the New York Times. And that was like the secret Pentagon program. So I contacted Leslie.

280
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,280
This is way years ago. I said, Leslie, I'm thinking about doing this thing. And she'd

281
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,080
seen me in the news all over the place. She knew that I had a little traction and

282
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,560
and she was like, well, hold on. Well, we got to think about this. We got to hold on.

283
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,760
We got to strategize. I don't know. I need to think about it. I might need to think for a

284
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,760
month or two. I said, look, I'm doing this and I'm doing it starting now. Are you in or you out?

285
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,920
And she's like, oh, fuck it, I'm in.

286
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:36,360
And so so now all I needed was the money to put the fan on. So then I was like, OK,

287
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,720
so now I got the media coverage and now I got this. Now I need some money.

288
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,040
So I contacted the National Press Club and I booked the ballroom, which is the biggest,

289
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,600
most fancy room they had. And I had to put five hundred dollars down to hold it. But it was like,

290
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,600
I don't know, thousands of dollars to book it. So I called the National Press Club that morning

291
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,280
and I said, well, we take a five hundred dollar deposit. Well, I had five hundred dollars on my

292
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,520
credit card. So I booked it and I heard my sister in the other room. She goes, did you just book

293
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:10,200
the National Press Club? I was like, yeah. She goes, how are you going to afford to ever do that?

294
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,600
I was like, I don't know. I'll figure it out. You know, and

295
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:25,960
and because I was getting a lot of media coverage, that really helped. I was able to buy out my two

296
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,280
other partners and bring in new investment. And for the money that I bought them out and that I

297
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:43,240
sold the their share of the of the production, the new production, I was able to fund the National

298
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,960
Press Club. In fact, I was a little short. Somebody ended up sending me some. And my point is,

299
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,200
is that, you know, you have an idea, you might not have the resources, but an idea could lead

300
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:01,560
to something big because a lot of people are too scared to go for it because failure is kind of a

301
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,880
scary thing. Right. Especially if you're like at the poker table and you push it all in your chips

302
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:12,040
in on one bet. You know, but, you know, I remember at one point having a bit of a meltdown. And by

303
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,160
the way, my father had slowly started to come around during this. And I took him to a when I

304
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,120
got back from Russia, I went and met with Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper, who was an iconic figure

305
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,080
of my dad's generation. He was the last American astronaut to go up in space alone. And, you know,

306
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,800
everybody knew of my dad's generation knew Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper, he was in the right stuff.

307
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:40,840
And I brought my father along to that interview. And Gordon Cooper had talked about a landed flying

308
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,240
saucer that was filmed at Edwards Air Force Base circuit 1965, and how he chased these discs and

309
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:54,680
fighter jets over Germany in the, I think it was late, late, late 50s, like 57, something like that.

310
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,320
But in any case, my dad was like, God, here's a man whose credibility is on the line. He's

311
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,120
got nothing. He's not getting paid. He's got everything to lose, nothing to gain. Why on

312
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,240
earth would he make this stories up? That was a bit of a turning point for him. And he also saw,

313
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,560
you know, some of the success and I was, you know, things were really taken off. And my dad

314
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:19,320
definitely started to recon more than reconsider. He became a very big supporter of mine and was

315
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,120
very, very excited about what was happening. It was all just kind of unfolding, you know,

316
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,640
as it was happening, but getting back to the National Press Club event. So we did that.

317
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,760
And I didn't have, I'll share another story since we have the time, I guess it's kind of kind of

318
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:45,160
funny. We didn't have an alternative, a plan B to promote the National Press Club event. Okay.

319
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:52,840
It was a big deal. We were flying in 15 people from seven countries from all around the world,

320
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:01,160
military government, FAA officials, people from Tehran. I've got a photograph of a fighter pilot

321
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,520
in Tehran that had one of the most dramatic encounters with the UFO in 1976 over Tehran,

322
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,640
Iran, where he literally tried to fire at the thing. It blocked up and seized his plane. He

323
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,280
started falling out of the sky. I got to, I'll show you a picture of that a little bit. Incredible

324
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:21,960
encounter. And nobody had ever gotten Parviz Jafari to come to the United States ever. And it was

325
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,400
right after the Bush administration had called Tehran, I ran the Axis of Evil. So I was like,

326
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,240
dude. I was like, don't say that. I'm trying to get visas to get this guy over to the state.

327
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:42,840
Anyway, the time was very sketchy. So we do the National Press Club event. And I was like,

328
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,720
I'm going to make a movie out of this National Press Club event. I'm going to film it all in

329
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,000
HD. And everyone's like, how are you going to make a movie about a bunch of old retired guys

330
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,200
standing at a podium testifying under the UFO phenomenon? I said, well, who's the guy Al Gore

331
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,880
made a PowerPoint presentation on a film and that, you know, if he can do it, heck, I can do it.

332
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:12,440
Right. So I ended up making a whole movie and I was still in production. I still hadn't finished

333
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,600
production with Out of the Blue, the revised version of Out of the Blue. But suddenly this whole

334
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,000
new thing came along. And so I made a film on the National Press Club event that I did with Leslie

335
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,880
Kane. And it's called I Know What I Saw. And I continued production with that. But the crazy

336
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,520
part was, as I was saying earlier, sorry, I keep going off these tangents, is I never really had

337
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,880
the money. I never ever had any money up front to do anything I've ever done. I always kind of found

338
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:49,480
the money because I really believe and I've lived it. People will see and be inspired by

339
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,640
you're going for it. Right. And it's a scary thing to go for it. It really is because, you know,

340
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,280
you're soldering this project. You don't know the ultimate outcome. You don't know

341
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,800
witnesses you're going to get to come forward or not come forward. You don't know where your next

342
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,440
like checks going to come from. Right. You know, but people will be inspired, particularly when I

343
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,920
had some traction in the media. That really helped. And they'll be inclined to want to help you

344
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:21,960
and support you. And so there was this upswell of support coming from this. I had one guy,

345
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,080
I never even met him. Bless his heart. I just went to thank him the other day. I found out he

346
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,760
passed. His name is Joe Bellotti. Never met the guy. He goes, I love what you're doing. He sent

347
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,560
me a check for 20 grand. That was like a million dollars to me. I mean, I did so much with that

348
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,440
money. Yeah. And I contacted him recently. I was like, yeah, I'd lost contact with him. And I

349
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,920
reached out and I, his daughter goes like, yeah, Joe Bellotti, unfortunately, you know, he passed

350
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,040
a couple of years. I was like, oh my God, I never really got to anyway. My point is, so that phrase.

351
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:57,240
Yeah. So then I did. And I could go on till I'm blue in the face. How many times, you know,

352
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,560
people come out of the woodwork to help out and support what you're doing. Some anonymously, some

353
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:09,880
not. But then I did, I know what I saw and I sold, I know what I saw to A&E. It was all rather

354
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:18,520
precarious. And you know, you've got a gritty, do-it-yourself production. Things have changed

355
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:25,000
in the last decade and a half, a lot. But I remember finishing the movie and it was a pretty

356
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,440
good movie. I narrated it. The first time I went out, broke out from Peter Coyote and it was a good

357
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,520
film. And Tom DeLong was helping a little bit with the sound. I recorded some sound in his studio in

358
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:45,320
San Diego. And you know, at the end of a production, you're pretty broke. And then you got deliverables

359
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:52,280
and deliverables at that time were a nightmare. You had to like, you had to produce standard

360
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:59,000
deaf, high deaf version, short version, long version, audio stems, this side, that side,

361
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,160
independent, textless version, texted version. Oh my God. And I had to do it on Digi Beta tapes.

362
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,480
Digi Beta tapes. I was like, what the hell am I doing these on Digi Beta tapes? You guys are

363
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,520
going to digitize this stuff anyway. It's already digitized. Like, what are you doing? And it was

364
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,240
like the last year or two that they did that stupid process. It was a nightmare and it cost so much

365
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,840
money every time. And I kept failing the delivery process. Black levels have to be a certain this

366
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,840
and they're very, the A&E had very high standards of like deliverables. And it was like, you know,

367
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:37,000
super expensive process to do these Digi Beta tapes and everything. So I failed the first two

368
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,640
attempts. And then my financial backer said, we're not putting another penny into this movie. I was

369
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,880
like, we have a sale right now for half a million dollars on the line. Right now? You mean to tell

370
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,360
me you're not going to put another dime into this thing? My really good friend had just died, left

371
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:56,440
me with this fancy BMW. So I pawned that car to pay for the last round. And I literally contacted

372
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,160
the guys at acquisitions department at A&E. And I was at the end of my rope. I had nothing to lose.

373
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:07,080
And I was pretty much arguing with them, right? I was like, look, man, this is not a high def,

374
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,000
you know, production on the beauty of the Grand Canyon. What the hell is wrong with you guys?

375
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,560
Like, it's never going to be. It's a gritty do it yourself documentary, but look at the content.

376
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,640
And it was shot over like a long period of time. And I got archival footage and there's

377
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:25,880
different frame rates and who cares? Like, and then I was like, oh, God, maybe I went a little

378
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,840
far with this guy. I was like, oh God, I was like kind of silent on the phone. I was like a half

379
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:41,080
million dollars and I was so broke. And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got a point. You got a point.

380
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,440
Okay. I'll tell you what, I'll let these three things go, which I could have never fixed.

381
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,840
I need you to do this, this, and this. And if you do that, we got a deal. So I went back to the

382
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,240
drawing board and I went into the production facility that was making the tapes and I sat

383
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,600
there with them. And they were like, you know, our clients don't usually sit and look over our

384
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,360
shoulders and look at the black levels and know this and then that. And I said, look, buddy,

385
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,880
I can't afford to do this one more time. This is it. So I need to get this right. And so there

386
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,640
made an exception. And I looked over, you know, send the tapes off. I mean, it was like 15 grand

387
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:22,440
or something. Send the tapes off back east. And I barely made the FedEx. I was so precarious. Oh

388
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,680
my God. People had no idea. So precarious. What was the biggest difference between?

389
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,880
So the last one I'll finish. Yeah. So the next morning or two mornings later,

390
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,960
I get a phone call. I was driving my car. I looked down, it's 212. I was like, oh God,

391
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,440
that's Amy. I pulled my car over. Mr. Fox, how are you doing? This is so and so. We're at

392
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,600
acquisitions. I was like, well, I don't really know how I'm doing. Why don't you tell me?

393
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:51,400
He goes, you passed. And so, you know, so I know what I saw, you know, I sold that and then that

394
00:36:51,400 --> 00:37:01,400
went out. And it just kind of, but I was never satisfied with a production of mine since the

395
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,280
early concept in the 90s when I was like, I'm going to do the feature length documentary

396
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,120
on the topic of UFOs. It's going to like transcend into the mainstream. And I wasn't satisfied until

397
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:20,520
I did the phenomenon. That when I finished that, I cried and I was like, I did it. It took me like,

398
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,080
you know, years and years, but I did it. Excuse me. So you released the phenomenon in 2020, right?

399
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,600
At the end of 2020. Yes. What's the biggest difference in your experience from creating

400
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:38,040
these films in the 90s compared to now, right now? Because obviously there's a ton of resistance,

401
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,680
right? There's a ton of friction with the whole topic, especially when it comes to

402
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,760
different secret levels of government, people not being one of wanting to be associated with

403
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,600
the stigmas. Yeah. Yeah. How is the whole world around this topic changed? So I used to get laughed

404
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:58,200
at all the time to the point where if I go to a cocktail party, I tell people I was with, don't

405
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,200
tell them what I do. I don't want to spend the night defending myself. I'm not interested. And

406
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,080
I'm not here to like prophesize and get people to join my cult of believers. I really don't care.

407
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:14,520
And so that is what I was used to. You know, I was used to being laughed at and ridiculed and made

408
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,480
fun of. So there was like, you know, a few people that might quietly kind of behind the scenes like,

409
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,400
Oh, is there really something to that? You know what I mean? Or I have a friend that claimed they

410
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:34,760
saw something that all changed December 2017 when the new and I had no idea. I was like three or

411
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,760
four years into production with, with the phenomenon. Of course, I didn't have a title

412
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,080
for it at that point, but I was three or four years into production and I was kind of struggling

413
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:49,160
for financing. You know, a lot of times on with making a doc, I'll get, you know, funding and

414
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,200
it takes me so long. It'll dry. That funding will dry up. Then I got to go find more funding.

415
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:00,360
Well, right around the time when the New York Times revealed the secret Pentagon UFO program,

416
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,880
that changed everything because it wasn't just the fact that they revealed

417
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,000
this secret Pentagon UFO program, but they also revealed or released evidence.

418
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:17,160
That was the cockpit recordings of those UFOs, you know, and then you had slowly the pilots

419
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,760
coming out. Right. And that really, and then you have the former Senate majority leader,

420
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,800
Harry Reid, talking about how he initiated this with a couple of other senators. And like,

421
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:35,480
they gave the contract a big low. And anyway, this whole thing had come out and I had people

422
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,600
from all around the world apologizing to me. I'm not kidding you, man. Like, we're so sorry. We

423
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:46,120
made fun of you for so long. Wow. I guess there really is something to this. It really changed.

424
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,320
It really changed everything that front page of the New York Times. So I got to wipe my nose.

425
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:59,080
Yeah. So the difference in terms of perception,

426
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:10,840
I think the phenomenon, the film, and I'm not trying to pat myself on the back, but I guess

427
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:21,800
I can pat myself on the back. I was terrified. So there are three categories of UFO sightings

428
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,760
according to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who investigated UFOs in an official capacity. He was a scientific

429
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,640
advisor to Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book ran from 47 to 69, someplace to 70, but they

430
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:42,680
announced its closing in 69. They investigated 12,000. This is the United States Air Force.

431
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:51,320
They investigated 12,618 cases, out of which 701 remained unidentified. And remind me about

432
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,280
that number. I'll explain the relevancy with that number to the report that came out yesterday

433
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,920
on the Hill. Okay. So that's a very stubborn small percent. So Dr. Hynek

434
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,960
broke them down into three categories, close encounters of the first kind. It's when someone

435
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:14,680
claims to see a UFO, close encounter of the second kind. They see a UFO and somehow this UFO

436
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,840
interacts with the environment, whether it leaves a burnt mark on the ground or the radiation affects

437
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:29,720
someone's face within certain proximity, burns, soil samples, leaves, trees, bushes, whatever.

438
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,920
That's close encounter of the second kind. Okay. Close encounter of the third kind is when the

439
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:45,480
witness reports allegedly beings, entities associated with the UFO. That's close

440
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:52,520
encounter of the third kind. So the phenomenon for the first time in all the films that I'd ever made

441
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,880
dealt with close encounters of the third kind.

442
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:04,440
Alleged beings. And it's very different between objects in the sky and beings on the ground.

443
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,000
Yeah. It was a big, big difference, right? Because you talk about Russia or China, all you want.

444
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,640
But when you talk about beings on the ground, that's just a game changer. I'm going to get to

445
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,440
the relevance of what the close encounters of the first, second, and third kind. So all the history

446
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,000
I'd done, I did 50 years of denial, which I sold to Discovery. I did out of the blue version one,

447
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:30,120
out of the blue version two, I did I know what I saw. I'd never ever dealt with close encounters

448
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:36,360
of the third kind where the witness report, they report seeing beings associated with the craft.

449
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,400
Okay. I felt like a slippery slope and boy, that's kind of a difficult one to kind of swallow.

450
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:52,440
Yeah. With the phenomenon, I went for it. And honestly, I was terrified because I had

451
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,080
high level government and intelligence officers in the film. Several of which, including the

452
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,480
former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, refused to sign a release form until they got to see the

453
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:11,080
movie. Wow. I don't blame them. Right. So I got a movie that starts in Alabama in the 50s and it

454
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:18,840
ends in Africa of an alleged landing of a UFO, multiple UFOs, and the occupants getting out

455
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:26,120
in broad daylight with 100 witnesses and interacting telepathically with these witnesses.

456
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:33,320
That's just nuts, right? I mean, come on. Like, I thought the Harry Reeds and the Podestas and all

457
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:38,360
the other intelligence people that are in my movie, the New York Times, like, take us out of

458
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:46,200
the movie. I was terrified. Nobody had ever done with a mainstream reporting with all that

459
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:53,320
and dealt with alleged close encounters of the third kind. That's just such a game changer

460
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,960
because you can no longer, like, talk about whether it's Russia or whether it's a drone or

461
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,080
whether we're talking beans. Right. And these beans look very different than a human. Right.

462
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,640
In fact, if you want, I've got some illustrations I could tell you. Yeah, no, we'll definitely get

463
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:13,160
into that. But anyway, my point is, is that that was the first film, the phenomenon, where I

464
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:21,080
broke through to a much broader mainstream audience. And not only that, but we dealt with,

465
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,000
we reported on very compelling close encounters of the third kind.

466
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Yeah, the stigma, when you talk about the stigma associated with just UFO sightings or encounters

467
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,480
of the first and the second kind. Right. It's definitely been largely erased by the New York

468
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:44,200
Times article. For sure. There's obviously still a lot of it when it comes to actual creatures

469
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:52,040
or beings being reported. To you, actually, before we get into that, let's talk about the

470
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,200
Hill. Yeah, the latest news that just came out yesterday regarding the Hill. And I also want

471
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:07,000
to ask about what you know about the new bill that was passed to protect whistleblowers. It's to

472
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,440
maybe you can find it. We'll talk about that after, but it's a new bill that was passed to

473
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,680
protect whistleblowers of private organizations that are working on some of these secret programs,

474
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,880
for example, in Lockheed Martin or Raytheon, whatever it might be.

475
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:29,880
They've been talking about basically giving people immunity that can come forward and share

476
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,360
government secrets without fear of prosecution. Because the violation of National Security Act,

477
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:40,280
I think it is. But backing up for a moment. So I read the article that came out, I think it was

478
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:48,520
yesterday, in the Hill, Vice. And I thought I interpreted it fairly well. But then I reached

479
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,640
out to Lou Elizondo, who ran the ATIP program at the Pentagon, just to be sure, because we go back,

480
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,440
we text things back and forth and I share stuff with him and vice versa. So he was, for people

481
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,080
who don't know who he is, he was the head of the ATIP program. So it was Advanced Aerospace Threat

482
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:10,040
Identification Program. It was the program at the Pentagon, the secret UFO program that ended

483
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,200
up on the front page of the New York Times. And you see all the little UFOs that came out with it.

484
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:22,680
So let me read you the text that he sent me. Yeah. Because, and I'll explain this.

485
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:33,240
Okay. For the first time in recent history, our Congress is focusing on UFOs in a non-prosaic

486
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:41,080
manner. Meaning, if it turns out that a particular incident, a product of man-made process or

487
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:48,040
technology, then the UAP JPO, I have to look up what the JPO is, will not continue to study it.

488
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:54,840
Only those phenomena that fall outside the category and are truly anomalous will be focused.

489
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:00,840
So basically what he's saying is, you've got a select committee, right? And they're saying,

490
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:09,320
I talked earlier about the 701 cases that ended up in the unidentified category that were

491
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:15,160
investigated from the Air Force out of 12,618. So that's that very stubborn, small percentage of

492
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,360
cases. So what the select committee is saying, we're only going to look at stuff that's non-human.

493
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,560
All the other stuff we have no interest in investigating. So by them saying that,

494
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,520
they're admitting that a small percentage of UFO, we're not trying to find out if all UFOs are of

495
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:36,680
extraterrestrial origin, right? It's are any, are any of them, because it only takes one or two,

496
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:44,840
right? So they're saying, we're only interested in that core 10 or 15% of truly unidentifiable

497
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:52,360
cases like the non-human cases. So it's basically them saying without directly saying that a small

498
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:59,320
percentage of UFOs are not of earthly origin or not of human, you know, or not manmade.

499
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,360
And they changed it to where they, they talk, they're now talking about being transmedium

500
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:10,040
to where they're like, they're, they're aerospace and submersible.

501
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,760
Yeah, they can go, they can operate in outer space. They can operate in the atmosphere

502
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,760
and they can operate underwater and they can do all three simultaneously.

503
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,800
Yeah. And this is new. This is something that the commander David Fravor was talking about.

504
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,560
The thing was hovering about, there's videos of the crafts that are hovering above the water

505
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,640
and then disappearing into the ocean. And that's something that hasn't really, that I don't think

506
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,120
the New York Times article talked much about the underwater aspect of it, but the underwater

507
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:41,640
aspect of it to me is fascinating. Unbelievable. I mean, look, I went and I got to interview

508
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:48,440
Fravor. I got to meet a lot of people, you know, for the phenomenon and

509
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:57,000
the videos that have been released are pretty impressive, but the videos that I'm told

510
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,240
that people have seen that I've spoken to that have not been released are just like, you know,

511
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:13,880
more in focus. They exhibit, they'll exhibit like a flight characteristic. Like for instance,

512
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:21,320
there's one out right now called the GoFast. According to people that I've talked to,

513
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,720
you see the GoFast and the guy likes trying to, he's trying to get his, his radar on it.

514
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,680
He goes, I got him, I got him. And he finally gets it as it's screaming across the top.

515
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:38,760
The GoFast, you can look up GoFast, but apparently that video is much longer and then it does a 90

516
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:45,560
degree angle turn and then shoots off the screen. So there's, there's that, the, the, the famous

517
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,520
tic-tac that David Fravor had talked about where it's like stationary and the jet's flying towards

518
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:58,680
it. And then it shoots off to one side. That was in 2004, the Nimitz UFO encounter that apparently,

519
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,800
according to David Fravor and others, there's a much higher resolution version of that one.

520
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:11,960
Somehow that has not been released. There's stuff that underwater, I mean, I've, I just heard some

521
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:18,040
incredible stories. In fact, I've been hearing incredible stories for decades about video and

522
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:23,960
photographic evidence that has yet to see the light of day. And, and when I got to meet with

523
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,160
the guy who spearheaded the ATIP program, he was former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid,

524
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,920
which I had to pinch myself that I was in the same room with the guy. He confirmed on camera,

525
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,800
which was a very, very big gotcha moment in, in, in the phenomenon where he says,

526
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,680
I said, wait a minute, are you suggesting that the, there's a lot of evidence, there's evidence

527
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:49,320
that hasn't been released to the public. And he says, I, I'm telling you that most of the evidence

528
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:56,440
has yet to see the light of day. So some intelligence or agency,

529
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:04,920
I don't know who's in charge, is sitting on the most compelling, I know this because I've talked

530
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,760
to the witnesses that have either handed the evidence over or that they've seen the evidence.

531
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:15,880
They've seen the video and photographic evidence. So one of my objectives moving forward is,

532
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:25,320
is locating that footage and locating who has the authority to release it. Because that would be,

533
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,320
it's one thing to talk about the reality of the phenomenon. It's another to start, you know,

534
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,400
they've got all the sensors for them to start, you know, releasing it into the general public.

535
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:40,840
Right. Another thing is, Al Putoff, who was the head of, I think, what was he? He was the senior

536
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:47,880
advisor of ATIP, which was at Bigelow airspace. And the guy, Al Putoff, older guy, he talks about

537
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:58,120
the same thing, except that the, what happens is a lot of this technology, a lot of this information

538
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:05,400
that's being held is in the hands of private agencies. That way it's protected by FOIA,

539
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,760
by the freedom and information act. So people can't go to the government and request these

540
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,160
records because they're held by these, these private entities, like whatever that might be,

541
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:21,800
like he Martin or. So that's, that's a very, very good point. And I sort of organically came to that

542
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:31,320
conclusion because, well, I'll give you an example. This book right here. Okay. This is a briefing

543
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:37,080
document that was sponsored. If you could see it. It's a briefing document that was,

544
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,400
that was paid for and sponsored by Lawrence Spellman Rockefeller. It was done during the

545
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:48,680
Clinton administration. And he was, this is a briefing document for world leaders to bring

546
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:53,480
them up to speed on the most compelling aspects that, you know, that five or 10% of truly

547
00:52:53,480 --> 00:53:02,360
inexplicable UFO cases. This, this book features a lot of the really best ones. And in it,

548
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:09,480
he, during, during making the, during putting this whole thing together, he was putting

549
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:16,840
significant pressure on the Clinton administration. In fact, he even said to Clinton, you either

550
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:23,320
going to go after the UFO phenomenon or I'm going to expose the fact that you're not willing to do

551
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:28,200
this. I know this, I have inside information. This is definitely happened or I'll, I'll, I'll

552
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,480
publish on the front page of everything. And UFOs were kind of getting a little bit of traction

553
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,960
because you had the 50th anniversary coming up for the Roswell. You know, there had been some

554
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,080
reports coming out. There was the Bob Lazar thing. You know, people were talking UFOs in the early

555
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:50,040
nineties, early mid nineties. So ultimately what concluded was he said, okay, president Clinton

556
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:56,600
said, okay, give me a case. What case should we go after? And Rockefeller said Roswell. So

557
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:02,360
they went after Roswell, the, the, the administration. They've got, I cover some

558
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,560
of this in the phenomenon, but they went after Roswell. And at the end of the day,

559
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:16,440
they concluded that the hard evidence had gone out to these subcontractors. So these, these,

560
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:21,320
these outside companies that were free from oversight. So when the government says we don't

561
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:26,360
have it, they really, they don't, they really don't have it. You know, it could be like,

562
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:31,960
let's just say Boeing or Lockheed Martin or one of these companies. They are outside of oversight

563
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,240
from members of Congress and presidential reach. So, cause people go, well, the president has

564
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,800
access to everything. Well, naturally he doesn't because if it's outside, I guess, or if you don't

565
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:47,160
know about it, he said, president Clinton said he was not happy with the answers he was getting.

566
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,760
So, and you know, you hear the same thing. I mean, president Jimmy Carter had said that

567
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:59,400
Gerald Ford had gone, you know, I talked to Gerald Ford. I interviewed Jimmy Carter very briefly at

568
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,040
a book signing where he was basically like, we went after it, but we weren't like, we weren't

569
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:11,000
getting the answers. Who else was, well, I'm sure Bush knew probably quite a bit because he was

570
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,360
head of the CIA. I don't know about Bush Jr. But yeah, I definitely, I have definitely concluded

571
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:22,120
from all the people that I've talked to is that presidents do not have access. And I don't know

572
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,080
who does, to be honest with you. I'm not sure what agency does. I wish I did know, you know,

573
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:33,160
I'd like to know. Yeah, it almost seems, it almost seems like it's obvious that some of these private

574
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:39,880
aerospace companies are holding evidence or material, physical material that's, that's not

575
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:48,360
available to academia or the public, obviously. Which I think it makes it, which shows, you know,

576
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:55,320
one of the reasons for stuff like this, the Congress having the bill to the whistleblower act

577
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,920
to protect the people who work in those companies to shine light on it or make it public. But at the

578
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,920
same time, it seems like those people, it would be hard for them to do it because they would just be

579
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:12,360
sacrificing their career. Also think of it this way. How do they benefit by sharing what they have

580
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:23,320
with the general public? How do they benefit? Right? Like, you have to reveal your vulnerabilities

581
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,120
and the things that you don't know in order to reveal what you do know. Because as soon as you

582
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:36,360
start talking about these, I mean, just think about it. If the president of the United States

583
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:44,760
tomorrow said, you know, my fellow Americans, it's been brought to my attention that we have

584
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:52,440
structured craft of unknown origin, whizzing around with impunity in our airspace.

585
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:58,840
We don't know, they fly rings around our fastest jets. They exhibit a technology that's light years

586
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:04,360
advanced from what we have. We don't know who they are, where they come from, or what they want.

587
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:13,320
Thank you and good night. I mean, that's honestly what I believe. I believe that they know

588
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:19,560
that the phenomenon is real. I believe they have hardware and bodies. But does that mean they have

589
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,000
but does that mean they have all the answers? Does that mean that they understand whatever

590
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,680
the agenda could be of whoever these people are? Do we know where they come from? Are they

591
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:37,720
interdimensional? Do they live under the ocean? Are they interplanetary? Are they time travelers?

592
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:45,720
Are they all the above? I have no idea. Do they know? I mean, they got more answers than we do,

593
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,720
but they might not have a whole lot more. They might be opening up a can of worms.

594
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:57,720
There are people right now fearful of what the level of transparency is. And don't get me wrong,

595
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:05,720
what's been happening since 2017 is unprecedented. It really is. But remember,

596
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:12,920
somebody forced the government's hand. The former intelligence guy Christopher Mellon,

597
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:19,080
who's friends with Lou Elizondo, who ran the ATIP program, they walked those tapes out of the

598
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:24,920
Pentagon. Granted, they found a loophole that they didn't necessarily like violate the law.

599
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:31,080
They took advantage of that loophole. But they kind of like bend the rules a little bit, right?

600
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,360
Those tapes came out of the Pentagon, and they went on to the front page of the New York Times.

601
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,640
That was kind of forcing the government's hand. They can't put the genie back in the bottle.

602
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:48,920
So there are people that want this out, and there are other people that do not want this out.

603
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:54,120
And they don't want it out for fear of like, A, they've been lying to us all these years. But B,

604
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,960
it exposes their vulnerabilities. It exposes our vulnerabilities. Just imagine for a moment,

605
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,960
like I said earlier, if there really were these unknown objects that could just fly rings around

606
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:10,440
our fastest jets, they turn off our nuclear weapons, turn them on, turn them off, mostly turn

607
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:16,840
them off, right? They whiz off at an unbelievable rate of speed. And we don't know who they are,

608
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:22,120
where they come from, why they're here. Like, that's a little unnerving to release to the

609
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,880
general public, wouldn't you think? I'm not saying that your audience to believe what I'm telling you

610
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:32,440
or not. Just imagine if that's the case. You can kind of see a justification for secrecy,

611
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,920
right? Not that you agree with it. I don't agree with it. I don't care how scary it is. I want to

612
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:42,680
know the truth. Right. Let us all know the truth. We're all entitled to it. Let's let's know this.

613
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:48,200
Do you think it's possible that one of these private aerospace companies has some sort of

614
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:55,880
have has figured out in any capacity, anti gravity, or anything like that, some of these projects

615
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:00,680
that Bob Lazar was talking about? Do you think it's possible that they have some of this technology

616
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:07,560
and aren't letting other scientists and academia know about it? I think that they have the

617
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:12,680
technology and I didn't just believe that overnight. I mean, it didn't just like it was a very slow

618
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:17,480
process for me because I am, believe it or not, I'm actually quite skeptical. A lot of the cases

619
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,360
that I cover, like my new film Moment of Contact, we'll talk about that a little later, you know,

620
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:28,200
which is the UFO crash case that happened in 1996 in Brazil. I didn't believe that for over 10 years

621
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,760
when I heard about it. I didn't believe in the Rua case, the landing in Africa. Absolutely didn't

622
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,960
believe it. Wouldn't even look into it. I was like, there's no way that that happened. So

623
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:44,440
the fact that I believe that crashes have happened and bodies and debris have been recovered,

624
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:51,240
it was a very slow process for me. It was witnesses after witness, after witness,

625
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:56,680
after document, after intelligence person I've talked to. Like I finally was like,

626
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,640
there's more evidence to suggest that it happened than it didn't happen.

627
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:11,160
And that clearly went somewhere, right? I've even asked, you know, I jokingly ask, I always

628
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,400
kind of do it with a smile on my face, but I'll say, all right, hey, you know, to some intelligence

629
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,200
guy that I'm talking with. All right, so here we go. All right, here we go. I want to know where

630
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,200
the bodies are. We'll get that. Let's talk about that first and then we can get over the debris.

631
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:29,240
Where are they hiding the bodies? And I think they kind of know that they are being hidden somewhere,

632
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:35,800
but it sounds like crazy talk. I know. We were talking about it last night. The bodies from

633
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:42,280
Roswell are apparently in the Air Force base in Florida. Yes, and I've also heard California too.

634
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,760
Maybe they go back and forth. I don't know, but that was in the seventies.

635
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:52,600
Right. Yes, yes. The seventies is the story when Jackie Gleason and Nixon went to go see the Air

636
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:59,240
Force base. Yes. How did that story go? Well, so, because I've heard it before, but nobody seems

637
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:06,760
to know the whole story. Okay, so a really good friend of mine, a guy who's very high up in the

638
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:16,200
entertainment industry, who's been very instrumental in getting my foot in the door with some executives

639
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:25,320
over the years to help me out. His name is Jeff Zaganski. And one day, quite a while ago, actually,

640
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:33,400
I was doing, I know what I saw. I said, Jeff, you're so nice to me. Like, why are you helping

641
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:40,920
me? You're this top executive. You're a gazillionaire. Why are you helping me? I'm just

642
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:48,520
this little guy, like this little independent guy. And he goes, you know, James, I was friends with

643
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:56,360
Jackie Gleason. And Jackie Gleason told me one time, Jeff, don't ever believe anyone that tells

644
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:03,800
you that UFOs are not real. I had 100% definitive proof, excuse me, whether he saw it or shown it,

645
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:10,760
but he was somewhat nebulous as to exactly what happened. But he said, don't ever believe anything

646
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:20,440
this event's happened. UFOs are real. They're here. It's a fact. So he said he'd always remembered that

647
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,200
encounter with Gleason when he told me that. And when he saw this independent guy, myself,

648
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:32,840
just striving to get the word out and find out what's going on, he always like offered a helping

649
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:39,160
hand. He was always really helpful. Then I think it was like, maybe about two years after Jackie

650
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:44,840
Gleason died, his wife came forward and said that one night he came home in the early 70s

651
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:52,920
from a meeting with Nixon at a Florida military base. You know the one. Homestead. Right, the tip

652
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:59,560
of Florida. And that his eyes were wide and his face was white. And he said, I was just shown

653
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:06,840
entities from a crash in New Mexico. And they were floating in some fluid or something at

654
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:15,560
the Air Force base. That's what his wife came out. Now, you know, that's probably what Gleason was

655
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:21,240
referring to, I would imagine, when he met with Jeff Zaganski and told him that. I would imagine,

656
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,600
right, if he had that level of confirmation, that's what he said to Jeff. He didn't say to Jeff,

657
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:31,800
you know, Nixon showed me the bodies. He just said, I had definitive proof. Like there's no,

658
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:36,200
don't ever believe anyone tell you otherwise. They're absolutely here. It's a fact. That's

659
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:43,160
what he said to Jeff Zaganski. And so when his wife came out with that, that's probably what

660
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:48,680
happened. Do you get the feeling that a lot of when you talk to a lot of these people that you

661
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:53,560
interview that obviously there's people who worked in the government and worked on some of these top

662
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:58,360
secret programs. Do you get the feeling that they're holding things back? A lot of things

663
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,880
back sometimes where they're talking to you, because obviously there's times where you're

664
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,880
talking to people like witnesses who aren't tied to anything and they're just talking to you freely.

665
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,680
There's having a conversation with you, but then there's people you talk to

666
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:14,760
who are influenced by organizations and it's a different kind of conversation.

667
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,440
Yeah. I'll give you an example. This is kind of funny. I'm not going to, I'm not going to,

668
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:25,800
is an intelligence person. We're putting together this, he was helping me put together

669
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:33,800
some language for something I was doing. And he said, no, no, no, change that, change that wording.

670
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:44,120
And I said, okay, why? It was like, I don't know if I said like extraterrestrial or if I said alien

671
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:49,320
or otherworldly, I can't remember exactly how I phrased it. And he said, no, no, no, no, delete

672
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:57,400
that, change it, make it to this. And I said, okay, sure. Why? He goes, well, they might be living in

673
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:06,440
our, under our oceans. And I was like, uh, okay, can you elaborate a little bit? He's like, no.

674
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:17,240
What? Yeah. That's what he said. Hey, where did this guy work? He was an intelligence guy.

675
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:21,720
I'll leave it at that. Okay. He definitely would be in a position to know certainly, you know,

676
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,480
but that's all he said was like, they might be living under the ocean. They might be living

677
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:30,280
in our oceans. Yeah. They might be. They didn't say they did or they did or didn't. They said

678
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:35,560
they might, but he was sort of on Shallan about it. He was just like, I'll tell you, I'll tell you

679
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:45,000
Robert Bigelow. Yes. We talked about him last night. Yeah. So I did, I know what I saw. Now

680
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,760
your audience knows a little bit about my history, so you'll have a reference when I tell you this.

681
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:54,600
When I finished it, I know what I saw. And it was based on that event I did at the National

682
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:59,000
Press Club, which was pretty credible civilian effort at the time. It was like, you know,

683
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,600
you have all these retired military and government officials and pilots and FAA officials from seven

684
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:19,880
countries. We had Chile, we had Iran, France, Belgium, England. Anyway, Peru. It was incredible.

685
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,440
It was incredible listening to these like officials from all these, you know, I was,

686
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:29,640
it was, it was credible. It was a pretty credible civilian effort to get this stuff out. I,

687
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:37,800
the film comes out and I get an email from, which I showed you last night. I get an email from

688
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:45,240
Robert Bigelow. He's in aerospace. He's designing these. He's a billionaire. He lives in Nevada

689
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:53,560
and he has contracts with the United States Air Force dating back God knows how long decades

690
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:59,880
where any reports, any pilot reports, things of that nature of UFOs all goes to Robert Bigelow's,

691
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:06,280
you know, he had like a think tank, NIDS and his organization was like, how could this civilian

692
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:12,600
like be getting a contract with the government on UFO? What? You know, and he's also, he was

693
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:23,000
working at one point with, with Tesla, Elon Musk with, I guess he was trying to use Elon Musk's

694
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,880
rockets to put his habitable inflatable zones up into space because they're lightweight.

695
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,440
Oh, really?

696
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,560
Anyway, I'm not sure what that whatever happened with that effort, but in any case,

697
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:39,640
he's a high profile guy. He was on 60 minutes. So he sends me an email or his secretary.

698
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:45,560
Mr. Bigelow has a message he wants to pass along. He watched your film. I know what I saw and he

699
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:50,680
wants to congratulate you on a job well done. And I was like, damn, Bigelow reached out to me,

700
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:57,800
like, wow, for Bigelow. So I, you know, I emailed back, thank you so much. Would he be willing to

701
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:03,560
get together for, you know, dinner or lunch or something? And yes. So I was like, well,

702
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:08,680
I'm going to go meet Bigelow. Why not? Right? I mean, the guy is like, he's gotten all the

703
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,320
contracts. Now, what was really funny was that I didn't realize this until later.

704
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:22,200
Robert Bigelow at the time was actually, and I'm convinced of this, he was fishing to see what my

705
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:28,200
next move was going to be. He wanted to know what I was, what I was up to, because he was asking me

706
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,800
like, oh, what's your next thing? You know, maybe I'd finance it. You know, he just wanted to know

707
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,960
he wasn't he wasn't going to finance anything I wanted to do. He just wanted to know. And I'm

708
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,880
pretty sure of that. But I said to him at one point, I was like, well, you know, what side,

709
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:45,240
who side are you on? Because every case that I'm looking into, particularly the case of the United

710
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:53,080
States and international cases too, I get people saying, oh, well, Bigelow, Bigelow's organization

711
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:57,080
came and took all that evidence. And I kept hearing that it's like, so what are you doing

712
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:05,080
with all this evidence and stuff? Anyway, he says, James, do you,

713
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:15,560
before I say this, I was going to say that this guy, I guess, legitimately is in a position to

714
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:22,600
know a lot more than I know. Okay. Particularly at that time. He had the government contracts,

715
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:28,200
he had the contacts, he had the intellectual heavyweights in the scientific community all

716
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:36,920
working for him. This guy definitely knows a lot. No question. And so he says, James,

717
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:48,280
do you understand the implications of disclosure? And I said, I'm not really giving it too much

718
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:56,120
thought. Why? He goes, meaning the implications of disclosure. This story really came out. Okay.

719
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,320
So he's like, and to be honest with you, yeah, sure. I guess I thought about it. I mean,

720
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,760
doing this even though it's that big of a deal to me, we're not alone. Great. You know what I mean?

721
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,640
I don't think anybody thinks that we're alone in the universe anymore anyway, but

722
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:19,880
they're coming here. He said, I just need to really emphasize this to everybody out there.

723
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:25,400
So you understand what I'm telling you. I'm not saying I believe what I'm about to tell you. Okay.

724
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:31,400
I need to see more evidence. I'm not saying I don't believe it, but I don't just believe something

725
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:36,200
because someone told me that. I need to see supporting evidence. I need to hear testimony.

726
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:41,960
I need a lot more. What's taken me as long as it has with all the other cases that I investigate.

727
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:48,360
I don't just believe a case. Okay. So Robert Bigelow said to me, they're walking among us.

728
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:57,560
I said, what do you mean they're walking among us? He said, they're walking among us. They live

729
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:03,480
right here kind of thing. So again, I'm looking at him going,

730
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,880
I need to see, I'd like to see some proof of that. But then he said,

731
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:18,040
we've done studies. We've done extensive studies on the impacts of this story we have on the general

732
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:26,360
population globally. And I said, okay. Well, like what kind of studies? He goes, well,

733
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:34,200
you take Iran-Contra and you take all these other like super big scandals and you multiply those,

734
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:38,040
every one of them that's ever happened in the history of mankind in modern history.

735
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:43,400
And then you multiply that by a million. And that's the impact according to our studies

736
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:48,040
that this reality would have on the general public. He said the economy would collapse,

737
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,720
organized religion would collapse. And he just rattled off all that. Like again, I'm not saying

738
01:12:53,720 --> 01:13:01,560
that I believe this. I'm just telling you what he said to me. How could you possibly conduct

739
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:09,880
a study on that? I could see how you could, you could gather, you could collect data on

740
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:17,720
individuals, but how could you possibly do a study on an entire civilization or large

741
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:23,320
group of people? Like, how would you do that? That's what he told me. That's what he told me.

742
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:26,680
I mean, look, it would have an impact. There's no question that it would have an impact and it

743
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:31,400
probably would affect religion, right? Why am I going to work? Why the fuck am I paying taxes?

744
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:41,000
You know, and it's like, I remember having this conversation with the sixth man to walk

745
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:47,320
the moon, Edgar Mitchell. And he goes, you know, this story is just part of the bigger picture.

746
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:52,360
Let it out. People should know about it. People should be okay. He goes, you know,

747
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:57,560
you still have to take out the garbage. You still got to pay your mortgage or your rent. You know,

748
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:02,360
I thought it was kind of funny. Every time I take the garbage out, you know, I believe we're not

749
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:06,120
alone in the universe and it's being covered up from us, but I still got to take my garbage out.

750
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:12,760
Imagine also, imagine the kind of power you must feel holding onto that information that would,

751
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:19,720
you're holding something that could potentially alter humankind, alter the mindset of every one

752
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:25,080
of our species on earth. And that could probably change the trajectory of where we go, how we

753
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:29,640
evolve, et cetera. Like if you hold onto that information, how does that affect your ego?

754
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:36,200
I literally just interviewed a guy, I get, I've got goosebumps on my arms talking about this

755
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:48,520
because it's just crazy. Cause I believe it. Who drove a bean called a creature or bean or

756
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:56,520
they called it kind of ET on that UFO crash case in Virginia, Brazil in 1996. And I said to him,

757
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:02,760
you have a level of confirmation that only a handful of people on this planet have.

758
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:10,760
What does that feel like? Cause I wanted to know, you know, this guy was serious as a heart attack

759
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:17,800
and he was not out there trying to get an interview with anybody. We were chased him down for years.

760
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,280
And it was like all the money in the world and never coming forward. And the stars lined up and

761
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:28,040
the stars lined up and we had like a 36 hour window where we managed to get this guy on camera.

762
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:34,200
But I asked him that question. You have a level of confirmation, you know, definitively you drove

763
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:41,560
this thing around. What does that feel like? And he, he responded like it was more of a burden

764
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:47,880
than anything else. And it's actually kind of ruined his life. The level of secrecy. He gets

765
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:54,360
phone calls from the base that ask him like, Hey, how you doing? How's your family doing?

766
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:58,520
You guys having a good time? Did you, did you move yet or are you still in the same spot?

767
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:02,920
Right. Great. Great. Well, I'm glad your family's doing good. I'm glad you're,

768
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:09,240
you're doing good. You know, any change of plans, you know, let us know that those kinds of calls

769
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:14,520
he gets all the time. Yeah. I mean, the main difference between people like the people you

770
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,960
interviewed in Brazil who were a part of the Virginia, Virginia case and people like Bigelow

771
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:27,960
is Bigelow is a powerful, rich and powerful guy who probably has a lot of leverage in government.

772
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:33,480
Like I'm sure if he chose one day on his, whether it be just because he was in the right mood or

773
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:38,040
because he was on his deathbed, whatever, if he chose to release that information, I'm sure

774
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:43,240
he could do it and wouldn't have to suffer any kind of crazy repercussions. Maybe I'm wrong,

775
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:48,360
but the guys that are in Brazil, like literally the, like they're dealing with the threats of

776
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:52,440
military and government threatening their families. I feel like it's a little bit different. I feel

777
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:59,480
like Bigelow is in a position of, I hold onto this mad, like it's, it's like this piece of magic that

778
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:07,560
he's holding this, this power, the power to change the world. Yeah. For me, I feel like Bigelow is

779
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:13,320
selfish. Yeah. Because when I met with, I think I might've called him later as well a couple of

780
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:19,960
times. I can't remember, but I, I said to him, whose side are you on? You know, and I was serious

781
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:27,000
because like everything that I do, I do to share everything that I uncover with the rest of the

782
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,000
world. That's why I do what I do. I honestly and firmly believe that every man, woman and child on

783
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,040
this planet is entitled to this information. I believe that with all my heart, you know,

784
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:44,040
and it pisses me off quite frankly, that someone feels that we are not worthy of knowing this,

785
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:50,280
that we can't handle it or that we don't deserve it or something. You know what I mean? So it's like,

786
01:17:52,200 --> 01:18:00,600
when I see someone of his, like stature, you know, he's got resources, man. That guy's a billionaire,

787
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:05,480
you know, I'm like a squirrel trying to get a nut out in this, you know, compared to a guy like that.

788
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:11,560
And then the fact that he's hoarding it all and it's under armed guard in a vault at his house,

789
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:17,240
like, or his whatever his office kind of pisses me off a little bit. I'm like, what, what, wait a

790
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:21,720
minute, what, what, how are you, does he have an agreement with the government? So he has to do

791
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:28,200
that? Or is he just being like selfish and doesn't want to share the results of, of his, you know,

792
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:32,680
work and investigation with the general public? Cause he's like, feels like he's better. I don't

793
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:38,520
know what the hell he's thinking, but I share everything. The only thing I don't generally

794
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:44,520
share is stuff that I know for sure beyond a shadow of doubt that I'm going to be looked at

795
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:52,760
like a crazy guy because I've looked at myself as a crazy guy. You know, I, I can't tell you enough,

796
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:59,080
like I'm putting my credibility on the line for this Virginia case. Okay. Because you got this and

797
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:07,400
I'll say right up front, I honestly, sincerely, and unequivocally do not expect any of your

798
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:13,640
audience to believe any of this without looking at the testimony. In other words, don't believe a

799
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:19,880
word coming out of my mouth because I heard about this case decades ago. I heard about it within a

800
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:25,880
year or two of it happening. And you wrote it off. I dismissed it like, like that. I was like,

801
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:33,800
no way a UFO crashed and the bean survived and we're walking through the town. No way. No way.

802
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:44,360
In fact, I dismissed it for 10 years. Let's see. No, no, I dismissed it in 97.

803
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:53,800
I wouldn't look, I wouldn't look into it for one second. Not one second. In 97, 98, 99,

804
01:19:53,800 --> 01:20:01,720
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 13 years. Okay. So 2011, I was going to

805
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:08,440
Brazil on a completely, I was going to give a presentation on one of the films I'd done.

806
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:16,600
Probably I know what I saw or something. And my buddy, Jeff Sagancki, the guy I was talking

807
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:21,080
about earlier who met with Jackie Gleason, he goes, oh, you're going to, you're going to Brazil.

808
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:25,720
You got to look into the Margini case. And I was like, you mean the one where the UFO crashed and

809
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:29,400
the alien survived and they're walking through the town? I go, sure, Jeff, I'll look into that.

810
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:38,680
Click. And I had no intent in looking into it. I told him I might've said I would. I'm not

811
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:45,080
looking at it. I'm not wasting my time on that case. So I get to Brazil, and this is 2011,

812
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:52,360
and totally accidentally, completely like inadvertently, I met some witnesses

813
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:58,200
from, they were happy to be at the conference that I was at and talked to them a little bit

814
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:10,280
about it, a little bit. I was like, huh, okay, interesting. Kind of believed them a little bit.

815
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:19,080
So I went back in 2012 and I thought maybe there's something here. And I was knocking on doors and

816
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:23,080
really chasing it. I mean, I went down to downtown Virginia, Brazil. Virginia is in the state of

817
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:30,040
Minas Gerais, which is about four or five hours north of Sao Paulo. In Sao Paulo, everyone,

818
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:34,600
myself used to think I included the capital of Brazil, but it's actually Brasilia, which is way

819
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:45,480
to the north. But Sao Paulo is like the big city, right? And second time around, I was like, wow,

820
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:53,640
hmm, maybe there really is something to this. And then I went a third time and then I went a fourth

821
01:21:53,640 --> 01:22:00,600
time. And then ultimately I made the film. And now I'm absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt,

822
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:12,200
fully, completely convinced that a UFO crashed in January of 1996 and that the beans, some of the

823
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:18,360
beans, survived and were captured by the authorities and witnessed by civilians in the

824
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:23,640
town of Virginia, Brazil. And the film is complete now? Totally done. And you started working on it

825
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,640
how many years ago? Well, I started actually making the film. I know you've been researching

826
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,440
it for a long time. Researching it for a long time. So if you look at it from when I started

827
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:36,440
researching to the completion, it's probably 10 or 11 years. 10 or 11. Yeah. But in terms of

828
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:42,600
like production, like go there, boots on ground, we're going to do this. But all that prep work

829
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:49,480
went into it. That was just less than a year. Absolutely mind bending film. For full disclosure,

830
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:58,920
I watched it Monday night and it had me completely, it had me in a choke hold the whole time I was

831
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:04,680
watching it. Like I did not look up once. Maybe we should show the trailer before we go deeper

832
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:11,720
into it. Can you pull the trailer for it? For a moment of contact? This trailer took I think

833
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:26,840
three months to make. Maybe a bit more. In 1996, the people of Virginia, Brazil, witnessed a UFO

834
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:32,040
event that would change their lives forever.

835
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:44,920
Call it another Roswell, if you will. It is a crashed vehicle that had beings on board.

836
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:58,120
Finally, the facts will be revealed.

837
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:05,000
The Virginia case is considered the most well-kept secret in the military circles of Brazil.

838
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:12,120
My objective here is to put some clarity on what took place in Virginia, Brazil, January 1996.

839
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:23,080
The witnesses are some of the most compelling testimony I've ever heard.

840
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:37,080
Action! A lot of people in this town have a little piece of the puzzle.

841
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:50,040
This year, he had captured this creature with his bare hands.

842
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:59,560
After he captured the creature, he developed this infection that wouldn't go away.

843
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:08,600
This can no longer be covered up. They might shoot us because we're on the property.

844
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:15,400
This can't be denied.

845
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:29,080
This was proof. Pull this off. It'll be the most compelling testimony revealed. Of contact.

846
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:38,200
This is a level of confirmation that only a handful of people on this planet have.

847
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:52,520
His first mistake turned out to be his last.

848
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:16,600
I'm pushing the envelope a little on the comfort level of those around me because you're dealing

849
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:22,280
with like this. I know how I looked at the case and I looked at the case when I first heard about

850
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:31,880
it, the Virginia case. I dismissed it so quickly. I told you earlier, like I know how other people

851
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:40,200
are going to react when they hear, sure, a UFO crash. Sure, the being survived. Yeah.

852
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:53,240
I'm literally putting my 30-year reputational line for this one. 29-year reputational line.

853
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:59,560
Do you know what I mean? I stand behind it. I stand behind it and I really believe and I

854
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:06,040
think you do as well. Sure, it's got a lot of pizzazz. The trailer is designed to get people

855
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:13,240
to watch the film, but the film delivers. It does. It delivers. It delivers. It's not just

856
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:18,280
a bunch of hot air. Not at all. The amount of evidence that you have and the amount of people,

857
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:25,400
civilians, and ex-military that you talk to is astounding. Correct me if I'm wrong, I know the

858
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:31,720
Zimbabwe case is close to this when it comes to the amount of witnesses,

859
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:39,560
but when you have civilian witnesses mixed with military and police witnesses, on top of that,

860
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:47,880
people handling this creature and seeing it come into their place of work, into the hospital,

861
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:52,920
I don't think there's ever been a case where there's been a being like this

862
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:59,800
with all these witnesses running around a neighborhood or a city. Has there? No,

863
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:06,840
I've never, I've never, I've never. It seems so sci-fi. I get the goosebumps talking about it

864
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:17,240
because I challenge anyone out there in the UFO community, anyone to show me, let's say crazier

865
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:26,600
story. It's the most sensational story I've ever heard and the crazy part about it is that you

866
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:33,640
will believe it. I have one of my most skeptical friends who's watched my career from day one,

867
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:41,800
one of my best friends. He lives in San Diego and he's been moderately supportive and he watched

868
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:48,840
the phenomenon. He loved it. He watched this one about a month ago and he's my barometer

869
01:28:50,040 --> 01:29:00,040
and he called me up and he goes, I'm floored. He goes, it's the craziest story I've ever heard

870
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:05,240
in my life and I actually believe it happened. I think this is the most powerful thing you've

871
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:11,480
ever done and it's not my story, right? I'm just reporting on it, but we went out of our way to

872
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:18,680
really, I mean, we worked on some of those witnesses for nearly a decade. We identified

873
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:23,880
some of the doctors early on and they were like, I will never talk with you. Like this is never

874
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:30,840
gonna happen. You might as well just not even, and then one of them, allegedly the guy that did the

875
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,720
x-rays, which for some reason, I don't know, there's something about that testimony that really just

876
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:42,360
for me personally, listening to him, and he goes, at the end of it, he goes, thank you for giving

877
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:49,480
me this opportunity. This has been the heaviest weight on my shoulders for so long. The fact that

878
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:54,520
I had the opportunity, even though I'm doing it anonymously, the fact that I've got, and everybody

879
01:29:54,520 --> 01:30:00,120
that we feature that you're filming from behind, we have their credentials. We have them in uniform.

880
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:06,120
We have all the history of them, all of it, right? So we verify all of that before they even,

881
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:12,680
and then the fact that we get them to come forward was just a miracle, quite honestly,

882
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:17,720
just a miracle, yeah. To you, what was the most compelling piece of evidence or interviews that

883
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:22,280
you did from all the people you talked to in Brazil? In Brazil? Yeah, to you, what was the

884
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:29,800
thing that stood out to you the most? I met with an Air Force brigadier by the name of José

885
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:37,400
Carlos Pereira. I have a photograph of him in uniform somewhere, and he said, I'll talk to you

886
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:42,600
about the UFO phenomenon in Brazil gladly. I could talk about this case in 86, UFOs in Brazil,

887
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:47,320
and I could talk about the Calaris case, but I don't want to talk about Virginia. I was like,

888
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:53,960
okay, why are you going to talk about Virginia? Don't even bring it up. I was like, Jesus. So

889
01:30:54,280 --> 01:31:04,280
Marco, my partner in Brazil, we did the interview. I honored the fact that he didn't want to, I don't

890
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:13,640
know how I brought it up, but I basically didn't bring it up on camera. At the end of the interview,

891
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:17,960
and I have video and photographic proof that I was with this guy, at the end of the interview,

892
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:25,960
we walked him to his car where he had his driver waiting. I looked him in the eye and I said,

893
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:31,720
I swear on my life and on my family's life, there are no recording devices anywhere on my body,

894
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:41,240
no cameras rolling. Please, General, please tell me, did Virginia happen or not? Marco and I were

895
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:46,760
just basically just, I mean, we were like, I mean, I'd never begged. I wanted to know so bad.

896
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:52,920
And he looked at Marco and he looked at me, and as he was getting into his car,

897
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:58,120
he opened up the back door and he goes, it happened. And he got in his car, closed the door,

898
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:07,240
off he drove. So I had, at that early stage, very definitive, for me, it's obviously this is a story

899
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:13,560
for you or anybody else listening to what I'm saying, why on earth would he not want to talk

900
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,520
about it? Why on earth would I have to beg and plead with him on my hands and knees to get him

901
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:23,640
very discreetly at the last possible second when he was driving off to look at us and say it happened,

902
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:31,160
why on earth would he lie to us? And so I had a pretty concrete level of confirmation early on

903
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:36,120
on the case. So now it's like, okay, we got to keep digging, we got to keep digging.

904
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:41,560
But what we were finding was, is that the better the witness, the less likely they wanted to come

905
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:49,560
forward and that the more likely that they had been intimidated and threatened. And they would

906
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:55,320
do it in a way where it wasn't like, hey, we're going to kill you. It was just like the punishment

907
01:32:55,320 --> 01:33:03,640
for violating your security oath or your security is going to be so severe, they would say, so

908
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:08,760
severe. How's your family kind of thing? Not we're going to kill your family, but these are the

909
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:14,840
kinds of things. It was spooky to the witnesses, like really spooked them. And then to get phone

910
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:23,160
calls every couple of years, hey, how you doing? That kind of thing. So we worked incredibly hard

911
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:32,040
and we were so lucky. And I've got to tip my hat 100 times to Marco Leal, my producing partner,

912
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:39,080
who's Brazilian, who's been investigating this case longer than I have, and he's been just a

913
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:46,280
force to be reckoned with, could never have done it without Marco. It's incredible. For people

914
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:52,760
that are listening and watching, can you lay out kind of a linear timeline of what went down?

915
01:33:52,760 --> 01:34:00,840
What was seen first? Was it crafts, the crash from the girls to the cop that actually captured

916
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:17,000
the being? So in January, probably 12th or 13th of 1996, there was a ultralight pilot

917
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:24,840
by the name of Carlos de Sosa. And Carlos was driving from Sao Paulo up to a state called

918
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:34,600
Minas Gerais. It's a state to the north. And in Minas Gerais is Vargenha and a number of surrounding

919
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:41,640
cities. And he was driving on the freeway, I think it was five o'clock in the morning, five,

920
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:48,760
530 maybe. And he saw something in the sky that was cigar shaped, that didn't look right,

921
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:56,520
and it looked like it was in trouble. And he witnessed it crash. Prior to that, there were two,

922
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:01,800
it was like 2.30 in the morning, there were two farmers, which I interviewed both of them as well,

923
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,720
that saw the object that looked like it was going to crash, but they didn't see it crash.

924
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:09,960
There was two of them and it was about 2.30 o'clock in the morning for them.

925
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:17,320
And it was a cigar shaped object and it had a gash on the side of it and it had vapor coming

926
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:23,240
out like a white vapor coming out according to the witnesses. But they kept kind of expecting it to

927
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:28,760
impact the ground, but they didn't see it impact the ground because it looked like it was in serious

928
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:35,320
trouble and it was flying slowly. So then Carlos de Sosa, like I said, was up early one morning

929
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:41,240
driving to go meet some ultralight pilot friends of his to go flying. And he saw this object and

930
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:47,640
then he saw it kind of go down like it was going down. And he jumped off the freeway and he drove

931
01:35:47,640 --> 01:36:01,160
up this farm called Maolini Farm. And he came upon maybe a football size field of debris and

932
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:08,520
one very large piece of the cigar shaped UFO that was kind of a metallic light that was still intact,

933
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:17,240
but a lot of bits that were not intact. And he jumped out of his car. He ran up and he said

934
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:22,760
there were like these like tin foil type pieces. He wasn't thinking extraterrestrial. He thought

935
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,320
it was a government thing. He didn't know what it was. He thought there were some people that

936
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:28,600
were in trouble. Yeah, he thought there was people in trouble. He wanted to help them.

937
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:34,440
He never ever, ever did he think alien. Not one time. Not to laugh at what I'm about to tell you.

938
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:40,200
So then, I don't want to give too much away, but he held one of the pieces and he said it was light

939
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:44,520
as a feather, very similar to what the description of the people at Roswell where he could take it

940
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:51,320
and crumple it up and then it would rebound and reshape itself. But he said it was light,

941
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:55,640
like just so light you could barely feel it in your hands. He was looking at her going,

942
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:59,960
the hell is this? And then all of a sudden these military trucks start rolling in.

943
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:11,480
They take guns out and they threaten him and he gets in his, you know, gets in his car and they

944
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:17,800
force him to leave and it was all rather terrifying for him and he, off he goes and he was collecting

945
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:23,800
himself, I don't know, half an hour down the road at a gas station, went in to get a coffee

946
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:30,360
and that's when he had a visit from these men that basically like knew his name and knew everything

947
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:36,040
about him and warned him of keeping his mouth shut. This was right after? It's pretty much right

948
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:44,440
after, yeah. I think within an hour, half an hour, something like this. And a couple months

949
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:50,280
after the incident, he met with a famous UFO researcher by the name of Clodio Covo and he

950
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:58,840
gave him one brief on-camera statement and then he vanished for 26 years. Well, Marco and his

951
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:04,200
associates were, because I kept saying 10 years ago, I was like, we've got to find the crash,

952
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:08,280
we've got to find Carlos. Like we've got to find the guy, but he was just vanished.

953
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,840
I think it took us like eight years and we found him. Marco found him. Anyway, we got him. Then,

954
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:24,440
so then roughly, let's see, it would have been the morning of January 13th, so the afternoon of

955
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:32,680
January 20th, you've got all sorts of reports of unusual activity in the town of Virginia.

956
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:38,920
You get in reports of weird, strange creatures. Nobody said ET. It was like, what the hell are

957
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:46,680
these creatures? The fire department was called. It was five days, about five days, yeah. And the

958
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:53,160
distance, I think the distance between the crash and the sighting in the town of Virginia is

959
01:38:53,160 --> 01:39:01,640
somewhere in the realm of 12 to 15 miles. Whoa. Something like that. And so you're getting these

960
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:11,400
reports. The most compelling reports came from civilian reports, came from three girls. It was

961
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:19,560
Katya, Liliani and Valkyria. And Valkyria and Liliani are two sisters. And then Katya was a

962
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:26,840
little older. She's 21 and it was like 14 and 16. And they were going through a little field

963
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:36,840
on the outskirts of town, but in the town. And they saw this creature in broad daylight,

964
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:46,120
I think it was like three o'clock in the afternoon, crouched against a cinder block wall.

965
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:53,480
And we're like, you know, looking at this thing, like, what the heck are we looking at here? And

966
01:39:53,480 --> 01:40:03,240
it had, it was weak. It had spindly arms and legs. It had like a brown oily skin, almost like a

967
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:11,240
kidney or something. Do you know what I mean? Like it was like an exposed organ. And they shrieked

968
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:17,160
when they looked at it and then it turned and made eye contact. Two of the girls, I think it was

969
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:28,360
Liliani and Valkyria took off and Katya got completely mesmerized by making eye contact

970
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:33,080
with it. There was some level of communication that was happening and Katya was kind of frozen

971
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:39,240
in her tracks. She was about eight feet, maybe 10 feet away from it. And it was, it was feeble. It

972
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:46,680
was scared, according to Katya. It wanted help, like get me out of here kind of thing, help,

973
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:54,120
according to Katya. The other two girls got, I don't know, 50 or 70 feet away and were like,

974
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:58,360
where's Katya? We got to go back and get Katya. And they ran back and it was Liliani,

975
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:03,720
ran back and grabbed Katya and broke her stare and yanked her out of there. And then they

976
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:12,680
they reported, they went running home to their mother and they were like telling her what, you

977
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:16,360
know, and they thought it was something of the devil, like it was a devil or something.

978
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:21,720
Did she say, did she say anything about any kind of communication between the being and her?

979
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:26,600
Yeah, well, I asked her about that. Yeah. Cause I said, this is where the title came from. I said,

980
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:31,800
and I didn't even realize this at the time. I said, cause I wanted to know, I know it was very

981
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:37,960
brief. It was probably just a couple of seconds, but a lot can happen in that moment. In a couple

982
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:44,760
of seconds, time slows down and you kind of get, you know what I mean? Like, so I said during that

983
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:50,200
moment of contact, was there any level of communication? If so, what was said, what did

984
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:57,320
you feel? And she says it was obviously no words or anything, but it was like, I'm scared, I'm weak,

985
01:41:57,320 --> 01:42:06,040
I'm scared and I need help. That was what she got. And Katya was, was staying behind and Lilliani and

986
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:13,320
Valkyria ran back and grabbed her. Katya was the oldest, she was 21. And so they run back to their,

987
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:18,520
the mother's house, the two sisters with Katya and the mother says, we're going to, let's go back.

988
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,720
And then the two sisters weren't, didn't want to go. So she went back with Katya was the oldest one.

989
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:27,880
So the mother went back and they found a footprint where it was. And it just,

990
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:34,040
the strongest smell of like ammonia, just, they said the smell was just like paralyzing, like

991
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:41,640
a hundred thousand times worse than a skunk. Just the smell. I had somebody say to me,

992
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:46,280
that seemed to be in a position to know, but I don't know, it could be complete speculation,

993
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:52,040
because everybody had talked about the smell of this thing. That when certain creatures get scared,

994
01:42:52,040 --> 01:43:00,200
they have this, they excrete something that, that can protect them or paralyze those around them to

995
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:05,400
protect, do you know what I mean? Like a skunk does. And that, that a lot of people thought that

996
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:10,520
that's what these creatures did. So it was like a sulfur mixed with ammonia. Sulfur ammonia,

997
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:14,840
they said it was the worst, like it was just paralyzingly bad. Okay. And it was in your,

998
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:19,160
it was in your nose for like a week. Yeah. Everybody talked about that. So in any case,

999
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:24,200
so the mother, I don't know if I'm going into too detailed, the mother went back and smelled the

1000
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:29,800
smell and saw the footprint of, you know, this weird creature, which I actually have a drawing

1001
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:34,040
of the footprint if you want to see it. Yeah. Yeah. They drew the pictures or they had an artist do

1002
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:38,840
a rendition from, from their description. No, the mother actually drew the footprint for me right

1003
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:44,920
there on the spot. Let's see if I have it here. Watch me not have it. I saw it last night when I

1004
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:49,720
was going through these. Yeah, I think it's in there. Okay. Here we go. This could be it,

1005
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:57,320
but it's basically like two digits, like two digits like this with one appendage that looks

1006
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:02,600
like it maybe comes out when it's trying to beep by when it's standing up and when it's not standing

1007
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:08,600
up, it looks like this kind of like, so we can walk. Right. I'll, I'll keep discreetly looking

1008
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:17,400
here. You guys right there. Oh, there it is. Boom. Wow. Okay. Yep. Good. Good. So kind of around,

1009
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:25,640
around paw with three long fingers. This is exactly where you can see that.

1010
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:32,440
Pull it back, back behind the mic right there. Yeah. Okay. So this is exactly where the encounter,

1011
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:36,520
this is exactly where the encounter took place. And these are the three witnesses.

1012
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:46,120
That's Katya, Valkyria and Liliani and his exact location. And this photograph was taken in 1996.

1013
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:52,520
Right after that, right after it happened. And then you've got, here, hold this up by the microphone

1014
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:56,440
real quick. You've got the footprint. That was the, that was the footprint of the creature. Then the

1015
01:44:56,440 --> 01:45:00,120
mother who saw the footprint drew this for me. A little bit higher. There you go. Perfect.

1016
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:07,800
Perfect. Yeah. Crazy. She drew that for me. And a lot of witnesses I talked to had seen the foot

1017
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:17,640
in the hospital. So later that day, only a few blocks away, there were two military officers

1018
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:26,200
on patrol. Nobody was talking ET. Okay. Nobody had mentioned ET. The girls thought it was the devil.

1019
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:31,160
They were very religious. Right. The mother didn't know what, you know, the girls saw.

1020
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:39,880
Later on that day, two military officers, Eric Lopes and this guy named Marco Cherizzi.

1021
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:44,840
And when you're in the police, it's like the fire department's part of the military. The police is

1022
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:50,120
part of the military, military police. So these two officers were on patrol looking for something

1023
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:55,880
unusual. They didn't say UFO crash and there was ET walking around. Right. So they're driving around

1024
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:01,160
and they're just a couple blocks away and it's around 5.30 PM. They're a couple blocks away from

1025
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:07,560
where the girls encountered. And by the way, I talked to a lot of people that had that area

1026
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:15,960
of Varginha completely cordoned off by the military, like military blockades all around

1027
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:20,440
there. And I talked to a lot of, I have them on camera, but they were armed and like, you're not

1028
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:27,240
walking one step further, including the local news outlets. I interviewed them as well. So they

1029
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:31,560
cordoned off the area that I'm talking about right now. And that's where the girls had the encounter

1030
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:38,920
and two blocks away at 5.30, where military officers Marco Cherizzi and Eric Lopes saw this

1031
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:45,640
creature run across the road in front of them. Slammed on his brakes, Marco jumps out the passenger

1032
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:51,000
door and grabs this thing with his bare hands. And he takes it and he puts it in the back seat

1033
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:57,960
on his lap. Believe it was the back seat. On his lap? On his lap. Yes. And they take it initially

1034
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:03,000
to a clinic in the town of Varginha and the guy comes out and says, I don't know what the heck that

1035
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,720
thing is. Get it out of here. I've no, what are you guys doing? Kind of thing. And so they go to

1036
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:13,720
another hospital called hospital regional. And at which point the creature remains in hospital,

1037
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:19,000
regional hospital. Sorry. The creature remains in regional hospital for,

1038
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:25,560
I'm not sure exactly how long, but it ultimately ended up in Humanitas hospital.

1039
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:33,800
And we have testimony from doctors that performed certain things, as well as

1040
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:43,240
military guys that drove the creature. We have the whole, the entire area where the

1041
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:47,240
creature was. So they, they captured two creatures. One was alive and I think the other one was not

1042
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:51,800
alive. The one that Eric Lopes caught that you said was in his lap in the car, was that one alive or

1043
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:59,240
dead? It was alive. That one was still alive. Yeah. But very little resistance. So he got a cut on his

1044
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:05,560
arm, kind of on his shoulder, like right here during the capture of it, whether it scratched

1045
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:12,040
him with a nail or I don't know what exactly happened, but he got infection. And within days,

1046
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:23,640
week or whatever it was, he went into the hospital. The doctor administered antibiotics and he said

1047
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:29,640
he'd never in all of his years prior or since seen anything like it. Marco trees, a perfectly

1048
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:36,840
healthy 23 year old young man got this like complete immune system failure and he died.

1049
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,680
And we interviewed the family, his sister, we interviewed the doctor who worked on him

1050
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:51,400
and they wanted to put him in the ground as soon as possible.

1051
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:59,160
Uh, I couldn't believe that you actually got the doctor on camera, the doctor that treated him.

1052
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:03,960
I know it's crazy, right? What, what did he say? What was he looking for? What did he see

1053
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:10,120
when he was treating Eric? He just said that he'd never in all of his career and he's been

1054
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:19,560
in there for like 40 plus years. He's never seen, uh, someone with an infection from a simple cut

1055
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:25,400
like that, uh, have a complete immune system failure and not respond to any of the antibiotics

1056
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:31,000
that he's, he pumped him full of everything and nothing worked at all. And he just,

1057
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:35,960
his health just went down and he died. There was some sort of mention of a granular toxin.

1058
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:41,480
Yeah, I know. I didn't quite, yes, we have the autopsy reports, which the family had to fight

1059
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:47,960
to get. We interviewed, uh, we w I didn't interview his wife. His wife was interviewed one time very

1060
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:55,000
briefly, never seen the light of day by Roger Lear. Roger Lear, Dr. Roger Lear is a UFO

1061
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,440
researcher. He used to take allegedly implants out of people. And when Roger Lear found out

1062
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:06,120
that I was making this movie years ago, 2014, he was adamant that he wanted to talk with me.

1063
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:11,400
He wanted to get together. And I, I sincerely wanted to talk to him too, but I was investigating

1064
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:16,040
Rua at the time and I, I was kind of backburning, backburning, uh, Virginia case.

1065
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:22,120
Long story short, he sent me, he said, well, if I can't, if you can't get me on camera,

1066
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:27,880
you got to have my tapes. I went to Virginia in 2002 and I documented a bunch of witnesses,

1067
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:33,400
some of whom have gone off the radar completely forever. Those tapes had never seen the light

1068
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:37,800
of day. I transferred the tapes, had them digitized and then Dr. Roger Lear sent them back to rear

1069
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:42,360
Dr. Roger Lear and then he died. And so I never got a chance to talk to Dr. Roger Lear,

1070
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:47,320
but I got his tapes and one of those tapes, he interviewed the wife of Marco Triese.

1071
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:52,200
Nobody's ever done that. Nobody's even going to get a hold of her, but nobody had ever managed

1072
01:50:52,200 --> 01:51:00,040
to get the driver, Eric Lopes. He'd been in hiding for like 26 years. Marco, what's the name of the

1073
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:04,280
guy who died again? That was Marco. Marco Triese died. Yes. He was the guy that leapt out of the

1074
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:09,000
passenger seat and grabbed this creature apparently. And the guy who was driving the car has never been,

1075
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:14,440
no, he won't even talk to the family of the guy who deceased. The guy who was driving the car,

1076
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:19,000
that's the guy who basically was trying, was about to shoot you guys. Yes. Yeah.

1077
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:28,200
Yeah. It's a crazy story. You know, and we interviewed the town mayor. He was like,

1078
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:33,640
yeah, this is unbelievable as it sounds. I believe this actually happened. I interviewed the local

1079
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:38,680
news station, you know, saying the same thing. They completely threatened to lock us up if we

1080
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:45,480
asked one more question at the military base as a, to lock up the local media in prison for asking

1081
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:52,280
questions. They came down so hard. And then, you know, I don't want to give away too much of the

1082
01:51:52,280 --> 01:52:02,840
film, the storyline, because I don't want to ruin it for anybody, but they shut it down. They shut

1083
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:11,160
the story down. And then we came to the realization, not for about 10 years, on my last trip to

1084
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:18,840
Virginia, which was just last year, we came to the realization that the U.S. government was 100%

1085
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:24,440
involved and that they arrived and they took, we talked to the radar operator, we saw the plane

1086
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:30,040
coming in. Saw U.S. Air Force plane. United States Air Force airplane come in and it came into the

1087
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:34,680
exact area where we knew the body was because we drove, we interviewed the guy who drove the body

1088
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:40,040
to that location. And then the United States Air Force plane came in. Yeah. And then flew out,

1089
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:48,600
in and out. Yeah. Wow. So it's heavy. Highly likely, extremely likely that they, one of the

1090
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:54,040
reasons for the level of secrecy is that the Brazilian government would be exposing the U.S.

1091
01:52:54,040 --> 01:53:00,760
government by revealing what they know. So I'm just guessing here, but

1092
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:10,200
there are some pretty crazy aspects that we uncovered during meeting the witnesses

1093
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:17,560
and stuff that you just go, Jesus, like really? Guys in suits from some unknown government agency

1094
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:23,080
coming in and trying to like intimidate and influence testimony and offering large sums of

1095
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:28,760
money. Bribes, yeah. Bribes. And then you've got like the lead UFO researcher on the case,

1096
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:35,720
Uberajada Rodriguez, who's a lawyer in the town of Virginia, who suddenly, after writing a book,

1097
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:40,360
does a complete 180 and he won't even talk to anybody anymore. Pacaccini, the same thing.

1098
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:48,440
Claudio Coville's unfortunately passed. But so they managed to like get the lead UFO researchers

1099
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:54,760
to either recant what they said previously or made to print in a book or just go silent altogether

1100
01:53:54,760 --> 01:54:00,200
and never comment on the case ever again. And then threatening the witnesses. I never heard a witness

1101
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:07,160
say to me, they said they're going to kill me. They just say the consequences of revealing what

1102
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:14,120
you know would be extremely severe. The punishment would be extremely severe. And then ask, you know,

1103
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:23,080
that kind of thing. Right, right. So yeah. So now, as crazy as it all sounds, and I think I told

1104
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:27,160
your audience earlier, don't believe a single word I'm telling you because I wouldn't if I were you.

1105
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:33,400
But this story happened. One of the parts that freaked me the fuck out the most was the interview

1106
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:40,920
with the x-ray technician. Crazy. What did he say specifically? Like how was his description of it?

1107
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:50,680
Just working in the hospital one night, one late afternoon or evening, and military trucks pulled

1108
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:58,600
up. And they're like, you're going to be doing some work for us. He's like, OK, like what exactly am

1109
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:05,480
I doing here? And they had an object in a black body bag. He said it stank to no end. And it was

1110
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:13,080
kind of smaller. But he said that they were armed guards in there watching his every move.

1111
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:17,400
Look at him in the eyes. You just perform this. You can't look at the x-rays. For the first time

1112
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:21,560
in history, he couldn't look at the x-rays because he always verifies to make sure they come out.

1113
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:27,560
Couldn't look at the x-rays. They just looked at him very carefully. And then he performed his

1114
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:33,240
duties. And then they said, don't you ever talk about any of this stuff. And he said he x-rayed

1115
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:40,120
the skull, the torso. Yeah, all of it. The whole thing. He actually thanked us when,

1116
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:46,600
at the end of it, I mean, I think Marco Leal, my partner, co-producer, who's amazing, Brazilian,

1117
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:53,880
he said that, I think he spent like eight years, because he found him in the hospital through a

1118
01:55:53,880 --> 01:56:00,600
student that he revealed the story to once. But he was still working in the hospital. He was like,

1119
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:06,040
they'll never, ever reveal. And then he retired. And then we worked on him. And Marco worked on

1120
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:13,000
him for a couple more years after he was retired. And then he finally agreed, provided we shoot the

1121
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:18,360
back of him. But we got a photograph of him at the hospital. We shoot the back of his head and

1122
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:23,000
disguise his voice that he'll come forward. And at the end of it, he said, I feel so much better.

1123
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,680
Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to share this story, because I've been holding this

1124
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:33,560
on my shoulders for 26 years. And they all were very, quite honest. Could you imagine

1125
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:40,760
if something like that happened and you couldn't talk about it? That's a big deal. Yeah. Yeah.

1126
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:46,760
Really big deal. Yeah, man. It's compelling how a lot of those interviews are. Those people had to,

1127
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:51,800
they demanded to be interviewed from the rear and have their voices changed and completely be

1128
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:53,880
censored. 100%. It was that or nothing.

1129
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:02,040
So it seems like the thing that would blow this out of the water is if it's just crazy that there's

1130
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:06,120
this whole story happened and there's all this evidence from everybody. All these people are

1131
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:13,960
willing to talk, but still we can't get a photo or a video clip. All we get is, can we show the

1132
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:20,120
drawing? Wasn't there a rendition of the creature hiding? There's an artist at a rendition of the

1133
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:25,960
creature, kind of like huddled, like crouched in the corner. Well, hang on a second. Is it online?

1134
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:31,880
Well, I do have the actual creature that the girls gave me. They said it was the most

1135
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:36,840
accurate depiction of what the creature looked like, but it's a little model. Oh, okay. Yeah,

1136
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:42,600
yeah. I mean, because I don't have that really high level drawing. I don't have that with me,

1137
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:46,600
but I have the, let me grab it. Okay. Hold on one second. Yep. It's like super glue would probably

1138
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:49,400
do it. The head fell off. There's super glue here. We'll, we'll fix it after.

1139
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:58,840
Oh man. So it's this shiny brown creature. Well, they, you know, I, I generally try to,

1140
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:06,120
you know, avoid little trinkets like that because there's somewhat cheesy paraphernalia for UFOs,

1141
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:13,720
but the girls who came into contact with that creature allegedly said that this was the most

1142
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:17,080
accurate depiction of what the creature looked like. And that's why I brought it.

1143
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:22,520
I don't know if you want me to see if I can hold it. The reason why I have this is because

1144
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:28,360
the girls gave this to me and said that this is the only, facing me. There you go. This is the

1145
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:37,560
only depiction of the creature that is totally accurate is exactly what they saw. And it was

1146
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:43,720
given to me by, and how big was it? It was like about four and a half feet, maybe four and a half

1147
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:52,440
feet tall. Wow. Brown, oily skin, big eyes, scared, cowering, non-threatening. It was

1148
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:57,320
non-threatening. It was, it was scared. That image, that drawing isn't anywhere on Google.

1149
01:58:57,320 --> 01:59:02,520
It was, it's, it's strange because it kind of, it matches all of the traditional depictions of

1150
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:07,320
the alien beings. Except for the eyes. Except for the eyes and its brown skin.

1151
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:10,680
Yes. And it had like ridges. There you go. There's a bunch of them.

1152
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:15,480
All right. So that's, that's pretty accurate. That one upper right. Yeah, it's pretty accurate.

1153
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:24,520
That's pretty accurate. So it had this brown skin and red eyes. Yeah. It wasn't evil looking.

1154
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:29,320
Yeah. Some of these renditions try to make it look evil. I know it was not. Oh, look at that one. Go

1155
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:36,280
up. Left. Yeah. Yeah, that doesn't. Yeah, that's too big. And, you know, it wasn't reaching out.

1156
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:42,680
It's the wrong position. It was crouched. I mean, if you could see like all it did. Okay.

1157
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:51,160
The entire time it was crouched, it had, it had its arms kind of between the legs

1158
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:57,640
like, like this, right. And when the girl screamed, it went like this.

1159
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:06,520
And that was it. It didn't get up. It didn't come after them. It just turned to look them right in

1160
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:12,360
the eyes. And they say it made any noise? No, they didn't. But others did. Like a, like a,

1161
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:19,160
there were witnesses and we actually have them in the movie where they say kind of

1162
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,880
sounded like a cricket, like a, like a cricket.

1163
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:33,960
Um, yeah, I can't replicate. There were people in the hospital, uh, once they took the alien that

1164
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:39,400
had died, it was partly covered up, but there was people in there who said they saw the feet of it

1165
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:45,240
kind of hanging out and they were all just looking at each other in bewilderment, not knowing what to

1166
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:52,680
do or what to say. Yes. Yes. I said, I said to that witness, I said, put me in that hospital room.

1167
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:59,800
Right. What was the feeling like? What was the atmosphere like? What were the doctors doing?

1168
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:05,160
What were the other military officers doing? And he said they were all scared. Like they were all

1169
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:10,360
feeling in over their heads. Like, what are we looking at? What is going on here?

1170
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:16,840
Do you know what I mean? Like everybody was freaked out. He said he's looking at these

1171
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:21,080
feet and it was like, you know, I think it had another appendage that when it stood up and did

1172
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:27,800
that because, but, um, yeah, it's, it's a truly crazy story, but you know, there are other

1173
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:36,040
crazy stories like that. I was talking about the Rua incident, which is different because they

1174
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:43,240
were in control. Right here. These creatures were clearly not in control. They were scared,

1175
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:50,440
which is so crazy, man. It's so crazy. You always think of in these stories of the creatures being

1176
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:56,760
the ones in control. Yeah. They're the ones who have the upper hand. In this case, this thing was

1177
02:01:56,760 --> 02:02:04,840
all alone and in distress. That is what makes it so insane to me. Oh my gosh. I was going to tell

1178
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:13,320
you. So I flew my, my drone. Yeah. I learned, I fly remote control airplanes and I remember years

1179
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:16,840
ago, I was like learning to fly remote control airplanes. So I could put cameras on them and then

1180
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:22,600
of course the drones and, and, uh, so I think my drone, I took it everywhere I go just to get

1181
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:32,040
aerial photography of cases. Right. And I took it way up and I pointed the camera straight down

1182
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:39,400
because I wanted to document the area where the girls came in contact with this being allegedly.

1183
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:47,720
And you could see the block, the military blockade where that was from a different witness. Then you

1184
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:53,400
could see where the girls saw the creature in this one little area. And then you could see where the

1185
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:59,240
capture occurred. And I was, we were all like coming to the realization, wow, this, the vast

1186
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:05,240
majority of this occurred in a rather small area. Like, I don't know, within eight, 10 blocks. Right.

1187
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:15,800
Right. And then the family that we rented, we, we Airbnb'd a big house on the outskirts of town.

1188
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:24,120
It was fairly secure. And the owners of the house were doctors and, uh, they were like,

1189
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:27,560
what are you guys doing here? And we told them, you know, we're making this stuff. Oh, okay.

1190
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:34,520
We'll have really good friends have a story. So, uh, we end up

1191
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:39,560
going to their house. It took like a couple of days cause they really didn't want to talk on

1192
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:43,560
camera. And then they want to just, they were like, no, no, we weren't going to go on camera.

1193
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:47,400
We just wanted to tell you where their doctors and they were worried about the impact it would

1194
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:51,160
have on their careers and their credibility. And they didn't want to, they were like, no,

1195
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:55,000
we're just going to tell you it and not on camera. We just wanted you to know what happened.

1196
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:58,680
We were like, well, okay. Well, why don't I film me from the, you know,

1197
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:03,240
you think all this camera equipment's here? Yeah, I know. Yeah. So long story short, what we,

1198
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:10,600
what, what we realized is that, uh, we had done an overhead shot of the cap of the

1199
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:16,440
encounter site, the military blockade site, the capture site, according to witnesses,

1200
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:22,520
all with one shot and the home of the witnesses that we were just about to interview the whole

1201
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:31,880
family, the mother, the husband, and the daughter. And they all watched this thing for about 12 to

1202
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:39,000
15 minutes. And we realized in the middle of the interview, wait a minute, the proximity to

1203
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:47,880
these witnesses, to the girls' witnesses, to the capture, to the military blockade, it's all

1204
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:58,600
right here. So we have testimony from an entire family that watched that night in January,

1205
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:05,800
right around midnight, a UFO, according to the entire family of doctors,

1206
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:13,160
looking for something. And it was doing a grid search over the area where the girls seen it,

1207
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:18,760
where the capture happened, where it all happened. That to me was so compelling because I'm going,

1208
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:23,400
wait a minute, now you've got witnesses describing a recovery effort.

1209
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:31,560
You've got very compelling testimony of people witnessing. And I actually interviewed four

1210
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:39,400
people that all claimed of this disc shaped craft that was looking for something.

1211
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:42,680
Doing sort of a grid. Well, I mean, if we left our people behind,

1212
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:47,400
I'm sure we would be looking for something too. Right. I know it sounds so crazy. I really do.

1213
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:51,560
But you didn't put this together. They didn't put two and two together when you talked to them.

1214
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:54,840
No. Well, they said they were looking for something. I said, how do you know? They were

1215
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:59,400
doing this grid search. Everybody said it was looking for something. Then I was like, wait a

1216
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:06,360
minute. I think we just accidentally captured their home from my drone. And I'm looking at the drone

1217
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:14,760
shot and I've got their home, which is like, say, you know, like here, let's just show you.

1218
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:19,480
So we got overhead shot. This is representative of about 10 city blocks, maybe a little bit more.

1219
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:23,400
Right. This is the road where the capture happened. This is the little area where the

1220
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:27,720
girls came direct contact with the creature. This is where the military blockade was.

1221
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:32,680
And this is the home of the family we interviewed. It's all right here. It all took place.

1222
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:37,800
Yeah, man, it was incredible. I had goosebumps. So I was, we were all just going, oh my God,

1223
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:42,040
they were looking for their people. Clearly. What the hell else are they looking for?

1224
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:45,800
If you are to believe the accounts of the people that you met, and I believed all of them,

1225
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:50,760
no question about it. Can I have some of this liquid death? Oh, absolutely. Hell yeah, man.

1226
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:57,720
It's for you. Awesome. This is water in a bottle. Water in a can. I really like that because I hate

1227
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:03,400
plastic. I always feel so bad about all the plastic. So this is recyclable aluminum.

1228
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:06,360
Murder your thirst. Murder your thirst. I'm going to do that right now.

1229
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:16,360
Did you get any sense from any of them, whether this being was a biological entity

1230
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:23,960
compared to possibly being some sort of robot or humanoid sort of drone or clones?

1231
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:27,880
Because you think when these creatures visit us, if they're coming from some place far away,

1232
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:34,520
similar to the way we look at Mars, we send robots. Why would they come here themselves?

1233
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:42,440
So there's so many unanswered questions. But according to the witnesses that I interviewed

1234
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:52,040
personally, that being was a sentient being. It had emotion. It had intelligence. It had fear.

1235
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:59,560
It was cowering. It was scared. It was non-threatening. It was scared. And it was

1236
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:05,960
feeble and having a hard time. So I mean, it's kind of sad when you think about it.

1237
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:18,360
I started thinking like, gosh, how did they treat this thing? Were they kind to it? Did they try

1238
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:24,840
to make any kind of communication? What did the authorities do? How long did it live? Did it live

1239
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:37,240
for weeks or days? I just wish I knew. I need to find the counter. Once it left the Brazilian soil,

1240
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:44,040
and we have very compelling testimony that it did, what happened to it? Was it alive?

1241
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:46,360
How long did it live?

1242
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:51,560
How long did it live? Was there any level of communication with it? All these questions I

1243
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:57,960
have unanswered, I'm just dying to know. And I'm going to continue researching this case in the

1244
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:07,480
United States because I'm going to start finding out. I know of a bunch of evidence, photographic

1245
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:12,440
evidence, videotaped evidence, filmed evidence, and now physical debris evidence with bodies.

1246
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:21,000
I'm very confident that some unknown government agency or outside government agency, whether it's

1247
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:27,640
an independent contractor for the United States government has got this stuff. Now, my objective

1248
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:34,600
moving forward is where is it and who has the authority to release it? And I want to know if

1249
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:39,320
there are any Americans out there that were involved in this case. In fact, if there's any of them

1250
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:45,960
listening to this podcast right now, please reach out. They can get in touch with you

1251
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:56,920
or they can email me at jamescfox.gmail.com. And I'd love to hear from you.

1252
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:06,200
What are the obstacles for you in order to get your hands on footage of something like this or

1253
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:11,240
photos or something like this? What are the biggest obstacles? What do the people that have

1254
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:30,200
them have to lose? The people, unfortunately, are terrified. The higher the stakes, like the

1255
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:35,880
this has been across the board with pretty much every case I've ever investigated,

1256
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:45,240
you have people that are just legitimately scared. And the more better evidence they have,

1257
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:51,560
the better the encounter, like the girls encountered this thing, the mother had

1258
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:58,840
men in suits come and intimidate her. And I absolutely believed her. No question. The guy

1259
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:04,680
that watched it crash had men in suits come up to him and intimidate him, scared him, spooked him.

1260
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:14,120
People with photographic or videotaped evidence are terrified. I can't emphasize that enough.

1261
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:20,840
Let's just speak hypothetically for a moment, okay? Obviously, I'm covering this case.

1262
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:29,400
Clearly, I want to uncover photographic videotaped evidence. I mean, come on, man,

1263
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:35,000
it's obvious. If you don't think I'm going after that, then you need to readjust your

1264
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:43,160
thinking. There's nothing. It's the holy grail, right? How do you execute? Let's just say

1265
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:52,600
hypothetically that you did identify someone with evidence like that, and you offer them

1266
02:11:53,400 --> 02:12:00,600
a significant compensation for it. Either they don't want it, they're too scared, there's no

1267
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:07,800
amount of money. Well, let's just say they do agree to take money. How do you get 100 grand

1268
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:15,880
or 200 grand cash into Brazil? You can't even take more than 10 grand with them asking you

1269
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:20,840
questions. They're watching you. I know the military base is watching me. They've already

1270
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:24,120
called all around to half the witnesses I've talked to. Instead of Bitcoin.

1271
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:32,920
Yeah. I had some people say, yeah, some of the alternative currency, but how do you do the hand

1272
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:38,280
off? How do you get it out of the country? Do you upload it to a server? This is all logistical

1273
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:43,800
things that... And then you have people that are just terrified. I mean, look at Eric Lopes,

1274
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:50,520
the driver of the car. He's been in hiding for 26 years. He threatened to shoot everybody when

1275
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:58,760
we got to his property. He's not messing around. What did they tell him? Is it not just threatening

1276
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:06,360
him, but his family? What would get a guy to literally say he was going to shoot everybody?

1277
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:13,080
He wouldn't even give a statement to the family of his buddy who was in the passenger seat.

1278
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:20,600
Like, think about that for a minute. He wouldn't give a statement to the family of his buddy who

1279
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:31,080
died after handling that creature. What on earth? He grew up. Those two grew up together. They were

1280
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:40,200
good friends. Like the fact that he... You know? I mean, isn't that... So you just kind of have to

1281
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:46,600
have to fill in the blanks a little bit. It's not easy. It's not easy going after

1282
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:51,240
videotaped photographs. That stuff has a weird way of disappearing.

1283
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:58,200
It's horrible. I know. It's like, I mean, there's nobody on the planet probably trying harder than

1284
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:07,080
I am. I mean, no civilian that I could think of. I'm giving it 110%, 24-7. And look,

1285
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:14,440
I'll be incredibly satisfied if our film comes out and it triggers other evidence and testimony

1286
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:19,240
to come forward. And maybe that's a part of another project that somebody else does or I do. I don't

1287
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:27,240
really care. I want it out. But of course, of course, we know there's that kind of evidence

1288
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:35,240
out there. We know that. Now, John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist, did he interview the girls

1289
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:42,040
in... Or all the girls and the boys in Zimbabwe after that thing happened. But he also interviewed...

1290
02:14:42,680 --> 02:14:48,920
Did he also talk to the people in Virginia? Yes. That's fascinating. How did he get in touch with

1291
02:14:48,920 --> 02:15:02,200
them? How is it that almost no Americans and even the UFO community, researchers, know very little

1292
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:09,080
about this case? You had two people that I know of, Americans, that investigated. Excuse me, Roger

1293
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:18,760
Lear and Dr. John Mack. They're both deceased. Dr. John Mack is really funny because I was

1294
02:15:18,760 --> 02:15:23,720
investigating the Rua Zimbabwe case. That's that landing at Ariel School in 1994. I think it was

1295
02:15:23,720 --> 02:15:30,760
September. And where roughly 100 school children were out in broad daylight and they all witnessed

1296
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:36,120
a couple of disc-shaped craft come down and land in the field next to their playground.

1297
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:43,080
And they all ran out with great curiosity and came face to face with beans, very similar to what the

1298
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:49,560
girl... The big eyes, spindly arms and legs, about four feet tall. There was telepathic communication

1299
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:54,920
that occurred. Sounds totally unbelievable, but I'm pretty sure that case happened as well. In fact,

1300
02:15:54,920 --> 02:16:00,760
I'm convinced it did. But Dr. John Mack was investigating that case and he was doing so

1301
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:06,840
at the behest of Lawrence Spellman Rockefeller, who was funding a lot of his efforts at the time.

1302
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:11,480
Rockefeller was putting pressure on the Clinton administration. He was funding

1303
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:21,160
researchers, Harvard psychiatrist, Dr. John Mack. Harvard tried to fire John Mack because of his

1304
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:28,680
association with UFOs and alleged abductees and the work that he was doing. And apparently Lawrence

1305
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:33,160
Spellman Rockefeller picked up the phone and called and said, you know those grants you guys like

1306
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:38,520
getting from the Rockefeller Foundation? Well, if this guy gets fired, those are all gone. So anyway,

1307
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:45,800
so he was funding him. So you had John Mack investigating with the camera crew in Africa.

1308
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:50,440
Two years later, you got this another amazing case in Virginia, Brazil. He's interviewing the

1309
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:56,120
witnesses there. Those were only two years apart. Two years apart. Wow, man. The 90s were amazing.

1310
02:16:56,120 --> 02:17:03,880
Like think of the two, some of the best cases ever. That massive broad daylight mass sighting over

1311
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:10,920
Arizona. That's such a good case, man. Even the governor saw it. That massive, you had-

1312
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:14,760
You're talking about the Phoenix lights? Phoenix lights. You had the 50th anniversary of Roswell.

1313
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:19,960
You had the people coming forward from Roswell because in 1997, a lot of them weren't dead yet.

1314
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:24,440
A lot of them had died, but a lot of them had not died. So you had the Roswell thing.

1315
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:36,520
You had the Belgian UFO wave, which was the late 80s, but early 90s as well. You had

1316
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:46,440
94, you had the landing at the school in Africa. In 96, you had the crash in Virginia. In 97,

1317
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:52,680
you had the massive flyover of the state of Arizona, the Phoenix lights. I mean, my God,

1318
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:58,360
that was hot. What an exciting- Why was the 90s so hot? I mean, you cover in phenomenon

1319
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:03,480
the 80s during the Cold War. Yeah, I cover a lot of-

1320
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:08,920
They targeted these nuclear facilities. There were many sightings. I love the way you showed the

1321
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:14,280
graphic of the world and you showed the timeline of every nuclear bomb ever detonated. Yeah.

1322
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:19,320
Crazy. That was Lance Mongia's idea. It was a brilliant idea. That was like, yes, Lance,

1323
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:26,920
let's do that. I had no idea we detonated so many nukes. I know. Isn't it crazy, those stories of

1324
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:32,920
the UFOs or these top secret facilities of shutting these things off? Fascinating.

1325
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:40,360
That was an afterthought because I was pretty much wrapping up the phenomenon. Of course,

1326
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:44,440
you got the front page of the New York Times revealing that Pentagon UFO program. Then I

1327
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:49,880
was interviewing the former Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, who had initiated ATIP,

1328
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:57,560
Bigelow and everybody else. I don't know why. For some reason, during the sit-down interview,

1329
02:18:57,560 --> 02:19:03,640
I didn't ask this question and that was bad on me. But when after the fact, I was walking,

1330
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:08,920
I said to Senator Reid, hey, do you mind really quickly if I get a quick B-roll shot of the two

1331
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:14,520
of us walking? He's like, okay. He had just a couple of minutes. He had these security guys,

1332
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:18,920
detail, kind of looking at me. I couldn't even get near him without them looking at me all funny.

1333
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:24,200
It was kind of weird. Big, brute guys. Is it okay if I stand next to him and we'll walk down the

1334
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:30,680
hall? Yeah, okay. They were walking and I said, what was one of the more astonishing aspects of

1335
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:36,600
the phenomenon that you uncovered during this Pentagon UFO program? He immediately said the

1336
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:42,680
fact they're shutting off our nukes. I thought, oh my God, I just got that on camera with

1337
02:19:42,680 --> 02:19:46,600
Senator Harry Reid. That's an aspect of the phenomenon we're going to have to cover in

1338
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:52,280
the movie. I went back to some researchers and that was the last thing we did. That was the last

1339
02:19:52,280 --> 02:20:00,280
aspect of the phenomenon that we put in the film. But in any case, getting back to John Mack,

1340
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:07,400
I was following his work in Africa, kind of picking up where he left off with that case.

1341
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:13,160
Randall Nickerson also did a film on Chus Rua, which is, I think it's out now,

1342
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:19,080
called Aerial Phenomenon. He was very helpful and helped me put me in touch with some of the

1343
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:25,000
witnesses. But in any case, I was following Dr. John Mack and then to my astonishment,

1344
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:32,840
when I got to Brazil, I uncovered archival tapes of John Mack in Brazil. So John Mack was doing a

1345
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:39,960
lot of like cutting edge investigations in the 90s that he never really saw through to fruition

1346
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:45,560
because he was struck down I think in the early 2000s by, he looked the wrong way. People think

1347
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:49,640
it's a big conspiracy that he was killed. I really don't believe that. He looked the wrong way in

1348
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:54,200
London. I've done it. It's easy to do. You go across the street and you're, you know,

1349
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:57,000
especially if you don't spend a lot of time there, you don't know the way traffic flows.

1350
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,960
Got a couple beers in your belly and you just looked the wrong way.

1351
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:00,440
Yeah.

1352
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:04,760
You know, you just go jump across the street. You're so used to looking this way or what, you know.

1353
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:11,960
So unfortunately, he was run down and died. But it was amazing to see him. He was like at the

1354
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:17,560
forefront of a lot of these incredibly compelling cases. And I'm so glad they're coming out now,

1355
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:22,040
you know. Like Varginha happened how many years ago? What's it?

1356
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:25,240
1996? 28 years ago?

1357
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:27,880
Is that 28?

1358
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:31,720
Close to 28. My wife was born in 96. I think she's 28.

1359
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:37,960
Okay. Wow. Wow. So it's almost three decades it's taken for the story to really come out

1360
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:42,760
in the United States. Varginha is known pretty well. And it's funny actually,

1361
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:46,200
they put their spin on it the same way like with Roswell in the United States.

1362
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:49,240
And I think that's changed a little bit recently. But

1363
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:57,560
like when I hired a local talent from Rio de Janeiro, this audio guy twice, two different

1364
02:21:57,560 --> 02:22:02,520
audio guys, and they were laughing, oh, we're going to go investigate Varginha, you know,

1365
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:07,080
kind of thing. And then at the end of it, after they met the witnesses, they were like,

1366
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:10,440
whoa, this happened. Like, you know.

1367
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:11,000
Yeah.

1368
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:16,680
But they kind of had that level of disinformation that had kind of swirled around

1369
02:22:17,560 --> 02:22:24,920
the Brazil. But that too now is changing. And I think there's going to be

1370
02:22:25,880 --> 02:22:29,320
a lot of questions once this film comes out. Yes.

1371
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:34,040
It really exposes this case unlike it's ever been exposed.

1372
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:40,440
Well, the most fascinating thing to me about the Rua incident is the telepathic communication

1373
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:46,200
that they all explained to John Mack. The videos with John Mack are fascinating,

1374
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:50,600
how he's talking to them and they're explaining this. Like, I don't know how long after the

1375
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:53,800
incident it was. For people that don't know, maybe for people that don't know, you can give

1376
02:22:53,800 --> 02:23:02,840
kind of like the bullet points of that encounter. Sure. So there was a sighting of a UFO over

1377
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:10,440
probably a three or four or five day period in South Africa, as well as, which is just to the

1378
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:17,800
north, Zimbabwe. Harare is the capital of Zimbabwe. And then there's a school in a town

1379
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:27,800
called Rua, which is maybe an hour or 45 minutes away from Harare. And the school's called Ariel

1380
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:35,000
School. And it was like, I want to say September 1994. And there were roughly,

1381
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:40,040
they'll say 66, but no, no, there were roughly, I went there and I talked to the teachers,

1382
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:45,400
there were roughly a hundred school children playing outside during recess. It was like 10,

1383
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:55,720
30 in the morning. And they suddenly saw these objects that looked like a disc and they were

1384
02:23:55,720 --> 02:24:03,960
coming down and landed. And the next thing they knew, and a lot of the, you know, either the kids

1385
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:09,640
all saw the UFO. Some of them came, saw the creatures from further away. Others saw the

1386
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:15,320
creatures face to face. Like I would ask, you know, some of the witnesses, well, how close did you

1387
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:21,960
get to these, this being or whatever you call it. And they were like, oh, arms reach. Like I could

1388
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:29,640
touch them. Yeah. And there was this apparent, oh, so within I think a week or two,

1389
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:36,360
Dr. John Mack, this Harvard psychiatrist, again, I was telling you he was being funded for research,

1390
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:42,360
general research on the phenomenon by Lawrence Rockefeller, gets a camera crew and flies to

1391
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:48,920
Africa and goes to Ariel School within a week or two. And so he interviews, I think it was 66 kids

1392
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:55,160
on camera right after it happened, all talking about what they saw. Some of them had a download.

1393
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:59,640
They would look at the creature in the eyes and that's when they would, there was a communication

1394
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:03,800
with imagery and they were talking about- Imagery.

1395
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:10,680
Imagery. Yeah. Like, well, so I'll talk about the communication. I can also talk about another thing,

1396
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:18,040
which is kind of crazy, but they had this telepathic communication they described as like

1397
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:26,680
images of environmental destruction, fires, like the earth is, like we're having an impact,

1398
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:35,240
a deleterious impact on the earth, on the environment, our presence, technology,

1399
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:40,440
this kind of thing. And the kids were young. They never thought about climate change. This was 1994.

1400
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:44,040
I mean, nobody's written anything about climate change that was in the mainstream.

1401
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,720
So they reported that. But also, and this didn't make it in the film, and this is something that

1402
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:53,640
I've only shared a couple of times, but it's something really delightful about this.

1403
02:25:55,720 --> 02:26:03,480
So I heard this directly from the witnesses, the children, now adults. They said, so they had these

1404
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:10,440
very defined areas of the playground because it was Africa. They had these big telephone pole-like

1405
02:26:10,440 --> 02:26:15,480
things that would define the absolute outer perimeter of where the kids were allowed to play.

1406
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:21,000
And because there were like dangerous snakes and tall grass and spiders and this sort of thing,

1407
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:25,720
so everything was like groomed within that area and then the children weren't allowed to go beyond

1408
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:36,120
those poles or telephone poles. But what they would do is they would go, children being children,

1409
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:42,920
they'd skip and dance on top of the poles at that furthest perimeter. Like if they went two more

1410
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:47,240
inches over to the right, they were out of bounds, right? And they would skip along there. And

1411
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:52,360
apparently, according to some of the children, these beings were mimicking their behavior and

1412
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:59,800
skipping with them, dancing with, yes, I know, kind of a benign encounter. But they were mimicking

1413
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:05,640
their behavior and kind of just, yeah, isn't that weird? Wow. That's super weird. I never heard that

1414
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:09,960
part of that. Yeah, I know. I didn't put that in the movie, but I thought there was something

1415
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:13,720
delightful about that. That it was a very benign- How would they be doing that?

1416
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:20,120
Well, they said to me like this, because when I meet a witness, I always want to know,

1417
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:27,080
sometimes I even close my eyes and I say, put me there. I want to be there. The reason why I close

1418
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:35,000
my eyes is because your words need to recreate the scene, right? And if my eyes are closed,

1419
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:40,280
what am I looking at here, okay? How far away were they? What was the sky? Where were you?

1420
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:47,880
What were you standing? I wanted to know every aspect of it. And this witness said to me,

1421
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:56,280
have you ever been out in the wilderness, like in the middle of nowhere, and had an encounter with

1422
02:27:56,280 --> 02:28:05,080
a wild animal? There's this standoff, this moment where almost time freezes, where you have

1423
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:14,920
a level of curiosity from both, whatever it is you're looking at, the wild animal and you,

1424
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:20,120
it's like you're both frozen and you're observing each other with a level of curiosity,

1425
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:24,600
a piqued curiosity. What are you? What are you going to learn about each other? And like,

1426
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:31,960
are you trustworthy? Is this a threat? What is this? Curious, very curious. They said,

1427
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:38,920
that's what it was like with the beam. It was just as curious about them as they were of it.

1428
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:46,760
And I was always kind of stuck in my head about that. How many of them were there, did they say?

1429
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:53,240
Well, according to the witnesses, there were multiple UFOs. One was bigger than the rest.

1430
02:28:54,760 --> 02:29:04,760
And I want to say between, and they would appear here and then come over here. Several. Several of

1431
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:11,480
them. Yeah. Several. Yeah. Can you pull up the pictures that they drew? Oh, absolutely. Jordan?

1432
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:18,680
Yeah. Can you see that? Yeah. Yep. So that's just three of them, one in front, two behind. And

1433
02:29:19,480 --> 02:29:25,560
this is corroborated by a bunch of the children that were there. Oh my God. Are you kidding? Like,

1434
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:33,000
so many children. And this was drawn, I think this is, I'll think of her name in just a second.

1435
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:38,760
Does she put her name on the back? Gosh, why don't you put your name on here?

1436
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:49,080
Well, it'll come to me anyway. So. Okay, that's interesting. That shows like eight of them.

1437
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:53,960
But again, I don't know if there were eight, like some of them said we saw one,

1438
02:29:53,960 --> 02:30:03,800
others said we saw more than one. You know, some of them, yeah, most of the kids saw more than one

1439
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:10,040
UFO. Most of the kids saw more than one UFO. And multiple beings, more than four or five beings.

1440
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:15,720
But not all the kids came within arm's reach. Only a handful came that close. They were

1441
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:26,520
gathered around. So I wanted to share something really crazy because I was in Africa

1442
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:33,320
and right after, right after I left Africa,

1443
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:40,120
I went and I investigated another. That's wild. I know. I went and investigated another

1444
02:30:41,960 --> 02:30:50,360
UFO landing case at a school. And this case was Westall and it occurred in April of 1966.

1445
02:30:50,360 --> 02:30:55,640
Okay. But there were like all over 300 witnesses to this case.

1446
02:30:55,640 --> 02:31:02,760
300. Over 300, including a science professor in. School in Australia. Okay. Outside Melbourne.

1447
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:07,640
Okay. Westall, I think it was Westall Primary or something, but it's called the Westall Incident,

1448
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:16,920
1966. So I'm, I was just in Africa. Okay. And I had some of these drawings with me.

1449
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:24,840
I was just kind of sharing them a little bit, you know, and I had very much like the classic alien

1450
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:30,280
spindly net, long neck, big head and big eyes. So anyway, so I'm kind of sharing this and I had

1451
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:39,000
someone say, bloody hell. I mean, like that looks just like the one Gina. I said, the one Gina.

1452
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:43,640
He said, yeah, the one Gina from the, their 4,000 year old cave paintings here in Australia.

1453
02:31:43,640 --> 02:31:51,800
Yeah. So I looked up one Gina and I don't know if you, yeah. And look at that on their upper right

1454
02:31:51,800 --> 02:31:57,800
hand. 4,000 year old rock art. Yeah. So click on that one on the upper right, if you can, the big

1455
02:31:57,800 --> 02:32:06,600
one. Yeah. And I just have to remind your audience, this is 4,000 years old. I mean, hello. Do you see

1456
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:13,560
some resemblance? I mean. Yeah. It's kind of crazy, right? It looks, it looks exactly the same.

1457
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:21,560
That's what I'm saying. I, it was just, it was spooky to see that. The resemblance, I mean, these

1458
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:27,800
are children in 1994. It looks like a snake slithering in between all these heads of these

1459
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:32,760
creatures for people that are not watching and only listening. They've, it's, there are these 4,000

1460
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:39,960
year old cave rock paintings from Australia. And these heads look like the traditional UFO heads

1461
02:32:39,960 --> 02:32:45,480
with the big eyes, the big head, the spindly bodies. And there looks like a snake slithering

1462
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:52,200
through it, two tall, skinny looking beings off in the background and a bird, like a.

1463
02:32:53,320 --> 02:32:58,200
Anyway, it's just, I mean, could that possibly be a coincidence? I mean, I don't know, man,

1464
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:06,360
but that was just, and there's obviously. And this is, so these are apparently in some caves

1465
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:11,480
and how do they date? How do they date it to 4,000 years ago? That you're going to have to talk to,

1466
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:15,720
you know, specialists because I don't know, but that's according to everyone I talked to,

1467
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:21,720
these are thousands of years old on cave paintings in Australia. In fact, I almost went to one of

1468
02:33:21,720 --> 02:33:27,000
them. And next time I go to Australia, I'm going to go and look at some of this stuff because

1469
02:33:27,880 --> 02:33:33,320
it's just like, I'll look, I don't know which one that is. That's interesting.

1470
02:33:33,560 --> 02:33:41,560
I mean, it's just the big eyes, that shaped head. It's just fascinating stuff. And I think I,

1471
02:33:42,280 --> 02:33:47,000
you know, this is like the historical, for your audience listening or even watching,

1472
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:53,080
you can check out probably, there's a book that's put out by Jacques Vallee and it's called

1473
02:33:53,080 --> 02:34:02,360
Wonders in the Sky. And he documents ancient sightings, whether it's cave art or paintings,

1474
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:08,120
or coins. Historical paintings, Renaissance paintings. It's fascinating. It's called

1475
02:34:08,120 --> 02:34:14,920
Depicting UFOs. Depicting UFOs, which cannot be interpreted as anything other than UFOs.

1476
02:34:15,480 --> 02:34:20,360
Anyway, there's one drawing that I brought in this briefing document that I was talking about

1477
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:24,360
earlier. Yeah, pull it. You can pull that one up, Jordan. I think you have that one we were

1478
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:31,400
looking at earlier. It's painting the Madonna. It's in a, right there. Yeah, there you go.

1479
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:43,080
The Madonna with Saint Giovanni. Yeah, there's tons, there's lots of these old Renaissance paintings

1480
02:34:43,080 --> 02:34:49,640
from like the times of antiquity with religious depictions of Madonna and Jesus and the Virgin

1481
02:34:49,640 --> 02:34:55,480
Mary with strange objects in the background. I think this one shows a guy looking up at it in

1482
02:34:55,480 --> 02:35:00,920
the sky. Yeah, if you, yeah, if you can click on that and if you zoomed in, you could see there's

1483
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:06,920
a guy standing there with a dog and they're looking up at it. So let me, can I share, can I share,

1484
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:15,800
can we go back to Australia? Yes, yes. This is Westall UFO case. So I went to Australia

1485
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:26,040
right after Africa and I was fascinated because I, it's so hard for me as a researcher to imagine

1486
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:33,960
how a mass sighting like a school could happen in broad daylight and that the whole world

1487
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:38,360
wouldn't know about it. I just have a really hard time wondering how is that possible?

1488
02:35:38,360 --> 02:35:44,120
Do you know what I mean? So I started investigating, well, with the help of a number of Australian

1489
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:53,400
researchers and there was a guy who was 12 miles or less, eight miles away from the school.

1490
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:58,440
It was two days prior. Usually when there's a UFO sighting, there's always a couple of days lead up

1491
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:02,440
to a, whether it's a big event like a landing or something, it's almost like they're kind of

1492
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:07,400
casing the joint. I don't know. You'll always, you know, there's a UFO activity on a big mass sighting

1493
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:15,080
usually for a few days before it does something. There was a guy that was about, like I said,

1494
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:19,240
eight, 10 miles away. His name was James Kibble. He'd never come forward ever.

1495
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:32,520
His, he was out in his garden with a Polaroid. It was, I want to say April 4th, I'd have to look

1496
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:38,920
at the exact, but it was April 4th, 1966. And he wanted to share the progress of the flowering

1497
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:45,080
garden at his mother's place. So he had his Polaroid camera out there and then he saw some,

1498
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:49,720
something glinting in the sky that caught his eye. And he looked up and he saw this disc

1499
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:56,920
that was, according to the witness, James Kibble, he deceased now. He sent this to me.

1500
02:36:56,920 --> 02:37:00,200
This is a direct scan of his. He mailed that to you? He mailed this to me. Yeah.

1501
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:07,320
So it's descending like this. Yeah, please. It's descending like this. And then

1502
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:12,200
all the witnesses at the school that saw this object take off, they said it was a disc and it

1503
02:37:12,200 --> 02:37:18,440
went like this. It goes up like this on its side and then it shoots up straight up in the air.

1504
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:24,680
Well that, according to James Kibble, is the disc that flipped up horizontally like this

1505
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:31,400
before it shot off. A moment later, he said it was like a bullet leaving a gun shot out of there.

1506
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:39,160
Now I'll share some interesting aspect with your audience. And that is, if you ever see

1507
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:49,560
a UFO photograph with crystal clear defined edges, it's probably a fake. They don't know why,

1508
02:37:49,560 --> 02:37:55,720
but there's something to do with the propulsion they're guessing that causes the edges to blur

1509
02:37:55,720 --> 02:38:01,400
ever so slightly. Like if you look at a legitimate bonafide good photograph that has been like

1510
02:38:01,400 --> 02:38:14,040
scrutinized to death, like 1950 McMinnville, Oregon, or 1964, 65, the UFO worker that snapped

1511
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:20,440
off three or four Polaroids. I'm looking at his face right now. It'll come to me in a second,

1512
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:30,520
but you'll see that the edges are slightly blurred. And according to witnesses or specialists that

1513
02:38:30,520 --> 02:38:35,800
I've talked to, that's a pretty good indicator that coupled with the testimony of the person

1514
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:46,280
that shot it, Santa Ana Rex Heflin, 1965, he shot, I think, three or four Polaroids. And the edges,

1515
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:50,520
the great pictures, points of reference, broad daylight, light reflecting off the object,

1516
02:38:50,520 --> 02:38:56,120
fantastic. If you zoomed in on it, on the originals, the edges are slightly blurred,

1517
02:38:56,120 --> 02:39:03,560
just like this one. But this is like a metallic structured object that went from this position to

1518
02:39:03,560 --> 02:39:07,160
this position and then shot off at high red speed. Well, it's interesting. That's exactly how Bob

1519
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:12,520
Lazar described those things flying when he was on S4 testing those scraps. I learned about that later

1520
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:20,520
on. And I, you talk to the witnesses, I'd never talked to, prior to Australia, I'd never talked

1521
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:26,840
to someone who described, I mean, this thing was sitting on the ground when the kids ran up to it,

1522
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:34,760
okay? Sitting on the ground right there, broad daylight. It lifted off, got like 20 feet up,

1523
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:38,920
and then it flipped on its side and then that's when it rocketed off. That's what the kids

1524
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:45,160
described? That's what the kids described, yes. So, that's what this guy who snapped a picture of it,

1525
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:48,680
in that position right before he said a moment later it shot off, he said,

1526
02:39:48,680 --> 02:39:52,360
described the acceleration to me. He said like it was being shot out of a gun.

1527
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:59,480
Bang, gone. Yep. The pilots described it, the pilots that saw it off the coast of San Diego

1528
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:05,720
explained it like if you put a ping pong ball into a cup and you shook the cup, that's how the motion

1529
02:40:05,720 --> 02:40:11,880
was. And then Bob described him flying belly first, like when they did the test flights.

1530
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:19,640
Which brings me to the picture you showed me last night of that red glowing object.

1531
02:40:20,360 --> 02:40:28,440
Okay, well. Can you show that? I can. I have that on my phone. I can text it to you and you can forward

1532
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:36,680
it over to him. Okay, okay. But that's kind of a bigger story behind that whole thing. I don't

1533
02:40:36,680 --> 02:40:42,920
know if that's something that you, you know, want to go into detail on. Well, as much as you're

1534
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:47,320
comfortable with sharing. I'm happy to do it. Absolutely. I'm happy to do it. Because that is,

1535
02:40:47,320 --> 02:40:54,680
if that's real, that is one of the most compelling photos I've ever seen. Yeah. Of a UFO.

1536
02:40:55,800 --> 02:41:03,560
I'm happy to share that story. Yes. I just shared a single frame clip of an object.

1537
02:41:05,240 --> 02:41:10,680
That's what I basically what I saw. But I saw video videotaped. I don't know if you got it yet.

1538
02:41:10,680 --> 02:41:15,480
I just got it. I'm forwarding it to you now, Jordan. Okay, cool. So then I'll tell you the story

1539
02:41:15,480 --> 02:41:23,560
about it. Because I get it. It's footage that I've seen with my own eyes. That's truly. So is the

1540
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:28,280
first time you told the story about this to Logan Paul's first time you told the story? Well,

1541
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:35,480
I was always kind of hush hush about it for a long time. I mean, I would tell my friends. Yeah.

1542
02:41:35,480 --> 02:41:43,480
Because I was worried about it. I was worried about jeopardizing my efforts to get it. Why is

1543
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:48,440
that so small? Yeah, blow it up. Make it bigger. Oh, yeah, there we go. Okay, so.

1544
02:41:50,440 --> 02:41:57,400
But I've told the story a couple of times publicly. And the most detailed was probably when I was on

1545
02:41:57,400 --> 02:42:02,760
Logan Paul's show. Because he's like, evidence, where's the evidence? And of course, I feel them.

1546
02:42:02,760 --> 02:42:07,880
I feel I feel the same way. I mean, I've got some evidence, you know, uncovered some nice

1547
02:42:07,880 --> 02:42:12,440
photographic evidence and video. So let me tell you the story behind this, because it's pretty crazy.

1548
02:42:13,480 --> 02:42:20,840
Okay. I was doing my first UFO documentary way, way, way back. Believe it or not, they had cameras

1549
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:30,440
back. I'm old, but not that old. But and I was interviewing a guy who lived on the outskirts

1550
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:36,040
of Area 51 in the area where you could live. It's not like restricted, you know, space. His name

1551
02:42:36,040 --> 02:42:40,680
was Chuck Clark. He lived in a double wide and he was a former military guy, an amateur astronomer.

1552
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:46,280
And he had a sighting of something out at Area 51. And remember, this was kind of around the time

1553
02:42:46,280 --> 02:42:51,800
that Bob Lazar story was coming out, really big. It was, this is early 90s. I couldn't tell you

1554
02:42:51,800 --> 02:42:58,600
exactly what year, but early 90s. And so Chuck and I, he was he was participating in my film.

1555
02:42:59,240 --> 02:43:04,920
It's called 50 years of denial. And we were going back and forth for several months. And I was

1556
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:11,560
fascinated by what was going on in Area 51. I was a very curious person by nature. So I stayed in

1557
02:43:11,560 --> 02:43:22,200
touch with Chuck and we communicated often. Well, one day he calls me and he goes, I got something

1558
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:30,120
to show you. And I said, okay, well, can you tell me what it is? He goes, no, but I'll tell you this

1559
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:35,640
much. When you see it, your jaws can hit the ground. I said, really? And he's not one fraud

1560
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:42,440
verbally. I mean, Chuck is a pretty mellow guy. I said, really? He goes, yeah, really? I said,

1561
02:43:42,440 --> 02:43:47,320
I'm getting in my car and I'm driving straight there. It was like 16 hour drive, 14 hour drive.

1562
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:57,400
But I was like, if Chuck says, you know, so I get to, I get to the little alien Chuck lived just a

1563
02:43:57,400 --> 02:44:06,120
block away in Rachel, Nevada. Going to do his double wide, super clean trailer, very nice,

1564
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:12,280
like beautifully air conditioned, nice, very clean, nice situation. And he's got a TV and he's got a

1565
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:23,080
VHS tape and he pops his VHS tape and he said, sit down, I'll show you. And I see two guys on,

1566
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:28,920
all I can describe is like the typical road trip. They're listening to tunes,

1567
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:34,440
they're filming out the window, they're goofing off next to the, they go into like the little alien

1568
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:38,760
and they're posing next to the little alien, you know, just goofing off, just a road trip.

1569
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:46,280
Going to chat Area 51 after all the publicity that Bob Lazar gave Area 51 was a ton.

1570
02:44:47,640 --> 02:44:48,520
The first time, right?

1571
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:54,280
Mm hmm. Bob Lazar story came kind of public in 89, it was like 93, but still it was like making,

1572
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:58,120
you know, people were doing tours Area 51 and there were areas that you could go to

1573
02:44:58,120 --> 02:45:03,320
and look down onto the base that had yet to be closed off. If you knew what you're doing,

1574
02:45:03,320 --> 02:45:06,600
you know what I mean? You could still see the base. That doesn't happen anymore

1575
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:12,040
because they bought that section too. But anyway, they're goofing off, they're posing next to the

1576
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:17,720
ET sign, blah, blah, blah. And then all of a sudden the car's parked, they're in the car,

1577
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:28,440
the car's parked. The camera is on probably the armrest and it's crooked. It's not like level

1578
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:35,480
because it's just caulked a little bit. The camera's filming the dashboard, a little bit

1579
02:45:35,480 --> 02:45:42,600
of the windscreen and the heater and the vents and all that stuff. And they're arguing,

1580
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:48,360
and what it sounds to me like, you can't see them yet, you can't see them. It sounds like

1581
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:51,960
they're trying to crawl under the seats is what it sounds like. And they're arguing.

1582
02:45:53,400 --> 02:46:00,040
Excuse me. And all of a sudden one of them is like, it's over the top of us. Get down,

1583
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:04,440
get down. It's over the top of us. And I'm like, what the hell is going on? I'm looking at this

1584
02:46:04,440 --> 02:46:13,240
video going, what am I looking at here? What's going on? And that point, this light, like

1585
02:46:15,080 --> 02:46:21,960
this is the car. There's a light source above it, shooting directly down.

1586
02:46:23,480 --> 02:46:30,920
And it's lighting up the inside of the car. But not normally like if you just had a spotlight

1587
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:38,600
with a helicopter. No, this light was like a yellowy orange and the shadows inside the car.

1588
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:42,840
You couldn't see the light. You can only see the effects of the light. You couldn't see the source

1589
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:51,160
of the light. The shadows on the inside of the car were eerily moving around like the source of

1590
02:46:51,160 --> 02:46:59,240
the light was on a pendulum because it was kind of like this. So all the shadows, I'd never seen

1591
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:06,600
anything like it on the inside of the car were moving around very fluid, super smooth and fluid,

1592
02:47:07,240 --> 02:47:17,160
right? There was no abrupt stop or back and it was all fluid. And one of the guys goes,

1593
02:47:17,160 --> 02:47:20,200
you know, they were like, it's over the top of us. It's over the top of us. I don't know

1594
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:23,240
what the hell they're talking about. I don't know what the hell was over the top of us. I have no

1595
02:47:23,240 --> 02:47:27,080
idea what they're talking about. I don't know what I'm looking at. And at this point, the camera's

1596
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:30,120
still filming just the dashboard. Just the dashboard. Nobody has it in their hand.

1597
02:47:30,120 --> 02:47:36,120
And I hear this, I'm getting out. And the guy's like, no, stay in the car. Stay in the car. I'm

1598
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:45,880
getting out. And he grabs the camera, opens the door. And I don't remember like pretty sure the

1599
02:47:45,880 --> 02:47:51,560
camera pans up. You could see like the desert floor. You could see like tumbleweed. I remember

1600
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:56,360
seeing like a tumble. I think I saw a tumbleweed. It was dark, but it wasn't like it was dusk.

1601
02:47:57,080 --> 02:48:03,800
You could still see outlines of the desert, right? Okay. They're outside

1602
02:48:06,280 --> 02:48:17,640
100 feet is that. Okay. Now here's the crazy part. What I remember is that I'm looking at this thing,

1603
02:48:19,480 --> 02:48:23,160
probably 30, 40 feet in diameter. You could have easily hit it with a rock.

1604
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:32,120
It's sitting in the sky and it's magic. It's like floating silently. It's kind of rocking,

1605
02:48:32,760 --> 02:48:39,560
like floating. Like it's like a ship on the water. It's doing this. And the skin of the craft

1606
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:48,280
looks like it's alive. Like the molecules are alive. Like it's glowing. Like phosphorus on a

1607
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:54,920
beach or something. Right. And I'm looking at it and all I'm thinking of is all the witnesses that

1608
02:48:54,920 --> 02:49:00,280
I've talked to that have seen these things at a loss for words to describe what the hell they're

1609
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:05,560
looking at. Right. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like, cause it looks alive. It looks like

1610
02:49:05,560 --> 02:49:11,320
it looks, and it looks like magic. Like you're, you're just, you're, you can't even speak. Like

1611
02:49:11,400 --> 02:49:20,440
I was just like, like, just, you know, like Chuck Clark was right. My jaw was on the floor. Like,

1612
02:49:20,440 --> 02:49:24,120
I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. And then the guy operating the camera goes,

1613
02:49:25,800 --> 02:49:30,360
Oh my God, like this. And then bam, oh, the camera shuts off.

1614
02:49:31,640 --> 02:49:36,920
Did he shut it off or was it just, you know, like shut down? I have a vague memory of something

1615
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:40,920
like him saying something about a battery, the battery or something, but the camera shut off

1616
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:46,840
pretty quickly. Camera shut off. And that was that. And I looked over at Chuck Clark and I went,

1617
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:56,920
Holy shit. Like, who gave that to you? Like, I need to have that. I was still in production

1618
02:49:56,920 --> 02:50:01,560
of my first piece. Right. I was like, I gotta have that. And I just said, and he's like, oh,

1619
02:50:01,560 --> 02:50:07,240
they're really scared that they, they shot something that, that's like a secret, super secret,

1620
02:50:07,240 --> 02:50:11,400
you know, stealth government, whatever. And they're, they're terrified. I said, okay,

1621
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:15,480
well fine. Give them my telephone number. Tell them I'll work with them. They could be anonymous.

1622
02:50:15,480 --> 02:50:18,280
Right. I'll get, raise whatever kind of money. Are you kidding me? Like,

1623
02:50:18,920 --> 02:50:24,520
just give them my number, Chuck. And I kept harassing them and calling them and calling them

1624
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:32,040
and calling them. And he had a copy of this video. He had a VHS copy of it. Yes. And you know, I hate

1625
02:50:32,040 --> 02:50:37,960
to say this, you know, you know, it was probably one of my biggest regrets is I didn't run out of

1626
02:50:37,960 --> 02:50:41,960
that thing. Had I known that it would never see the light of day, I probably would have,

1627
02:50:42,680 --> 02:50:49,320
because that's not right. Like they could be anonymous, you know, make copy of it, at least

1628
02:50:49,320 --> 02:50:56,280
for how did you get, can you tell me how you got the screenshot? So, so well, somebody will, there's

1629
02:50:56,280 --> 02:51:02,680
a photograph that was taken in France. Somebody, it's so, okay, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to

1630
02:51:02,680 --> 02:51:09,400
reveal what I can reveal comfortably here. Okay, that's fine. I do have screenshots that

1631
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:21,320
was given to me about a year and a half ago. I got contacted. I talked about the story on a podcast.

1632
02:51:21,960 --> 02:51:26,120
I just one day said that the hell with it. I don't care anymore. Like, you know, what good,

1633
02:51:27,400 --> 02:51:32,840
everybody needs to know, I saw this footage with my own eyes. I swear on my life. Okay. And I knew

1634
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:37,880
there wasn't, and I look at a lot of photographs and video, there's nothing on this one. Okay.

1635
02:51:37,880 --> 02:51:42,360
And not only that, but usually when I look at a photograph or some video footage, I immediately,

1636
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:49,400
I'm highly dubious. It's fake. It's been, not one, not even zero, zero, 1% of me said that.

1637
02:51:49,640 --> 02:51:55,000
This felt the most authentic stuff. It was just old enough to be before all the special. No,

1638
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:00,840
this was, this was phenomenal, man. Okay. Trust me when I tell you this, this was like the,

1639
02:52:01,640 --> 02:52:08,840
this was the most, this is the gold standard by which we're all going after the definitive

1640
02:52:08,840 --> 02:52:14,280
piece of videotaped evidence. This was it. Okay. Right. It was like, this is the Holy grail

1641
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:21,560
of evidence. And I saw it with my own damn eyes and the fact that I didn't get my hands on it.

1642
02:52:21,560 --> 02:52:24,520
Anyway, about a year and a half ago, maybe it was two years ago. I don't remember.

1643
02:52:26,360 --> 02:52:30,040
I sat out the heck with it. And I publicly told the story on a podcast

1644
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:35,960
and I get contacted by a guy who was a PI. He's like, he does private investigating. He finds

1645
02:52:35,960 --> 02:52:41,720
people. He's like, I heard your story, man. It's unbelievable. I'm going after this guy,

1646
02:52:41,720 --> 02:52:45,800
Chuck Clark. I said, go for it. Don't mention my name. Chuck won't talk to me anymore.

1647
02:52:46,520 --> 02:52:52,920
And so I said, good luck. Let me know how it goes. And he finds Chuck Clark and he goes,

1648
02:52:52,920 --> 02:53:03,640
I got his number. I said, well, give him a call. So he did. And so he, about maybe a year ago,

1649
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:08,200
he went out and met Chuck Clark and Chuck still had that same VHS tape and it was

1650
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:13,960
pretty degraded. But Chuck actually let him keep a couple of frames of it. I don't know,

1651
02:53:13,960 --> 02:53:20,040
let him shoot a frame off the TV screen. That's not one of them, but that's exactly like that.

1652
02:53:20,760 --> 02:53:25,960
Somebody sent that. So I don't know where that that particular object. I don't know exactly

1653
02:53:25,960 --> 02:53:30,200
where that came from. Somebody texted it to me and said, is this what it looked like? I said, yeah.

1654
02:53:30,200 --> 02:53:37,800
Now, the difference that I remember is that the one that I saw had like,

1655
02:53:39,240 --> 02:53:45,720
like if you took a pie and you took a knife and you symmetrically cut pieces of that pie,

1656
02:53:45,720 --> 02:53:50,440
very symmetrical, but you didn't remove the pieces. You just made the seams.

1657
02:53:52,120 --> 02:53:58,600
Those were darker. There were like lines that were darker, like it was like it was a pie,

1658
02:53:58,600 --> 02:54:03,800
but it wasn't taken apart. But they were perfectly symmetrical. And I remember that.

1659
02:54:04,600 --> 02:54:09,960
I remember that and I don't see it there. But in terms of like the color, orangey yellow

1660
02:54:10,520 --> 02:54:14,920
and glowing like that, that's what it looked like. Like it was alive, like it's phosphorus.

1661
02:54:14,920 --> 02:54:20,600
That's so weird. Yeah, I know. And it had been being that close to Area 51. It must have been

1662
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:24,840
right there. It must have been a test flight by one of the people there. Could very well have been

1663
02:54:24,840 --> 02:54:32,440
that. Could very well. I have no idea. But that's what I saw. And it was flipping. It was, it was

1664
02:54:32,440 --> 02:54:41,000
magic. It was like, like you look at it and you have nothing to relate it to because you've never

1665
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:48,120
seen anything like it, not even remotely like it. It's so foreign to your eyeballs. Like seeing

1666
02:54:48,120 --> 02:54:53,800
those shadows on the dash, the way they were moving. I'm like, the only way you could recreate

1667
02:54:53,800 --> 02:54:58,280
that is to have a light on a pendulum above a car at night that's bright enough. Like and it's

1668
02:54:58,280 --> 02:55:04,680
moving so slowly. Like the shadows were moving around in this fluid motion on the inside of the

1669
02:55:04,680 --> 02:55:09,560
car with this light source coming above the windshield. It was just like you've never seen

1670
02:55:09,560 --> 02:55:15,000
that before. How would you see that before? And then when you see the object and it's like,

1671
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:23,720
it's like, it's not stable. It's, it's, it's kind of wobbling, like maybe slower, but it's kind of

1672
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:28,920
wobbling. Do you know what I mean? Like if you thought of a boat on the, on the ocean, the way

1673
02:55:28,920 --> 02:55:35,320
it's kind of move around the ocean like that, that's what it looked like. It wasn't stable. It

1674
02:55:35,320 --> 02:55:41,560
wasn't like, you know what I mean? The camera shut off, but did the kids describe to Chuck or

1675
02:55:41,560 --> 02:55:46,600
anything what happened after that? He, Chuck wouldn't tell me. I mean, where is Chuck at?

1676
02:55:46,600 --> 02:55:52,440
We got to find Chuck. Chuck's in Arizona. Yeah, he's in Arizona. Chuck, god damn it,

1677
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:57,160
released the footage. Yeah. And when this private eye went out and checked it out,

1678
02:55:58,680 --> 02:56:03,640
he said, yeah, Chuck said that he would never talk to you. He goes, Chuck said that,

1679
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:07,400
Chuck said that he told, cause he said to me, he said, if you ask me again,

1680
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:13,320
I'm never going to speak to you again. If you ask me again, of course I'm going to ask you again.

1681
02:56:13,320 --> 02:56:19,320
Like I, I was, I was selling, I think it was out of the blue. I just sold out of the blue,

1682
02:56:19,320 --> 02:56:27,000
the NBC universal. Sorry, my mic away from the mic there. And there was this guy, Larry Landsman,

1683
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:31,240
who was at NBC universal. I told him the story, you know, he was buying my movie,

1684
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:36,840
sci-fi, whatever. And he goes 30 grand. We'll get 30 grand. No problem for that.

1685
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:40,840
So I was like, okay, I'll reach out to him, but I don't know how well it's going to go down.

1686
02:56:40,840 --> 02:56:47,800
It was like 2009 or 2010. And I reached out to him and he goes, I'm never talking to you again.

1687
02:56:49,800 --> 02:56:55,320
I said, well, I just have 30 grand. Could you just offer to the kids $30,000? Like, come on.

1688
02:56:55,320 --> 02:56:58,120
Right. Just talk to them. He wouldn't even entertain it. No.

1689
02:56:59,960 --> 02:57:03,080
You think he's in a similar situation to some of those people in Brazil? Maybe

1690
02:57:03,640 --> 02:57:09,240
no. Or those kids are in a similar situation. No, I don't know. Why would he show it to everybody?

1691
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:14,840
I mean, you think you keep it in a vault. He never got it transferred. He never got it digitized.

1692
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:19,880
That footage should have been transferred to beta SP from that bloody VHS tape from when I saw it,

1693
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:25,880
because I can assure you VHS tapes deteriorate. They degrade, go over and you play them over and

1694
02:57:25,880 --> 02:57:29,560
over that half inch tape. You know, so that tape is like,

1695
02:57:33,320 --> 02:57:36,840
who knows how bad it is now, but it's not great. It's not like, you know,

1696
02:57:36,840 --> 02:57:40,280
what I saw was pretty phenomenal. I mean, it was VHS, but it was, wow.

1697
02:57:41,240 --> 02:57:43,720
It was, I mean, it was like a couple of weeks old when I saw it.

1698
02:57:46,040 --> 02:57:50,360
I didn't dilly dally, man. I went straight out to that stuff. I'm not kidding you. I was like,

1699
02:57:50,360 --> 02:57:55,320
I was like, okay, I'm going. Like, I don't know how much more time we have, but there was a couple

1700
02:57:55,320 --> 02:57:58,920
of things that I could share with you or however you feel.

1701
02:57:58,920 --> 02:58:00,440
Yeah, let's share it. Let's talk about everything.

1702
02:58:00,440 --> 02:58:03,560
Well, this is kind of interesting because we'll start with this one first.

1703
02:58:05,400 --> 02:58:08,680
This was just something that we stumbled upon when we were making the phenomenon.

1704
02:58:09,480 --> 02:58:15,880
We, it was a tel, I think they call it a telex. What was it when you send a telegram or a telex?

1705
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:17,480
I have no idea.

1706
02:58:17,480 --> 02:58:21,080
It's in lieu of, it's in 1952. We didn't have fax.

1707
02:58:21,080 --> 02:58:24,200
So if you're communicating directly, you'd send a, I'm sorry.

1708
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:26,920
A telex, maybe. I don't know. That was way before my time.

1709
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:32,360
I know, before my time too, but I still, but in any case, this is interesting because we came

1710
02:58:32,360 --> 02:58:39,960
across this, this is from the White House, from the Truman Library. In two consecutive weekends

1711
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:50,200
of July, 1952, the White House Capitol was buzzed by UFOs.

1712
02:58:50,200 --> 02:58:50,700
Right.

1713
02:58:50,700 --> 02:58:59,900
I actually found through an archivist, excuse me, through an archivist, testimony from a guy

1714
02:58:59,900 --> 02:59:08,140
named Al Chop, who was in the radar room the night that the pilot, one of the pilots in 1952,

1715
02:59:08,860 --> 02:59:15,180
streaking across the night sky over 500 miles an hour in the pitch black and suddenly was surrounded

1716
02:59:15,820 --> 02:59:22,540
by these UFOs. They were like, kind of could be described as tic tacs. They were small,

1717
02:59:22,540 --> 02:59:30,940
circular, self-luminous objects that surrounded his plane. The testimony is phenomenal.

1718
02:59:30,940 --> 02:59:36,220
They were given the authority, and we have the newspaper clippings to validate what I'm telling

1719
02:59:36,220 --> 02:59:41,580
you. They were given the authority to shoot, and apparently they did shoot, and they attempted to

1720
02:59:41,580 --> 02:59:47,900
shoot at these objects. We take a very hostile position, according to the witnesses that I've

1721
02:59:47,900 --> 02:59:55,340
talked to, on unknowns. I mean, it is oversensitive airspace. I mean, the White House, the Capitol

1722
02:59:55,340 --> 03:00:03,660
building, and it was two consecutive weekends. So there was this guy, president of the Rocket Society,

1723
03:00:03,660 --> 03:00:10,460
his name is Robert Farnsworth, and he wrote a direct plea to, I guess it would have been

1724
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:19,580
then President Truman, and he said, it's really cool, I respectfully suggest that no offensive

1725
03:00:19,580 --> 03:00:26,300
action be taken against the objects reported as unidentified, which have been sighted over our

1726
03:00:26,300 --> 03:00:35,420
nation. Should they be extraterrestrial in origin, such action might result in the gravest consequences,

1727
03:00:35,420 --> 03:00:42,860
as well as possibly alienating us from beings of far superior powers. Friendly contact

1728
03:00:42,860 --> 03:00:48,940
should be made, should be sought, as long as possible. Anyway, it's just kind of a cool little,

1729
03:00:48,940 --> 03:00:56,060
came right out of the Harry, yeah, Harry Truman Library. Wow. Yeah, I got it directly from the

1730
03:00:56,060 --> 03:01:01,580
Harry Truman Library, and I thought that was neat. And what I wanted to share with you is

1731
03:01:02,460 --> 03:01:09,340
this photograph, this photograph here, this is- Up a little bit.

1732
03:01:09,340 --> 03:01:10,780
You got it? Perfect.

1733
03:01:10,780 --> 03:01:22,780
This is Parviz Jafari. He was a general. And in 1976, he had an incredibly dramatic

1734
03:01:22,780 --> 03:01:32,300
dog and cat, dog, you know, what was it called, a dog fight, but he had an encounter with a UFO,

1735
03:01:32,300 --> 03:01:41,420
him and several other pilots, and he tried to shoot it down. He got it in his sights,

1736
03:01:41,980 --> 03:01:47,020
and he pulled the trigger to fire at this thing, and his entire cockpit froze, and he started

1737
03:01:47,020 --> 03:01:50,940
falling out of the sky, and he said he was ready to, he was a second or two away from bailing,

1738
03:01:51,020 --> 03:01:56,620
thought he was done. And I interviewed him, we flew him out from Tehran

1739
03:01:58,940 --> 03:02:02,620
to Washington DC to testify at the National Press Club event that I did,

1740
03:02:02,620 --> 03:02:07,340
that I made that film about, called I Know What I Saw. And on camera, all these years later,

1741
03:02:07,900 --> 03:02:16,380
he's since deceased, he said, gosh, my biggest regret is why did I try to shoot it? I should

1742
03:02:16,380 --> 03:02:23,580
have tried to make friendly contact. You know, that really kind of left an indelible impression

1743
03:02:23,580 --> 03:02:28,700
on me hearing him say that. Like, why did we have to have an aggressive posture? Why didn't we try

1744
03:02:28,700 --> 03:02:34,780
to make friendly contact? You know, we're such an aggressive species. It's like, then you have to

1745
03:02:34,780 --> 03:02:39,740
ask yourself, and it's all speculation, man, nobody really knows, in my opinion, what's going on.

1746
03:02:40,380 --> 03:02:48,380
But these objects chose a school to land in Africa. They chose a school to land

1747
03:02:48,380 --> 03:02:55,820
in Australia. They chose a school to land in England. Is it a coincidence? Are the children,

1748
03:02:57,100 --> 03:03:01,420
they see as a benign presence, that they'd rather try to make contact with,

1749
03:03:01,420 --> 03:03:07,020
I'm just putting this out there, I don't know. But you know, the military takes an aggressive

1750
03:03:07,020 --> 03:03:15,500
posture. We shoot at these things. We have very credible reports of landings and contact

1751
03:03:16,140 --> 03:03:22,700
at schools. I mean, with hundreds of witnesses on some occasions. So I don't know, it's just part

1752
03:03:22,700 --> 03:03:32,540
of my personal journey. Sometimes I think like, maybe, maybe if we weren't so aggressive and

1753
03:03:32,540 --> 03:03:40,620
warlike, maybe, maybe they would make contact. I don't know. It's all, like I said, man, it's all

1754
03:03:40,620 --> 03:03:49,500
speculation on my part. But you look at what the phenomenon does, and that tells you some things.

1755
03:03:51,020 --> 03:03:56,460
But you also look at what the phenomenon doesn't do. All they have to do is hover over the Macy's

1756
03:03:56,460 --> 03:04:01,900
Day parade and it's game over. They don't do that. You know, you look at some of these abduction

1757
03:04:01,900 --> 03:04:09,820
cases like Travis Walton firing this guy. I think it was 75 at Snowflake, Arizona. And they

1758
03:04:11,500 --> 03:04:16,620
got him, I'm convinced that he got in the way of the propulsion when he jumped out of the truck

1759
03:04:18,220 --> 03:04:23,740
and was affected by it. The propulsion of the craft as it was spooling up and getting ready to

1760
03:04:23,740 --> 03:04:32,060
take off. And they came back and got him. And when they five days later dropped him off,

1761
03:04:32,780 --> 03:04:36,620
if they would have dropped him off in a location where he was captured or

1762
03:04:37,420 --> 03:04:41,420
obtained, he would have died. It was the middle of nowhere. I've been there twice.

1763
03:04:43,100 --> 03:04:43,820
Really?

1764
03:04:43,820 --> 03:04:48,140
Yeah. They dropped him off. I actually have a photograph of the location if you want to see it.

1765
03:04:48,620 --> 03:04:56,620
They dropped him off at, let's see this one. They dropped him off on the outskirts of town

1766
03:04:57,900 --> 03:05:06,540
that was just far enough away in a valley where they could swoop down quickly.

1767
03:05:07,740 --> 03:05:14,700
This is a little prize possession I have. This was a drawing that, oh no, 10 or 12 years ago,

1768
03:05:14,700 --> 03:05:19,740
Travis Walton, the key witness to the fire in the sky case, drew for me.

1769
03:05:19,740 --> 03:05:23,980
Oh, wow. There's something about that. That's what the disc looked like.

1770
03:05:24,700 --> 03:05:28,220
And he signed it. That's amazing. Oh my God.

1771
03:05:28,220 --> 03:05:34,780
Yeah, look at that. 10 years ago. So it's a ton of glowing. And then this, oh, that's at the site.

1772
03:05:34,780 --> 03:05:43,020
Yeah, you got it. Cool. That's at the site. And the weird thing was, proximity to where the object

1773
03:05:43,020 --> 03:05:51,820
was was seen hovering, they cut some of the immediate trees as samples to look at the

1774
03:05:51,820 --> 03:05:58,220
growth rings. And there was a pattern of accelerated growth within a certain proximity of where that

1775
03:05:58,220 --> 03:06:04,220
object was over like a 20 year period, whatever it was since, or maybe it's 30 years since that

1776
03:06:04,220 --> 03:06:09,100
sighting. But what I wanted to mention that I thought was rather interesting was so much of what

1777
03:06:09,900 --> 03:06:17,340
these alleged beings did with Travis. It's a very credible case because there were so many eyewitnesses,

1778
03:06:17,340 --> 03:06:25,260
seven of them, they all passed polygraph. But when they dropped off Travis, they did it so

1779
03:06:25,260 --> 03:06:32,620
right on the outskirts of town in a little valley so they could dip down quickly, deposit him right

1780
03:06:32,620 --> 03:06:39,900
on the outskirts and then shoot off, minimizing the likelihood of them being spotted. Why? But

1781
03:06:39,900 --> 03:06:44,220
they also cared about his wellbeing because if they would have dropped him off where they picked

1782
03:06:44,220 --> 03:06:48,860
him up, he wouldn't have made it. And so that tells you something too, right?

1783
03:06:50,620 --> 03:06:54,540
Excuse me. It's a fascinating. So, you know, you have to look at like

1784
03:06:55,740 --> 03:07:01,500
what UFOs do and you also have to look at what UFOs don't do. I mean, they do some pretty

1785
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:09,420
provocative things, but they don't make overt contact on a mass scale. Why?

1786
03:07:09,420 --> 03:07:14,860
Which is interesting, very interesting. And the children aspect of it is even more fascinating.

1787
03:07:14,860 --> 03:07:20,140
Children, think about it. I mean, children, they're the most open-minded. They're not

1788
03:07:20,140 --> 03:07:23,820
set in their ways. They're closer to the source than we are.

1789
03:07:23,820 --> 03:07:29,020
Yeah, they really are. They really are. Well, James, thank you so much for doing this, man.

1790
03:07:29,020 --> 03:07:34,220
It has been fascinating. I'm grateful for you coming and sharing all this information.

1791
03:07:34,220 --> 03:07:38,220
Thank you so much for having me on the show. It was a real pleasure. I hope I didn't talk too much.

1792
03:07:38,220 --> 03:07:43,500
No, you didn't. I wish you could talk more. Where can people find, when is the movie coming out,

1793
03:07:43,500 --> 03:07:48,620
Moment of Contact, and where can people find it? So Moment of Contact is coming out in mid-October.

1794
03:07:49,340 --> 03:07:53,580
There are a lot of streaming platforms that are currently looking at it. It's right now scheduled

1795
03:07:53,580 --> 03:08:01,420
to be released on TVOD, which is iTunes, Amazon, Fandango, Vimeo, Hulu, all those platforms of

1796
03:08:01,420 --> 03:08:07,820
transactional download. But it'd be great if anyone out there could just look up the trailer,

1797
03:08:07,820 --> 03:08:11,820
Moment of Contact, and just spread it out because the more views the trailer gets,

1798
03:08:12,380 --> 03:08:20,140
the higher profile the film and the more leverage that we have. Also, if anyone's interested in

1799
03:08:20,140 --> 03:08:25,740
seeing the phenomenon, you can watch it for free on Tubi. If you don't want to get commercials,

1800
03:08:25,740 --> 03:08:33,340
you can rent it for $2.99 or something like that on iTunes and Amazon. If you buy it,

1801
03:08:33,980 --> 03:08:38,140
some people go, why didn't you tell me this? Because I don't know. I never think about that.

1802
03:08:38,140 --> 03:08:43,100
But if you do decide to buy it, if you want to buy it, you can get it on, I think it's iTunes,

1803
03:08:43,100 --> 03:08:47,740
with three hours of bonus material. Oh, wow. And a lot of people, for the same price,

1804
03:08:47,740 --> 03:08:52,380
you'd buy it anywhere else. But I think it's Vimeo and iTunes. But check it out. I'm pretty

1805
03:08:52,380 --> 03:08:57,740
sure it's iTunes. They have bonus material that you get when you purchase it for nine, whatever,

1806
03:08:57,740 --> 03:09:02,380
bucks. I don't know. But people that are really into it want to know that. If you're going to

1807
03:09:02,380 --> 03:09:07,420
watch it for free, watch it on Tubi. If you want to spend money, go to the cheapest place to rent it,

1808
03:09:07,420 --> 03:09:10,460
which is like $2.99. Don't be cheap. You've cheap bucks. Spend the money.

1809
03:09:11,500 --> 03:09:16,220
If you watch it free, too, I don't care. I don't do this for the money. I have to make a living.

1810
03:09:17,820 --> 03:09:20,460
Yeah. But thank you for having me on, man. Absolutely, man. Thank you so much. And thank

1811
03:09:20,460 --> 03:09:25,820
you for bringing all these amazing photographs and everything. It really made the experience

1812
03:09:25,820 --> 03:09:28,860
so much more incredible. Oh, cool. Well, thanks, man. That was a lot of fun.
