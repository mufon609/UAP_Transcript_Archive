00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Hello world. Today my guest is Professor Avi Loeb. Avi is an astrophysicist at Harvard

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,240
and his new book, Extraterrestrial, The First Signs of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth, proposes

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,360
that an interstellar object that passed through our solar system in 2017 may have been the

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,280
creation of alien intelligence. This man is truly a genius who is pushing the envelope

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,840
in the world of astrophysics and cosmology. I hope you guys enjoy this one as much as

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,000
I did. Please welcome Avi Loeb.

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,560
Pleasure to meet you. Avi, is that how you pronounce it?

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,360
Yes.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,520
So again, I just asked you before we started recording, have you done any of these Zoom

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,000
conversations in the past?

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,960
Well, thanks for having me. Yeah, over the past three weeks or so, things were very

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:04,720
hectic. I've had about 150 Zoom meetings of this type, interviews with either podcasters

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:13,320
or television or newspaper or radio stations, and there seemed to be an enormous interest

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,040
in the book. And I think part of the reason is that the scientific community starved the

15
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,760
public on this topic of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, technological

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:36,920
signatures for many decades. And the public is thirsty for information. And I address

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,720
this interest. And it's intriguing to the public. And hopefully, the scientific community

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,520
will start discussing this topic within the mainstream in the future. That's my hope.

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,560
That's incredible. You know, it's funny that we reached out to you probably maybe three

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,440
weeks ago, we scheduled this interview. And then late last week, I saw you pop up on Joe

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,720
Rogan's podcast. Right. So did all of this sort of like spiral out of control after you

22
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,240
went and visited him?

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,760
Well, it started before that. There was a report in the New York Post that I did not

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:24,960
anticipate that started lit this fire of interest. And just to give you another example,

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,400
over the past couple of weeks, I had about 10 filmmakers and producers from Hollywood

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,840
contact me about the book with interest of perhaps using it for a documentary series

27
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:46,240
or perhaps a film. And it's just extraordinary, the response that I'm getting. And as you

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,200
know, the book that came out just a few days ago is already, I mean, it has been a best

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,520
seller on Amazon for a couple of weeks before it came out, even before reviews came out.

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,920
But now that there are a number of reviews of the book already in the New York Times,

31
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:14,680
in the Washington Post, in the New Yorker, also overseas in many outlets. And, you know,

32
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,280
I get a lot of requests more than I can accommodate. Basically, my day is full of interviews

33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,920
from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. every day. And that will continue for the next few weeks, based

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,640
on all the commitments that I've made. But I think, you know, for me, as far as I see

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,080
it, it's a platform to explain the importance of the issues that I'm trying to bring up

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,600
to the attention of the public and the science community, more than a privilege of, you know,

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:57,160
raising my status in any way. So I see it as an opportunity to communicate. And I'll

38
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:04,400
be glad to discuss with you the various issues that appear in my book. Maybe I'll just say

39
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,680
upfront that there are two major aspects of the book. One has to do with the object that

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,000
was discovered in 2017 that is very weird and doesn't look like anything we have seen

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,840
before from within the solar system. The object came from outside the solar system. And so

42
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,960
I suggested that maybe it's artificial in origin, not natural. And then the second part

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,800
of the book is discussing, you know, the implications that it could have to us as the

44
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,680
human species and why there is reluctance to consider that possibility that I just

45
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,040
mentioned. And are we ready to receive the news?

46
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,760
So the first time I heard about you is when I think Vice released an article about the

47
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,800
Amua the long cigar shaped shiny object that was traveling through our solar system. Could

48
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,880
you start out by explaining exactly what was this Amua that was traveling through our

49
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,560
solar system?

50
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,480
Well, first, also, I should say that I had many years in which I worked on other topics

51
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:18,000
of, for example, how did the first stars from the universe, the first light, which is

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,760
mentioned actually in the first chapter of the Old Testament, the Bible, how was the

53
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,880
first light generated in the early universe? And we can now address it with scientific

54
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,800
means. And I also worked on black holes for many years.

55
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,080
And the topic of the search for life or intelligent life in particular came to my attention

56
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,320
only over the past few years. And I'm actually in addition to the popular level book, we're

57
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,360
about to publish with a former postdoc of mine a textbook of a thousand pages long that

58
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,280
will be published in June 2021 that will include the foundation for future research on

59
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:04,240
this subject. And so I see it as the most exciting frontier that will that should

60
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,920
occupy center stage within the mainstream of astronomy in the future.

61
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,320
Unfortunately, right now, it's pushed to be at the periphery.

62
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,040
And and we can talk about that.

63
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,840
So let me come back to your question.

64
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
And that is Oumuamua.

65
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:27,600
This object was spotted in October 2017 by the Panstars Observatory in Hawaii, which

66
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,000
was tasked to look for objects that may come close to Earth because they could endanger

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,880
us. Congress gave this task to NASA to find 90 percent of all the objects that are larger

68
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,600
than 140 meters that get close to Earth so that we can protect ourselves by deflecting

69
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,920
them if they are too dangerous.

70
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,600
You know that the dinosaurs died as a result of a big rock.

71
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,560
I heard that. And they didn't have astronomers to warn them.

72
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,080
That's that's the point. So we have telescopes we can tell in advance if an object is

73
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,600
approaching us and devise methods to prevent that from happening.

74
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,880
So at any event, the Panstar started this process of identifying objects.

75
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:21,640
And in the process of surveying the sky, found Oumuamua, which is the very first object

76
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,760
that we spotted near the Earth that came from outside the solar system.

77
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,080
And you could tell that based on the fact that it moved too fast to be bound by the

78
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,320
sun. So it suddenly came from outside and it was given the name Oumuamua because it

79
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,880
means in the Hawaiian language, a scout or a messenger from far away.

80
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,000
The astronomers at first, of course, assumed that it's just like all the rocks that we

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,440
identified in the solar system.

82
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,360
So it probably is a comet because most of the objects are a rock covered with ice and

83
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,040
they reside in the outer parts of the solar system.

84
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,200
And the same kind of objects may exist near other stars and get ejected from those

85
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,040
environments and reach us.

86
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,720
But the problem was that there was no cometary tail.

87
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,360
We couldn't see any gas trailing the object.

88
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,320
Visually, we couldn't see it, but also the Spitzer Space Telescope looked for any traces

89
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,760
of carbon based molecules, couldn't see it.

90
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,880
So it was clearly not a comet.

91
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,280
But yet, at the same time, it exhibited an extra push away from the sun that is often

92
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,720
associated with evaporation of gas from a comet.

93
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,360
But since it wasn't a comet, the question was what gives it this extra push?

94
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,280
And I suggested that it may be the reflection of sunlight.

95
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,560
And for that purpose, the object had to be quite thin and not naturally produced.

96
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:00,120
It has to be something like a sail that you find on a boat, which in the case of a boat

97
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,480
reflects the wind.

98
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,280
But in the case of the sun, we're talking about the sail that reflects light and can

99
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,400
be pushed. This is called a light sail.

100
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,200
And it's a technology that we are currently developing for propulsion of

101
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,880
spacecrafts in space.

102
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,760
And the advantage is that the spacecraft doesn't need to carry its fuel.

103
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,200
It's just being pushed by light.

104
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,720
I should say there was another object identified in September 2020 just a few months

105
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,800
ago that exhibited also an extra push away from the sun.

106
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,720
And in addition to the sun's gravitational force and didn't show any cometary

107
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,480
tail. Turns out that this one was a rocket booster from 1966, a lunar lander

108
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,720
Surveyor 2 mission that was launched by NASA.

109
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,880
And it was simply hollow and thin.

110
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,120
And that's why it was pushed by reflecting sunlight.

111
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,000
So we know in that case that the object was artificial in origin because we produced

112
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,560
it. In the case of Oumuamua, we don't know who produced it.

113
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,240
And the other thing I should say is that from the reflected light that Oumuamua

114
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,840
showed, as it was tumbling, it was tumbling over eight hours, roughly the size of a

115
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,560
football field, from the amount of reflected sunlight, we could tell that it's

116
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,840
most likely flat, not cigar shaped.

117
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,440
And also that it's very extreme in terms of its geometry.

118
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,040
It's much longer than it is wide when projected on the sky.

119
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,360
And that fits the bill in terms of it potentially being a thin surface.

120
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,760
So have you seen on a lot of the articles online, have you seen some of the

121
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,320
renderings that they've created of it?

122
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,440
Oh, yeah. So the most popular rendering is that of a cigar shaped object.

123
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,160
And that is incorrect based on the evidence we have.

124
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,080
And the most likely shape is disc shape or pancake shape.

125
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,720
Interesting. And how far away is it from the Earth?

126
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,320
Oh, right now it's beyond the distance of Jupiter.

127
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,080
And so it's actually right now a million times fainter than when it was close to

128
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,240
the sun because it dims very rapidly such an object because the amount of

129
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,880
sunlight impinging on its surface drops inversely with distance squared.

130
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,400
And then the amount of light we see reflected from it drops by another factor

131
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,040
of one of a distance squared. So altogether, the object dims inversely

132
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,960
with distance to the fourth power, which is very quickly.

133
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,320
So by now, we can't really see it anymore.

134
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,200
And therefore, we cannot even design a mission that will chase it, but we can

135
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,080
search for other objects. You know, when I go to the kitchen and I find an ant by

136
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,000
looking at a small portion of the kitchen, I know that there should be many more ants

137
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,080
out there. And so the conclusion from finding this object is that there should be

138
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,200
many more. If we use the PANSTAS telescope within a few years, we should find another

139
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,400
one. But in fact, in three years, there would be a new survey telescope called the

140
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,680
Vera Rubin Observatory that could then that would be much more sensitive and

141
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,600
therefore could find such an object every month or so.

142
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,480
Right now, the telescope that found this Amuamua, what is the I guess the goal of

143
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,560
that telescope? Is it just like generally blanketing the sky or is it particularly

144
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,400
looking for doomsday asteroids?

145
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:55,360
Yeah. So the latter, it was intended to find those near Earth or objects called

146
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,160
NEOs. But then it just started the job of doing that.

147
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,320
And the Vera Rubin Observatory would then go two thirds of the way towards having a

148
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,040
full census. Congress tasked NASA to find 90 percent, but with the Vera Rubin

149
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,920
Observatory, we find maybe 60 percent of all near Earth objects above 140 meters

150
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:28,040
in size. How how much do astronomers, your colleagues or yourself, how much of your

151
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:34,080
time and focus goes towards worrying about giant Earth killer asteroids?

152
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:44,080
Very little. There is a relatively small community of astronomers that they focus

153
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,400
on on objects within the solar system. And then out of that community, a small

154
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,000
fraction worries about near Earth asteroids.

155
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,080
So it's mainly an observational effort to identify individual objects that may come

156
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,240
close to Earth because we can forecast their orbits using the law of gravity.

157
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:15,000
And so it's sort of a practical matter to monitor and figure out which objects

158
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,480
might come close, monitor the sky.

159
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,280
And we can see objects based on their reflected sunlight.

160
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,880
So the bigger the object is, the easier it is for us to identify it at a greater

161
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,600
distance. And it also depends, of course, on the telescope size and the amount of

162
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,080
light that you can collect within the telescope diameter.

163
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,720
Now, if there was an object that was similar to the one that took out the

164
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,760
dinosaurs that hit the Yucatan, how soon were we able to find it?

165
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,000
And is there anything we could possibly do to alter its course?

166
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,120
Yeah, so the dinosaurs went extinct.

167
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:02,200
And in fact, three quarters of the Earth's life forms were killed in that event.

168
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,560
I mean, there was this giant rock that collided with Earth.

169
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,680
It was roughly the length of Manhattan Island, tens of kilometers.

170
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:19,200
And then as it approached the Earth, probably it was a beautiful sight.

171
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:26,600
But the fun of the dinosaurs stopped when it collided with Earth and caused this huge

172
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:34,360
environmental damage, the Chicxulub crater and sort of a change in the climate of the

173
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,400
Earth because of all the dust that was raised.

174
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,040
But perhaps we owe our existence to that impact because it changed altogether the life

175
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,680
forms that appeared on the surface of the Earth.

176
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:58,360
And then such a big object can be identified far enough for us to plan years in advance

177
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,480
what to do. And there are various ideas about how to deflect it.

178
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:10,240
You can, for example, paint a side of it in a color such that it will reflect or will

179
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,000
evaporate more quickly and then there will be some push on it and that will deflect it

180
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,800
from colliding with the Earth.

181
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,560
You can detonate something on the surface of such an object and that would also push

182
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,200
it aside.

183
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,000
You can shine a laser beam on one side of the object and achieve the same goal.

184
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There are all kinds of...

185
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,960
You can also shepherd it gravitationally with a spacecraft.

186
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,040
All kinds of suggestions for what to do.

187
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,640
It really depends on the size of the object and the composition as to what we want to do.

188
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:55,280
You don't want to, for example, destroy it into a lot of fragments because those fragments

189
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,200
could hit the Earth with a higher chance.

190
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:06,320
During the Gulf War, there was this Patriot missile that intercepted the missiles that

191
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,600
were sent, for example, towards Israel.

192
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,800
At the early version of these Patriot missiles, they just blasted the incoming missile into

193
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,280
pieces and that caused more damage than the original missile would have caused.

194
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,000
So you don't want to do that.

195
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,800
And we will have enough time to make appropriate plans depending on which object is

196
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,920
approaching us.

197
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,400
We will definitely not get extinct as the dinosaurs did.

198
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,520
The human brain, even though it's much smaller than the body of a dinosaur, it's much more

199
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,000
precious for long-term survival.

200
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,280
Now, why is it that you think that you're the first astronomer to come out with some

201
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,440
fascinating stuff like this, talking about the Amuamua and talking about interstellar

202
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,560
potential extraterrestrial objects coming through our solar system?

203
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:06,200
Well, first I should mention that this subject is at the periphery of astronomy.

204
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,880
It's not funded much.

205
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:14,720
And anyone that talks about the search for technological signatures is sort of marginalized,

206
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,120
sometimes to the point where the subject is ridiculed.

207
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:26,240
And that is unfortunate because it doesn't allow new talent to enter the field or to

208
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,040
get funded for doing research in this field.

209
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,120
And it's sort of like stepping on the grass and then saying, look, it doesn't grow.

210
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:42,880
So obviously, we don't get major discoveries or important results because of the

211
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,280
self-fulfilling prophecy that the fact that the community is not supporting it.

212
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,920
And I find this to be completely inappropriate because the public is extremely interested in

213
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,560
the question, are we alone?

214
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,680
I'm interested in the question beyond that, because I think that we are probably not alone.

215
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,200
Half of the sun-like stars have a planet the size of the Earth, roughly at the same separation.

216
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,080
So you have billions of Earth-Sun system just within the Milky Way galaxy, our own galaxy.

217
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,520
And then you have a trillion galaxies like the Milky Way within the observable volume

218
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,080
of the universe.

219
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:23,040
So altogether, there are more Earth-Sun systems than the numbers of grains of sand on all

220
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,280
beaches on Earth.

221
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,760
It's just huge.

222
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,040
And the chance that we are special or unique is really minute.

223
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:38,360
And out of modesty, we should consider the possibility that things like us exist everywhere

224
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,840
as the simplest assumption, the most conservative assumption.

225
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,000
If you replicate the same circumstances, you get the same outcome.

226
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,080
But for some reason, the mainstream community prefers not to think that way and say, maybe

227
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,600
we are unique, maybe we are special.

228
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,000
You need extraordinary evidence in order to argue otherwise.

229
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,640
I would argue that you need extraordinary evidence to assume that we are unique, because

230
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,080
whenever we thought that we are special, we were wrong in the past.

231
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,600
We thought that we are the center of the universe.

232
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,640
Aristotle suggested that in his philosophy.

233
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,200
And for a thousand years, people believed it until Copernicus and Galileo demonstrated

234
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,840
that the Earth moves around the sun.

235
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,080
And even then, the philosophers at the time didn't like the idea.

236
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,200
They didn't look through Galileo's telescope.

237
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,400
And they just maintained their ignorance.

238
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,040
That reality doesn't care about whether we ignore it or not.

239
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,840
And whenever we assume that we are unique and special, we were wrong.

240
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,360
It's sort of like my daughters when they were infants.

241
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,600
They thought that they are unique, they have qualities that nobody else has.

242
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,520
And they're at the center of the world.

243
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,800
But once they went to a kindergarten, they saw other kids and they got a better perspective.

244
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,840
So for us, as the human species, as civilization, to mature, we need to find others and get

245
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,520
a better perspective about our place in the universe.

246
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:15,480
But many people prefer, you know, it flatters their ego to maintain the view that we are

247
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,320
alone until proven differently.

248
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,280
And I find that to be completely opposite to where they should be.

249
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,640
But by preventing any research in this subject, by ridiculing suggestions that we might not

250
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,760
be alone, you know, you don't get anyone to work on that.

251
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,640
And that's why I'm sort of alone standing against this mainstream.

252
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,400
And I should say, you know, I'm not an outlier.

253
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,200
I've worked in the mainstream for many years.

254
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,520
I had a lot of leadership positions.

255
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:56,320
I was the longest serving chair of the astronomy department at Harvard between 2011 to 2020.

256
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,200
Nine years, a position that was renewed twice.

257
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,760
And I'm the chair of the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the National Academies.

258
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,920
And at the same time, I think that the current view is misguided.

259
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,840
And I think that this subject appeals to the public and the public funds science.

260
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,840
And therefore, we have an obligation to address it with the existing tools that we have,

261
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,640
telescopes and instruments.

262
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,200
And we can do it.

263
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,480
Just to give you an example, you know, the astronomers are developing the next generation

264
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,920
of instruments to search for and these would cost billions of dollars to search for oxygen,

265
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,640
for example, in the atmospheres of planets around other stars.

266
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,000
Because the idea is that oxygen will tell us if there is life on these planets around

267
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,520
other stars.

268
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:55,520
The problem with this idea is that oxygen was rare, did not exist in the Earth atmosphere

269
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,400
at noticeable levels for two billion years, for half of the lifetime of the Earth.

270
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,680
For the first two billion years, there wasn't much oxygen in the atmosphere.

271
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,120
But there was life on Earth.

272
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,640
There were microbes.

273
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,360
So not finding oxygen is not evidence that life doesn't exist.

274
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,000
Also finding oxygen is not evidence that life exists because you can make it by natural

275
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
processes.

276
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,440
And if you ask yourself what would be a conclusive signature of life is if we find industrial

277
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,060
pollution in those atmospheres.

278
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:34,400
Those molecules that are very complex and are produced by the industries that we have

279
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,920
or by refrigerating systems, they are called CFCs.

280
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,840
If we do find evidence for those, then we know that life must exist.

281
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,000
So in fact, the justification to the future, the next generation of instruments that astronomers

282
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,440
are developing is much stronger in the context of the search for technological signatures

283
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,000
than it is in the search for primitive life.

284
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,120
But nevertheless, you would never find an argument or a motivation for these instruments

285
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,360
in that context.

286
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,320
What sort of conversations have you had or debates have you had with your colleagues

287
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,280
or other astronomers when it comes to the pushback that you've received from being outspoken

288
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,160
about things like this and the Oumuamua and intelligent life?

289
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,840
Well, I can give you an example.

290
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,680
There was a seminar about the Oumuamua at Harvard.

291
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,400
When I left the room with a colleague of mine that worked on the solar system for decades,

292
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:35,440
he said, this object is so weird, I wish it never existed.

293
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,280
And that illustrates to you that the properties of this object take people away from their

294
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
comfort zone.

295
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:53,560
And most people prefer not to change their views and not to update what they thought

296
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:59,600
to be the worldview that describes the universe.

297
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,320
And it's sort of like a GPS system when it gets to a place that it doesn't recognize,

298
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,240
it says recalculating.

299
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,680
And unfortunately, most of my colleagues do not recalculate, they just want to maintain

300
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
their views.

301
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:20,320
So most of the mainstream would simply say, business as usual.

302
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,400
I don't care about the details.

303
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,440
It must be a rock.

304
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,480
To me, that sounds just like a caveman saying that when presented with a cell phone, you

305
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,240
know, the caveman is used to playing with rocks all of his life, saying, oh, the cell

306
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,640
phone is just a shiny rock.

307
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:49,240
And the point of the matter is since I don't find technological signatures as speculation,

308
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,440
I think it should be contemplated as a real possibility put on the table and then, you

309
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,480
know, one can gather more evidence to try and see if indeed it's consistent with that

310
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,160
and it should not be dismissed upfront.

311
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:12,680
And so I think there needs to be a revision in the culture right now within the academic

312
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
community.

313
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,480
There are also parts of, for example, physics, the physics community, theoretical physics,

314
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,920
that engage in concepts that cannot be tested experimentally, such as extra dimensions or

315
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:33,240
the multiverse or supersymmetry or string theory.

316
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,680
These are concepts that were not yet proven to be correct based on experimental evidence.

317
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,960
They are highly speculative and for decades people have been working on them and doing

318
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,720
mathematical gymnastics or about demonstrating how smart they are.

319
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,400
But you know, doing physics is not about showing off as being smart.

320
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,840
It's about understanding reality, understanding nature.

321
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,160
And if you're trying to do that, you should be guided by evidence.

322
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:08,080
Yeah, I mean, there's tons of money that goes into things like the LHC that they go to find

323
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,160
the Higgs boson and all those other things.

324
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,480
It's amazing that I would imagine, and correct me if I'm wrong, the number one thing on the

325
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,000
checklist of reasons to become an astronomer would be to find extraterrestrial life or

326
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,920
to find something out there.

327
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:30,320
Well, in fact, a lot of physicists would say that they were attracted to doing physics

328
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,320
because they read some science fiction stories.

329
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,400
And I think that this is the most exciting question for us to address because it will

330
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,880
change our perspective about our place in the universe, our aspirations for space.

331
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:50,440
And it could impact many things we do, including religious beliefs.

332
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:57,400
You know, and so I think it's just a missed opportunity for scientists if they have the

333
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,640
tools to address this question and search for technological signatures, not to do that.

334
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,320
And that's why I speak out loud and I use Oumuamua as an anchor to demonstrate

335
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,360
that here is an anomalous object that didn't look like anything we have seen before.

336
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:21,320
And all of the mainstream suggestions for why it looks so weird also invoked something

337
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,720
that we have never seen before, you know, a hydrogen iceberg or a cloud of dust.

338
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,960
And given that we are entertaining possibilities that were never seen before, why not also

339
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,280
a technological origin?

340
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,000
It's sort of like, you know, walking on the beach and most of the time you see rocks or

341
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,600
seashells, but every now and then you stumble across a plastic bottle that indicates that

342
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
the civilization might be around.

343
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,440
So how did you first come across this Oumuamua?

344
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,360
Well, I heard about it when it was discovered on October 19th, 2017.

345
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:07,400
After a week or so, it became quite intriguing in the sense that, you know, we realized it's

346
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,120
the first interstellar object, looks a little bit strange in terms of its shape.

347
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:23,000
And so I had a discussion with Yuri Milner, a Russian-Israeli science founder in Silicon Valley

348
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:32,200
about using radio telescopes to which he had access through a project called Breakthrough Listen

349
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,800
and trying to see if there is any radio signal coming from this object.

350
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,360
We checked it and put an upper limit of roughly the transmission of a cell phone.

351
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,040
So clearly, Oumuamua was not transmitting at the frequencies that we were looking at,

352
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,640
the radio frequencies.

353
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,240
It could have been transmitting at other frequencies, could have been transmitting in

354
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,800
a different direction, but we ruled out the possibility that anything in our direction was

355
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,320
more than the power of a cell phone.

356
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,480
And so at that point, you know, I thought, well, it must be probably natural.

357
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:16,920
But then six months later, there was the report about it showing, exhibiting an extra push away

358
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,720
from the sun.

359
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,680
And that could not be explained in terms of a cometary tale because we haven't seen any.

360
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,240
And at that point, you know, that was the straw that broke the camel's back in my vocabulary

361
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,680
in terms of me saying to myself, look, it's so unusual.

362
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,640
Maybe we should look for something out of the box to explain it.

363
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,280
And I wrote a couple of articles in Scientific American talking about it being a technological

364
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,600
artifact or relic, and then wrote a scientific paper about it in October 2018.

365
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,040
That got a lot of attention.

366
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,560
We didn't have any press release.

367
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,480
It just became viral in the media.

368
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,280
And after that, I wrote a number of papers on Oumuamua and its implications.

369
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,400
So you mentioned it was moving away from the sun.

370
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,280
Well, when we discovered it, it was already receding away from us.

371
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,760
Yes.

372
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,840
It's sort of like having a guest for dinner and realizing that the guest is interesting

373
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,080
when the guest goes out the front door into the dark street.

374
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,680
And that was unfortunate because we couldn't chase it at that point.

375
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,440
If we were to discover it in July instead of October.

376
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,480
And by the way, I was visiting that observatory,

377
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,640
the Pan-Stars Observatory on Mount Haleakala in Maui.

378
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:47,240
Just around that time, July 2017, with my family, we were on vacation in Maui.

379
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,160
And I gave a seminar there.

380
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,680
And at the time, nobody knew about Oumuamua.

381
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:58,520
If we were to know about it, then we could have contemplating sending out a spacecraft

382
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,240
equipped with a camera along its path and then getting a better view of what it looks like.

383
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,720
Unfortunately, we didn't know.

384
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,240
And so it was too late for us to chase it afterwards.

385
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,600
And the moral of this story is that if we find another weird object in the future

386
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:25,400
on its approach to us, we better send a camera that will take a photograph of it.

387
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,880
And, you know, a picture is worth a thousand words.

388
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,240
Right.

389
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,160
Now, is that something that you think we'll be able to do

390
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,720
next time one of these is coming close to us?

391
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,040
Yeah, I think it's quite possible.

392
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,520
And science is all about the evidence and it's about reproducibility,

393
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,600
the ability to study something again and again when it repeats.

394
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,840
And in this case, given the fact that Pan-Stars looked,

395
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,440
surveyed the sky for a few years before it discovered this object,

396
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,160
we should definitely find another one that looks like it within a few years from now.

397
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,800
Because otherwise, it's very unlikely that we found a rare object just within a few years.

398
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,680
Now, what were the main differences between this and other things that you see,

399
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,080
like asteroids or comets or something like that?

400
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,840
Obviously, the shape was different.

401
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,720
And yeah, the shape was more extreme.

402
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,240
It was projected on the sky 10 times longer than it is wide.

403
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:32,920
And imagine a piece of paper tumbling in the wind, even if it's razor thin,

404
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,600
the chance of it being exactly edge on is very small.

405
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,080
So most of the time, it would change the amount of area that you see.

406
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,520
But the change by a factor of 10 or more is quite extreme.

407
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:50,360
And the second is that we infer that it's most likely flat based on the

408
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,480
amount of light that it reflected as it was tumbling.

409
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,280
What do you think it was?

410
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,440
What do you think it legitimately was?

411
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,880
Well, I think it was probably a very thin object, artificially produced,

412
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,800
and probably dysfunctional, not something that is being used for spying on us or some other purpose.

413
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,480
Simply because it was tumbling, it was out of control in a way.

414
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:22,040
But also, if you think about it, we sent out Voyager 1, Voyager 2, New Horizons,

415
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,640
all kinds of space junk.

416
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,120
And a million years from now, all of this will be real junk

417
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,840
in the sense that it will not be functional anymore.

418
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,920
So if you wait for long times, these objects that are being sent into space

419
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,560
may not continue to be functional.

420
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,840
They don't have enough energy supply to keep them functional.

421
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,360
And there might be a lot of them floating in space,

422
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,360
just like plastic bottles in the ocean that are swept ashore.

423
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,320
And we find them every now and then.

424
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,400
So it's sort of like waste filling up interstellar space.

425
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
And every now and then, we will bump into one.

426
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,320
Now, could you define exactly what interstellar...

427
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,640
Does that mean not bound to the sun?

428
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,360
Well, yeah, interstellar...

429
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,440
Well, more generally, interstellar means between stars.

430
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,080
And in this...

431
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:21,320
So in this context, you can say Oumuamua came from the space between stars.

432
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,760
It came into the solar system from outside the solar system.

433
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,480
The question about its origin is not answered,

434
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,720
because we don't know where it came from.

435
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,120
It was actually...

436
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,880
Another weird fact about it is that it was situated in a special frame of reference.

437
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,240
It was in the local standard of rest,

438
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,760
which is the frame that you get to when you average

439
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,880
over the motions of all the stars in the vicinity of the sun.

440
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,440
And Oumuamua was at rest in that frame.

441
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,280
So it's sort of like finding a car that is parked at rest in a public parking lot.

442
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,800
You cannot really tell which house it came from,

443
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,080
because all the stars, in the case of the local standard of rest,

444
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,520
all the local stars are moving relative to that frame.

445
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,760
Only one in 500 stars is so much at rest,

446
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,720
relative to the local standard of rest, as Oumuamua was.

447
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,840
One way to think about it, it was like a beauty sitting on the surface of the ocean,

448
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,240
and the solar system bumped into it,

449
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,120
because the sun is moving relative to that frame.

450
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,480
And you may ask what purpose does it serve being in that special frame?

451
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,840
You know, one possibility is that there is a grid of such objects,

452
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,120
and they serve as road posts.

453
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,200
When you navigate through interstellar space,

454
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,760
you can find your coordinates where you are relative to those objects.

455
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,640
Another possibility is that it's a relay station for communication,

456
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:57,560
that you don't need to communicate across large distances,

457
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,760
you just communicate by the signal hopping from one relay station to the next.

458
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,000
We use this approach on Earth.

459
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,560
Now, what did you say the name of the telescope that was being,

460
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,160
the new telescope, the billion-dollar...

461
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,000
Vera Rubin.

462
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,040
Oh, the name of the telescope that we survey the sky, you mean?

463
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,680
You mentioned that there was like a billion-dollar telescope being built in Chile.

464
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,760
Well, there is the Vera Rubin Observatory that will be much more sensitive than

465
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,440
the Pan-Stars Telescope that discovered Oumuamua in Hawaii,

466
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,440
and it will be in Chile, yes.

467
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,880
Okay, and the primary focus of that will be to

468
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,800
discover these things before it's too late.

469
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:46,360
Yeah, discover near-Earth objects with much greater sensitivity than Pan-Stars,

470
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:54,520
and it will be able to find about two-thirds of those that the Congress tasked NASA to find,

471
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,960
you know, so 60% of the entire population.

472
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,040
What are your opinions on, in the recent year or two,

473
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,000
all of the different, you know, there's been Air Force pilots based in San Diego

474
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,840
that have come out and they've had their videos of these UFOs coming out of the water

475
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,800
and within one second being meters away.

476
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,000
Do you guys pay any attention to that stuff?

477
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,800
Well, I do. I mean, I cannot speak for others.

478
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:28,360
And my view on these reports, these eyewitness reports of unidentified flying objects,

479
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:36,440
UFOs that are unusual, my view is that these eyewitness testimonies come from

480
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,280
people that are not scientists, that were not planning to find these unusual things,

481
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,480
and we will be better served if we were to deploy scientific instruments

482
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,440
in those sites and monitor the environment.

483
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:58,040
You know, I have two concerns about these reports of UFOs over the past decades.

484
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,320
One of them is that now we have cameras and recording devices

485
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,960
that are far better than we had decades ago.

486
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,880
And back then, you know, the images were fuzzy

487
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,760
and it was difficult to be sure what it means and so forth.

488
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,440
But with present-day instruments, it should be crisp clear.

489
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,200
They are much better than we used to have

490
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,960
and they are still fuzzy and, you know, on the margin of believability.

491
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,960
The second reservation that they have is there are far many more cameras

492
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:36,040
available to monitor environments right now by orders of magnitude.

493
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,040
You know, people have cell phones, you have drones,

494
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:47,240
you have cameras on satellites, on airplanes, in the streets of cities.

495
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,160
And the number of video cameras looking at what's going on

496
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,680
is many orders of magnitude larger than it used to be a decade or two ago.

497
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,640
Nevertheless, the reports on UFOs have not increased.

498
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,800
So that concerns me that maybe, you know, all of these reports were sort of

499
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,920
artifacts of the instruments that were used or impressions of natural phenomena.

500
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,320
But I think that it would be appropriate to deploy

501
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,480
scientific instruments and check it out.

502
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,880
It's really, I mean, science is about reproducibility of results.

503
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,440
So one-time events are not believable in science.

504
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,680
You should be able to reproduce them by being in the same environment

505
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,280
under similar circumstances.

506
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,800
And I would trust instruments recording these events.

507
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:45,320
You know, there is this biblical story from the Old Testament about Abraham

508
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:53,640
that heard the voice of God and that voice told Abraham to sacrifice his only son, Isaac.

509
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,800
And imagine Abraham having a cell phone with a voice memo up.

510
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,320
If he could have pressed the button, he would have recorded the voice of God.

511
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,640
And then instead of an eyewitness testimony, we would have the recording

512
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,800
and that would have convinced all of humanity that God exists.

513
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,440
And so my point is that by recording things on instruments,

514
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,640
you get a much more objective evidence than all these reports that are now being

515
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,440
declassified from the Pentagon and so forth.

516
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,920
We should not obsess with these old reports that were based on either eyewitnesses

517
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,000
or instruments that are much more inferior to the instruments we have now.

518
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,960
We should simply use our best instruments, go to these sites,

519
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,120
and see whether we see anything unusual.

520
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,680
Well, the Pentagon actually said that they were in possession of some sort of

521
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,240
extraterrestrial craft in the New York Times article.

522
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,840
Well, what I'm saying is that it's better.

523
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,640
You know, Abraham said that he heard the voice of God, right?

524
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,960
So the question is, do you believe Abraham or not?

525
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,960
I'm saying if he had a cell phone, we could have looked at the evidence.

526
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,560
He didn't have that.

527
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,600
And then you have to decide whether you believe the biblical story or not.

528
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,960
And the same is true here.

529
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,080
People report things and I don't know whether to believe them.

530
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,600
So the only way for me to believe them, scientifically speaking,

531
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,960
is to deploy recording devices in the same sites and see if they find something.

532
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,880
What is your opinion on humans and how long we're going to be here on Earth?

533
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,240
Do you think we're ever going to have to leave Earth?

534
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,320
Oh, yeah, definitely.

535
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,760
Currently, all our eggs are in one basket and everything that is precious to us

536
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,160
could get eliminated, extinct if something catastrophic happens on Earth.

537
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:56,680
If an asteroid impacts us or if there is, for example,

538
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,760
a nuclear war or a climate change or something catastrophic.

539
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,600
And it would make much more sense to spread our eggs in different baskets

540
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:15,480
and go somewhere else as well and have duplicates of what we hold important and valuable here.

541
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,880
It's sort of like the Gutenberg printing press.

542
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,120
There were very few copies of the Bible before the printing press was invented.

543
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,160
Then they were all handwritten and each of them was extremely precious.

544
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,200
But once the printing press came to exist, there were many more copies.

545
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,360
And if something bad happened to one of them, it wasn't a catastrophe.

546
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,960
You could make new ones.

547
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,400
And then we can imagine saving life as we know it on Earth.

548
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:55,480
And the approach would be similar to what Noah did in the biblical story of Noah's Ark.

549
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,440
There is the story about the great flood that endangered life on Earth.

550
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:07,880
And so Noah decided to build an ark and put animals in it so that it will save them.

551
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,600
We can, in principle, design a similar approach and build

552
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,040
Noah's spaceship that will save life on Earth.

553
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,680
But we don't need to put elephants and whales on it.

554
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,840
We just need to put the computer and a 3D printer.

555
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,800
And if the computer has the information about the DNA of all life forms that we care about,

556
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,800
then this system can go to another planet.

557
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,920
And in principle, it could make the life as we know it out of the raw materials

558
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,720
that exist there on another planet.

559
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,280
You don't need to bring the life with you.

560
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,680
You can recreate them as long as we figure out how to make synthetic life.

561
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:59,480
And that's not speculative because people are, as we speak,

562
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,920
people are trying to produce synthetic life in the laboratory.

563
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,440
And so I wouldn't be surprised if within the next few decades we will be able to do that.

564
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,480
And so once we are able to do that, we can potentially produce life on other planets

565
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:22,040
without carrying it from Earth and just using what we know about the genetics and so forth

566
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,480
in making that life over there out of the raw materials there.

567
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,640
How long do you think it would be before we would have to do that?

568
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,600
Oh, that depends on us.

569
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,920
How quickly we inflict the wounds on ourselves.

570
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,840
If we are not smart enough, we might not survive for more than a few centuries from now.

571
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,880
We started developing our technologies about a century ago.

572
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:55,960
And our technologies are advancing exponentially with a characteristic timescale of a few years.

573
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,120
So it's quite possible that within the next century,

574
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,400
unless we are careful, we could develop technologies that will destroy us.

575
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,960
And we need to be really careful about what we do to the planet, what we do to ourselves.

576
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,320
We don't pay that much attention to it.

577
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,160
Because we are so close to when technology started developing.

578
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:27,400
But once we go a few decades into the future, we will be in a real risk of extinction, I think.

579
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,080
And because there would be technologies that could potentially destroy life on the planet.

580
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,960
And then we just need to be smart enough to avoid that.

581
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:43,320
And right now, I wouldn't say that we are very intelligent in the way we do our politics.

582
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,880
There are lots of conflicts.

583
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:54,360
And we invest most of our efforts in fighting each other among nations and so forth.

584
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,040
And that is not the smart approach.

585
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,320
We should collaborate, especially on issues that science can address.

586
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,080
And you could see that in the context of COVID, right?

587
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,320
So when it started in China, there wasn't much sharing of information.

588
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,880
And science is global.

589
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,960
Science is international.

590
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,240
It's supposed to be a mode of collaboration among nations.

591
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,120
And in promoting a better future for humanity.

592
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,400
And I very much hope that then ultimately science will prevail

593
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:31,480
and suppress all these tensions among people that really could bring us down.

594
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:38,280
If you look at the World Wars, there was a lot of effort dedicated to killing people.

595
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,120
And that makes no sense whatsoever.

596
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,720
Yeah, I think especially recently, I feel like the internet has really

597
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,800
made everything in this world so much more transparent.

598
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,800
And I think there's a big paradigm shift happening, especially with the recent news.

599
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,880
I'm sure you've heard the GameStop stocks, the people online that were buying the stocks

600
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,400
that the hedge funds bet against.

601
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:09,800
And 10 years ago, this is something no one understood hedge funds

602
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:15,720
or the stock market or what these bets on them failing even were.

603
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,800
And people were able to benefit off that and essentially create this massive gap,

604
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,520
this massive gap between the billionaires on Wall Street

605
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,080
and the average working person, blue collar worker.

606
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,240
And now it's becoming the internet has made this so much more transparent.

607
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,320
I feel like this is something that has to happen with science.

608
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,480
You can somehow correlate it to what's happening with what you're doing.

609
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,080
And now you released your book and you're talking to everybody about it.

610
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,720
Well, one thing I would like to highlight in this context is we tend to think that

611
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,800
technology and science is superior to the humanities.

612
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,320
So humanities are in decline, the study of philosophies,

613
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,000
the study of literature and so forth.

614
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,840
Young people are more attracted to science and technology.

615
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:14,280
The problem is that we develop tools using science and technology that could destroy us.

616
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,240
And the only way to prevent it is to have the humanists

617
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,120
telling us how to guide ourselves towards a better future.

618
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,440
For example, how to set the rules such that genetic engineering

619
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,680
will not end up making people the type that we want

620
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:40,200
and all kinds of other issues that come up, like artificial intelligence.

621
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:46,920
If we allow it to make life-death decisions on medical issues,

622
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,240
we have to worry about the morality of that.

623
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:57,000
And at what level do we allow the machine to decide the fate of a person

624
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,880
versus having people involved?

625
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,360
In the past, it was the doctor that made the decision.

626
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You could trust the doctor better because the doctor would be a human

627
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,920
that has a bigger perspective, that is more balanced in a way.

628
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,960
If you have a machine deciding, you have to decide about a set of rules

629
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:24,120
of what's moral and what's ethical and how the machine decides who dies and who lives.

630
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,760
There are lots of such issues with modern technologies.

631
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,840
The humanities, the way I see it, play a central role.

632
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,960
As a young kid, I was mostly interested in philosophy.

633
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:44,360
I grew up on a farm, and then circumstances brought me into physics and astrophysics.

634
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:51,640
But I value these areas of humanities, like philosophy, very much.

635
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,640
I think they are essential for guiding us to a better future.

636
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:02,840
Without them, we could be nerds developing all kinds of tools that will kill us as a civilization.

637
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,760
How did you transition from studying things like black holes

638
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,440
to studying what you're studying now?

639
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,720
How did you make that transition?

640
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,600
It was by chance.

641
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,720
For example, I was studying the first generation of stars in the universe,

642
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,000
the first stars that formed, that lit up in the universe early on.

643
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,920
Those stars had an impact on their environment.

644
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,680
They basically broke the hydrogen atoms around them into their constituent electrons and protons.

645
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,080
If you want to see the scars left by the first stars on their environment,

646
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,480
you want to image the hydrogen around them.

647
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,160
Hydrogen emits faint radio waves.

648
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:55,160
Therefore, I worked on a frontier that tries to map the hydrogen in the early universe.

649
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,840
For that purpose, you need to develop radio observatories.

650
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:06,680
Observatories that are sensitive at radio frequencies of around 100 to 200 megahertz.

651
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:14,440
It so happens that these radio observatories operated exactly the same frequency band as

652
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,000
FM radio stations and TV stations.

653
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:23,720
One concern was that there would be interference from TV and radio stations on Earth.

654
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,280
Then it occurred to me that the same observatories could, in principle,

655
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,800
eavesdrop on another civilization, on a planet around another star,

656
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,880
that transmits those radio waves.

657
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,480
I wrote a paper about it.

658
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,920
That was my first encounter with a search for technological signatures.

659
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:47,480
I visited Abu Dhabi for the inauguration of a new campus for NYU.

660
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,440
That was around 2012 or so.

661
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:01,240
When we went around, the tour guide was bragging that the city lights

662
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,800
there are visible from the moon.

663
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,560
They're so bright.

664
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:12,760
That gave me the idea of checking how far can you see a city

665
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,080
with the Hubble Space Telescope, for example.

666
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,520
We found with Ed Turner, a collaborator of mine,

667
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:23,480
that in principle, the Hubble Space Telescope can see a city like Tokyo

668
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:30,040
on Pluto, the edge of the solar system of planets.

669
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,720
That was an interesting idea, that you can look for artificial lights

670
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,800
as a signature of another civilization.

671
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,880
You can identify these artificial lights, not as reflected sunlight,

672
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:49,160
by the way the source dims as it changes its distance from us.

673
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,960
That was my second paper.

674
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,440
Then the third one on this subject was when astronomers talked about

675
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,960
searching for biological signatures in the atmospheres of planets.

676
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,360
If you look for industrial pollution, that would imply

677
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,440
there is an industrial civilization there.

678
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,840
I wrote a paper about that.

679
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,200
Gradually, it drifted in this direction.

680
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,400
That was 2015.

681
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,400
Over the past few years, especially because of Oumuamua,

682
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,120
I published a lot on this subject.

683
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,600
In about half a year, I will have a textbook out of more than a thousand

684
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,840
pages with my former postdoc, Manas Vilinga,

685
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,000
that lays the foundation for future studies on this subject

686
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,840
of the search for both primitive and intelligent life.

687
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,320
You mentioned earlier when you were talking about 3D printing

688
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,520
and printing organisms or basically duplicating ourselves on other planets.

689
00:54:54,280 --> 00:55:00,200
Now, I've heard reports of people who have worked at S1 and Area 51

690
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,560
have obtained crafts that are very small,

691
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,760
saying that only really tiny beings that have no reproductive organs.

692
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:19,640
Is it possible that other beings are printing these sort of cadavers

693
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:27,880
or basically like humanoids, but aliens,

694
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,600
that can travel long distances through different solar systems

695
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,840
that don't have to stay alive, they don't have to eat?

696
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,440
Everything is possible and there are lots of possibilities

697
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,680
outlined in science fiction stories.

698
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,200
The key as a scientist is to look for evidence

699
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,880
and that should guide you as to which possibilities are real

700
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:59,000
and which are illusions or our imagination of what might be out there.

701
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,600
It's sort of like a detective story.

702
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,720
You can have an infinite number of possibilities

703
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,560
and you just sort them out and figure out which one is realized

704
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,680
by collecting clues and evidence.

705
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,120
We could think that we are wealthier than Elon Musk,

706
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,480
we could have a lot of money

707
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,200
and the only way to figure out what we actually have

708
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,760
is to go to an ATM machine and check it out.

709
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,280
And so the ATM machine represents an experiment

710
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,880
where you actually check what you have

711
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:39,000
and that's what guides modern science, evidence and clues.

712
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,800
Many times scientists prefer to have ideas

713
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,920
that do not stand up to the scrutiny of experiments

714
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,400
and that's legitimate as long as the ideas can be tested in principle.

715
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,440
The frustration I have is that some parts of the physics community right now,

716
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,440
you know, there are hundreds of people working on ideas

717
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,320
that will never be tested in their lifetime

718
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,520
and that to me could be a waste of their time

719
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:11,080
because it's imagining things that may not exist.

720
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,320
If we were to go and put ourselves on another planet,

721
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,280
which planet do you think it would be?

722
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,640
Do you think it would be Mars or would it be a Proxima B?

723
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,360
So there are two planets that are closest to us

724
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:29,000
and in principle could have life on them

725
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,920
or we could imagine going there and changing conditions

726
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,600
such that we could live there.

727
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,400
They are Mars and Venus on the two sides of the Earth.

728
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,080
Mars used to have an atmosphere

729
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:47,960
and probably had conditions similar to Earth early on in its life

730
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,360
but then because it's 10 times less massive than the Earth,

731
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,960
it couldn't hold on to its atmosphere so the atmosphere evaporated

732
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:01,640
and then it lost the potential for liquid water on its surface

733
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,960
because you can't have liquid water unless there is an atmospheric pressure

734
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,960
and so even if there was life on Mars it couldn't continue.

735
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,720
There was no liquid water available

736
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:19,560
and the Perseverance mission will actually get there in February 2021

737
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,800
in less than a few weeks actually

738
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,400
and we'll figure out whether there was

739
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:35,000
or maybe there is some left over signatures of life in the Martian soil

740
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,560
and so that would be very exciting

741
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:42,440
and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the results from this mission

742
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,040
but then going there for us, for humans,

743
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,200
would require a lot of adaptation

744
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,600
because just standing on the surface of Mars

745
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,920
without an atmosphere, without a strong magnetic field that Mars doesn't have

746
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:04,040
we will be exposed to energetic particles, cosmic rays

747
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,640
that could damage within a year

748
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:10,600
you will have a substantial damage to the cells in your brain

749
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,720
and you need protection from that

750
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,320
and one way to protect our bodies is to go underground

751
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,800
to go into a cave or to build some infrastructure that will protect us

752
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,800
there is not enough attention given to that

753
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:29,000
so just sending humans to Mars without proper protection would be irresponsible

754
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,600
it's sort of like a death sentence

755
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,840
you don't want to do that

756
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,640
so we need to come up with solutions to protect people that go there

757
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,360
but potentially it's a place that we could

758
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:46,360
modify such that we could live there

759
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:50,120
and you can imagine not necessarily going to a planet

760
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,920
you can put some platform in space

761
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,760
we started in the jungles of Africa

762
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,560
and we ended up in apartment buildings in cities

763
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,800
that's a big leap over a period of a hundred thousand years

764
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,040
I don't see the leap from an apartment building

765
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,840
in a city in Manhattan to going to space

766
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:18,440
as big as the leap from Africa to an apartment building

767
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,000
we could do it

768
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,600
it will require some time

769
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,080
but a hundred thousand years is a huge period

770
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,680
over which we will have technologies that are far superior to what we have now

771
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,560
so I'm quite optimistic that we could adapt to living in space

772
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,240
but it will take some time

773
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,000
and then Venus right now on the surface

774
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,680
it went through a greenhouse effect

775
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,920
and the surface is extremely hot

776
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,080
it cannot sustain liquid water

777
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,400
you cannot live on the surface of Venus

778
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,720
there was some suggestion that maybe there is life in the clouds of Venus

779
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,360
so the only way for us to inhabit Venus would be to terraform it

780
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:04,280
to change the condition such that it's not as hot as it is

781
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,800
but then of course we can go to Proxima b

782
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,960
we can go to another star

783
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,120
the nearest star is Proxima Centauri

784
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,760
and it has a habitable planet next to it

785
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,440
and that planet is the star that it has a permanent day side

786
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,800
and a permanent night side

787
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:30,680
and my daughters say that the strip that separates those two sides

788
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,800
is the most would have the highest real estate value

789
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,600
because it will be a permanent sunset strip

790
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,960
and have a house there you can see the sunset forever

791
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:47,400
for dummies like myself who've never heard of Proxima b or Proxima the other one

792
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,840
can you explain where they are and what they are?

793
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,400
yeah Proxima Centauri is a member of a three star system

794
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,520
that is the closest to the sun right now

795
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,520
I mean it will continue to be the closest star system to us

796
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,600
for about a hundred thousand years

797
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,440
so every hundred thousand years or so there is a new star coming closest to us

798
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,280
and then it's passing

799
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,520
and right now Proxima Centauri is the nearest

800
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,480
and it's actually a dwarf star that is only 12 percent of the mass of the sun

801
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,840
so it's much fainter

802
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,920
most of the stars are much smaller and fainter than the sun

803
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,160
so we live next to an unusual star

804
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,440
most of the stars are like Proxima Centauri

805
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:38,280
and it has roughly half the surface temperature that the sun has

806
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:43,720
only 3000 degrees Kelvin compared to almost 6000 that the sun has

807
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,720
and therefore it emits mostly infrared light

808
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,560
the sun emits mostly visible light

809
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,400
that's why our eyes are tuned to visible light

810
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:59,080
but the creatures if there are any creatures on the habitable planet next to Proxima Centauri

811
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,480
they should have infrared eyes

812
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,360
which would be very strange for us to see actually

813
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:09,640
and if there is any grass growing there it will be dark red

814
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:15,560
so if you think about interstellar travel agencies designing trips

815
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:23,720
if most of the living creatures are living near dwarf stars that are the most common

816
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,440
they are used to red to dark red grass

817
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,040
and they will never come to a planet like ours that offers green grass

818
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:37,240
that will not be a desirable tourist destination

819
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,840
because they don't like this color

820
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,920
they enjoy having a vacation on a dark red grass

821
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,600
that may explain why we haven't seen any visitors

822
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:54,440
can you explain a little bit more what would the eyes of the beings on that planet look like

823
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,400
why would they be what would an infrared eye look like?

824
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,200
I don't know it would look shocking to us

825
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,680
it would look very different than our eyes

826
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:11,400
so our eyes were developed over time to take advantage of most of the light produced by the sun

827
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,680
which is visible light

828
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,960
but if you're next to a star that produces mostly infrared radiation

829
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:23,000
then evolution would lead you to be sensitive to that kind of light

830
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,320
this is the kind of light you get from warm objects

831
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:35,480
like soldiers have those goggles that are sensitive to infrared radiation at night

832
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,240
at night there is not much visible light

833
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,520
because you're on the other side of the earth where the sun is not around

834
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,360
but objects are warm enough to emit infrared radiation

835
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,840
and you can see them with these goggles

836
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:55,400
that's what the people that have infrared goggles can see

837
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,520
the heat emitted by bodies that are warm

838
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:07,240
and that's the kind of infrared radiation that the star Proxima Centauri is mostly emitting

839
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:13,080
so of course if we had goggles, infrared goggles, we would see that radiation very clearly

840
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:20,440
but those animals, creatures that may be born there, they have those sensors

841
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,360
infrared sensors that they are born with

842
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,000
because that gives them an evolutionary advantage

843
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:32,360
the reason we have visible light eyes is because it gives us an advantage

844
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,800
we can survive better if we see the light from the sun

845
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,080
because it's reflected off objects so we can protect ourselves

846
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,080
if there is something endangering us

847
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,240
we can avoid that danger by seeing that object

848
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:48,840
and that's why we have sensitivity to visible light

849
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,600
which is the most common type of light near the sun

850
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:58,600
but if we were next to Proxima Centauri, it would not offer us much advantage

851
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,240
and then probably we would not survive

852
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:06,040
and animals that have infrared eyes would survive because they can see the danger

853
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,640
if there is another animal coming to eat them

854
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,760
they would be able to escape because they're sensitive to infrared light

855
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,800
which is the most common form of light in their environment

856
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,880
real quick, I wanted to go back to the mission you just spoke about

857
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,520
that's about to arrive in Mars in a couple weeks now

858
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,160
what is the purpose of that mission?

859
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,080
they're looking specifically for life?

860
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,960
right, so this is the Perseverance mission

861
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,400
and yes, one of the highlights of this mission is to search for signatures of life

862
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:40,120
and there were previous missions going back almost 50 years

863
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:45,400
that had some tentative evidence that perhaps

864
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,240
there is something in the Martian soil

865
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,680
that is going through metabolism that is living

866
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:57,080
because they took a sample of that soil

867
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:02,280
and they noticed that there is some gas coming out of it

868
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,280
that may indicate life

869
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,960
and when they heat that soil to a high temperature

870
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,120
suddenly that goes away

871
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,440
and there was a suggestion that maybe it indicates that there is life in that soil

872
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:20,440
and so the Perseverance mission is equipped with all kinds of instruments

873
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,920
that could then search for life that may exist right now

874
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,440
but also search for life that may have existed before

875
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:36,520
if there were rivers or ponds in the location where Perseverance lands

876
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:43,720
then there might be some leftover signatures of life that may have existed there

877
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,440
we don't know exactly how it might look

878
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,600
it might be skeletons or something else

879
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,080
but the idea is to search for it

880
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,640
and it would be very exciting to see what they find

881
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:59,160
yeah, I mean it sounds like we're doing everything we can possibly do

882
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,600
within our means to do these types of studies

883
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,520
and to try to find extraterrestrial life

884
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,760
and to find out if we're the only ones here or not

885
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,840
well, primitive life I should say

886
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,440
because technological signatures we are not doing enough

887
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,800
that's what I started from

888
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:24,040
I've heard you compare stagnation of the scientific community to technology

889
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,800
or to corporate commercial technology

890
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,800
you know, companies like SpaceX for example

891
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:36,120
which obviously are funded and they generate a profit

892
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:41,720
compared to science and the communities that you're involved in

893
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,920
can you speak a little bit to that?

894
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:50,120
yeah, so one would expect the academic world to take more risks

895
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:53,000
than the commercial world

896
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,200
because companies are mainly focused on making a profit

897
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,280
whereas in academia there is this concept of tenure

898
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:05,240
where the professor has a secure job

899
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:10,600
and the purpose of that was that once you get to that phase

900
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:15,880
you can explore blue sky research and take risks

901
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:21,960
and allow yourself to be wrong if it doesn't end up the way you wanted

902
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,480
unfortunately, most of my colleagues in academia do not take risks

903
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,840
because they want to get honours and awards

904
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,520
and they want to maintain an image of someone that doesn't make mistakes

905
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:39,080
and they build echo chambers that repeat their voice

906
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:44,280
making it louder so that their reputation is improved

907
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,400
but at the same time they don't innovate much

908
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:52,200
because innovation implies taking risks and being wrong sometimes

909
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,360
and at the same time in the commercial sector

910
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:01,560
you find companies as you mentioned like SpaceX or Google or many others

911
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,840
that have groups of people that are thinking

912
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,880
that are taking risks and checking ideas out of the box

913
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,320
and the reason they do that is because they recognise

914
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:18,280
that the next major discovery that will make them a big profit

915
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,200
would come in unexpected directions

916
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:24,280
so they're taking risks because even though some of the directions fail

917
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,760
if one of them ends up being real

918
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,120
it would compensate for all the losses associated with the failed directions

919
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,720
if companies recognise the value of that

920
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,720
academia should have recognised it much more

921
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:42,840
and it's quite unfortunate that there is not as much innovation in academia

922
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,600
as there should be

923
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:49,560
and that's why I'm trying to promote an open mind

924
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,840
in the context that we discussed before

925
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,840
of searching for technological signatures

926
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,880
but more generally I think it's extremely important

927
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,520
for example for federal grants to be given

928
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,880
also to people that have risky propositions

929
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,680
people that consider ideas out of the box

930
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,560
NASA for example very often funds projects

931
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:20,280
that can declare ahead of time what they will discover

932
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,160
what they will find

933
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,440
and that's contradictory to the nature of discovery

934
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,000
very often you discover things that you haven't expected

935
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,480
you cannot tell in advance to the funder what you will find

936
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,560
or else what you're doing is very boring

937
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:38,840
so I think the funding agencies should also allocate

938
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,920
some fraction of their funding to risky propositions

939
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:47,000
to out of the box thinking and allow for that

940
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,400
it all comes together in a culture where innovation

941
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,720
and risk-taking is appreciated

942
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,440
yeah it almost doesn't make sense

943
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,320
it almost seems like somebody like Elon Musk

944
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:03,000
would have way more to lose by venturing outside the box

945
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,280
than a researcher or a scientist would

946
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,040
it seems like they wouldn't have as much to lose

947
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,840
I completely agree but it's human nature

948
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,600
that drives people in academia towards

949
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,560
being less innovative, less risk-taking

950
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,280
because this way they can maintain an image

951
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,840
that makes of someone reputable

952
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,840
so that they get honors and awards

953
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,600
and by the way one way to not make mistakes

954
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,680
is not to put skin in the game

955
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,480
so not to be engaged in predictions

956
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,760
that can be tested experimentally and proven wrong

957
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,480
and that's why you find this culture of people

958
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,360
that work on subjects that are sort of esoteric

959
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,600
have no connection to reality

960
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,920
and cannot be tested experimentally

961
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,160
because that's much more attractive

962
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,160
you can just demonstrate that you are smart

963
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,320
and never be proven wrong

964
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,080
isn't that the point of science to be proven wrong

965
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,840
yes I would argue that

966
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,200
and that's what I argue yes

967
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,960
and that's what I practice

968
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,160
I don't just preach

969
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,360
but it's not easy to change the culture

970
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,560
and I think it should change

971
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,720
and I hope it will change

972
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,240
and my book discusses that

973
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:17,080
as one of the most important messages of the book

974
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,800
so I very much encourage people to have a look in it

975
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,320
and you talk about Einstein as well

976
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,640
yeah I mean Einstein in the last decade of his career

977
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,320
when he was the most experienced

978
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:33,080
and obviously he was the leading scientist of his generation

979
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,080
made three mistakes

980
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,000
and these were major mistakes

981
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,760
that we now know are completely wrong based on experiments

982
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,080
you know we detected gravitational waves

983
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,520
and he claimed they don't exist

984
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,200
we detected black holes

985
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,480
he claimed they don't exist

986
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:53,080
we also detected spooky action at a distance

987
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,120
in quantum mechanics

988
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,560
and he claimed it doesn't exist

989
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,760
but that's part of being at the frontier

990
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,120
you never know in advance

991
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,600
what is the right direction

992
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,520
and even if you are the smartest person around

993
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,960
like Einstein was

994
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,000
you make mistakes

995
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,760
and that should be tolerated

996
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,520
because if you look at Einstein

997
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,160
you know he also made important breakthroughs

998
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,480
at the same time or before that time

999
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,120
and so the other thing is

1000
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,040
his generation was putting skin in the game

1001
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,720
you know he was making predictions

1002
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,720
and they were tested

1003
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:32,440
the current generation wants to always be valued as smart

1004
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,520
without putting any skin in the game

1005
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,840
so they you know a lot of physicists

1006
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,120
theoretical physicists

1007
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,960
are doing intellectual gymnastics

1008
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,360
they're using sophisticated mathematics

1009
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,560
and that serves the role of demonstrating they're smart

1010
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,720
but it doesn't necessarily describe nature

1011
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,400
do you think some of the reason

1012
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,160
that you're getting a lot of backlash

1013
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:55,560
is because people are threatened

1014
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,080
by you coming out and talking about this

1015
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,720
maybe they see Avi getting all this attention

1016
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,680
and talking about this

1017
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,760
but they've never gotten this amount of attention

1018
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,680
from anyone about any of their ideas

1019
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,040
well one aspect of that is jealousy of course

1020
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,000
for that attention

1021
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,080
but another one is because I address

1022
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,240
my main message is that we should be modest

1023
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,160
that science is a learning experience

1024
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,720
and that making mistakes is okay

1025
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,640
that's part of the scientific process

1026
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,360
you know we should be just like kids

1027
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,880
trying to understand the world

1028
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:29,400
and willing to not be so attached to our egos

1029
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,600
so I'm trying to remove that connection

1030
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,840
between the ego of a scientist

1031
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,080
and the profession

1032
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,920
you know we are trying to understand nature

1033
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,320
we should engage in a dialogue with experiments

1034
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:46,440
we should not consider it as an evaluation of our abilities

1035
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,960
it's not about us

1036
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,040
it's about understanding nature

1037
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,280
and it's a dialogue with experiments

1038
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:56,360
and we just have to start from a point of modesty

1039
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,160
you know and that modesty is communicated to us

1040
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,200
by looking at the universe

1041
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,800
you know we are so small

1042
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,560
we are so short-lived

1043
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,160
how can anyone be arrogant

1044
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,680
okay that makes no sense to me

1045
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,000
how can anyone be racist

1046
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,680
you know that also makes no sense to me

1047
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,760
because just based on the color of his skin

1048
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,680
you decide what the person is

1049
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,960
I mean that's completely ridiculous

1050
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:20,840
so people have this tendency of wanting to feel superior to other people

1051
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,000
either by demonstrating that they are smart

1052
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,920
or by demonstrating that their DNA may be superior to others

1053
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,640
all kinds of ways of demonstrating superiority

1054
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,400
and it all drives it all stems from their ego

1055
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,800
and what I say is just leave that aside

1056
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,240
that causes the worst in human nature

1057
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,760
you know all of the wars

1058
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,960
all of the the worst things that happen in human history

1059
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,560
were driven by ego

1060
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,880
we should try to push it aside

1061
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,320
be as modest as possible

1062
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,160
which is what the universe is telling us

1063
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:51,800
stay modest

1064
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,240
you're not at the center of anything

1065
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,960
and we might not be the smartest kid on the block

1066
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,880
I'm trying to convey this message

1067
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,960
and the pushback is in part

1068
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,600
because people are too attached to their ego

1069
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,720
it bothers them

1070
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,640
takes them out of the comfort zone

1071
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:11,080
they want to feel as if they are respected, smart

1072
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,360
never make mistakes

1073
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,800
never have to revise their view of the universe

1074
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,160
just like the philosophers during the days of Galileo

1075
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,400
they didn't want to look through the telescope

1076
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,560
because they were happy believing that they're at the center of the universe

1077
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,400
they were comfortable where they were

1078
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,240
exactly it's sort of like my daughters saying

1079
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,880
we don't want to go to a kindergarten

1080
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,480
you know at home

1081
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,440
if we have a small enough environment at home

1082
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,440
we feel as if we are the smartest kid

1083
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,560
there is nobody like us

1084
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,520
we feel great

1085
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,720
that's our comfort zone

1086
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,920
we will never go out

1087
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,240
and you know that's sort of the tendency

1088
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,480
not to explore

1089
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,360
because then you feel proud of yourself

1090
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,040
you can be arrogant

1091
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,320
if you limit your view to a small environment

1092
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,600
but it goes against the fundamentals of science

1093
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,720
because staying comfortable inhibits growth

1094
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,320
exactly that's my point

1095
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:10,840
exactly

1096
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,360
and that's why I have this battle

1097
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:19,160
and by the way I'm getting a huge response from the public

1098
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:20,840
a lot of emails

1099
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,640
also from people in academia that feel the same

1100
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,680
mostly young people

1101
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:29,240
because young people are not attached as much to their ego

1102
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,600
and I'm hopeful for the future

1103
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:36,040
you know I do not care how many likes I have on Twitter

1104
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,600
I just am focused

1105
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,440
you know just like basketball coaches

1106
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,760
advise their team players

1107
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,560
keep your eyes on the ball

1108
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,680
not on the audience

1109
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,880
and that's what I'm trying to do

1110
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,920
now you don't even have any social media right?

1111
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:51,640
no I don't

1112
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,960
because my wife asked me not to have any

1113
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,240
and I respected that

1114
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,000
and I don't miss that

1115
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,560
because it frees my time

1116
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,960
and also allows me to be more creative

1117
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,960
without being biased by the herd

1118
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:07,240
or the you know view

1119
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,000
so for my audience

1120
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,200
you don't have any social media

1121
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,200
so people that are listening or watching this

1122
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,760
what can you suggest to them

1123
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,880
to learn more about what you're doing

1124
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,840
or to find more of your writings or your books?

1125
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,080
yeah they can go to my website

1126
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,800
by putting my name on Google Avi Loeb

1127
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,120
and I have a main website where I list

1128
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,560
my commentaries in Scientific American

1129
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,480
I publish roughly once a week

1130
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:34,760
or once every two weeks

1131
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,840
I also have scientific papers

1132
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,000
more than 800 of them listed there

1133
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,360
and books

1134
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,600
and they're welcome to say

1135
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,520
anyone is welcome to send me an email

1136
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,280
and I'll be glad to correspond

1137
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,440
so in general I do have communication

1138
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,640
with a broad audience

1139
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,400
but not through social media

1140
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,000
that's amazing man

1141
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,440
well hey I'm super grateful for you

1142
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,600
having this conversation with me

1143
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,480
I really appreciate it

1144
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,520
I've learned a lot from you

1145
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,400
my pleasure

1146
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,520
thank you for having me
