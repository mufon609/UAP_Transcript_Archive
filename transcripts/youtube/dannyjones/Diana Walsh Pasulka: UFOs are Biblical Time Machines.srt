1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
You are a professor of religion and religious studies, but do you personally believe in

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
God?

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,360
Okay, so, let me talk a little bit about what we do in my field.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,800
In religious studies, it's a multidisciplinary field, and some –

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Let's get a little bit closer.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,480
Okay, some of us are archaeologists, some are historians, some are a combination of

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,480
those, and our method is that we take a step back from belief.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,960
We study belief and how belief informs practices and worldwide movements and things like that.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,240
Religion is a very powerful force.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,160
People will die for their religious belief.

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,240
So, we're academics, and we don't actually – I don't tell my students what I believe

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,440
because I don't think it's helpful.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,040
We're learning about religion, I'm not advocating religion.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
But I personally, yes, believe in God.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,600
But it's not part of my field.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,760
We have atheists, some of the best people in my field are atheists, so it's not being

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,320
a minister or a priest or something like that.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,800
I actually did get a master's degree along with priests in formation, Jesuits in formation,

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,520
from the Jesuit School of Theology, which was affiliated with UC Berkeley.

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,080
It is part of the Graduate Theological Union, which is very similar to Harvard Divinity

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,880
School but Berkeley's version.

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,880
And then I went on to get a PhD from Syracuse University in religious studies, which is

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,400
a field, a field of international academics who study religion.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,600
A lot of people are religious who study religion, but a lot of them are not as well.

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,880
So that's the first thing, is I just want to get clear what the method is.

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,840
And I've been a person who studied Catholic history for my whole career until I moved

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,520
over into studying belief about UFOs.

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,240
And I took my method with me to study that.

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,720
And we could talk about how I got into studying UFOs, because I think that's interesting.

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:24,440
But we take the method to study UFOs, which means we don't have to believe in UFOs.

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,640
I'm not out to prove that UFO crash debris are real.

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,880
And it is the subject of American Cosmic, my first book, on UFOs, but not my first book.

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,920
So I think that's important to know, is that I'm not out here crying for government disclosure

34
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,080
or whether or not these materials are actually real.

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm out to study the impact this belief has on populations of people, mainly people in

36
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,280
the United States, but globally now.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,040
Did your early childhood have anything to do with your interest in religion and religious

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,080
studies?

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,120
Did you have a very religious childhood and upbringing?

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
OK.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,320
Sorry, too faceted.

42
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,400
And did your studies and your work at all influence your outlook or your world view

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
on that?

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Yeah.

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,200
I do think that people are impacted by how they were brought up and also what happens

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,680
around them in culture.

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,880
So of course, I'm not exempt from that.

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,880
That said, I didn't grow up in a particularly religious household at all.

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,080
My parents were what I would call, I'm from California, Northern California, and it was

50
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,200
and still is an eclectic culture where there's new age beliefs and things like that.

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,600
So my parents were pretty eclectic.

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,120
My father was Irish, Roman, Catholic.

53
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:53,880
My mother was pretty secular Jewish, and they were interested in a lot of things, philosophy.

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,860
So we did have a library of books about philosophy, and I read those as a kid.

55
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,080
And I was very interested in religion and philosophy.

56
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,120
And I did make the decision to study this pretty young.

57
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,200
So yes, I think I was really interested in how people, you know, people would have pretty

58
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,680
extraordinary experiences and these would shift their lives.

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,880
And I was interested in why you also have to understand that I went to graduate school

60
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,000
during the late 90s, which was the time period of the dot com boom.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,680
And so I'm in California.

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,560
Technology is just kind of flourishing at this time.

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,960
And I'm seeing that the infrastructure is changing the way people believe in their religion.

64
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,520
And so the digital infrastructure and especially media technology like Star Wars and things

65
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,280
like that, you know, people are beginning to have these, I would call them almost like

66
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,660
mystical beliefs about things like the forces with you.

67
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,100
And it was impacting their religious beliefs.

68
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,160
And so when I went to school, not only did I study ancient texts about different religions,

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:09,200
but I also studied the ways in which people took their own beliefs and they incorporated,

70
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,520
you know, the lexicon of Star Wars into those beliefs as well.

71
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,600
And those were part of the whole landscape.

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,720
So I really focused on technology and religious beliefs.

73
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,080
That was like my focus all throughout studying Catholic history and also studying what I study now.

74
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,000
You know, I'm sure you studied religion and belief for a long time before you ever even

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,520
thought of the UFO phenomenon.

76
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,640
Yes.

77
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,080
What was it that introduced you to this?

78
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,760
Like what was the moment like when you first got introduced to this and started to look

79
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
into it?

80
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,480
And what were the biggest connections between the logic of the UFO phenomenon compared to

81
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
early Christianity?

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
Right.

83
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,140
That's a good question.

84
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,040
This happened in late 2011, 2012.

85
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,720
And I had just finished a very major project that culminated in a book about the Catholic

86
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,400
doctrine of purgatory, which is an afterlife destination for souls who don't quite make

87
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,340
it to heaven but are definitely not going to hell, okay?

88
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:20,120
And this doctrine kind of had fallen off the map for Catholics, and I wanted to know why.

89
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,600
And so I did a lot of study of old materials in archives, manuscripts, and things like

90
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,680
that.

91
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,280
And I also talked about Catholic popular culture and how that shifted this belief.

92
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:41,200
And so at the end of that, I had a long catalog of reports of aerial phenomena from 1400,

93
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,920
1600, 1700, European Catholicism, you know, that I didn't quite—in different languages,

94
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,920
by the way—and I didn't quite understand what they were about.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,840
A lot of times, people believed that these were either angels, sometimes flying houses,

96
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,040
sometimes souls from purgatory.

97
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,760
And so I kept these, and I knew that they were really interesting, but I didn't quite

98
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
make the connection.

99
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,000
I thought, hmm, I wonder what this is about.

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So I finished my book.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,840
My book was in press, and I'm on to the next book.

102
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,000
But I'm thinking that it's not going to be—it's going to be—it's not going to be about that

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
stuff.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,840
It's going to be about a Catholic bishop who was one of the first Catholic bishops

105
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,600
in the States.

106
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,920
And I show a friend of mine this catalog, and I say, what do you think of these reports?

107
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,120
And he looked through the reports, and he said, well, these look like Steven Spielberg

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
films.

109
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,360
I mean, it looks like UFOs.

110
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,360
And I thought he was silly, because I was a person who scoffed at this belief.

111
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,720
It was a coincidence, but there was a conference in my town for people who were UFO experiencers.

112
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,320
So I went to that, and I heard them talk about their experiences, and I saw that these

113
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:59,480
experiences that they were having were like an exact match with the experiences that I

114
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,080
had cataloged from hundreds of years ago up till the present.

115
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,840
And I recognized that this was a continual pattern, and it kind of blew my mind at the

116
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
time.

117
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
I was like, wow.

118
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,960
And I started to look at primary source material from Catholic experiences, like from saints,

119
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,400
like Teresa of Avila, St. Francis of Assisi.

120
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,840
And when I started to read the primary source material, I saw that it was also very similar

121
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,040
to what you would see in John Mack's book, because at this point, I read John Mack's

122
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,000
book, Abduction.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,520
And literally, these experiences of the saints could be other chapters in his book.

124
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:50,680
And so at the time, I knew Jeff Kreipel, but he's a professor at Rice University who looks

125
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,760
into this type of thing.

126
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,380
And I told him, I said, have you seen this?

127
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,700
And he at first said, no, Diana, no, I don't think so.

128
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,300
And then I took some of the stuff that I had translated and sent it to him and said, they're

129
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,580
talking about little beings and aerial phenomena and other things that happened in John Mack's

130
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,580
book.

131
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,860
And he was blown away, too.

132
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:18,620
And that was the beginning of my writing about UFOs and looking into modern-day reports of

133
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,900
UFOs.

134
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,740
And honestly, I didn't think I was going to experience what I did when I went into studying

135
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
UFOs.

136
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:32,560
I thought it was going to be a natural progression of using this method that I learned, moving

137
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,920
from Catholic history into modern-day reports of UFOs.

138
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,120
Honestly thought it was going to be pretty easy to do.

139
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,940
But when I got into the community of studying UFOs, I immediately saw that there was a lot

140
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,200
of government misinformation, truthfully.

141
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,120
And I also met high-level scientists that were studying in these programs.

142
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,000
And I didn't actually, they wanted to know what I knew, by the way.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,880
They were interested in my field.

144
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,840
They thought that they could learn from me.

145
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,000
So this is what happened, and this is how I wrote my first book about UFOs and my second

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
book, too.

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,600
So I found myself in an environment that was absolutely completely different from anything

148
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,680
I had ever studied before.

149
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,160
Now when you say these experiences that you met with, their experiences were an exact

150
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,640
match of what you were reading in some of these old texts.

151
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,080
Can you give me some specific examples of what was the thing that stood out to you the

152
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
most?

153
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Yeah.

154
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:40,360
So this would be disturbing for people who are fairly literally Catholic, right?

155
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,880
And by the way, I'm a practicing Catholic, so it was a little bit scary to read.

156
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,480
So if you look at Teresa of Avila, she's a nun who is now a doctor of the church.

157
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,360
She's a very well-known, beloved saint in the Catholic church.

158
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:05,120
She had an experience with what she considered to be an angel, but when you look at the primary

159
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:13,880
source material, and this is in the 1500s in Spain, and it's during the time period

160
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,240
when there was an inquisition, a Spanish inquisition, so it's not like she would want to have talked

161
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,120
about this, but she did write about it in her diary.

162
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:33,160
And so she had this experience where she was basically praying, and off to her side, she

163
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,920
saw something that she couldn't really understand.

164
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:45,900
It was a being, and it was about three feet tall, and she said it was very shiny, and

165
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,840
she said she was confused by it because when she saw angels prior to this, they would be

166
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,340
imaginative angels.

167
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,760
She made the distinction that this was not an angel in her imagination, but this was

168
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,460
an actual fleshy thing.

169
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,460
She saw it.

170
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,520
And so she was confused.

171
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,640
She didn't know what kind of angel it was, and she said it must be a cherub.

172
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
A cherub?

173
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
That's what she said.

174
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
What is that?

175
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,800
Well, it's a type of angel.

176
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,000
So in Catholic history, you have different types of angels, and so the cherub is going

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,780
to be kind of a little angel, childlike looking.

178
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,160
And so, but you could tell that she wasn't even sure it was that.

179
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:32,140
And so this, by the way, can only be known by reading her work and looking at her own

180
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:39,740
description of the event, because this is a very represented encounter in Catholic history.

181
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:46,120
And there's a very famous statue in Rome by Bernini, who is a sculptor, and you see her

182
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,980
and this little angel, and it has a dart.

183
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:56,280
So you know how John Mack talks about an instrument that people are examined with?

184
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,480
So apparently this little fleshy angel creature examines her.

185
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,600
And this was amazing, because it was just very strange.

186
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,280
She said it examined her?

187
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Well, yeah.

188
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Like looked at her?

189
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Okay.

190
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,040
So you have to understand translation from that time period, so let's be super clear.

191
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,740
So when I say I'm using the word examined, but probably I should not have used that word,

192
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,040
it basically said it took this dart and it thrusted into her entrails.

193
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,260
Those are the words that she used.

194
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:38,180
So you know, it was something that I didn't expect to see.

195
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,540
So this would be the example, but there were many more examples that weren't as famous.

196
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,900
That's the most famous example, the one that Catholics would know about.

197
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,520
But there are a lot of examples that I had that no one would know about because they're

198
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,720
not digitized and they're in old manuscripts.

199
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,800
And there's lots of these, by the way, at the Vatican Archive and the Vatican Private

200
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,000
Archive, which is also known as the secret archive, and literally miles of these kinds

201
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
of things and experiences.

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,480
Did you read this when you went there?

203
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,640
Yeah, I read a lot of, I did go there.

204
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:17,420
I took one of the people that was a scientist who was studying this too, and we both went

205
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,980
there and looked at this.

206
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,860
He was really interested in these experiences because he was also trying to get data for

207
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,100
what he was studying.

208
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,620
And this is the guy you call Tyler D. in your book, right?

209
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,140
He keeps his name pseudonymous because he can't be exposed.

210
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,140
How long after you started researching this stuff did you meet him?

211
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
Pretty quickly?

212
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Yeah, pretty quickly.

213
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,760
And how did you get introduced to him?

214
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:53,240
Okay, so he reached out to me and he said that he was interested in this field and he

215
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,160
was working in the space program.

216
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,880
He was a mission controller.

217
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:05,160
And I wanted to know why he was interested in my work because I didn't make the connection

218
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,140
that it had anything to do with space, you know, space stuff.

219
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,420
And so he explained that a breakthrough in his field was going to come from my field.

220
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,140
And so we started to communicate.

221
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,340
You have to understand that 2013, 2014, I was still pretty reticent to talk with people

222
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,060
who were affiliated with government stuff because it wasn't my field.

223
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,100
It wasn't something that I ever thought people would be interested in.

224
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,280
So it took me about a year and a half to actually meet him in person.

225
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,600
And so immediately I met a lot of people.

226
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,800
I met the people that you call the invisible college.

227
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,400
So for a person who didn't believe in UFOs, had no understanding of the history, thought

228
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,840
it was all hokey, this was really a strange experience.

229
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,160
And you met other people like Gary Nolan who came out.

230
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,020
He was synonymous in the first book and then he kind of like revealed who he was.

231
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,780
What was the connection between all these people?

232
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:20,140
Okay, so they're all studying what they believe is the modern day, you know, encounter with

233
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,660
non-human intelligence.

234
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,980
But they weren't studying it publicly, right?

235
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,340
Well, no, nobody was studying it publicly.

236
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:34,260
This was all before 2021, before the Pentagon, you know, reported that there were programs

237
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,100
and that they were studying this.

238
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:42,960
So this was all, and honestly, I, you know, you have to understand, I just didn't, I didn't

239
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:50,500
believe even when I was in New Mexico, because I did travel to New Mexico with Gary and Tyler.

240
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,420
And we were, we went to an alleged craft site.

241
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:00,300
I was still under this idea that they were somehow misinformed or they were very, their

242
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,380
belief was, was really strong and I needed to know why they believed this because they

243
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,140
were both incredibly intelligent people, public, intelligent people.

244
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,060
And so that's why I went, I knew that there was a rising belief in UFOs and I was trying

245
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,540
to understand it.

246
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,580
And these guys were like a key to understanding it.

247
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,300
And so Tyler had said, I don't think you believe in the physical parts of UFOs, and I want

248
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,580
to take you to a place where you'll, you'll believe after that.

249
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,660
And I was like, I'm taking my friend.

250
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,620
So I'd originally asked Jeff Kreiple to go with me, but he said, that's outside my comfort

251
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,420
zone, Diane, I'm not going to do that.

252
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:48,580
And so then I asked Gary, I had actually just met Gary and he was really impressive to me,

253
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,580
not just by being who he is, a Stanford professor, but also just really genuinely fascinated

254
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,460
by the topic.

255
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,100
And he jumped at the opportunity to go.

256
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,040
And I also knew that he, he would be the person to go, you know, if we were going to look

257
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,380
for anything, it would be Gary who could, who could figure it out.

258
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,940
And so, you know, after a while, Tyler was okay with that, but at first he wasn't okay

259
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,940
with that.

260
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,640
And then he, he looked into Gary and he said, yeah, let's go.

261
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,620
So we went to the New Mexico desert and you were like blindfolded or yeah, we had to be,

262
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,000
we had to accept to be blindfolded to go into this place.

263
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,400
And we went there, took off the blindfolds and we spent all day, you know, accumulating

264
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,400
what they believed, what were UFO debris from a crash that occurred sometime in the late

265
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,680
1940s.

266
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,140
And it wasn't Roswell.

267
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,700
And you actually found something when you guys were there during that, that specific

268
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,700
day?

269
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
We did.

270
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Yeah.

271
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
And it was hard to get.

272
00:18:51,700 --> 00:19:00,700
I mean, the place looked like it had a rubble, well, it did, it had rubble all over it.

273
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,480
And Tyler told me that the rubble was from disintegrated tin cans from the 1950s.

274
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,300
And this was something that the editor of the book wanted me to take out because she

275
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,860
said, I don't understand why you'd go to, well, she understood why I went to the place,

276
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,100
but she said, why would the government put all this stuff out in the middle of nowhere

277
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
tin cans?

278
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,820
We just need to take that out.

279
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,860
And even though I didn't understand at the time, I said, look, we have to keep it in

280
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,220
because it's still data, you know?

281
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,820
And so we kept it in, thankfully.

282
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,580
And what was it that you guys found?

283
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Okay.

284
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:41,020
So we did find some parts, two different types of parts.

285
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:48,820
One looked like, almost like frog skin, metallic frog skin, and some other stuff that looked

286
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:55,460
like, it just looked like, honestly, I don't know.

287
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Metallic frog skin?

288
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,460
Yeah, yeah.

289
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,540
It was just, both were really strange.

290
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,540
I still didn't believe.

291
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
I still didn't believe.

292
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,140
Even after Gary got stopped at the airport and things happened, like Tyler said they

293
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,620
would happen.

294
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,820
And yeah, I still don't know.

295
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,700
I still don't know what to think about that.

296
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,620
But that did happen.

297
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,940
That was part of studying what I was studying.

298
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,780
And how did that alter or affect the trajectory of your research after that, like from then

299
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,780
on out?

300
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,220
Obviously, you had met Gary and you and Gary had become friendly.

301
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:32,740
But how did that experience going to that alleged crash site affect your mind and your

302
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,980
thinking around this whole topic?

303
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
Yeah.

304
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
Okay.

305
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:45,700
I think that we have to see that this is, in its very most basic sense, this is a belief

306
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,380
that would be considered by people in my field as a mythology.

307
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:58,020
This idea that we have parts of craft from extraterrestrials and we're back engineering

308
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,060
those for technology.

309
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,700
This is actually an old myth.

310
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,460
This is, you know, the Greeks had the myth of Prometheus.

311
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:12,980
Prometheus was a God person who gave humanity fire, which was a tool and a technology, gave

312
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,740
humanity technology.

313
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,300
So this is like the modern Promethean myth.

314
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,620
That's how I was looking at it.

315
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,380
But it's something more than that.

316
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,380
And that's really what I was trying to figure out.

317
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:30,260
So while I was writing the book, it was incredibly difficult to write as an academic, because

318
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,220
I felt like this is more than a myth.

319
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,900
Something really interesting is going on here.

320
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,380
And I'm in the midst of it and I have to write about it.

321
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,820
How am I going to write about it?

322
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,180
Because generally a person in my field is going to write this academic book that basically

323
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,220
says, you know, I was on this journey with these people.

324
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,220
They believed this and they keep their distance.

325
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,300
But I felt like I couldn't keep my distance, that I was within the myth itself.

326
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,120
And so I wrote it kind of as a journey of how I was writing it actually.

327
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,920
So even the book itself was not a typical academic book, even though it was published

328
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
by Oxford.

329
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:19,280
It's a book that explores not just their belief, but also the interface of me, a non-believer,

330
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,720
even skeptical, going through this process, seeing the people involved, seeing how the

331
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,780
government's really interested in it as much as people are, you know, normal everyday people.

332
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,980
And this being kind of a very important turning point in history, really, historic.

333
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:44,420
And yeah, so I guess, you know, even with the second book, I kind of continued on that

334
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,940
journey of describing it, basically.

335
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:55,680
How do you explain what's going on now, like in the public media, like the public facing

336
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:02,200
media with like the Pentagon reports and the New York Times talking about and declassifying

337
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,700
all these radar encounters with what these Navy pilots are finding and publishing these

338
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:14,360
videos and saying that it's off-world technology.

339
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,000
What do you think, like I know you said that you encountered a lot of misinformation and

340
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,680
disinformation on this topic and that there's a lot of energy that goes into muddying the

341
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
waters.

342
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,640
But what is your take on the, in the last, however long it's been, like six years or

343
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,080
whatever that the U.S. has been trying to make this more public facing?

344
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,280
Why do you think that they're doing this?

345
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Yeah.

346
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:43,060
Okay, so again, if you go back to what I study, which is the, you know, religion, you'll see

347
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:49,160
that in mostly the traditional religions, like the big religions, and since Christianity

348
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,800
is my field, I'll use that as an example.

349
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,680
The early Christian church was completely different than the kinds of churches that

350
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,120
were institutionalized, radically different.

351
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:09,560
And what happens during the process of an institution, an institutionalization of belief,

352
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,520
so this happens with the Roman Catholic Church.

353
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:18,420
They take the Christian belief and then they institutionalize it in the fourth century.

354
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:24,540
And how they do that is they make other beliefs about Christianity heretical.

355
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,580
So you have Gnosticism, for example.

356
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,580
Those books are burned.

357
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,700
You know, we do have Gnostic texts, but...

358
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
What is Gnosticism?

359
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:39,780
Gnosticism is a form of Christianity that sprung up in the first 300 years of Christianity.

360
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,860
And it's, there's different types of Gnosticism, so different, we would call them denominations.

361
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:53,260
People believe that the knowledge of Jesus or the knowledge that Jesus had is something

362
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,700
that they experience themselves, like the Holy Spirit, they feel it.

363
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,980
It's more like an experiential knowledge.

364
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,300
The way I talk about Gnosticism to my students is I say, take a chocolate bar, okay, would

365
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:10,740
you rather know the chocolate bar by eating it or by reading the ingredients on the back?

366
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,900
So it's an intimate knowledge of something.

367
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,900
That's Gnosticism.

368
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
That makes sense.

369
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:21,460
The Catholic Church was like almost eradicated at that point, or it was submerged into the

370
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,060
Roman Catholic Church.

371
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,020
So this is the type of thing that you see.

372
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,060
You see the institutionalization.

373
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,380
And through institutionalization comes some suppression of voices.

374
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,260
And so you're going to expect to find that.

375
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,260
That's what I'm looking at.

376
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,920
And I look at that in the second book.

377
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:44,780
So I was like, okay, we're institutionalizing this belief now about extraterrestrials.

378
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,260
What are the voices that are being not heard or drowned out?

379
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,780
And why is there so much misinformation?

380
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,180
So it's a control of information that you see happening.

381
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,340
And that's what's happening now.

382
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,460
And with early Christianity, before it got institutionalized, it was suppressed, right?

383
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,920
Like you explained to me how earlier offline, how Jesus was like spreading this message

384
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,180
in the Roman Empire.

385
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:15,260
It was frowned upon and people were punished for practicing this religion.

386
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
Yes.

387
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,620
So being Jewish in the first century was hard.

388
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,300
And so there were many groups that were trying to exist.

389
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,400
And Jesus's movement was one of those groups.

390
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,220
There was another group that were zealots.

391
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,360
They were basically, they believed in armed rebellion, but there weren't enough of them.

392
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,000
So they couldn't pull it off.

393
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,540
So Jesus was basically teaching Jewish people, his congregation, the people who would listen

394
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
to him.

395
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,440
He would always talk in parables and things like this, basically.

396
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,360
He was talking to people who were ready to listen to him.

397
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,520
He was okay with not everybody listening to him, by the way.

398
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,700
So he had a very specific message.

399
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,560
And so he was basically imparting this to groups of people.

400
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,880
And his followers loved him so much that they called him the son of God.

401
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,740
Well, at the time, it was Caesar who was the son of God.

402
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,120
So we tend to look back and think that they had this, you know, the people during that

403
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,200
time period had this mythology called, you know, they had the Greek and Roman gods and

404
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
that was their mythology.

405
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,300
That was actually their religion.

406
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:28,760
So Jesus's followers were identifying him as primary and the son of God, kind of like

407
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,880
the head honcho, against Caesar.

408
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,640
And that would be called treason.

409
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,360
And so the punishment for treason is crucifixion.

410
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,400
So he was crucified for treason.

411
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,000
So who was God?

412
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:51,520
Okay, so God would be, if you look at, you know, God is either Apollo or Zeus.

413
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:58,700
So there's, you know, but they had somewhat of a pantheism, an idea of there were various

414
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,200
different forms of belief in God.

415
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,440
So obviously, Jews had their own idea of God.

416
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,440
So yeah, so it was competing divinities at that time.

417
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:17,180
I can easily see the parallels in between how the institutionalization of Christianity

418
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:25,080
and the, wow, easy for you to say, institutionalization of the UFO phenomenon, how it has always

419
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,440
been like this incredibly stigmatized topic.

420
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,680
And now they're making it more mainstream so people can, I mean, there's so many blockbuster

421
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,640
TV shows that cover this topic.

422
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,860
It's almost unfathomable.

423
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,840
But that's the thing, that the government isn't necessarily talking about the ancient

424
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,960
aspect of it or the religious side of it.

425
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,720
They're talking about it as it's just technology or like, quote unquote, aliens, possibly.

426
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Yeah.

427
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,160
So I think this is interesting.

428
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:03,520
I think that the one thing that shifts this, makes it different from the Christianity example,

429
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,560
you know, I would say that UFOs right now are having a Christianity moment where there's,

430
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,340
you know, the institutionalization going on.

431
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,080
But the one thing that's different is that whereas the other was the focus on we have

432
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,200
the divinity or we, you know, the Catholic Church is the one who has the access to the

433
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,160
divinity.

434
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,240
It's an interesting shift in that this divinity is secular, secularized.

435
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
Can you define secular?

436
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Oh yeah.

437
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
Secular is not religious.

438
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Okay.

439
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,960
There's no religion here.

440
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,120
But that completely goes against what I'm looking at.

441
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,400
So I'm happy to call it secular if that's what I found.

442
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:47,640
Like I said, I have no, I don't care, you know, I'm not here promoting, you know, the

443
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,320
existence of this or that.

444
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,400
I'm just doing my job, which is basically to see what I see and then make conclusions

445
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,680
based on what I know and the data.

446
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,200
And so what I find is that the very people who are most immersed in the study of even

447
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:13,920
the quote unquote technology are having experiences that I would call religious like experiences.

448
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,840
And these, these are changing them and shifting them.

449
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,160
They live really almost like monastic or ascetic lives.

450
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,840
So to not include that as data is probably, well, let's just put it this way.

451
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
I think it's interesting.

452
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,280
I'm including it because that's what I see.

453
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:38,000
So I think that the public facing aspect of it, not including that data, I think that

454
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,800
there are probably reasons for that.

455
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,960
One of which is they probably just aren't trained.

456
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,400
They don't know.

457
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,920
They miss it.

458
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,880
So here's an example.

459
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,760
The recent James Fox film about the Brazil.

460
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Yeah.

461
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Okay.

462
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
So love his stuff.

463
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
He's great.

464
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
He is great.

465
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Yeah.

466
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
So, and I talked to him, I don't know, about 10 years ago.

467
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,920
I, we talked, we were at a conference and he said, so tell me about the religious aspects

468
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
of this stuff.

469
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,640
Cause I don't see that connection.

470
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,320
And so, you know, I kind of at the time told him a little bit about it, but this was 10

471
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
years ago.

472
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
He asked you.

473
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,320
Yeah.

474
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,080
However, and this last video of his, oh gosh, moment of contact, moment of contact, yeah.

475
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Yeah.

476
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,040
So Virginia, Brazil, there was a crash landing and apparently there was a being that was

477
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,240
running around a town for a couple of days that was captured by the military or two beings

478
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
brother.

479
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,680
So this was fascinating to watch mostly because to me, what was interesting, you know, he's

480
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,200
bringing in a complete, he, he's bringing the framework of what I would call the secular

481
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,560
idea of the UFO as extraterrestrial crash lands.

482
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,840
And then the government covers it up and people are.

483
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,840
Men in black.

484
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Yeah.

485
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,360
And intimidated and the being looks really creepy, you know, these kinds of things.

486
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,040
So all those elements are there, but what's also there, but what gets completely missed

487
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,560
generally is that this isn't a Catholic country.

488
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,560
And the people that first see the being, they're like, what is it a demon?

489
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,640
It's not a human.

490
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,440
So they identify it and they also, there's a lore to demons as well.

491
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,020
And part of that lore is that they have cloven feet and they have a really terrible smell

492
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,020
like sulfur.

493
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,640
And both of these are mentioned many, many times.

494
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,960
They come up repeatedly in the video.

495
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,520
And I'm thinking if I ever see him again, you know, I'll say, hey, you did, you brought

496
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,000
up a lot of the religious stuff.

497
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,800
But of course he didn't see it because he's coming from a secular framework.

498
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,480
But a person trained in religious studies is going to see that or a Catholic is going

499
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,920
to see that somebody who's very Christian, they're, they're not going to miss that.

500
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Yeah.

501
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,520
This kind of blew my mind when you told me this last night, you mentioned the, the Clovis

502
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,120
feet and the smell of sulfur.

503
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,480
And this is, so you're saying that this has talked about a lot in some of these Catholic

504
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
texts.

505
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Yes.

506
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,360
So I'm not saying that that's what it is because that's, I don't do that, but I'm pointing

507
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:13,280
out that when people had these experiences in 1500, you know, 1600, these are the same

508
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,960
kinds of things that they would say.

509
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,600
They would say it smelled like sulfur.

510
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
They would wreck.

511
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,720
They would talk about the feet and things like that.

512
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,220
Now there are a variety of different experiences that have patterns, historical patterns.

513
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,180
But this is just one example.

514
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,400
It's a wild example.

515
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:36,240
Like I said earlier, there's, there's really not that many documented cases of actual beings,

516
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
right?

517
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,000
Like this, we're mostly used to seeing like these flying disks.

518
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes.

519
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,360
You know, there's, there's a couple of rare instances where there's beings that are, that

520
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,840
are witnessed and people that have encountered these things, like in their living room or

521
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,840
in their bedroom.

522
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,840
But there's never been a case where there's been multiple witnesses seeing this thing

523
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,760
that was actually taken by humans into captivity.

524
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Yes.

525
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,960
There are examples, though, from Catholic culture of this happening.

526
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,680
Like I mentioned the Teresa account where she sees a being, but it's, she doesn't record

527
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,880
a smell or anything like that, but it more looks like the beings that populate John Mack's

528
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:23,400
book or the beings that the kids in Westall or Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe, yeah, see.

529
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,080
So, so, you know.

530
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,880
There's an image of the thing that's, I guess in the newspaper, there was an illustration

531
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,240
done by somebody in Brazil.

532
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,040
Like how does, I don't know, how does that thing get here?

533
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Yeah.

534
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,280
All I can tell you is how people have seen it for a long time, not just in the 21st and

535
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,880
20th centuries.

536
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,280
It's been around.

537
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Yeah.

538
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:56,560
Movies and documentaries, I feel like they shift our memory of this kind of stuff.

539
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
They do, yes.

540
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,920
People's memory of stuff, especially over a decade, can get distorted.

541
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,080
And then when you take into context that somebody's actually making a documentary that they're

542
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,000
going to sell, you know, there's that famous line, never let the truth get in the way of

543
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,280
a good story.

544
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,800
You talk about this a lot in your book, how you were kind of like in the middle of this

545
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:23,880
world of scientists and this world of like the media and movies and Hollywood.

546
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,000
And you were finding like this connection between the two things.

547
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah.

548
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,200
Well, it's pretty obvious.

549
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:36,800
So yeah, I spent a lot of time talking about technology in my book and cognitive science

550
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,920
of technology and especially virtual environments and things like that.

551
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,280
And the more virtual something is, the more we place it in our memory.

552
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,560
And I've written a lot about this, not just in books, but also peer-reviewed papers and

553
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
things.

554
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,400
And I work with people who are doing this kind of work as well for good.

555
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,720
Like when we see things in virtual environments, we believe them, even if we don't consciously

556
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
believe them.

557
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,320
They act on our bodies as if we believe them.

558
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,840
So you can help people with PTSD in virtual environments.

559
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,800
You can train police officers to deal with stuff or even people in space, right?

560
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,160
So they use simulations for astronauts.

561
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,200
And they say that it's so real that when they're in space, they feel like that's not as real

562
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,940
as what they felt in the simulation.

563
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:34,120
So what does this have to do with us, just normal people and our interface, constant

564
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,860
interface with technology?

565
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:41,540
And I basically was saying that, yeah, we're misremembering things.

566
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,900
And a lot of that's on purpose and intentional for selling stuff, right?

567
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,420
So people want to make a lot of money from their digital content.

568
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,380
And so when, this is an example, Jacques Vallee had this happen to him, I've had it happen

569
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,380
to me.

570
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,340
So for Jacques' case is he said that when Whitley Strieber's book Communion came out,

571
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,560
there's that picture of the alien on the cover of Communion, and it looks a lot like

572
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:14,980
the James Fox alien, maybe a nicer version of it, a more friendly version.

573
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,020
And so Jacques said that it influenced researchers, ufologists.

574
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,380
So ufologists are people who study this topic.

575
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:28,980
And so they would go to a sighting, a reported sighting, and if people had seen stuff that

576
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:37,180
did not look like Whitley's cover of Communion, they would discount it as a legitimate encounter.

577
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,720
And Jacques said, you know, he just mentioned it.

578
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,140
And I encountered this a lot.

579
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,900
So after American Cosmic was published, I had people from all over the world sending

580
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,220
me videos of their encounters.

581
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,140
And a lot of them were interesting, and of course now I have friends who look at that

582
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,900
stuff and they're like, yeah, that's definitely not our stuff, you know, or something like

583
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
that.

584
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:04,700
And I showed somebody who is a researcher, a well-known researcher, I showed her a video

585
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,700
and I said, you know, and she said, that doesn't look like a flying saucer.

586
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,140
And I'm thinking, well, how do you know what a flying saucer looks like, you know, because

587
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,820
we just don't know, because we've only had drawings of flying saucers, you know.

588
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,580
So when you actually do, that's why in my next book, Encounters, what I did was I focused

589
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:31,180
on people, a lot of different types of people too, like trained observers, people in the

590
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:36,580
Space Force, you know, people who are just kind of normal people.

591
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:44,220
And if you go back to them and what they saw, it looks pretty different than what we see,

592
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,660
you know, they're similar to what we see in media, but you can see how media is taking

593
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:52,460
it and only focusing on certain types of encounters.

594
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,820
And I'll give you an example.

595
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,660
There was a really interesting example that happened, it was a UFO flap that happened

596
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,660
in Brockport, New York in the 1960s.

597
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:08,280
And more than 30 people, credible witnesses, witnessed a series of UFOs.

598
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,660
The first person to report it, and this report went to NYCAP, and this is in 67, was this

599
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,420
night watchman.

600
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:21,620
And he saw, he went out into the parking lot of where he was, you know, working, and he

601
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,740
saw Kraft parked in the parking lot, and he said he saw these little, three little

602
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,380
beings come out, or maybe two, I can't remember, come out and run around.

603
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,380
And he reported it right away, and nobody believed him, and everybody, you know, they

604
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,900
thought it was a, they just didn't think it was a credible report.

605
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,820
But immediately after that, all these credible people started to see what looked like a kind

606
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,380
of Steven Spielberg type UFO in the sky.

607
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:54,580
And I interviewed a witness to that event, he was a kid at the time, a teenager, and

608
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,260
he and his friends saw it.

609
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,340
And a lot of people saw it, police officers saw it, teachers saw it.

610
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:07,740
And so, NYCAP then took their reports, but completely discounted the first guy's report

611
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,220
because it was so weird.

612
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,860
So, there's a lot of different stuff happening in reporting, so, you know, if the report

613
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,260
is too strange, people won't take it seriously.

614
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,940
But if it's kind of, you know, mystical Steven Spielberg type UFO, people are like, oh, ready

615
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,540
to believe it.

616
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:32,820
My previous view on this whole phenomena was like, it's very technological, and as soon

617
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:41,820
as anyone started to mention anything about poltergeists or mysticism or, you know, anything

618
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:49,180
that is paranormal, I started to like, take a huge step back and be like, okay, I can't

619
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,100
take this person seriously.

620
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:58,100
But after reading your book and hearing how all of these people report all these similar

621
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:03,500
experiences, even though they don't understand what it is, but they describe it to you, like,

622
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,460
for instance, the guy Gray Man was his name.

623
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,380
He had a crazy experience with this being hovering above him at night, and he described

624
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:17,180
it to you, and you said what he described to you was to the T, the St. Michael, the

625
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,180
Archangel.

626
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,180
Yeah.

627
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,380
He didn't even know it.

628
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,660
So like, that was the point in reading your book where, like, I had to put it down and

629
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,660
take a walk.

630
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,660
Yeah.

631
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,660
I agree.

632
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:34,180
So, who is this guy Gray Man, and was he similar to Tyler?

633
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:40,020
Well, he worked in the same field, and he has to be pseudonymous because of that.

634
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,100
So he works in the same field, but he's not from this country.

635
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,340
He's from Australia.

636
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:53,620
And he was really, really careful about things that he's told me.

637
00:41:53,620 --> 00:42:06,620
And so he had personal experiences that were of this phenomena, both seeing it as, like,

638
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:11,180
something in the sky, like aerial phenomena, and also personal experiences.

639
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,860
Pardon this brief interruption, but I want to take a second to talk about our sponsor,

640
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,860
Verso.

641
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,540
Now, if you've heard this podcast before, chances are you already know how obsessed

642
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,180
I am with health and longevity, which is why one of my favorite guests to have on this

643
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:29,380
show is nutritional scientist and neuroscientist, Dr. Dom Dagostino, who actually introduced

644
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,380
me to this stuff.

645
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:36,180
Verso is a company that is dedicated to translating scientific breakthroughs into products that

646
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,300
hold a potential to increase longevity.

647
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:43,460
The problem with aging is we accumulate these zombie cells, or old damage cells, that linger

648
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,140
beyond their useful life.

649
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:49,980
These zombie cells infect other healthy cells, speeding up the aging process, causing things

650
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:55,140
like hair loss, wrinkles, arthritis, cancer, dementia, and everything in the realm of aging.

651
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,340
What scientists have realized is that we can manually induce autophagy, meaning the cleanup

652
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,020
process of the old zombie cells and replacing them with new ones.

653
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:08,660
Verso's new CleanBeing, which I take every night, is a powerful blend of synolytic molecules

654
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,820
that help promote the body's natural cleanup processes like autophagy and apoptosis, promoting

655
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,540
better cellular health, supporting lower inflammation and natural cardioprotective functions, while

656
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,440
boosting protection against age-related diseases.

657
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,020
The three main ingredients in CleanBeing are spermidine, lutolin, and dihydrocorsitin, which

658
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:31,500
play key roles in the control of gene expression and are essential for cell growth and proliferation.

659
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,660
Specifically when it comes to cardiovascular and cognitive function, skin health, vision,

660
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,660
and the immune system.

663
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,100
I linked it all below.

664
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,260
Now back to the show.

665
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:55,060
So what I found was that a lot of people who have, when there are sightings of things in

666
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,220
the sky, like aerial phenomena, some people just see aerial phenomena and that's it.

667
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,220
They don't have these experiences.

668
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,580
Other people might even have the experiences not even in that vicinity and not even see

669
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:09,700
something in the sky, but have experiences of it, which I found strange.

670
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:15,580
And again, I don't, I'm not concluding right now as to what's going on because there's

671
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,020
too much, I just don't know.

672
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,060
And a lot of people have to bring data, right?

673
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,780
We need more data basically.

674
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:29,300
And we need more people like looking at this and taking the data and not discounting stuff

675
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,380
because it's so weird.

676
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:37,060
I guess part, and I'm with you, like I used to discount people like this all the time.

677
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,340
I don't believe in it at all.

678
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:47,020
I think that what, you know, what we need is, we need someone who's like that, who comes

679
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:53,020
along and says that, you know, I was kind of trained to look at weird stuff because

680
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,500
I'm in religious studies, you know, what do people believe in religion?

681
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,860
Well, if you look at what you're, if you're religious and you're, you're believing some

682
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,640
stuff that can't be proven, you know, if you believe in angels, we've never proven that

683
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,640
an angel exists.

684
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,820
We can't put it under the microscope.

685
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,380
So we have no objective proof of religion.

686
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,060
So I'm already trained in this method.

687
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,840
So looking at UFOs, we have a lot more proof of those.

688
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,780
You know, we have like radar, we have the government now basically saying, yeah, there,

689
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,180
you know, there are these things, we just don't know what they are.

690
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,620
You know, they could present a problem for us in airspace and things like that.

691
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,780
And of course, we have people studying them in these programs.

692
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:37,100
And a lot of the people that study them in programs have very weird experiences that

693
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,340
are not talked about.

694
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:44,220
Even the history of the space program, the Russian and our space program, American space

695
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:50,940
program, you know, we have founders who had really interesting experiences like Jack Parsons

696
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,460
on the one hand, totally bizarre, you know.

697
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,980
And most people would not want to talk about that, especially if they're working for NASA

698
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,660
or aerospace, you know, they're not going to talk about that.

699
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,620
Could you describe briefly to people who Jack Parsons was?

700
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,620
Yeah.

701
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:12,800
So, okay, so there's a couple of people that are recognized as the father of rocketry.

702
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,500
They basically created the calculations to get us into space, to get us out into space.

703
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:26,860
And one of these people is Jack Parsons, probably the most effective.

704
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,680
Werner von Braun is one as well.

705
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,060
But he actually gave a lot of credit to Parsons and said Parsons figured all of this out.

706
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,700
And how did Parsons figure this out?

707
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,060
Well, he had a really interesting way.

708
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,820
He lived in the early 20th century, and he was working on rocket technology.

709
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:50,540
He also was a friend of L. Ron Hubbard, who started Scientology, and Alastair Crowley.

710
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:55,100
And he had this crazy life, and he lived in Los Angeles.

711
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,620
And he would do rituals in the desert, and he thought that these kinds of things would

712
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:03,620
help him basically download this rocket technology.

713
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,740
And it's weird.

714
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:13,700
But as weird is Konstantin Tchaikovsky on the Russian side.

715
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:20,480
He didn't have the same belief system as Parsons, but believed that he was in contact with angelic

716
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,980
presences.

717
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:27,020
He would also allow him to, you know, create this rocket technology.

718
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,780
So that's what I'm talking about, is like the people who are the most valuable to this

719
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:37,060
program are the people that are doing the stuff that most people would have discounted

720
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,540
because it's so weird.

721
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:41,460
What was he doing hanging out with L. Ron Hubbard?

722
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,460
They were...

723
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,460
And what is...

724
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,180
I'm interested to hear your take on Scientology.

725
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:51,020
Okay, well, I don't ever talk about Scientology, to tell you the truth.

726
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,540
I do teach about it in my class, not publicly.

727
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,540
Okay.

728
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,540
Is that something that...

729
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,540
Is it on purpose or is just no one's interested?

730
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,020
No, everyone's interested.

731
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,020
Oh, okay.

732
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,020
Yeah.

733
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,260
I'm talking about Scientology.

734
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,260
Right, right.

735
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,260
I don't talk about it.

736
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,260
Yeah.

737
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,740
I've had a lot of people on here talking about Scientology.

738
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,060
L. Ron Hubbard, I think he was one of the most prolific science fiction authors of all

739
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,060
time.

740
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,340
Like he wrote more science fiction than anyone.

741
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,340
Yeah.

742
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,340
And he started a religion.

743
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,340
And he started a religion.

744
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,340
Yeah.

745
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,340
Yeah.

746
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,340
Kind of interesting there.

747
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,340
Where were we?

748
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,340
What were we talking about?

749
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,340
I love strategy.

750
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,340
Okay.

751
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,340
We're talking about Jack Parsons.

752
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,340
Yeah.

753
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:32,140
When you scratch the surface of the UAP UFO topic and you look at the people who are the

754
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:39,060
most successful at moving the needle, you're going to find that their lives are imbued

755
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,780
with this kind of mystical practice.

756
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:50,220
And what is it about these people that they are able to do these quote unquote downloads

757
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,140
that they talk about, that you talk about in your book?

758
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:57,700
Tyler has this specific protocol that allows him to connect with nature and this network

759
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,700
of nature.

760
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,700
Yes.

761
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:08,860
So a lot of the people, basically, even if they don't know they are, in my field, we

762
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,420
also study monastic traditions.

763
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:17,660
Like there's a history of monastic traditions, people who are monks and nuns, and they tend

764
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:23,460
to live in communities with each other and work on their spiritual growth, basically.

765
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,580
Do things like pray a lot, study a lot.

766
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,460
And so what I noticed about Tyler was that he lived a fairly monastic life, even though

767
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,380
he would never know that or call it that.

768
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:40,020
But he had these, what I called, protocols.

769
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,700
They were physical and spiritual and mental protocols.

770
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,900
And what I noticed was that a lot of people who were doing the same kind of work followed

771
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,580
these protocols.

772
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:56,940
And they enabled them to download information that they were interested in.

773
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:04,220
They could be useful things like technologies or other things like artistic things, projects

774
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,660
and things like that.

775
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:11,060
And so when I finished American Cosmic and it was out there, a lot of people with this

776
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,500
ability reached out to me.

777
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:19,460
And I met a lot of very incredibly successful people who were doing this their whole lives,

778
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,140
doing this similar thing their whole lives.

779
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,620
And so I interviewed them, too, because I wanted to know, you know, what's going on?

780
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,620
What were they doing?

781
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,940
Why are they doing this?

782
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:35,180
And so what I figured out, for the most part, is that religions, different traditional religions,

783
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,780
were the traditions that held these technologies.

784
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:44,380
Now I see these protocols as like body technologies or, you know, technologies of connection.

785
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:52,260
And they would enable people to be super creative and help culture in many ways.

786
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,460
Like Teresa of Avila is a doctor of the church.

787
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,140
She was able to do this.

788
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,860
She was a nun.

789
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,580
And a lot of the tradition in the Catholic tradition, the saints, they were doing the

790
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,580
same thing.

791
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:07,700
They were, you know, they had these practices that enabled them, they believed, to connect

792
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,980
to their God.

793
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,420
But that's just because we didn't have a global society.

794
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:18,460
Now we have a global society and we can actually do analysis of what's going on when people

795
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,460
are connecting.

796
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:24,860
Harvard's done studies of people who meditate and how it changes, physiologically changes

797
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,660
your brain structure, right?

798
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,660
Yeah.

799
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:31,420
So, you know, so I think that this is, if I were to say the one thing I learned most

800
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:36,740
from my work so far into UFOs is I learned about these protocols and I met a lot of people

801
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,540
who do them.

802
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:43,820
And that's what I'm interested in right now is that because it seems to me that the other

803
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,100
stuff is a huge distraction.

804
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:53,180
Because if we could just focus on this type of thing, it would, you know, where people,

805
00:51:53,180 --> 00:52:01,460
you know, they're able to resist being distracted by media and, you know, focus on, on what

806
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,300
they, what they actually are interested in, you know, what are you really interested in

807
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:11,540
instead of being hung up on, you know, being distracted by stuff and consuming stuff and

808
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,700
going on to the next thing because you're bored, you know?

809
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,580
So these people are never bored.

810
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:22,140
There's this thing that creative people, specifically writers and painters, they talk about when

811
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:26,140
they're trying to get into like a creative flow process of doing their work is when they

812
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:31,780
just, when they start, when they start working on something, whether it be a poem or a piece

813
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:37,980
of artwork, they, they just start by picking up the brush and just like splattering paint

814
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,820
everywhere.

815
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:44,300
And then once they start to keep, like once time passes, they start to like get into this flow.

816
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:49,860
And some people like to call it the muse where this thing just sort of comes out of the ether and

817
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:53,620
creativity and things just flow through you without thinking.

818
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,620
That's right. That's it.

819
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:00,180
That's similar to what Tyler was talking about, where he has just thoughts that enter his brain

820
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:04,380
that have nothing to do with with memory or anything he's ever learned.

821
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,500
They're just ideas that come out of the ether.

822
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,500
Yeah. Yeah.

823
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,420
So he's not he's not the only one.

824
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,100
There's so many of people, you know, there's so many people like that.

825
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,580
So, yes. So to me, that's the most interesting thing.

826
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:22,580
And I was and most and a lot of people were very interested in it.

827
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,820
So I gave a class on it, you know, because and people from all over the world took the

828
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:31,980
class and a lot of people who were doing it because they want to know, what am I doing?

829
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,420
Are other people doing this, too?

830
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:42,140
But doesn't. So the idea is that our bodies are the work at the cellular level.

831
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,500
It's all electronic, right?

832
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:50,060
Like the electrons in our bodies that make up our our atoms and our cells and our DNA and

833
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,980
everything about us. And we're like 90 percent water.

834
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:59,100
And the idea behind this is that I'm sorry if I'm messing this up, but that our bodies are like

835
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:05,020
these radio transmitters and that like if we can treat our body the right way and eliminate all of

836
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:14,460
these outside peripheral signals that we can connect to some sort of some sort of network.

837
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,460
Yes. So I've talked to a lot of people about this because, you know, at some point, my own

838
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:25,780
training fails me and I need to like access people who are really into A.I. or into, you know,

839
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:31,140
that are scientists. And so I've talked to a lot of them and there are two different kinds of

840
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,540
theories. One is that it's like a network, right?

841
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:39,420
And there was a Jesuit priest in the early 20th century who felt this network.

842
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,900
His name is Chardon. Tell your Chardon.

843
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,500
Right.

844
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,860
And so he described it as the newest fear.

845
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:52,420
And so he felt this network when he was on the front in World War One.

846
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:56,260
And, you know, there's a lot of tension going on there.

847
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,540
And he felt like this was going to connect with technology in the future.

848
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,300
And he felt like, you know, his work is interpreted in different ways.

849
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,820
But I interpret his work as basically saying that there's almost like a new form of a human

850
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,500
that's going to happen in the early 21st century.

851
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:17,540
And and he sees it as connected to this network.

852
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,020
A new form of human. Yeah.

853
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,060
And a lot. So I met a lot of people who believe this, too.

854
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:29,740
So he's a very well known philosopher in communities of people who are creating A.I.

855
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:34,020
And so the belief systems of people who are creating A.I., I interviewed them, too,

856
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:39,300
because, you know, because really I was interviewing people who were in Silicon Valley

857
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:47,060
believing in aliens and E.T. and reverse engineering things, you know, in for American Cosmic.

858
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,540
Well, the whole world has shifted.

859
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,780
A.I. is something that wasn't a big deal.

860
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,220
I mean, it was a big deal in that time period, but it's now become super public.

861
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:02,460
And so during the time period that American Cosmic was published and and then this book here

862
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:07,860
that I just finished, I focused on people who were in these communities of A.I.

863
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:12,780
And a lot of them know about this idea of the organic network

864
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:19,100
that's now somewhat infiltrated with the actual other Internet

865
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:24,380
and how these you know, how your body's impacted by competing with the Internet, right?

866
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:28,460
Kind of. I mean, let's put it this way.

867
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:37,100
Some of them said that they do detox from the Internet in order to connect to the original,

868
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:43,220
I guess, you know, network in order to come back and code, which is so ironic.

869
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:50,020
But yeah, there's a deeper meaning here when it comes to like our evolution.

870
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:54,300
We can we have the choice to either develop technology as a tool

871
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:01,260
or develop something that is going to that is going to make us sort of irrelevant.

872
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,740
Yeah. Or trample us.

873
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,620
Yeah. There's like a fork in the road.

874
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,420
Right. A fork in the road. That's a good way of putting it.

875
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:12,340
Chardon saw this. It's one of his warnings, you know.

876
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:20,540
And so the person who is included in the book that is this person that we call Moon Girl, right?

877
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:30,140
And so she's she's one of the major creators of AI back when, you know, 20 years ago.

878
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:37,220
And so she's now seeing the fruits of the things that she created, you know, come alive in a sense.

879
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:46,740
And so she's she's the one who explained a lot of this idea to me and that, you know,

880
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:58,220
that we do have to have a good understanding that, you know, there's obviously there's a lot of talk of the danger right now of AI.

881
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:09,220
And so she's she's saying that there's a positive aspect that we can take right now and we can utilize this and it'll be helpful.

882
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:13,900
But it seems like she also believes that AI is going to be sentient.

883
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:26,860
What is the connection between this way of of tuning the human body and being able to experience some of these paranormal aspects,

884
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:30,820
some of these paranormal, having these paranormal experiences in connection with it?

885
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:38,940
It's it's pretty well known in Buddhist communities of meditators and also within Catholic culture that if you pray,

886
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,580
I mean, we're talking about the monastic traditions.

887
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:46,980
If it's not, you know, not your everyday Catholic is not going to be praying and then seeing an entity or something like that.

888
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,460
Or they might. But generally, no.

889
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:55,580
So if you're doing this kind of practice where you're becoming sensitive to, you know,

890
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:06,940
what happens during meditative or prayer sessions, sometimes you'll see something that is like what would be called a UFO or an entity.

891
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,900
And it would might disturb you.

892
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,420
But that's why there are communities that help each other.

893
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,180
So that's why monks and nuns, you know, they live together to help each other through these spiritual practices.

894
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:24,380
So they would say, I know that in specific Buddhist communities, they say, that's just a distraction.

895
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:31,780
That's not your goal. You know, so if you see these things in the Catholic monastic community,

896
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:37,060
you would tell your spiritual director and they would most likely say the same thing.

897
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,620
Don't focus on that, you know.

898
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:44,020
Now, are there are there good and evils?

899
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:49,340
Like, is there are there good? Yeah. Yeah. And evil beings that people report?

900
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:55,180
Yeah. And what what what determines whether these people experience good or evil?

901
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:58,580
Well, within the Catholic tradition, definitely they would call it good or evil.

902
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,580
Within the Buddhist tradition, they would probably have unhelpful and helpful, right?

903
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:05,380
They wouldn't like put a value judgment on it, in my opinion.

904
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,260
I am not a scholar of Buddhism. So just to be clear.

905
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,940
But within the Catholic tradition, what would happen is if you started to have locutions,

906
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:17,500
which, you know, you hear things or you see things, you would go to your spiritual director

907
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,300
and you would tell that person, OK, this is happening to me.

908
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:26,700
And you would work through it. And there would be tests to find out if this was a evil thing or a good thing

909
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,780
and whether we should pay attention to it.

910
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:35,900
It's definitely something that has always been around in Catholic culture and is still around.

911
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,340
So, say, let's take the example of sightings of the Virgin Mary.

912
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,820
OK. All right. So people see the Virgin Mary.

913
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:49,060
All right. It's kind of an often if you if you go online, you'll do maps of Virgin Mary sightings global.

914
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,500
There's a bank that's right down the street from here.

915
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:58,540
Years ago, there was the sprinklers went off and it stained the glass on the side of this glass building,

916
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,340
which was a bank, and it created the stain that looked just like the outline of the Virgin Mary.

917
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:07,100
And it was all over the news. And a church ended up buying the building and making it now.

918
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,620
It's now a church today. Wow. That's amazing.

919
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:15,420
A church bought a bank. There would often be these stains on the windows from the sprinklers, right?

920
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,820
And they were all different kinds of shapes.

921
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:21,300
But this day specifically created the shape of a Virgin Mary and they never cleaned it off.

922
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,660
They, in fact, like did something where they like coated over it and made it permanent.

923
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,660
Wow. And then a church ended up buying it.

924
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,180
Wow. That's really neat. Yeah, it's wild.

925
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:33,940
But it's like it goes back to the thing like believing is seeing.

926
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,700
Like if you believe something, you see it everywhere. Yeah, yeah.

927
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:43,660
So, OK, so say you see, say somebody sees the Virgin Mary and this person seems credible, right?

928
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:47,140
They don't even want to talk about it, but they they do see it.

929
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,500
And they go to their priest and they say, look, I saw, you know, this.

930
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,820
Here it is. Oh, yeah, I remember that.

931
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:58,060
It's really beautiful. Yeah, it's like 10 minutes away from here.

932
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:07,100
Wow. So there's a there are committees at the Vatican that assess these sightings

933
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,140
and assess whether or not they're from God or not from God.

934
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:14,540
And so these kinds of things get assessed.

935
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,940
And that's not in secular culture.

936
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,820
So if you see something and you're like, well, I saw this, you know, people are like, OK, right.

937
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,660
But if you do see this in different religious traditions,

938
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:26,980
there are committees set up to deal with that kind of thing.

939
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:31,540
Is this similar to you mentioned something in your book that there is a person

940
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:37,580
I can't remember the name of this person, but there's a person who determines who is a saint.

941
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:40,260
Yeah, there's a whole committee that does that.

942
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,980
And it's called there's a postulator.

943
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,940
So postulators, that's what it was.

944
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:53,620
Yeah. And I've I've met one at the Vatican who was also I think he's he's still there.

945
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:57,300
He doesn't he's not on the Internet or email or anything.

946
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,460
Now, what is this spiritual aspect of the phenomenon?

947
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:08,380
What does it have to do specifically with going back to Gary Nolan's work, brain structure?

948
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:13,340
And he talks about specific brain structure and a specific part of the brain that is developed.

949
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:18,260
And I think it's like what it's like one percent of the population.

950
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:23,060
I don't know what percentage it is, but he was studying.

951
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:29,740
I don't know if Gary's talking about it with respect to spiritual spirituality or religion,

952
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:39,380
but he's definitely talking about it with respect to people who access this data that allows them to do downloading.

953
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,900
That's what I meant. Yeah. Yeah.

954
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:50,780
So these are like high functioning people who are downloading information that's really helpful, generally technologies.

955
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:55,500
And it's the Caudate Pudiman, that the part of the brain that he was looking at.

956
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,300
What is it called again? It's called the Caudate.

957
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,340
The Caudate. I think it's the Caudate Pudiman.

958
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,860
The Caudate Pudiman. OK.

959
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:13,020
These protocols that Tyler specifically talks about is not something that should be practiced by everyday people to try to access this?

960
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:17,100
Or is this something that that all people can try to do?

961
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:24,060
Oh, I think that I mean, honestly, it's I think all people should should do the things that he was doing.

962
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,980
I mean, maybe not to that extent because they're pretty intense.

963
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:31,020
But I mean, he's just talking about having.

964
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:37,380
OK, let's put it this way. In many traditions, your body's religious traditions, your body is considered a temple.

965
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:42,020
OK, well, what is it a temple of? It's going to be a temple of God. Right.

966
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:47,300
So it's a temple that so this idea has been around for a while.

967
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:53,980
We just forgot about it. And so it's being, you know, I'm looking at it and saying, hey, you know, this has been around for a while.

968
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,100
And these people are doing it to great effect.

969
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:05,740
And it's basically making sure that you're you're healthy and you keep your body, you know,

970
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:13,780
if it is the case that we're transmitting and receiving information, that you're keeping your body clear enough and healthy enough to do that.

971
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:17,620
So I think it's kind of like a human thing. I think a lot of people can do it.

972
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:20,420
Is it simple stuff like getting good sleep, drinking a lot of water?

973
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,060
It's totally simple. Take your vitamins. Yeah, it's simple stuff.

974
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:27,060
But when you look at the science behind it, you're like, oh, so that's the reason why.

975
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:32,500
So getting enough water, our bodies. So Moon Girl explained this to me.

976
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:38,220
She said our bodies are like 90. No, not I'm sorry, like 80 percent water, 70, 80 percent water.

977
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:42,460
And water is like the universal conductor.

978
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:48,060
It's conducting electricity and a lot of things that are happening in our bodies are electrical.

979
01:05:48,060 --> 01:06:00,220
So we're just, you know, making sure that the water is clear in order for these things to, you know, to in order for us to be at our peak.

980
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:07,140
You see it also with athletes. You know, you have to be at a certain point in order to get into the flow.

981
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:12,900
A musician has to know the stuff really, really well in order to get into the flow.

982
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:18,500
So it's basically living very in a very healthy way.

983
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:23,100
So this brings me to the the study.

984
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:27,580
There's a part in Plato's book where he talks about the the cave.

985
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:33,100
I think it's called the Cave of Allegory. Oh, oh, you're talking about the allegory of the cave, the allegory of the cave.

986
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,140
Yeah. Dyslexia. No, no, it's OK.

987
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:39,060
It's in Plato's Republic. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

988
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:44,340
It's a really interesting. It's like a template for our time, like a lot of movies make use of it.

989
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:51,060
The Matrix makes use of the allegory of the cave is kind of like a template that what we see is not real.

990
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:57,500
And there's something behind it. And he talks about it with respect.

991
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:01,860
It's a really interesting book, by the way, Plato's, Plato's Republic.

992
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,340
There's a diagram of it. Yeah.

993
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:08,940
So, OK, so I'll tell you what's going on. OK.

994
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:12,780
So Plato's basically in the allegory.

995
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:20,980
He's talking to, I'm sorry, Socrates, because Plato's talking about Socrates, who is his teacher, and Socrates never wrote anything.

996
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,260
So Plato basically mimicked Socrates, tried to.

997
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:32,100
Writing was a new technology at the time, and Socrates didn't like it because he felt like it removed

998
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:35,820
knowledge from the actual source of knowledge, which was the person.

999
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:39,260
OK, so this is this is happening at the time period.

1000
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:45,540
So Plato wants to provide people with an understanding of what his teacher, Socrates, said.

1001
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:50,140
But he's he needs to use writing to do it. So everything's in dialogue.

1002
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:57,220
So Plato's writing all of this in dialogue form in order to kind of preserve something of what Socrates is saying.

1003
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:03,020
OK. So Socrates, so this allegory, the cave, this occurs in Plato's Republic.

1004
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:06,340
Plato's Republic is asks this question.

1005
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,100
Can we have a just society? Right.

1006
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:12,140
Can we actually live together without killing each other?

1007
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:15,340
This is a question. Right. Can we have a just society?

1008
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:26,300
OK, so that's the question. And so each chapter is back and forth about whether or not between Socrates and Plato's brother, Glaucon.

1009
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:30,580
You know, can we actually have this just society? And.

1010
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,460
There are lots of different readings.

1011
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:35,500
I am not a trained philosopher, although I took a lot of philosophy.

1012
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,260
I have like the equivalent of a master's degree in it.

1013
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:43,140
Oh, wow. But. So I know a lot of philosophers.

1014
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:47,380
I've talked to philosophers, mostly James Madden at Benedictine College.

1015
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:51,340
He and I have had a lot of conversations about the allegory.

1016
01:08:51,420 --> 01:09:04,860
And it appears that Socrates at the end of the Republic is kind of the answer is we can't really have a just republic because, you know,

1017
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:13,620
we've gone through all of these scenarios and simulations and it looks pretty bad for people because politicians are really pretty they shouldn't actually be politicians.

1018
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:20,700
It's like the people who should be politicians are not politicians and you have to trick them into being politicians.

1019
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:24,140
That's the best politician. Right. And that's not going to happen.

1020
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:28,500
So in the end, he throws in the allegory of the cave and you're like, what's this about?

1021
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,980
So he's basically saying that life is like this.

1022
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:37,780
We're all in this cave. And if you look at this image here, you see these people tied up.

1023
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:46,380
So people have tied them up. And what's worse is that they've lit this fire in back of them and they're doing puppet shows.

1024
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:54,740
And so these people just see the shadows of what's happening on the cave wall and they think that's reality.

1025
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:57,220
OK, so that's the setup. That's what life is like.

1026
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:03,180
And then somebody gets out and like goes outside the cave and sees, you know, something real.

1027
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:05,780
They see reality out there. They see like the real world.

1028
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:10,060
They see the sun. And this is true.

1029
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:14,860
And they realize that they've been fooled their whole life and they don't see what's real.

1030
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:21,060
So they go back into the cave and they tell the people that are tied up, there's reality out there.

1031
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:24,780
But sadly, what happens is the people who are tied up think that they're crazy.

1032
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:28,020
They say, you're crazy. Your eyes are ruined.

1033
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:35,620
And Socrates even says maybe they might even harm that person because they're so angry at them.

1034
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:41,140
So he basically says, what do we need then? What kind of what should we do about this situation?

1035
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:50,580
And so he and Glaucon agree that the best way to deal with this is through a basically a conversation about what is real

1036
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:58,980
and a way to help each other recognize like kind of a community, the very basis of a community that looks like a monastic community

1037
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:03,420
where people basically say, wow, what's out there is really crazy. We can't believe it.

1038
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:08,020
So let's kind of talk about it and and really form this.

1039
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:13,940
What a lot of philosophers believe is this epistemology of of good, you know, that we can you know,

1040
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:22,660
that this is the the ascent from the cave is when a person starts to attain like a mystical knowledge of what is good.

1041
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:29,180
And so that's what he believes is going to help us in this kind of situation that we're in.

1042
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:34,900
You can definitely see the parallels of the situation that we're in with the allegory of the cave.

1043
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,980
Yeah, it's kind of mind blowing.

1044
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:46,180
I know. I know. That's why a lot of people who are doing media are using allegory of the cave as kind of a template, you know,

1045
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:50,700
for our time period. But I think it's actually just the way that has been.

1046
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,900
By the way, I want to say that this is a Western thing.

1047
01:11:54,900 --> 01:12:02,020
I don't know if the allegory is going to be structurally important for like certain indigenous communities, frankly.

1048
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:08,860
When you look around, you're like, wow, they don't actually have this situation where you have government.

1049
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:13,140
And, you know, Socrates was killed by his government. Right.

1050
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,380
It was a pretty dire situation.

1051
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:24,740
Like, it seems like right now we're in the cave, but it seems like the way to break it or to break the chains is through this philosophy.

1052
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:36,100
And through us finding out, like finding and discovering that everything that we're looking for is within ourselves.

1053
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:48,980
Yeah, I think that I honestly do think that this is a template that it's and it's structural for at least this is this type of culture.

1054
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:57,780
And the way to remedy, maybe you can't fix it, but you can remedy it for yourself.

1055
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:00,780
And that's to do what Socrates suggests.

1056
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:05,020
And so I think it's really important to do that.

1057
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:08,140
Will this be a fix it for humans?

1058
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:11,900
I don't know. And is there a fix it for humans?

1059
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:17,300
Maybe not. And but if there is, we have to look at these kinds of things.

1060
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:23,420
So I find correlations to early Christianity, too, because when Jesus was talking to his community.

1061
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:34,700
And by the way, this would be something that they would have known about because, you know, that we're talking about a very Greek informed Jewish community in the first century.

1062
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,220
So there, you know, there's a called Hellenization.

1063
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:40,780
So they're very informed by Greek thinking.

1064
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:49,580
And there's philosophical communities of math mystics, basically, who sometimes are vegetarian and they're practicing these protocols.

1065
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:52,620
Socrates and his group practice these protocols, too.

1066
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:59,420
A lot of them didn't start learning and utilizing math until they were 35 to 40 years old.

1067
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:02,020
They were, you know, because, yeah, so it's really interesting.

1068
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:10,620
So, you know, when you start to learn about that time period, Jesus's time period, you start to understand that it was very sophisticated what they were talking about.

1069
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:18,900
And Jesus was also, in a sense, being the Socrates of his time, basically saying to the people who had listened, he was even talking to everybody.

1070
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:24,180
He was saying, this is what it's like, you know, and he would basically help his community.

1071
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:28,540
And so he was initiating. He also never wrote anything like Socrates did.

1072
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:33,420
I mean, didn't either. So they were very similar in that sense that they never wrote anything.

1073
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:36,980
So he was also, you know, he was also asking, could there be justice?

1074
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:39,980
And he said, yes, there can. But but it's the way this is the way.

1075
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:42,980
And it was a spiritual and mystical way, just like Socrates.

1076
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:52,740
And my reading of Socrates is that he's proposing a spiritual way, a mystical way, even though, ironically, the reason he was killed was because he was supposed to be.

1077
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:58,900
Athens said that he was promoting atheism among the youth, which I think is really ironic.

1078
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:03,940
Tyler described a hierarchy of beings.

1079
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:06,140
How do you make sense of that?

1080
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,580
Always really interesting to me.

1081
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:17,500
So Tyler's information about the protocols I thought was so good and interesting and helpful that I was I asked him to guest speak in my classes.

1082
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:20,540
Oh, really? Yeah. Prior to the publication of American Cosmic.

1083
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:23,900
So he would guest speak in my classes and my students loved him, by the way.

1084
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:31,380
So he would it would be standing room only when he was around and students would come, you know, and pack into my classes.

1085
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:40,620
And he would basically talk to them about their own lives and what they were interested in doing and that type of thing.

1086
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,340
And during the time period, he was really open about his beliefs.

1087
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:50,100
And part of what he used to say was that there were a higher there was a hierarchy of beings and he placed God at the top.

1088
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,900
He was Christian. And then he placed angels below God.

1089
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:58,540
And then he placed beings like off planet beings.

1090
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:00,740
He called them off planet beings.

1091
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:08,180
And then he placed and this is where it gets really weird to me, factions in the intelligence community and then normal humans.

1092
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,060
That was the the hierarchy.

1093
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:19,340
OK. Was he was Tyler religious before you guys before you like when you first met him, was he very religious person?

1094
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:21,660
He was religious in a pretty normal way.

1095
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:28,540
So he he went to church maybe a couple of times a year, non denominational Christian.

1096
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:32,060
He was very, very spiritual.

1097
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:39,460
But his his spirituality wasn't I mean, obviously, when he met me, I taught him a lot about, you know, what I knew.

1098
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:44,700
And when we were at the Vatican, he experienced a pretty intense religious experience.

1099
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:51,220
And so now he's very religious, like Catholic goes to church, works, I think.

1100
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:52,660
After his experience at the Vatican.

1101
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:58,140
Yeah, yeah. And that was nothing that I promoted or wanted to happen, by the way, just kind of happened on its own.

1102
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,580
I was fascinated by it. So, yeah.

1103
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:05,980
So no, he was not. He was not super religious.

1104
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:09,100
OK. So God, God is at the top.

1105
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,820
Angels are below that. Yeah.

1106
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:14,980
What in his view are angels?

1107
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:29,700
Well, he changed his view when we went to the Vatican and we learned a lot more about the saints and what was happening with them and their interfaces with what looks like similar to what people are saying when they have UFO experiences today.

1108
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:34,500
And he started to understand it from a broader perspective.

1109
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:39,700
And he thought perhaps that the things that he was studying had to do with angels.

1110
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:50,620
And so he was willing to decide that maybe the category of angels and off-planet intelligence were closer than he had thought before.

1111
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:56,100
Maybe they were the same. And so he revised that, but he kept everything else the same.

1112
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:59,180
So he combined angels and extraterrestrials?

1113
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:03,060
Yes. Well, remember, he's calling them off-planet beings.

1114
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:05,540
He's not calling them extraterrestrials.

1115
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:08,860
OK. Isn't that the same thing, though?

1116
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:14,620
Not to his mind, because I think he's keeping an open mind as to what they are.

1117
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:19,060
He believes in them and interfaces with them, but he's keeping an open mind.

1118
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:28,340
So is the difference between off-planet, when he says off-planet, does he mean like stellar?

1119
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:33,620
Or is he talking like, are we talking multiverse, like different dimensions?

1120
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,180
Yeah. So these are the questions that he had.

1121
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:40,700
OK. So he didn't know. That's why he left it open.

1122
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:47,940
I mean, I think that he believed that they're in space and that we encounter them in space.

1123
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,220
Oh, we encounter them in space.

1124
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:54,900
And they come down, too, to our atmosphere. So I think that he calls them off-planet.

1125
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,020
They're not terrestrial.

1126
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:03,340
So he claimed that we see these things in space?

1127
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:04,540
Is that something you can talk about?

1128
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,500
That's what he believes. Let's just say that.

1129
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,340
That's what he believes.

1130
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:09,740
That's what he believed at the time.

1131
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:16,540
What is his opinion of the objects that the Navy pilots are seeing,

1132
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:21,020
like the Tic Tac objects and the other, the GoFast and the Gimbals?

1133
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:31,100
OK. It was only the Tic Tac videos that I was able to get him to look at and ask what he thought about those and not the other ones.

1134
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:36,900
So he looked at those and he said, the video quality is horrible.

1135
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:40,260
And then he said, that's pretty similar. That's what he said.

1136
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,300
That's all he said to me.

1137
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,940
He said, that's pretty similar.

1138
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:48,420
Yeah. But he said, the video is really terrible.

1139
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,620
And he thought that that was probably purposeful.

1140
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,140
I got the feeling he thought that was purposeful.

1141
01:19:54,180 --> 01:20:01,340
And it was very soon after that that we stopped talking about, we stopped working together.

1142
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:04,340
Really? Why did you guys stop working together?

1143
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:11,900
Because his work was changing already and things were going really fast.

1144
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:16,020
And my book was, you know, said a lot.

1145
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:21,700
And I think that it was not in his best interest to keep communicating.

1146
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:33,660
Did anybody seem to have the opinion that that those modern videos are sort of like technology that has been developed by us?

1147
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:43,260
Let's see. I mean, yeah, there are some people who believe who basically told me this is after the book got published.

1148
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:49,980
She said that we have drone technology from a long time ago, way before people even knew that drones existed.

1149
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:59,780
And so, yes. So it got a lot of very, you know, of course, at this time, I recognized the complete disinformation that was coming my way,

1150
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:03,700
because I'm a professor writing about this topic.

1151
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:09,740
And so I'm like a magnet for anybody who wants to spin their story in public.

1152
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:17,220
And so I had to be really conscientious about who I listened to and took seriously.

1153
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:25,380
And so, you know, but I did have people come and very, you know, emphatically tell me, yes, this is like this is not what you think.

1154
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,540
It's it's our technology. And we've had it for a long time.

1155
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:35,260
That and then gave me evidence to show me. But at this point, I decided I wasn't going to be doing that.

1156
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:39,460
They give you evidence to show you? Yeah, yeah. And of course, they're going to want it out there, you know.

1157
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:42,660
So I'm like, I'm not doing this game. Like, I felt like I did that before.

1158
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:52,460
I'm not going to do it again, because at this point, I understood that I was going to be a target and was a target of people feeding me information they wanted to place into public.

1159
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:58,220
And you have as a person, you discern that. Well, right. It's really difficult to discern that.

1160
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:03,380
I used my some of my friends who I trusted, like Jacques Vallee, to kind of get a read on people.

1161
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:07,620
I'm not like I'd ask him specifically. I just say, do you want to meet this person?

1162
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:16,260
And if he said no, or if he didn't comment, I didn't know. OK, this is not because he's got a I think he's pretty good at discerning, you know.

1163
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:32,100
And yeah, so I just chose to only write and publish stuff that I felt was responsible, I guess, you know, and could be I could say, yeah, that, you know, put it out there and say, yes,

1164
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:38,780
it wasn't anything that I was going to put out there that I had a question about, you know.

1165
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:49,580
So I was doing straight what's called ethnography, which is basically talking to people about their experiences and interfaces with this phenomenon.

1166
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:57,940
What for you with the specifically with the new book, what for what was there anything in there that was like really?

1167
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:05,180
Something that like blew your world view out of the water or like really shocked you.

1168
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:17,460
OK, that's a really good question. I think the few things, the two chapters that are really impactful to me are side by side.

1169
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:22,220
And the first one is with Moon Girl and her world view.

1170
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:34,380
Was really interesting to me because it's the new world, you know, she's she augurs in this new world, her work, the way she lives and.

1171
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:39,100
Speaks about it really. She's articulate and eloquent about it.

1172
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:53,020
And it's for a lot of people, it's frightening because it's basically us living with a technology that we've created that has huge potential to shift everything.

1173
01:23:53,020 --> 01:24:04,540
And this is what attracted me to the work of Martin Heidegger, the philosopher, in that he predicted this time period and said only a God can save us now thing type.

1174
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:09,460
Yeah, so, you know, I was like, wow, we're here and she's the one who knows most about it.

1175
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:16,060
So so, you know, this time period of.

1176
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:31,820
You know, intelligent technology, either something that we merge with or that something independent on its own is fascinating and something that I said is unprecedented for humans.

1177
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:40,060
And so, yes, that and then directly after that, I I know a person, actually a colleague of mine.

1178
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:47,420
I've known her for many years, 20 years, and this is all pre pre UFO and post UFO.

1179
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:56,180
And when she was a woman in my department, I'm in a male dominated field, so we spent a lot of time together.

1180
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:02,020
She's a philosopher and she worked or she was being recruited by the NSA as well.

1181
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:07,940
And her father worked in what she called the secret space program.

1182
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:11,460
And this was all when I was doing Catholic history.

1183
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:15,820
So I always thought that was strange, but I never actually asked her about it.

1184
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:22,460
And but then when I started to study this, I was like, I need to ask her about this because it's strange.

1185
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:28,740
You know, you hear all this crazy stuff about this secret space program and it's this and that, and it's you know, it's absolutely insane.

1186
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:38,380
So I did an interview with her and I recognized that she was actually the child of a person who was in one of these programs.

1187
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:41,940
And I met so many people in these programs like Tyler.

1188
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:48,900
Right. And, you know, and these people have children, those children do not live normal lives.

1189
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:54,140
And because their parents don't live normal lives because of being part of these programs.

1190
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:57,100
And so that was an insight. I met a lot of these people.

1191
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:08,420
And so there's like almost like an effect, you know, of that lasts on these generations of people, their children.

1192
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:14,940
And so I really wanted to talk about that, but I couldn't talk about it directly with some of the people who are now in the program.

1193
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:18,140
So her father's been dead for many, many, many years.

1194
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:25,700
But still, people around her told her not to share the information because there was so much intimidation not to share it.

1195
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:32,620
I mean, we're talking about he's been dead for more than 30 years, you know, and so but she talked about it.

1196
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:46,260
It's so it's so unsettling to think that there's this such this deep layer of fear and secrecy embedded deep in our government and in the world that you don't see or normal people don't even think about.

1197
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:50,860
The deeper you go into this topic, it's just like the more of that you see.

1198
01:26:50,860 --> 01:27:00,620
Yeah, I've I started having that idea that you have, like, you know, there shouldn't be this and basically being kind of really frightened of it, not wanting to be a part of it.

1199
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:06,380
And then being around people so much in it, a lot of them were saying it's worth.

1200
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:10,820
Listen, it's better. The devil, you know, the devil, you know.

1201
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:17,780
And so that kind of change and then having them tell me exactly why it's better, the devil, you know.

1202
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:24,460
And so that shifted my perspective. And now I just, you know, maybe there's some wisdom.

1203
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:31,540
And so I back off from it. And so I just focus on the religion aspects of of this.

1204
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:34,540
I don't want to go into this.

1205
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:40,060
You know, the the secrecy of that chapter is the one in the book that.

1206
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:43,900
I just kind of talk about it. It's a safe way to talk about it.

1207
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,260
We just have to say, yeah, it's there that exists.

1208
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:51,140
And some people believe that it exists for good reason.

1209
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:58,900
Do you think that there's there's people that are like this girl's father who passed away?

1210
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:03,540
Scientists that are deep within the shadows of governments

1211
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:12,100
who are very much aware of this spiritual mystic thing that Tyler's being a part of, that Tyler's a part of.

1212
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,540
Yeah, I do.

1213
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:17,260
And what and do you think they're trying to purposely hide it or weaponize it?

1214
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:24,100
I mean, because like all the history of the evolution of technology is is.

1215
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:30,260
Competitive capitalism mixed with science for the purpose of war, right?

1216
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:32,620
Like we're apes with nuclear weapons, right?

1217
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:37,100
And we just want to compete to have to be higher on the food chain.

1218
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:42,660
And that's what sort of inspired a lot of the most incredibly innovative technology in throughout history.

1219
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:51,700
So like it's do you do you think that that is what they're why they're keeping this a secret?

1220
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:56,500
OK, so yeah, so I would I loved what you just said, right?

1221
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:00,620
The rundown of kind of the state of affairs and technology.

1222
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:08,700
But I would I would change one thing, and that's the people who create it are often not the people who utilize and operationalize it.

1223
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:16,820
OK, so the people who create it, they probably keep this stuff, you know, grab the patents or, you know, grab the people themselves and use that.

1224
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:19,700
But those people are not out to do wage war.

1225
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:24,140
Generally, they have like they're hey, this is helpful for humanity in this case, right?

1226
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:32,100
OK, so you take any scientist or doctorate or whatever, whoever they are researcher and you give them millions of dollars.

1227
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,420
So here run free, like do what you you know what I mean?

1228
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:38,100
We want you to figure out everything you can about this.

1229
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,860
Like that that essentially is what it is.

1230
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:45,580
Right. It's these people with agendas giving money to scientists and smart people.

1231
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:48,660
Yeah. So that happens. OK.

1232
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:52,380
All right. So that's that's one way to look at it.

1233
01:29:52,380 --> 01:30:03,020
Another way to look at it. So again, after American Cosmic was published, lots of very wealthy people who do want to operationalize technology got a hold of me.

1234
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:09,100
Still happens. OK. And they'd like to talk to me and maybe connect them with Tyler or people like that.

1235
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:18,940
But I always feel like they're looking for this, you know, this idea of the reverse engineering, the data.

1236
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:22,540
And what I found is that the data actually exists in the people.

1237
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:28,180
So, you know, the the data is passed down through an oral tradition.

1238
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:31,100
It's not kept in, you know, a bunch of computers.

1239
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:35,740
You know, you can't access the data and then put an AI on it and work, you know, work with it that way.

1240
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:40,820
It's actually a transmission from person to person.

1241
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:52,740
So and also it's got the spiritual kind of mystical guise to it that a lot of them aren't adequately prepared to understand or even see.

1242
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:56,460
So I always felt like I was going to give them a disappointing answer.

1243
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,540
You know, can you do this for me? You know, kind of thing.

1244
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:08,940
And I'm thinking, even if I did do it for you, you will not be able to access this because you don't understand what it is and how it gets passed down.

1245
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:17,780
So a lot of the UFO communities, the people who work in them are passing it down in orally transmitted tradition.

1246
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:22,420
So it's something that. And there's lots of reasons for that.

1247
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:32,420
Part of it is just to keep it super secret because it's not, you know, you can't I can't take my phone and get it from you, you know, like with a program or an app.

1248
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:36,020
Right. It's actually it's in your body.

1249
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:41,940
And it seems like something that even if somebody wanted to, it couldn't be used as a weapon.

1250
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,620
It's not something somebody can weaponize.

1251
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,980
Yeah. And that's kind of cool.

1252
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:53,660
Because once you discover it, it's like a whole nother thing, like a whole nother another universe inside you that you can that you can connect to.

1253
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:56,540
Yeah. But then why would you want to keep a secret?

1254
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:58,620
Why would good people want to keep it secret?

1255
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:03,700
OK, so I think that we have to understand that we're living in a world of kind of like war, right?

1256
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:08,020
Like there's a lot of war going on that is not actually the war we see in Ukraine.

1257
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:09,740
Right. It's not that kind of war.

1258
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:13,260
It's more of an informational war, but it has real effects.

1259
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:15,300
It has effects on people's mental health.

1260
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:21,380
It has effects on what they believe, what they'll buy, what they won't buy, whether they're vaccinated or not vaccinated.

1261
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:23,540
You know, this is actually in real time happening.

1262
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:36,900
Yeah. And so so we have to understand that that that those interests, you know, our security is a lot based on that, on this this war that's going on.

1263
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:40,060
So how so our security?

1264
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:47,300
Well, it's really easily to infiltrate the boundaries of technology, like through different access points.

1265
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:51,740
You know, when you open your computer, you're already a vulnerable target.

1266
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:58,940
Whereas if you didn't have that, you wouldn't be as vulnerable and war would be fought in the way in which you're saying like a mind war.

1267
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,140
Yeah. Yeah. Virtual warfare.

1268
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:05,420
So you're what you're describing is like the like human beings.

1269
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:10,420
We are so we are almost already cyborgs because we're always connected to our phones.

1270
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:13,380
We spend most of our time staring at iPhone screens or whatever.

1271
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,740
And it's easy to be that kind of stuff.

1272
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:20,900
That media is very easily manipulated by somebody who has an agenda.

1273
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:23,780
Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, this is nothing new.

1274
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:28,100
Right. Right. I learned about this when I, you know, freshman in university.

1275
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:30,620
So I thought I was going to be a doctor.

1276
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:37,300
So I was taking classes in nutrition and I was at a great agricultural school, University of California at Davis.

1277
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:43,500
And all my nutrition classes, I thought I was going to learn about how to make people healthy and, you know, things like that.

1278
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:50,140
But I didn't actually. I learned about how we can make square tomatoes through genetic engineering that sell.

1279
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:53,260
And yeah, they didn't have any nutritional content.

1280
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:58,220
And how Edward Bernays shifted the four food groups and things like that.

1281
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:01,980
I mean, my mind was like, whoa, OK, so this is what it's about.

1282
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:06,860
And so, yeah, so this is just the world we live in.

1283
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:09,980
Edward Bernays is a wild character. Yeah.

1284
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:12,820
I watched a documentary on him by Adam Curtis.

1285
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:14,460
Have you seen that one? Yes.

1286
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:18,100
Where he I guess he's the guy who brought consumerism to the United States, right?

1287
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:22,620
Like, he's one who developed it and like brought the subconscious mind into marketing.

1288
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:24,020
Yes. Yes. One of the greats.

1289
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:28,580
One of my favorite parts about that documentary is how he consulted with.

1290
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:32,780
I think it was either an agency or it was with the company itself.

1291
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:36,940
I think it was Betty Crocker and there was a cake mix they were trying to sell more of.

1292
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:41,540
People weren't buying it. And they found they did a focus group where I guess they studied housewives.

1293
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:46,020
And the housewives felt guilty making this cake because they didn't do enough work.

1294
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:49,100
So they added an egg.

1295
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,420
Well, let's put on the instructions. Crack an egg.

1296
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:53,260
And now they felt like they were doing the work.

1297
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:56,260
They didn't have that guilt anymore. And it started flying off the shelves.

1298
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:04,300
Yeah. So Bernays is kind of, you know, all over our culture made huge inroads into everything.

1299
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:11,340
So everything you have to think about from that perspective, like what we eat, you know, everything, the brand.

1300
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:17,860
Yes, the brand. And then I was just talking about this on a podcast a couple of days ago.

1301
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:21,060
The food pyramid is like upside down.

1302
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,460
Yeah, yeah.

1303
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:31,060
And there was like a bunch of lobbying that went into the original food pyramid from like a bunch of food product or food brands.

1304
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:36,980
Yeah. So I learned this. But, you know, they weren't teaching it to me like, hey, this is kind of terrible and people need to eat better.

1305
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:41,260
They were teaching it to me like, OK, this is the best way to do it.

1306
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:45,300
And that's why, by the way, I started to take philosophy classes.

1307
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:47,700
What do you mean by that? OK, this is the best way to do it.

1308
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:55,020
Yeah. So they weren't. So there was no like self-consciousness about do we really want to make a square tomato?

1309
01:35:55,020 --> 01:36:01,340
So what if it sells better and, you know, gets into a box and we're able to ship it anywhere in the world?

1310
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:04,220
Like, it's not really that good for you. Right.

1311
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:09,340
Maybe, you know, so there was no question about the health of the people that were going to eat the tomato.

1312
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:13,900
It was is this the most efficient way to make money off of a tomato?

1313
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:17,780
That's what I was learning about. And there was no self-consciousness at that time.

1314
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:21,860
I mean, I'm hoping that it's changed since I was a freshman.

1315
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:25,860
Right. There's this great quote in this show called Westworld.

1316
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:30,300
I don't know if you're familiar with the Westworld on HBO, but it's Anthony Hopkins.

1317
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:39,180
He's talking to one of the robots that he made and he's talking about human consciousness is like peacock feathers.

1318
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:45,260
And he goes, look at the some of the greatest pieces, the greatest creations that humans have ever made.

1319
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:50,900
He said, look at the Eiffel Tower, look at Mozart, look at Rembrandt.

1320
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:55,940
All of it is just an elaborate mating call. Peacock feathers.

1321
01:36:55,940 --> 01:37:02,060
And it makes me like that really made me think like even going to people like Elon Musk, right,

1322
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:08,460
who talks about this grandiose idea of I want to I want to make our species interplanetary.

1323
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:16,060
I want to send, you know, make do all these great things, eliminate carbon emissions and all this stuff.

1324
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:18,460
It's a it's a terrific story.

1325
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:26,060
But I always question, like, is it really all just about becoming richer and making another making billions of dollars?

1326
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:29,580
Is it making more and more money? Like, I always question like these crazy billionaires.

1327
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:35,420
Like, if I was Elon Musk or if I was Jeff Bezos, like, what is the motivation?

1328
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:40,140
Really? Like when you really drill down deep into the core.

1329
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:45,380
And I always wonder if it's just a big, elaborate display of peacock feathers.

1330
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:49,500
I would suggest no. I used to I have, of course, thought about this.

1331
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:52,500
But a lot of it, yes, is.

1332
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:57,540
But a lot of the great things are just done because of pure love and enjoyment.

1333
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:03,500
You know, a lot of like think of the quote unquote stereotypical cliche starving artists.

1334
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:07,220
A lot of artists were doing their work and they were starving, but they were doing it anyway,

1335
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:10,020
because that's where they felt most alive.

1336
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:13,300
Absolutely philosophers are, you know, the philosophical work.

1337
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,060
This is not a mating call. Right.

1338
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,780
They're basically like doing this to survive, to live.

1339
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:24,140
You know, a lot of them were on the edge of suicide because they saw the cave and they were like, is this it?

1340
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,500
You know, I don't want to do this. I don't want to play that game.

1341
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,460
I don't want to play play the game of the big peacock feather.

1342
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:31,780
I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to engage.

1343
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:34,540
Yeah. Turing is a great example of that.

1344
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,420
A lot of people throughout history. You're right.

1345
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:40,420
Yeah. So no. So I can tell you, no, it's not all about the big piece.

1346
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:45,180
It's just the ones that we know about because they're so just like Plato says, you know,

1347
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:49,780
they're so out there and we see them and they're so in our faces.

1348
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:56,500
And, you know, and Socrates said this in Phaedrus, you know, he in this book Phaedrus that Plato wrote,

1349
01:38:56,500 --> 01:39:01,540
he said, you know, once once writing happens, he was criticizing the technology of writing.

1350
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:04,460
He said, once writing happens, people aren't going to know stuff.

1351
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:08,900
And it's going to be really horrible to be around them because they're going to be completely all about that.

1352
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,940
I'm paraphrasing all about themselves.

1353
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:16,300
And they're going to be insufferable company instead of actually people that you want to talk to because they know some stuff.

1354
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:18,460
And, you know, you have a good conversation with them.

1355
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:21,900
They're going to be all about their ego, basically, is what he was saying.

1356
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:27,940
So he was connecting writing to ego. Yes. Yeah.

1357
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:39,780
So like saying that there's is the idea that people could basically read a lot of books and gain knowledge through reading about it,

1358
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:42,020
but not actually having it, not actually having it.

1359
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:45,740
Yeah. And it's really interesting, too. I happen to think this is really an interesting point.

1360
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:47,940
I do, too. I think about this all the time, actually.

1361
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:53,820
Yeah, I do. The knowledge by there's actually a term I read recently where it's knowledge.

1362
01:39:53,820 --> 01:40:01,780
I've read about it. Knowledge by association or by acquaintance versus I think it was versus knowledge by association,

1363
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:11,980
because everything we see in media, I think, you know, every single YouTube channel, that's a guy who's a talking head who talks about politics.

1364
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:16,660
It's just they're all they're doing is reading the news or reading Twitter and reporting on it.

1365
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:21,580
They don't they don't experience stuff. They read stuff. Yeah.

1366
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:24,700
Or they listen to stuff and then they report it back.

1367
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:30,820
Yeah. Even on like the news, like the television news, those people aren't aren't experiencing much.

1368
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:40,540
Maybe there's situations where guys like go overseas into a war zone and experience being in the middle of a firefight and bullets flying everywhere and like meet people.

1369
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:45,460
There's definitely that. But I think most of it on TV is especially when it comes to like the talking heads.

1370
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:49,260
All of it is what you're talking about. Yeah. Secondary knowledge.

1371
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:56,140
Yeah, they don't. So yeah. So Socrates identified this as a actually when I look back at this and I reread him,

1372
01:40:56,140 --> 01:41:06,500
I see it as a turning point in the Western culture in the sense that he actually referenced knowledge that people would get from their actual environment.

1373
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:16,460
It almost sounds like I can't prove this, but it almost sounds like he's talking about a download experience within the context of the environment where,

1374
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:23,100
you know, you have indigenous cultures where people have so much knowledge about their environment, right?

1375
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:29,340
They can hear things like if you and I went out into the forest, like the rainforest, like in Brazil or something like that,

1376
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:35,340
and they would be able to hear the different sounds in the forest and know exactly what was going to happen,

1377
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:43,260
like either rain coming or, you know, whether a dangerous animal is going to be there or, you know, what the state of the forest.

1378
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:48,260
You and I wouldn't hear that at all. We would go in there. We just hear like what we would consider to be forest noises.

1379
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:54,300
We would be able to. So we don't have any intimate experience of our environments. Right.

1380
01:41:54,300 --> 01:42:05,420
And so Socrates was actually telling Plato about this and talking about how there was a once when people learned from the trees and they had this knowledge.

1381
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:13,220
But Plato made, I mean, Socrates made a joke and he said, but you guys, you're you're so young and knowledgeable, you wouldn't know about this.

1382
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:22,540
So he's basically, you know, he's basically decrying this loss of of this intimate knowledge and that technology was actually going to foster it even worse.

1383
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:27,900
And it was going to create a type of person that was egotistical and think they know everything.

1384
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:31,660
But and they were going to be horrible to be around. And I thought that was really funny.

1385
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:39,980
But I agree with you. I see that I even see that in my own field, like people talking about a topic like in my field, there's a push to publish.

1386
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:46,780
We have to publish a lot. And I just can't do that. I have to actually be I have to do field research.

1387
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:54,980
I have to go out to communities of people who are doing this kind of thing in order to get information like how else are you going to get that information other than being around them?

1388
01:42:54,980 --> 01:43:00,780
But a lot of people don't do that. They actually just read a bunch of books about it and they go on Twitter or wherever.

1389
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:04,460
And they get that information and then they write a book like every two years.

1390
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:09,060
And I just can't understand how first they could think that that's responsible.

1391
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:15,260
But, you know, put it out there for people to read because you don't actually know about what these people think or what they're doing.

1392
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:22,980
That's why the data that's happening with in the UFO community, you know, are you actually talking to these people and listening to what they say?

1393
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:28,420
So, yeah, so there's this whole, you know, difference in knowledge.

1394
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:45,500
Yeah, and some of the people that sort of like take the ball and run with it are sometimes very charismatic or very economically minded or other or know how to make money and know how to capitalize on certain things and sort of run with it.

1395
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:54,020
And some of the people that are actually like experiencing the stuff or doing like the real work and the real research, sometimes they may not have the skill in communicating it.

1396
01:43:54,020 --> 01:44:04,140
But the people who have the knowledge maybe have a better way of connecting with people and communicating a message, you know, so sometimes I guess it can work hand in hand.

1397
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:12,940
Yeah, yeah, like a lot of the people that I found that interface with this phenomenon, they they don't have big platforms.

1398
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:23,060
And even if they did, I don't think a lot of people would be able to understand what they're saying because they're so really a lot of them are so intelligent and out there, you know,

1399
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:26,900
and they're talking sometimes in mathematical terms.

1400
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:29,860
Who's going to get that? Who's going to understand it in popular culture?

1401
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:34,580
Right. All right. Let's let's talk about Jacques Vallee.

1402
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:46,300
So there's a chapter in your book where you mention what I think was one of the most fascinating parts that stuck out to me the most was you go to his apartment in northern California.

1403
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:51,620
Can you describe what happened there?

1404
01:44:51,620 --> 01:45:05,820
Yeah. So, OK, so I know Jacques and we've, you know, worked together and our colleagues basically for a long time.

1405
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:20,900
And I this one time, I went to his apartment and we were going to talk about the topic of the research that we were, you know, his research, my research.

1406
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:31,740
And so his he has a beautiful apartment and has an amazing view of San Francisco.

1407
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:40,900
And so we were in his apartment and he showed me the his library, which is really amazing.

1408
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:52,860
And he had a lot of, you know, historical things from the history of ufology in the United States and things from, you know, European Catholic history,

1409
01:45:52,860 --> 01:46:03,060
like looked like extent, you know, copies of books about angels and things like that.

1410
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:09,780
So it was it was amazing and things that belonged to Alan Hynek and things like that.

1411
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:13,180
And Alan Hynek was the guy who started Project Blue Book.

1412
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:18,540
Yeah, he was one of the people in the head of Project Blue Book, like the main scientist Jacques worked with him.

1413
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:22,500
Yeah, Jacques worked with Alan Hynek. Yeah.

1414
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:31,700
And they were both part of the reason for that chapter was I wanted to talk about the elements of the mystical elements that each were interested in,

1415
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:39,940
which include they were not affiliated with any Rosicrucian temples, but they were interested in Rosicrucianism.

1416
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:42,340
What is Rosicrucianism?

1417
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:50,460
OK, so Rosicrucianism is an esoteric tradition that looks like it comes from about the early modern time period.

1418
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:55,580
But its practitioners, a lot of its practitioners say that it goes back to Egyptian times.

1419
01:46:55,580 --> 01:47:04,020
But it looks like a I mean, depending on which histories of it you read, you'll get a different perspective.

1420
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:11,460
But it looks to be started around the early modern time period among scientists who had to be really careful.

1421
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:20,260
In fact, the invisible college comes from that early modern time period of Francis Bacon basically doing work as a scientist.

1422
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:25,180
But at that time period, science was risky because you could be killed for doing it.

1423
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:27,940
You know, so they called themselves the invisible college.

1424
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:34,340
And so Hynek repurposed that term for his group of people that were studying UFOs.

1425
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:41,140
And you had to be careful, you know, because if you're a scientist and you came out as a person who studied UFOs, you were immediately discredited.

1426
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:46,700
Hynek was one of the first guys to like build this bridge between science and spirituality.

1427
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:49,660
Is that sort of like the backbone of what this is about?

1428
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:56,660
I don't know. I don't think he was one of the first guys, but he was he's definitely a well-known figure who's not known to have done that.

1429
01:47:56,660 --> 01:48:02,220
And so there's a focus I put in the book on his his melding of the two.

1430
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:14,940
And you you were shocked, I think, to see all of the books that he had on on angels that were in his library.

1431
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:16,540
I was.

1432
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:18,060
What would you ask him about that?

1433
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:20,220
What did he say about that?

1434
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:29,540
So in the library, we he showed me a lot of books about, you know, like like I said, the history of ufology, like, you know, historical stuff from Project Blue Book.

1435
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:32,380
Right. That's the kind of stuff that I would expect to see in Jacques Vallée's library.

1436
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:42,900
It's really interesting. And so but the most of the library was dedicated to these very old books of of angels.

1437
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:52,580
And so he took out a couple and he showed them to me and he had a whole row of angels and a whole row of like fallen angels type thing.

1438
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:56,380
And he made some jokes about it. You know, well, if you have one, you have to have the other kind of thing.

1439
01:48:56,380 --> 01:49:06,700
And so, yeah, I guess the emphasis, I mean, I know that he has like a huge historical knowledge, obviously, with Passport to Magonia.

1440
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:10,700
I mean, that's a book about the whole history of, you know, kind of the Western history.

1441
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:16,820
It almost reads like a religious studies book about the the phenomena in history.

1442
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:19,900
And so, of course, I knew that he did have this knowledge.

1443
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:24,140
I just didn't know to the extent to which he studied it.

1444
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:33,860
So these having these books, especially purchasing them and having them, you know, it's one thing to go to archives like kind of like I do and read them.

1445
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:40,580
But to get them and to acquire them, to keep them in your own home, these are old books that require a certain, you know,

1446
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:44,540
they could disintegrate. The papers can disintegrate.

1447
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:48,620
So you have to have a climate controlled environment.

1448
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:53,740
They were kind of difficult to keep. So he had a huge library of these books.

1449
01:49:53,740 --> 01:50:05,060
So, yes. So it just reconfirmed for me that the focus of that chapter should be on the spiritual elements in the history and his focus on this esoteric tradition,

1450
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,380
as well as Hynek's focus on this esoteric tradition.

1451
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:12,260
It reconfirmed for me that that was appropriate.

1452
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:17,620
And he gave you a book at the end of your meeting with him that day.

1453
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:19,660
What was this book?

1454
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:22,540
OK, so book on the devil.

1455
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:24,580
Well, well, it was a history of Satan.

1456
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:30,220
OK. And it was it was done by these Carmelite nuns.

1457
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:33,940
And so he gave me the book and he said, you should try to acquire this book.

1458
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:35,500
It's really good.

1459
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:39,820
And I looked at it and then the page on it was really interesting.

1460
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:42,580
It was the the last page was 666.

1461
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:46,700
So he laughed and said they had a sense of humor, you know.

1462
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:54,300
And so, yeah, that was at the time I was really shocked by that and and thought it was what?

1463
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:59,820
You know, so it took me a while to actually talk to him about it because I thought, how do you ask somebody about this?

1464
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:08,580
So I did ask him and he said that, you know, and he's right.

1465
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:20,860
So the way we see he was basically suggesting it because of the ways in which you know how the ways in which the UFO are made to look kind of a certain way.

1466
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:29,740
But when you look into it, they look different and the same same way with religious traditions like Teresa of Avila's experience with the little angel.

1467
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:37,500
If you look at pictures and paintings from that and the statue of that, it looks very different than the primary source material.

1468
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:40,980
OK, like the like the description that she actually gave when she wrote it.

1469
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:46,100
Yeah, it looks completely different than what you call it telephone game.

1470
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:49,340
Right. Yeah. So there's telephone game in texts, too.

1471
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:54,140
Right. And in representations of spiritual experiences.

1472
01:51:54,140 --> 01:52:03,700
So basically, he was saying that that if you look at the history of this person, you know, well, not person with his being, that it's going to look completely different.

1473
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:12,420
And the people that did the best biography are these Carmelite nuns who had access to all of the primary source material.

1474
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:20,260
Did you read the book? So I did look for the book and I didn't do a hard search for it because I was so busy.

1475
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:22,580
I haven't been able to. But I do want to acquire the book. Absolutely.

1476
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:36,460
So, no, I have not read it. But, you know, his work is basically to look at these texts, just like my work is to look at the primary sources and to create his own understanding of it instead of looking at what people say about these primary sources.

1477
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:41,780
So that's the work he was trying to do with that book and why he gave it to me.

1478
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:46,020
I think he also gave it to me because I'm not sure. He's funny. He's got a good sense of humor.

1479
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:50,540
He may have been trying to kind of shock me. I don't know. But it was pretty funny at the time.

1480
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:58,340
So I'm sure you've done a lot of I'm just interested in this because I'm interested in the devil personally.

1481
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:08,140
OK. And one of the famous quotes, I wrote it down here, one of the the old sayings that I love is the devil has always been the church's best friend because he kept him in business.

1482
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:11,260
You've heard that, I'm sure. Yes.

1483
01:53:11,380 --> 01:53:14,220
And I had a guy on here recently who was teaching me all about the devil.

1484
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:19,060
He did a little documentary on the history of Lucifer.

1485
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:22,900
And he basically said that Lucifer was never real.

1486
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:26,100
Well, I mean, that's like saying God has never been real.

1487
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:30,540
Right. So we can't actually prove the existence of the beings that people believe in.

1488
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:32,980
OK. There's no microscope.

1489
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,740
OK. This is being exists.

1490
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:41,220
Right. Which is kind of an interesting critique of religion, because there's a lot of things we can't.

1491
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:46,940
Actually prove the existence of like when we tried to prove the existence of atoms, you know, they kind of go around.

1492
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:49,100
Electrons move in different directions.

1493
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:56,780
And, you know, so scientists even have a hard time proving what they believe to be like real kinds of things.

1494
01:53:56,860 --> 01:53:58,460
OK. So all right.

1495
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:10,900
So as a person who studies religion, when you start to look at the ways in which either Satan and there is a named Satan in the Bible.

1496
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:17,500
Which is the Hebrew Bible, Christian Old Testament and New Testament.

1497
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:22,060
Right. So and Lucifer.

1498
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:26,380
So you look at these, you see that the Bible's created.

1499
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:34,460
It's basically a bunch of different books put together and they're written by different people over many, many years, hundreds of years.

1500
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:35,380
OK. OK.

1501
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:45,500
So the the depictions of like the Satan in the Book of Job, for example, looks to be like, you know, he's kind of like a friend of God.

1502
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:56,260
Right. So if you look at that depiction of Satan and then you look at the depiction of Satan and other texts in the Bible, they look to be terrible or something completely different than that.

1503
01:54:56,660 --> 01:55:04,180
So there's no it doesn't look like there's like a cohesive person or entity that's Satan.

1504
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:17,620
Now, if you look at the extra texts that go into the formation of, say, Christianity or, you know, different like if you will, it's just take Christianity.

1505
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:19,820
That's what I'm most informed in.

1506
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:32,580
You'll see that there are other texts that talk about this being and, you know, and then you have people that have experiences of this being and or of evil and they call it Satan.

1507
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:37,140
So I'm not I haven't listened to that podcast that you did with that person.

1508
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:53,220
But in terms of the unreality of it, I would say that if you're looking at a cohesive person, you know, or a cohesive entity called Satan, it's not cohesive within the Bible.

1509
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:54,100
You're not going to see that.

1510
01:55:54,380 --> 01:56:06,780
But if you look at it within the various traditions that discuss this person or assume it and, you know, in various denominations of Christianity, Satan exists or doesn't exist.

1511
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:16,820
So, you know, there are some denominations that don't talk about Satan, even certain factions of one denomination that will talk about Satan or not talk about Satan.

1512
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:21,860
So, yeah, that would be my my answer.

1513
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:25,940
I think James Fox's creature in Virginia could have been Satan.

1514
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:28,540
Yeah. So when you Yeah, exactly.

1515
01:56:28,580 --> 01:56:32,700
That's my point is that you have descriptions of weird things like that.

1516
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:34,660
And then people ascribe it to Satan.

1517
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:37,740
They say this must be Satan or this must be a demon or something like that.

1518
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:40,420
And you still have that within Catholic cultures.

1519
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:49,580
If you have a UFO sighting and there happens to be the smell of sulfur and, you know, these beans that look like this, they're going to say the same thing because they still believe in that.

1520
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:50,540
That's still their culture.

1521
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:54,260
What did Nietzsche mean when he said God is dead?

1522
01:56:55,700 --> 01:57:03,540
And you talked about before, like you you weren't a fan of Nietzsche until like there was this weird you talk about synchronicities a lot in your first book.

1523
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:11,340
Yeah. And how it was a synchronicity in itself, the fact that the when you picked up a book by Nietzsche.

1524
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:26,340
There were OK. So synchronicity, when you do fields research and religious studies, you find that no matter what religion or denomination, synchronicity for people, meaningful coincidences, it's like the engine of spiritual belief.

1525
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:34,620
So people in the Catholic when I was doing my book on purgatory, a lot of Catholics were telling me their synchronicities and them saying so it was a sign from God.

1526
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:37,340
You know, and I noticed this in the UFO community, too.

1527
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:39,380
People had like a lot of synchronicities.

1528
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:47,380
I did, too. And people ascribed meaning to them like, you know, I must be on the right path because this is happening and things like that.

1529
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:50,460
And of course, when these things happen, it's pretty interesting.

1530
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:52,340
It's like, wow, this is so interesting.

1531
01:57:52,340 --> 01:57:55,860
Right. And I've had those experiences and have them all the time.

1532
01:57:55,860 --> 01:58:06,820
And of course, I'm I step back, though, and I don't want to ascribe any kind of overarching theory or meaning to them because they could just be by chance.

1533
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:09,100
Right. And so Nietzsche, Nietzsche.

1534
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:11,540
And so I've been thinking about this for a very long time.

1535
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:19,020
And it wasn't the first time I picked up a book by Nietzsche because a lot of my friends wanted me to like Nietzsche.

1536
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:23,100
They would try. They gave me books and they'd say, read this, read this.

1537
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,300
You got it. You're going to love Nietzsche.

1538
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:25,820
And I would start to read him.

1539
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:27,740
And I hated his philosophy.

1540
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:29,020
I was like, oh, this guy's.

1541
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:30,820
What about his philosophy did you hate?

1542
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:36,460
He seemed really arrogant and he was very sexist and racist.

1543
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:40,300
And I really didn't want to fill my head with that kind of philosophy.

1544
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:44,780
So I didn't think he was really that interesting.

1545
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:46,900
And so I never it never stuck.

1546
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:57,820
Right. So one day it was on New Year's Eve and it was I was not out there partying with everyone, but I could hear everyone partying.

1547
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:00,740
And I decided to try to get some sleep.

1548
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:06,340
So I went to bed and at midnight, everybody was partying so much.

1549
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:10,020
I heard everything. I woke up and I was like, oh, what am I going to do now?

1550
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:12,340
And I saw this book by Nietzsche by the bed.

1551
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:15,020
So I picked it up and I opened it up randomly.

1552
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:17,900
And I opened it up, by the way, it was the gay science.

1553
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:25,540
And I opened it up to I think it was aphorism 273, but it was a book, book two, which was St.

1554
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:27,780
January, Sanctus Januarius.

1555
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:28,940
It was about the same.

1556
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:33,620
And I was like, OK, it's like the January.

1557
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:35,820
It was January 1st.

1558
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:38,420
So I thought that's a weird kind of coincidence.

1559
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:43,420
And I opened it up and it was basically, he said, today's New Year's.

1560
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:46,980
And I was like, it is New Year's, you know, and I thought it was really interesting.

1561
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:49,980
I was I was hooked and I was like, OK, what is he going to say about New Year's?

1562
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:56,020
He said today he was declaring his philosophy of amor fati, which is the love of one's fate.

1563
01:59:56,220 --> 02:00:00,700
So when you're disgusted by life and life gives you all these terrible things, you know,

1564
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:03,940
just look away, like don't try to fight it.

1565
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:07,500
Just look away from it into something different and more beautiful.

1566
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:11,060
And so that was his like that was some kind of revelation to him.

1567
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:13,780
He was imparting that and I was like, oh, that's really cool.

1568
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:18,340
I like that. And I turned the page and basically I thought, what a cool synchronicity.

1569
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:20,580
Right. I really kind of it.

1570
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:23,020
The feel of the synchronicity was really intense.

1571
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:27,180
The next aphorism, the very next page was basically

1572
02:00:27,860 --> 02:00:32,700
an argument against ascribing meaning to synchronicities.

1573
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:36,260
It was beautiful. It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever read.

1574
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:41,900
I was like, OK, like I was just about to ascribe significance to this synchronicity.

1575
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:46,100
And now I feel like he's telling me not to like he literally is telling me this.

1576
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:50,220
And so I put the book, I put it down and I was like, that was weird.

1577
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:53,420
And then I picked it up again and I've been hooked on Nietzsche ever since.

1578
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:55,980
I love. I love. Yeah, it was really, really interesting.

1579
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:59,020
And it also made me really think about synchronicities,

1580
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:01,180
like what's going on with these things.

1581
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:06,020
And so I'm generally inclined to agree with him that, you know,

1582
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:09,940
he was really poetic in the way he said, don't you know, when it seems like

1583
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:14,860
everything has this personal meaning for you, when something even a terrible thing

1584
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:16,940
happens, but it happens for the very best.

1585
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:21,500
Don't think that it's any kind of God that's leading you on your way.

1586
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:24,260
It's the most beautiful.

1587
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:28,980
It's the epitome of being alive when you recognize this as the beauty of chance.

1588
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:34,300
And I was like, wow, OK, I'm hooked on that interpretation of synchronicities.

1589
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:38,780
And so I try to when synchronicities happen a lot and they do.

1590
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:43,580
I think it's just something that is actually just like Plato's

1591
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:45,820
cave is structural for Western society.

1592
02:01:45,820 --> 02:01:48,020
I think that it's structural for being human.

1593
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:51,820
Like we people from indigenous cultures also talk about this as well.

1594
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:55,820
And they they say that rational science doesn't actually understand

1595
02:01:55,820 --> 02:01:58,780
that when you're when you're really in tune with your environment,

1596
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:02,260
like these things are they just happen and they're part of being human.

1597
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:05,420
And it's part of what makes being human

1598
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:07,780
fun and interesting.

1599
02:02:07,780 --> 02:02:09,380
But, you know, scientists are doing this, too.

1600
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:11,900
Scientists are having some pretty intense synchronicities.

1601
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:17,580
And and they feel like, you know, oh, this is it.

1602
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:21,020
You know, this is going to help me with this technology or this equation

1603
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:22,140
or something like that.

1604
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:24,300
So I think it might have to do with

1605
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:32,140
learning or being open to being taught by your environment, life, you know,

1606
02:02:32,940 --> 02:02:34,780
something like that. I mean, I'm still to tell you the truth.

1607
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:37,060
I'm still trying to figure it out. Yeah.

1608
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:41,500
Do you think that this whole this whole thing that's going on right now

1609
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:46,140
with with technology and like Chachi PT and UFOs,

1610
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:53,740
do you think that this is is becoming like a a new religion for Western society?

1611
02:02:54,340 --> 02:02:56,220
No, I don't think it's becoming a new religion.

1612
02:02:56,220 --> 02:02:58,860
I think that that people are

1613
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:03,140
there is a religiosity.

1614
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:06,580
OK, so a religion is something pretty discrete, has a beginning

1615
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:09,820
and there's usually a person associated with it, like, you know, a figurehead.

1616
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:14,660
And it's an ongoing kind of.

1617
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:18,300
Formation that has dogmas associated with it.

1618
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:23,900
So what I see right now with technology and especially AI and its association,

1619
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:27,460
you know, there's a what I would call a religiosity.

1620
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:32,740
And this is what I identify as the UFO thing, too, because there are religions

1621
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:36,780
that focus and emphasize UFOs.

1622
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:41,060
OK, so like the nation of Islam, it's found, you know, it's

1623
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:45,620
there's a belief in that religion that there's a mothership

1624
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:49,060
and that in the end times, the mothership is going to show up again

1625
02:03:49,820 --> 02:03:54,460
and that these little UFOs that people see, they're part of the mothership.

1626
02:03:54,860 --> 02:03:56,620
They're little. Really? Yeah, yeah.

1627
02:03:56,620 --> 02:03:58,180
This is a nation of Islam.

1628
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:00,420
So this is a distinct UFO religion.

1629
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:05,820
But what I see right now is this pervasive belief in UFOs kind of on the rise,

1630
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:09,140
giving given credence by the U.S.

1631
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:11,780
government, basically saying, you know, with the Pentagon report

1632
02:04:12,180 --> 02:04:14,100
and a lot of the media associated with it.

1633
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:17,340
And this is kind of this, you know, a lot of times

1634
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:21,940
we can't prove that religious things exist.

1635
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:23,700
We base it on testimony.

1636
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:26,380
And that's very similar to what happens with UFOs.

1637
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:28,420
You know, we have testimony and things like that.

1638
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:31,260
So I see this kind of as

1639
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:35,580
an effect of technology, the decentralization of religion.

1640
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:38,180
That's what I think is happening.

1641
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:40,380
What do you think of the whole Bob Lazar story?

1642
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:46,300
OK, so I don't have I can't say I believe it or disbelieve it.

1643
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:50,340
There's so much about it out there.

1644
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:55,300
Obviously, he himself has been discredited by a lot of people.

1645
02:04:56,420 --> 02:05:00,220
I know people in the invisible college who think it's not true,

1646
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:03,460
but I also know people who are even

1647
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:07,660
more like associated with some programs

1648
02:05:07,940 --> 02:05:12,380
that interface with phenomena and, you know, do work in that regard

1649
02:05:12,820 --> 02:05:14,700
are super scientific.

1650
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:16,780
And then people that do like back engineering stuff.

1651
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:18,100
Well, they say they do.

1652
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:19,660
I can't say whether they do or not.

1653
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:21,860
I don't know. But they claim to. OK.

1654
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:23,260
And they believe him.

1655
02:05:23,260 --> 02:05:25,980
And they say that a lot believe him. Yeah.

1656
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:32,220
And they say that they believe that they've said that he's now

1657
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:34,380
this is like stuff I can't confirm, though, Danny.

1658
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:35,580
So, you know, OK.

1659
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:39,700
So but but they say so it's really confusing to me, too,

1660
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:41,460
just like for everyone else.

1661
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:45,340
But one piece of information that I think isn't out there is that

1662
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:50,900
what they said was that if this information is going to come out,

1663
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:55,180
it's not going to come out through someone like with a PhD telling you this.

1664
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:58,580
It's like it's going to come out through these people

1665
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:02,460
who can be completely discredited if needed to be.

1666
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:08,100
The thing about him is like if he is this incredible whistleblower,

1667
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:11,220
like blowing the whistle on one of the government's most secret

1668
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:14,460
programs in the history of the government, right, like

1669
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:19,820
there that how is he still getting like government contracts

1670
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:21,980
with this company and doing all this crazy work?

1671
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:26,260
Because if you think of like some of the whistleblowers of our modern time,

1672
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:28,460
they're not still working with the government

1673
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:30,420
and living freely in the United States.

1674
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:33,540
I know that's one of the perplexing things to me.

1675
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:36,500
And for me to have.

1676
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:40,140
People on this side who are so invested

1677
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:42,860
in the UFO thing for years and years and years, like their whole lives

1678
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:46,220
and scientists adamantly against him.

1679
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:49,700
And then people on this side who have the same credentials,

1680
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:53,380
the same investment of time adamantly for him.

1681
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:55,820
It makes it crazy.

1682
02:06:55,820 --> 02:06:57,540
Yeah, it's so polarizing.

1683
02:06:57,540 --> 02:07:00,100
And why hasn't he actually done like a real debate?

1684
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:04,860
You know, like with a scientist or with I mean, he's done the public facing stuff.

1685
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:07,660
Yeah, I don't I don't think he could keep up with a scientist.

1686
02:07:07,660 --> 02:07:09,900
I mean, excuse me, Bob Lazar for saying that.

1687
02:07:11,180 --> 02:07:12,420
You don't think you keep up with them?

1688
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:15,420
No, no. I mean, they're going to be asking him specific kinds of questions,

1689
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:19,100
you know, and I don't think he's able to or maybe he's just, you know,

1690
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:22,700
there are clips of him saying he wish he never came out to talk about it.

1691
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,620
So maybe he's just sick of all the media attention.

1692
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:27,740
Why would he not want to?

1693
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:29,980
Why wouldn't he be able to keep up with some of the scientists?

1694
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:32,820
Like if he was one of them, like he seems like one of the most like

1695
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:34,900
one of the smartest guys ever.

1696
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:38,780
And he went to this secret super secret place with all these other genius.

1697
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:41,020
He was kind of a genius.

1698
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:46,100
I think because a lot of people who are OK, so let's take Tyler.

1699
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:49,940
Tyler graduated from college, but barely.

1700
02:07:50,580 --> 02:07:54,260
But really, he had but has like more than forty five patents.

1701
02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:57,980
And like so a lot of these people who are geniuses,

1702
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:01,220
they're very specifically geniuses and they're downloading,

1703
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:04,420
but they don't have the infrastructure in their heads from years

1704
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:06,660
and years at MIT or something like that.

1705
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:10,180
They're like, I don't know what you call them, like local geniuses.

1706
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:13,540
They're geniuses in this one specific thing. Right.

1707
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:15,860
What was he specifically good at?

1708
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:20,740
OK, so he basically created the basis for a lot of biotechnologies

1709
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:23,820
that were used in different kinds of things.

1710
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:27,820
And he created companies that were sold on NASDAQ

1711
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:30,580
for upwards of like one hundred million dollars and stuff like that.

1712
02:08:30,980 --> 02:08:34,340
And this was all done like privately without being involved in like any.

1713
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:36,780
Were these like big government contracts or were these just?

1714
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:38,740
No, he created these things.

1715
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:41,460
He created the patents for them.

1716
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:43,540
And some of them he worked with.

1717
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:46,980
He he flew his first big.

1718
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:50,700
Thing that he created that was a biotechnology

1719
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:54,140
was an experiment that he flew on one of the space shuttles

1720
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:57,220
because it had to be done in like zero gravity environment in space.

1721
02:08:57,580 --> 02:08:59,620
And it was successful.

1722
02:08:59,700 --> 02:09:02,540
But that was actually taken from him from by the government.

1723
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:04,700
And so he was mad about that.

1724
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:08,780
So he quit the space program for a while and he went privately

1725
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:10,860
and did a lot of this stuff on his own.

1726
02:09:10,860 --> 02:09:14,460
So, yeah, so then he worked with biotechnology companies

1727
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:16,140
to create these companies.

1728
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:18,940
And then he was recruited back into the space program.

1729
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:21,860
Oh, wow. Did he ever go into space?

1730
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:24,220
Almost almost.

1731
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:27,220
Yeah, yeah, he was like 60,000 or I don't know.

1732
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:30,300
It was like really high up, right, because he would go up there

1733
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:33,540
in order to look well, I don't know exactly what he was doing.

1734
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:35,580
I shouldn't really talk about it because I really don't know.

1735
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:38,820
But but no, he he was a pilot, but he never went into space.

1736
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:44,260
But he would he was the person who would help astronauts with stuff

1737
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:47,020
and mission controller and stuff like that.

1738
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:48,820
And there was also

1739
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:51,220
there was a study by one of the women, one of the women

1740
02:09:51,220 --> 02:09:54,980
you interviewed based out of London, who actually I found it was wild

1741
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:58,980
that the astronauts, the farther they got out into space,

1742
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:03,660
the the more their brain changed or the more they're like

1743
02:10:03,660 --> 02:10:05,540
their moral code changed.

1744
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:06,540
Yeah. What it was.

1745
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:07,740
Yeah. Dr.

1746
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:11,140
E.A. Whiteley, she's at University College London,

1747
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:16,620
and she's a space psychologist, which I think she created that position

1748
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:18,700
because space psychologist.

1749
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:21,540
Yeah. So she helps people in extreme environments

1750
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:23,820
and space obviously is an extreme environment.

1751
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:27,260
And she's a pilot like an award winning, like

1752
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:30,220
she jumps out of airplanes and, you know, things like that.

1753
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:31,780
She's a pretty intense person.

1754
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:36,060
But yeah, so she she knows the psychology of astronauts

1755
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:41,260
and of people, pilots, and she's made flying safer for all of us, by the way.

1756
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:42,540
She's pretty amazing.

1757
02:10:42,540 --> 02:10:46,580
Yeah. So the first two chapters of the of that book like talk about her work.

1758
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:47,740
And so, yeah.

1759
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:53,220
So the further pilots get out into space, the more first of all,

1760
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:57,860
they they can have like a panic that they're not aware of.

1761
02:10:58,180 --> 02:11:00,860
And she's able to identify the panic through their voice,

1762
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:02,780
through using technology.

1763
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:06,260
She can identify like just the smallest change in their voice

1764
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:08,340
that shows that they're just about to have a panic,

1765
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:12,780
because the further you get away from the earth, the more panicked you get.

1766
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:16,260
And the more there is a case for being totally irrational.

1767
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:20,820
And since these pieces of equipment that they're in are billions of dollars,

1768
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:24,220
it would cost a lot of money to have someone freaking out out there.

1769
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:25,180
And so, yeah.

1770
02:11:25,180 --> 02:11:28,100
So I have some examples of astronauts when they're out there

1771
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:31,820
having these kinds of experiences of kind of creating their own rules

1772
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:37,140
and things like that in order to just because they're so disoriented

1773
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:39,460
from being in a place.

1774
02:11:39,820 --> 02:11:43,340
I think that just from being in space, honestly,

1775
02:11:43,660 --> 02:11:46,940
I'm not a lot of people been in space, like now a couple hundred people.

1776
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:50,140
So are they able to simulate that on earth?

1777
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:53,100
They're trying to. Yeah, they're creating simulations.

1778
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:57,020
And she works with that with that kind of thing, that effort to prepare them

1779
02:11:57,020 --> 02:11:59,060
for what's going to happen when they're in space.

1780
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:05,300
Yeah. And she's also working with a group for you for UAP stuff

1781
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:09,900
in order for people to report, because there's a culture of shame

1782
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:12,260
regarding reporting stuff like this.

1783
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:16,460
And so she helped pilots report anomalous information

1784
02:12:16,620 --> 02:12:20,660
that made safety that made flying safer for everyone.

1785
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:24,460
So she's working on this with UAP right now.

1786
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:27,300
Was Edgar Mitchell one of the people that first described

1787
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:29,660
the psychological effect of going deep into space

1788
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:33,460
and like seeing Earth as like this one little thing and seeing Earth

1789
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:37,420
as like this separate being disassociated from Earth?

1790
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:39,780
Well, he wasn't the only one, but he was one of them

1791
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:42,780
who actually did something about it because it changed him so much.

1792
02:12:43,060 --> 02:12:47,500
But the idea that astronauts, when they go out and what they see

1793
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:52,060
and then the Earth, obviously, William Shatner just had this experience

1794
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:56,100
with Jeff Bezos's, you know, he went out into space.

1795
02:12:56,620 --> 02:12:59,140
It was pretty horrifying for him.

1796
02:12:59,140 --> 02:13:01,300
And he he cried.

1797
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:03,740
So, you know, a lot of people think how great it would be, you know,

1798
02:13:03,740 --> 02:13:05,260
let's go out into space.

1799
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:09,660
But then when you do get out there, it's it's a pretty intense experience.

1800
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:12,700
Either, you know, sometimes it's good.

1801
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:17,100
But a lot of times it's traumatizing in certain respects.

1802
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:23,980
It's a funny thing to think about the fact that these people change so much,

1803
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:26,820
like the deeper they get or the farther they get from Earth.

1804
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:30,740
And it makes me think about like, how different are the morals

1805
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:35,060
of another like species or another sort of being?

1806
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:36,740
Yeah, you know, you think about that.

1807
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:41,820
So remember some of the the old novels about people

1808
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:45,620
stranded on islands like desert islands and how they had they form

1809
02:13:45,620 --> 02:13:47,980
their own moral code and society.

1810
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:50,220
Lord of the Flies. Yeah, yeah.

1811
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:51,820
So in a sense, what Dr.

1812
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:54,860
Whiteley is doing is she's looking at Lord of the Flies in space.

1813
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:58,300
Wow. Yeah, that's fascinating.

1814
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:04,260
Yeah. Have you ever like heard the stories of some of those uncontacted tribes?

1815
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:06,460
My friend Paul Rosalie, who I was telling you about,

1816
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:08,540
who wrote that Mother of God book in the in the Amazon.

1817
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:10,580
There's some uncontacted tribes in the Amazon, too.

1818
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:13,660
And whenever they come across other human beings,

1819
02:14:14,380 --> 02:14:16,260
they literally all they try to do is kill them.

1820
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:20,100
They know they're humans, but they're like an evil presence to them,

1821
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:21,900
which is bizarre.

1822
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:25,060
Well, I guess it's kind of true in the sense that if they're dying

1823
02:14:25,060 --> 02:14:28,900
from the diseases that are brought here, it's a it's a bad thing.

1824
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:32,420
But it's just like it just blows my mind to think that there's still

1825
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:36,180
uncontacted tribes that are on this earth.

1826
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:39,260
Another thing I wanted to ask you, are you are you familiar with

1827
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:42,900
John Marco Allegro?

1828
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:45,140
It sounds very familiar.

1829
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:48,860
He he was a linguist and he deciphered a bunch of like

1830
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:51,060
the ancient texts and the Dead Sea Scrolls.

1831
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:56,940
And he spent like 20 years of his life going over the Dead Sea Scrolls

1832
02:14:56,940 --> 02:14:59,300
and sort of like deciphering the language.

1833
02:14:59,620 --> 02:15:01,700
I would actually know this person.

1834
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:02,900
Oh, oh, yes. OK.

1835
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:04,940
The sacred mushroom. Yeah, yeah.

1836
02:15:04,940 --> 02:15:07,260
That's when that is a I know about that.

1837
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:09,460
Yeah. So that's a.

1838
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:11,540
Where did God come from?

1839
02:15:11,540 --> 02:15:15,660
What what do Bible stories really tell us?

1840
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:17,660
Who or what was Jesus Christ?

1841
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:21,340
This book challenges everything we think we know about the.

1842
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:24,580
Can you zoom in a little bit more about the nature of religion?

1843
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:27,060
The ancient the ancient fertility cult.

1844
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:31,740
The sacred mushroom as the emblem and embodiment of divinity,

1845
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:34,180
the secret meaning of biblical myths,

1846
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:36,860
the language of religion that links us to our ancestors,

1847
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:39,260
the sacred mushroom in the cross, sets out

1848
02:15:39,860 --> 02:15:43,980
John Allegro's quest through a family tree of languages

1849
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:47,620
to find the truth about where Christianity came from.

1850
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:53,020
So you've never heard of this this guy, but you've heard of that idea, I'm sure.

1851
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:54,260
No, I know about this book.

1852
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:55,420
Yeah, I know about this book.

1853
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:57,220
No, I know about this book. Yeah.

1854
02:15:57,220 --> 02:15:59,020
Oh, OK. Yeah. And I know about this idea.

1855
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:01,300
What is your I'm fascinated to hear what your thoughts are on that.

1856
02:16:01,580 --> 02:16:07,660
OK, so it is the truth that a lot of religions incorporate,

1857
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:12,260
you know, either mushrooms or peyote or some type of,

1858
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:16,460
you know, plant medicine into their rituals.

1859
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:20,980
But if you look at Christianity and how it developed,

1860
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:24,460
like the first and second centuries, you don't actually I mean,

1861
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:26,820
if you're going to see some of those rituals and rites,

1862
02:16:27,100 --> 02:16:29,820
they're going to be imported from the Hellenistic

1863
02:16:31,460 --> 02:16:33,780
denominations of Christianity.

1864
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:37,060
You don't actually see Jesus doing this.

1865
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:40,540
You know, he's not he's actually part mostly.

1866
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:44,620
He looks like he's part of a group of Christian Christians

1867
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:47,860
that are affiliated with John the Baptist, who are,

1868
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:51,620
you know, against Rome and, you know,

1869
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:54,860
doing fasts and mystical practices.

1870
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:57,620
So it depends on which version.

1871
02:16:57,740 --> 02:17:01,500
I mean, Christianity has different branches that branch off of it.

1872
02:17:01,820 --> 02:17:06,300
So most so I'm not discounting that for certain branches,

1873
02:17:06,300 --> 02:17:10,460
but you're not going to see it in that in Jesus is the Jesus movement.

1874
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:14,220
Christianity. OK, I don't believe it, at least.

1875
02:17:15,380 --> 02:17:19,020
There's the other book by Brian Marasco, Brian Marasco.

1876
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:21,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. The Immortality Key. Yeah.

1877
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:26,780
And so, you know, he does a good job of looking at these kinds of elements as well.

1878
02:17:27,260 --> 02:17:29,100
There are a lot of

1879
02:17:31,100 --> 02:17:35,300
there are there are a lot of religions that incorporate

1880
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:39,620
plants into plant medicine, especially Ayahuasca.

1881
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:44,100
Yeah, yeah. And that's just kind of how it is in normative.

1882
02:17:44,660 --> 02:17:48,580
Rituals are meant to shift your consciousness.

1883
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:53,540
So, yeah, this is nothing that's surprising to people who study religion.

1884
02:17:53,860 --> 02:17:57,260
I guess it would be surprising to a lot of people who practice religion

1885
02:17:57,260 --> 02:18:00,700
in the normal way, you know, and kind of go to church and do this kind of thing.

1886
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:05,540
They're not thinking about imbibing any kind of entheogen, you know, and like.

1887
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:10,540
You know, having these, you know, these experiences.

1888
02:18:11,420 --> 02:18:12,820
But yeah, yeah.

1889
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:15,620
And I don't I think that's accurate.

1890
02:18:15,820 --> 02:18:17,500
It seems like there's like a lot of stories

1891
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:22,180
that could have a close connection to psychedelic experiences, right?

1892
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:26,260
Like the like the burning bush or even the Ezekiel's wheel.

1893
02:18:26,660 --> 02:18:31,420
Like there's a lot of things people ascribe to hallucinations or like psychedelic

1894
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:34,140
experiences, but it sounds like that could also be similar to what

1895
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:39,860
you're talking about with Tyler and this spiritual network.

1896
02:18:39,860 --> 02:18:44,140
I think so. So with Ezekiel's wheel, that's called the Merkabah tradition.

1897
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:47,060
It's a it's a whole historical

1898
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:51,340
mystical lineage that goes to ancient Judaism

1899
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:55,340
and goes through, you some would say, even Christianity.

1900
02:18:55,580 --> 02:18:59,060
And it's this idea that, you know, what was going on with Ezekiel?

1901
02:18:59,260 --> 02:19:03,380
Well, he was having experiences with these angelic beings

1902
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:08,900
that were often terrifying, but really fascinating and would impart this,

1903
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:13,020
you know, transmit this this intense Gnostic wisdom to him.

1904
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:15,700
And that this was the Merkabah tradition.

1905
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:18,820
And, you know, some would say John the Baptist was doing that.

1906
02:19:18,820 --> 02:19:20,500
And then Jesus was doing that.

1907
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:25,220
And then even the apostle Paul had his own experiences with this.

1908
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:27,660
So these are experiences that I'm very interested in,

1909
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:32,180
but I don't affiliate them with psilocybin or anything like that.

1910
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:37,020
I think that they're actually if they're actually having these experiences

1911
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:41,580
and they're not taking hallucinogens, they're they're

1912
02:19:42,140 --> 02:19:46,500
interacting with whatever it is that Teresa of Avila interacted with or, you know.

1913
02:19:48,300 --> 02:19:52,380
Teresa, Teresa of Avila jumping around a little bit right now,

1914
02:19:52,380 --> 02:19:54,060
but it's it's all connected.

1915
02:19:54,060 --> 02:19:58,060
Teresa, Teresa talks about like by location

1916
02:19:58,740 --> 02:20:01,580
or there's a connection with her and New Mexico.

1917
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:05,300
OK, that's that's a Spanish nun also.

1918
02:20:05,380 --> 02:20:07,900
Oh, so that's someone in the next century.

1919
02:20:08,140 --> 02:20:10,220
OK. And she's having.

1920
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:13,820
So you'll know about her actually in the southern United States.

1921
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:17,020
If you go there, there are actually churches dedicated to her

1922
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:23,460
because there's the belief that she was by locating to the New World

1923
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:27,340
near New Mexico and, you know, in the southwest.

1924
02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:31,100
And she's called the Lady in Blue.

1925
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:34,340
So if you Google the Lady in Blue, you'll get all kinds of stuff about her.

1926
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:38,900
And so she was basically believed that she was

1927
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:43,660
catechizing, which was basically teaching the gospel to

1928
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:47,340
indigenous Americans in the southwest.

1929
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:50,500
And when some of the Spanish

1930
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:55,780
missionaries and people who are basically coming to colonize

1931
02:20:56,180 --> 02:21:00,380
this part of the United of, you know, what was then

1932
02:21:02,380 --> 02:21:05,860
for Spain, the New World, for indigenous people was their place.

1933
02:21:06,220 --> 02:21:08,740
It was where they lived when they would come.

1934
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:12,740
People that they some of the missionaries were

1935
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:17,620
bringing Spanish Catholicism and the native people knew it already.

1936
02:21:17,620 --> 02:21:19,260
And they said, how did you learn about this?

1937
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:22,460
And they said through this lady in blue. Wow. Yeah.

1938
02:21:22,460 --> 02:21:26,740
And so and then when those same missionaries went back to Spain,

1939
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:28,140
they heard about her.

1940
02:21:28,140 --> 02:21:30,460
And so they asked if they could meet her.

1941
02:21:30,460 --> 02:21:32,140
And she was a cloistered nun.

1942
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:34,500
And she described her experiences of coming here.

1943
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:38,700
And she described the foliage and the people that she met

1944
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:40,540
in that type of thing.

1945
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:42,420
So what was going on? How is that?

1946
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:44,060
How is that possible?

1947
02:21:44,060 --> 02:21:46,020
Well, yeah.

1948
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:50,100
So, OK, so there's a lot of like, you know, there's a lot written about it.

1949
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:53,060
And I don't know.

1950
02:21:54,460 --> 02:21:58,340
But I do know that she wrote one of her first books was a cosmology.

1951
02:21:58,580 --> 02:22:01,860
And then some people like you can reduce this to just.

1952
02:22:02,860 --> 02:22:04,740
A fake, right?

1953
02:22:04,740 --> 02:22:08,060
That that just didn't it didn't happen the way they said it happened.

1954
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:13,180
But I've talked to people who are indigenous Americans

1955
02:22:13,180 --> 02:22:16,660
who live in that area and believe absolutely in her.

1956
02:22:16,980 --> 02:22:19,260
So it's a it's a thriving belief.

1957
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:22,500
I'm not going to discount it. Right.

1958
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:26,580
And, you know, going back to these these crazy experiences

1959
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:31,100
that some people ascribe to like hallucinations or psychedelics,

1960
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:34,100
like like ayahuasca or psilocybin.

1961
02:22:34,100 --> 02:22:38,500
It seems like it's a it's a blurry line between what is that

1962
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:43,980
like dancing elves or whatever it may be and and and what is an actual

1963
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:46,500
like UFO, like what we're seeing today.

1964
02:22:46,820 --> 02:22:50,940
So what I think about that, actually, I think that most likely,

1965
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:54,580
Pete, they're going to a real place that there's this real place.

1966
02:22:54,580 --> 02:22:59,500
And it's perhaps I can't I'm not going to prove this.

1967
02:22:59,740 --> 02:23:01,100
It's interdimensional.

1968
02:23:01,100 --> 02:23:02,540
It's another dimension.

1969
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:07,060
And so people who are taking these drugs in order to access this place,

1970
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:10,380
they're they're going to that place.

1971
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:12,980
And people who are doing the protocols are going there, too.

1972
02:23:12,980 --> 02:23:14,420
They're just doing it in a different way.

1973
02:23:14,420 --> 02:23:15,820
Do you think it's the same place?

1974
02:23:15,820 --> 02:23:17,860
I kind of think that. Really? Yeah.

1975
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:20,020
What makes you think it's the same place?

1976
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:22,260
This is totally like non-professor talk.

1977
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:24,380
This is fine. This is what I think. Right.

1978
02:23:24,380 --> 02:23:28,020
So, yeah. So I've met too many people that have

1979
02:23:28,660 --> 02:23:32,940
that have reported similar things and almost identical things.

1980
02:23:32,980 --> 02:23:33,940
Really? Yeah.

1981
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:36,540
I mean, it's just after time, you're like, OK, well.

1982
02:23:36,700 --> 02:23:39,460
And then there are the people that are doing the DMT experiment.

1983
02:23:39,460 --> 02:23:42,940
Yes. Yeah. So I think, you know, I don't know.

1984
02:23:42,940 --> 02:23:45,820
I mean, I think that it's really interesting, but they report like little

1985
02:23:45,820 --> 02:23:50,660
little elves or like they report geometrical patterns and shapes.

1986
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:52,020
And a lot of them, they do it.

1987
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:55,060
They take this stuff and they experience the same exact thing.

1988
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:56,260
Yeah, that's right.

1989
02:23:56,820 --> 02:23:58,900
I was able to.

1990
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:01,980
I don't know if you know who Alex Gray is.

1991
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:03,460
He's. Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK.

1992
02:24:03,460 --> 02:24:06,900
So I was at a really small conference with he and his wife, Alison,

1993
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:12,940
and they were explaining what their process of, you know, doing their art.

1994
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:17,780
And they would it's no, you know, they would take ayahuasca

1995
02:24:18,140 --> 02:24:22,020
and wouldn't talk to each other, but they would have the exact same vision

1996
02:24:22,020 --> 02:24:23,420
and then would paint it.

1997
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:24,820
And really? Yeah.

1998
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:27,620
So that was when I first started to really consider,

1999
02:24:27,740 --> 02:24:29,860
wow, what's going on here, you know?

2000
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:34,660
So is there a way that these things can come in our reality?

2001
02:24:35,740 --> 02:24:39,780
And is that what like is that do you think there's a like comparing

2002
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:43,220
these DMT experiences and the stuff that Alex Gray and his wife

2003
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:44,900
were experiencing in painting it?

2004
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:48,540
Do you see any like telltale signs

2005
02:24:48,900 --> 02:24:51,780
that connect this to some of this biblical stuff?

2006
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:54,100
OK, well, OK, the biblical stuff.

2007
02:24:54,100 --> 02:24:57,220
So listen, the biblical stuff is filled with people

2008
02:24:57,220 --> 02:24:59,900
who are having kinds of experiences that are incredible.

2009
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:02,780
Right. So, you know, you have people, you know, and they're

2010
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:06,580
they're interpreting it through a religious lens

2011
02:25:06,580 --> 02:25:08,900
because that was the framework that they had.

2012
02:25:09,980 --> 02:25:13,700
What I see today is when people are talking about these experiences,

2013
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:17,700
what makes me kind of pay attention a lot

2014
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:21,900
is that Tchaikovsky talked about this like Constantine Tchaikovsky.

2015
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:25,820
He's the father of Russian, the Russian space program.

2016
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:28,740
And he was basically calling out the artists

2017
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:32,100
and calling out the poets and the mathematicians and saying,

2018
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:36,380
we're you know, we're the ones who can access this information

2019
02:25:36,380 --> 02:25:39,340
and bring it down and create things in our reality.

2020
02:25:39,860 --> 02:25:42,420
So he was saying that the human being is the bridge

2021
02:25:42,660 --> 02:25:44,980
between that reality and this reality.

2022
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:46,940
And that's what I found really interesting.

2023
02:25:46,940 --> 02:25:50,580
And it also gets me back, by the way, once I did publish the book,

2024
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:54,900
I had so much correspondence from mathematicians and artists,

2025
02:25:55,100 --> 02:25:59,580
like they really resonated with Tyler in that downloading process.

2026
02:25:59,900 --> 02:26:03,540
And they each I thought that these communities were completely different.

2027
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:06,220
But I now see them as very similar.

2028
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:10,740
So the artists believe that they're accessing some kind of place. Right.

2029
02:26:10,980 --> 02:26:14,860
And then mathematicians also not all of them, by the way,

2030
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:17,140
there are some that believe that they're imagining these places.

2031
02:26:17,380 --> 02:26:20,180
But a good portion of them are what are called idealists.

2032
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:25,540
And they believe in a space of where these forms exist, like platonic forms.

2033
02:26:25,780 --> 02:26:27,460
And it's like another dimension.

2034
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:31,420
And once they access that, they can bring that information back to our reality.

2035
02:26:33,060 --> 02:26:34,780
So that goes back to the protocol.

2036
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:37,500
So what is it that humans are doing?

2037
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:39,740
You know, what if we are these bridges?

2038
02:26:39,740 --> 02:26:43,180
And, you know, part of our job is to keep our,

2039
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:47,300
you know, our ability to maintain and cultivate this ability

2040
02:26:47,300 --> 02:26:50,140
to be this bridge, to create things. Right.

2041
02:26:51,180 --> 02:26:53,700
And they so we can go to that reality,

2042
02:26:53,700 --> 02:26:56,860
we can go escape this space time reality and go to that dimension

2043
02:26:56,860 --> 02:27:00,740
by doing these protocols and or by taking these up these compounds,

2044
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:02,580
these compounds that come from Earth.

2045
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:07,620
And then it appears that

2046
02:27:07,620 --> 02:27:11,020
these things can also transcend into our dimension.

2047
02:27:11,020 --> 02:27:13,020
And that's possibly what we're seeing.

2048
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:14,460
I think so. Yeah, I think so.

2049
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:16,820
With the space program, it looks like that's what was going on.

2050
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:18,340
But they weren't taking hallucinogens.

2051
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:20,580
They were actually just accessing. They were doing it naturally.

2052
02:27:20,580 --> 02:27:23,180
Yeah, yeah. And, you know, as always,

2053
02:27:23,180 --> 02:27:26,060
I think people need to understand that they should, if they do stuff like that,

2054
02:27:26,060 --> 02:27:27,820
they need to do it responsibly.

2055
02:27:27,820 --> 02:27:31,300
You know, because in think about the churches that do it,

2056
02:27:31,300 --> 02:27:34,300
like the Native American Church, you know, the use of peyote.

2057
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:37,580
It's done in a sacramental way, in a way that they believe

2058
02:27:37,820 --> 02:27:42,420
is the benefit of their tribe or their culture.

2059
02:27:42,780 --> 02:27:45,900
And it's not done for recreation or, you know.

2060
02:27:46,140 --> 02:27:48,660
So I think intention is really important.

2061
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:54,780
If the intention behind it is to, you know, for the best good for all,

2062
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:57,540
I think it'd be great. I think that not everybody.

2063
02:27:57,740 --> 02:28:02,260
But, you know, even just a small percentage of people, like 10 percent say,

2064
02:28:02,260 --> 02:28:04,060
OK, doesn't have to be everybody. Yeah, yeah.

2065
02:28:04,060 --> 02:28:06,700
Because I think that the effect we would.

2066
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:10,220
And we're not talking about just taking hallucinogens and things like that.

2067
02:28:10,220 --> 02:28:12,740
We're talking about, you know, spirituality.

2068
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:15,540
Yeah, yeah, spirituality. Yeah.

2069
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:18,620
I think it's a neglected part of humans right now.

2070
02:28:19,700 --> 02:28:25,980
Is there any possibility that these things could be us from the future?

2071
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:31,860
OK, so the UFO phenomena is like us from the future. Yeah.

2072
02:28:32,140 --> 02:28:36,460
I mean, OK, if you're going to give, let's see, could it be us from the future?

2073
02:28:37,860 --> 02:28:39,500
A lot of people believe that.

2074
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:43,980
And I've recorded their beliefs in several of my publications.

2075
02:28:46,300 --> 02:28:50,940
My belief, yeah, so my belief changes all the time. Right.

2076
02:28:51,100 --> 02:28:55,180
So I never actually say what my belief is because it changes too much. Right.

2077
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:58,860
Right. And I'll always talk to another really brilliant person who's like,

2078
02:28:58,860 --> 02:29:01,300
then changes my mind. And I'm like, oh, yeah, I believe that.

2079
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:08,140
But I definitely have had my mind changed about time and us from the future.

2080
02:29:08,500 --> 02:29:12,220
So my ideas of time, you know, being there's no, you know,

2081
02:29:12,220 --> 02:29:14,900
because a lot of the people that I'm talking with now,

2082
02:29:15,020 --> 02:29:18,620
they don't even have ideas that time, there's this linear progression

2083
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:22,060
and they don't even speak that way, like the future and the past.

2084
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:25,380
They're now, you know, their language is different.

2085
02:29:25,660 --> 02:29:28,180
So that's changed the way I think about time.

2086
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:33,580
So maybe I can't say yes or no to that.

2087
02:29:34,860 --> 02:29:36,340
Is it us from the future? I don't know.

2088
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:38,100
I mean, if it is, why are they doing this?

2089
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:39,100
Like, why are they hurting us?

2090
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:40,660
You know, because some of them do.

2091
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:44,060
You know, some people have burns and stuff, so they shouldn't be doing that.

2092
02:29:44,060 --> 02:29:46,380
And that's part of what Gary's studying also, right?

2093
02:29:46,380 --> 02:29:50,820
Like Havana syndrome style burns and brain damage.

2094
02:29:50,820 --> 02:29:53,060
Yeah, I wouldn't think that would be us from the future.

2095
02:29:54,060 --> 02:29:56,900
That's another thing that boggles my mind about the whole phenomenon,

2096
02:29:56,900 --> 02:30:00,940
because like before I was introduced to you, to your work,

2097
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:05,820
I was like really deep into the idea that

2098
02:30:07,020 --> 02:30:10,060
going back to Rua Zimbabwe and the proliferation

2099
02:30:10,060 --> 02:30:13,700
and sightings of UFOs over nuclear bases during the Cold War,

2100
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:15,980
like there was a crazy, there's a great map diagram

2101
02:30:15,980 --> 02:30:18,260
that was done on James Fox's Phenomenon documentary

2102
02:30:18,260 --> 02:30:20,900
that showed all the nuclear tests around the world

2103
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:23,700
in correlation with all the UFO sightings around the world,

2104
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:26,620
how they correspond so like perfectly.

2105
02:30:28,100 --> 02:30:31,460
And then with the Rua Zimbabwe thing, with like these these creatures

2106
02:30:31,460 --> 02:30:34,780
coming down and communicating with the young kids, the schoolchildren,

2107
02:30:34,780 --> 02:30:37,780
and then telling them technology is bad.

2108
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:40,740
That was one of the main things that those kids were getting

2109
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:43,340
like projected into their minds, like technology bad.

2110
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:48,660
That like these things were trying to protect us or protect our planet.

2111
02:30:48,660 --> 02:30:53,060
So I was like under, like I had this idea and this feeling that

2112
02:30:53,620 --> 02:30:55,100
this is all good.

2113
02:30:55,100 --> 02:30:58,780
But after looking into your research, it seems that they're not all good.

2114
02:30:58,780 --> 02:31:03,060
There are some that are good and there are some that are evil, right?

2115
02:31:03,060 --> 02:31:06,260
Like, or is this this these people that are getting damaged

2116
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:08,660
or are they getting hurt on accident?

2117
02:31:08,660 --> 02:31:11,620
Yeah, I think Gary's of the opinion that they're getting hurt on accident.

2118
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:14,540
He could have changed his opinion since I last talked to him about that.

2119
02:31:14,540 --> 02:31:19,780
But he thinks that there it's like collateral damage, maybe. Right.

2120
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:24,860
However, as many good experiences that I've heard

2121
02:31:24,860 --> 02:31:29,860
and I've now heard many like thousands, I've heard as many bad experiences.

2122
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:34,020
So I would have to suggest then that perhaps there are several

2123
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:36,900
different kinds of things that we're talking about, because, you know,

2124
02:31:36,900 --> 02:31:39,220
we write the research that we've been doing.

2125
02:31:39,220 --> 02:31:40,700
It's not there's a lot of it.

2126
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:43,180
That's not public. And.

2127
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:48,900
So, you know, that we can't bring a lot of,

2128
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:52,620
you know, researchers to the table to talk about it openly, it seems,

2129
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:54,380
at this point still. Right.

2130
02:31:54,380 --> 02:31:56,780
So we're just beginning to understand it.

2131
02:31:57,300 --> 02:32:00,980
And it looks like different kinds of things, different kinds of things,

2132
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:02,540
different kinds of things. Right.

2133
02:32:02,540 --> 02:32:05,620
Yeah, that makes the most sense. Yeah.

2134
02:32:05,620 --> 02:32:10,940
Because it's a nice idea that it is a super advanced species

2135
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:14,340
that is just looking out for us and trying to like guide us

2136
02:32:14,340 --> 02:32:19,220
in the right direction along the evolutionary path and not not blow ourselves up.

2137
02:32:19,820 --> 02:32:23,060
There's also the connection with people like Tyler,

2138
02:32:23,060 --> 02:32:25,660
how they're able to access this thing and children.

2139
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:29,940
Like those the biggest cases throughout history are just like Rua Zimbabwe,

2140
02:32:30,220 --> 02:32:32,340
the Westall School. There's so many.

2141
02:32:33,220 --> 02:32:38,140
There's so many depictions of these things or recordings of these things

2142
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:41,060
coming to schools and interacting with kids.

2143
02:32:42,300 --> 02:32:44,580
What do you what do you make of that connection?

2144
02:32:44,580 --> 02:32:47,980
Yeah, you see. OK, so you do see this connection also

2145
02:32:47,980 --> 02:32:50,380
within Catholic scholarship with like the Virgin Mary,

2146
02:32:50,380 --> 02:32:52,940
the Virgin Mary kind of appearing to children as well.

2147
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:57,620
So I don't know what I think about it.

2148
02:32:57,620 --> 02:33:00,100
I think that especially when the kids,

2149
02:33:00,140 --> 02:33:04,940
I think the the best examples of the phenomena are the school examples

2150
02:33:04,940 --> 02:33:09,060
because the kids grow up and they maintain their story

2151
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:12,860
and they're not going back on it and they believe it still.

2152
02:33:13,220 --> 02:33:14,940
And they still have the same message.

2153
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:19,740
And that's quite amazing because you have corroborating evidence, you know,

2154
02:33:20,820 --> 02:33:24,740
with Westall, with, you know, the Zimbabwe case.

2155
02:33:25,300 --> 02:33:27,780
And I think it's super compelling.

2156
02:33:27,780 --> 02:33:30,460
What is her name?

2157
02:33:30,660 --> 02:33:32,460
Yeah, Dr. Wiley. Dr. Wiley.

2158
02:33:32,460 --> 02:33:37,380
What is she doing as far as in regards to like babies

2159
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:40,660
and like teaching them to connect to this network and like raising children

2160
02:33:40,660 --> 02:33:41,540
in a different way?

2161
02:33:41,540 --> 02:33:44,060
You said there's some protocols that she's doing with the young children.

2162
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:48,740
Yeah, she's developed a program for infants, basically,

2163
02:33:48,740 --> 02:33:53,140
because it's at that point that they're developing their neurons

2164
02:33:53,180 --> 02:33:57,940
are connecting in order to create an infrastructure in their brains

2165
02:33:58,300 --> 02:34:00,500
to identify different languages.

2166
02:34:00,500 --> 02:34:03,780
And she has identified language.

2167
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:05,580
She calls it an Earth language.

2168
02:34:05,580 --> 02:34:10,500
And she uses technology to take the language

2169
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:14,260
and to to make it into graphemes, you know, like

2170
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:17,260
and then she's created a book.

2171
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:19,420
I didn't know this, but babies don't see in color.

2172
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:20,860
They see in black and white.

2173
02:34:20,860 --> 02:34:22,820
And so the the book is in black and white.

2174
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:24,980
And she did it because of her own kids.

2175
02:34:24,980 --> 02:34:27,940
She wanted to share with them the beauty of the universe.

2176
02:34:27,940 --> 02:34:30,300
And she said that all the baby books were horrible.

2177
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:32,940
So it was out of necessity that she did this.

2178
02:34:32,940 --> 02:34:34,900
So she's created this.

2179
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:38,940
It's it's a it's an immersive experience for these babies.

2180
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:43,580
So they'll develop the ability to identify this Earth language

2181
02:34:43,580 --> 02:34:45,620
and its nation independent.

2182
02:34:45,620 --> 02:34:48,380
So it's not English. It's not French.

2183
02:34:48,380 --> 02:34:49,700
You know, wow. Yeah.

2184
02:34:49,740 --> 02:34:53,700
So so she's doing this and it's really successful.

2185
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:56,580
That's interesting. Is this something you can buy this book?

2186
02:34:56,700 --> 02:34:58,540
Or is there something that's like, oh, really? Yeah.

2187
02:34:58,540 --> 02:34:59,460
It's on Amazon.

2188
02:34:59,460 --> 02:35:02,780
I think you can put Earth language in and it'll come up.

2189
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:04,700
And she's working with parents and babies.

2190
02:35:04,700 --> 02:35:06,100
And she's doing this.

2191
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:07,380
That's really interesting.

2192
02:35:07,380 --> 02:35:10,940
Yeah, because that's it's close to what Michio Kaku talks about

2193
02:35:10,940 --> 02:35:15,300
with when he talks to type one, type two, type three civilizations.

2194
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:18,580
How like right now, we're a type zero civilization

2195
02:35:18,580 --> 02:35:20,980
and in order to become a type one civilization,

2196
02:35:20,980 --> 02:35:24,060
we have to become like a planetary species,

2197
02:35:24,980 --> 02:35:30,340
which is like it's it's like all connected instead of like divided by nations

2198
02:35:30,340 --> 02:35:34,900
that we're all like together and not warring against each other

2199
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:36,540
and having a one world language.

2200
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:38,340
We already have like an Internet, right?

2201
02:35:38,340 --> 02:35:40,460
That's kind of like we're on our way.

2202
02:35:40,460 --> 02:35:43,420
We're on the path to having like an Earth language.

2203
02:35:43,420 --> 02:35:44,740
But that's fascinating hearing that.

2204
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:47,580
Yeah, yeah. It's a really cool program.

2205
02:35:47,620 --> 02:35:50,540
Well, cool. Thank you very much for doing this.

2206
02:35:50,540 --> 02:35:51,540
Yeah, I had a great time.

2207
02:35:51,540 --> 02:35:53,140
Thank you so much for inviting me.

2208
02:35:53,140 --> 02:35:57,220
Tell people where they can follow your work and get your books.

2209
02:35:57,340 --> 02:36:00,020
Sure. So I am on Twitter, D.W.

2210
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:04,260
Pasolka, and my books are on Barnes and Noble and Amazon.

2211
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:06,340
OK, wherever books are sold.

2212
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:08,380
Perfect. I'll make sure I link it all below.

2213
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:09,580
And thank you again.
