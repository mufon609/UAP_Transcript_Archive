1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,520
Is it true, you were one of the first, or were you the first active duty fighter pilot

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,040
to come out and talk publicly about UAPs?

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,120
Yeah, specifically active duty.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,920
I was actually active duty when I did first speak about this.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,440
David Fravor, Commander David Fravor, he was kind of the first one to, I think, come out

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,520
and speak about this, but at the time he was no longer in the military.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,760
Why is it that you were the first one to come out and talk about this?

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,000
Because people have been witnessing this and observing these things for long before you

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,400
came out, right?

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,880
Yeah, that's my understanding of it.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,720
So I mean, why was I, you know, the first, that's a great question, I think.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,340
Perhaps I wasn't just, maybe I'm the one we're hearing about, but you know, from my position

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:58,500
it was a little different because we weren't just seeing a one-off object on the radar

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,260
or on a camera and then never see it again and question whether, you know, we really

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,260
saw it or not.

16
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,840
We were seeing this on such a regular basis that it was something that we were briefing

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,380
to every time.

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,060
We were not only briefing to it, but we were also informing others that did not have the

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,980
proper technology to see them.

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,900
And we were notifying the general public essentially with our notice to airmen, essentially broadcasting

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,140
out that there were objects that we didn't understand what they were, but they were essentially

22
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,500
a safety of flight hazard.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,860
So for me to speak about it, it was just trying to solve that particular problem.

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,900
And that's why I spoke out about it.

25
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,660
And there was just, the day we're recording today, which is, what is today, the 13th of

26
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,560
January, and I think it was two or three days ago, the report came out that there was now

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:52,480
over 500 reported incidents of UAP sightings or UFO sightings by like service members or

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
military members.

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Yeah.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,520
My understanding is that reporting comes strictly from the reporting mechanisms that have been

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,480
created within the Navy and the Air Force.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,120
And so, yes, they are seeing more, and we would expect to see that, you know, assuming

33
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,000
what I've been saying is true.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,980
An increase in reporting will lead to an increase in reports.

35
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,980
And so that's what we're seeing.

36
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,660
Now it doesn't necessarily mean the quality of the reports will increase and it'll likely

37
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,740
have more false negatives when we do have that.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,620
But generally speaking, you know, they're out there and now we have the agency to actually

39
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,620
report them.

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,620
And so we're seeing the data come in.

41
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,920
I believe the New York Times, there was a bunch of articles about it, but the New York

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,980
Times article, I'm sure you saw, was speculating that a bunch of it was basically junk in the

43
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,820
sky or weather balloons.

44
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,820
And they even mentioned, I think they quoted about the gimbal and the go fast video saying

45
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,660
that the go fast video, the object was only going 30 miles per hour.

46
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,980
Did you see that?

47
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,980
I don't remember if they specifically called out the go fast video in those articles.

48
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,820
But generally speaking, you know, there are aviators out there that are talking about

49
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,580
this constantly.

50
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,940
They talk to me about it and they tell me how this is something that they're talking

51
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,180
about in their cockpits all the time now.

52
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,060
What they did express disappointment in was the fact that there were no reliable mainstream

53
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,140
media organizations that they could talk to about this.

54
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,880
Not that they're necessarily looking to go out and make news, but they are looking for

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,580
an opportunity to tell their story.

56
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,420
And what we're seeing from the mainstream media is just kind of the same old, you know,

57
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,820
little giggling, little, okay, well, maybe it's real, maybe it's not.

58
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,140
And these people are putting their careers at risk to come forward to talk about this.

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:33,580
So to have it blown off like that didn't really go over well to the aviators I spoke with.

60
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,220
They're saying that the big mainstream media corporations weren't taking them seriously?

61
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,500
Essentially, they didn't feel like they could go and have a respectable conversation about this.

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,700
And we see that with some of the reporting we've had where they've essentially dismissed

63
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
these sightings.

64
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,500
And what that does is the exact opposite of what I've been pushing for, which is to increase

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
reporting.

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,020
If you're going to mock the aviators when they actually do report something, well guess

67
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,020
what's going to happen?

68
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,780
Naturally, you know, some people are going to second-guess whether they should report

69
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:03,940
if you have a news organization like New York Times, you know, putting things out that are

70
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,180
detrimental to the safe operation of aircraft, right?

71
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,500
We have to report safety incidents and if we are minimizing those that report it, then

72
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
guess what?

73
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
We're not going to have as many reports.

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Yeah.

75
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,300
A Navy aviator seems like it would be the last person you would want to mock.

76
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,580
Well, it's that topic, right?

77
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,780
We kind of did it to ourselves.

78
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,860
It's a conversation where it might not be pure mocking, but it's almost a defensive

79
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,340
mechanism, at least from what I've seen.

80
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,460
People immediately want to laugh when they hear this topic.

81
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,660
And I don't think they're laughing because they truly think it's funny.

82
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,460
I just think they don't know how to react, right?

83
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,740
And so they just burst out laughing and then they listen for a real response and sometimes

84
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,940
they're shocked when they hear one.

85
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,420
But I think that we're going to see people continue to kind of hold that flag of ridicule

86
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,980
until they convince themselves of it.

87
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,540
I don't think that one thing will be able to show them that data and they'll say, okay,

88
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,780
that's clearly something interesting.

89
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm going to now stop mocking this and really pay attention.

90
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,860
I see some of these people kind of holding on for quite a while until they have real

91
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,180
evidence to stand behind.

92
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,460
Yeah, I don't see that.

93
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,900
I don't see many people that have that stance, really.

94
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,020
Maybe it's just the people I surround myself with, the people I talk to.

95
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,900
But it's interesting hearing you say that because I'm sure you deal with a lot of people

96
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,660
that are still active military or still in the Navy.

97
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,020
So a lot of people that you talk to that are still active service, are they the ones that

98
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,860
you're referring to that still kind of are holding on to that stigma?

99
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,540
Well, certainly I'll say in the military, but I think it's more complicated than that

100
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,340
because now that there is a classified reporting mechanism for this, I wouldn't expect them,

101
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,860
nor would I ask them to communicate about it.

102
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,380
However, I do still think the stigma is there.

103
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,260
The stigma that I was referring to primarily is on the commercial side.

104
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,820
Since they do actually have the agency to have a conversation about this, they really

105
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,940
want to.

106
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,740
Some of the aviators I've talked to have got some pushback from their employees about speaking

107
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,860
on this, including cease and desist orders.

108
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,780
I don't think they're necessarily asking them to cease talking about UAP or UFO, but just

109
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,860
generally talking about operations of the aircraft.

110
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,980
I can see why they might have an issue with pilots communicating a safety issue publicly

111
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,020
throughout without their filter.

112
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,780
Where are the cease and desist coming from?

113
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,060
Just corporate airlines or commercial airlines.

114
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,340
When there are pilots that are interested in speaking out, occasionally they have received

115
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,860
cease and desist orders.

116
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,340
Oh, wow.

117
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,580
Yeah, so I'm interested.

118
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,740
What was your take on that new report coming out with over 500 new sightings?

119
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,180
Was it 500 total or 500 new?

120
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,820
I think it was 500 total.

121
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,060
Yeah, well, it's a good thing because we're going to continue to see those numbers growing,

122
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,420
I think, as more people report.

123
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,500
And again, that's only military.

124
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,100
What also came out at the same time as the report was also an interesting PowerPoint

125
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:58,420
presentation that was given to the National Transportation Board by Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick,

126
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,060
which kind of fell out, actually, I think, the same day, which has some interesting information

127
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,500
regarding how serious they're taking this aviation safety threat.

128
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,780
Additionally, we also have seen the release of even more of what they're calling the

129
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,220
Range Fowler Reports.

130
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,100
Those are the actual reports from aviators who are...

131
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,740
Those are the data sets that they're generating these reports from.

132
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,460
And so those data sets, I'll suggest, are much more interesting than the reports themselves.

133
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,660
You actually hear from the pilots themselves about the objects that they're seeing and

134
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,060
why they're so confusing.

135
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,060
Interesting.

136
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,220
Okay, so for people out there who may not be familiar, can you summarize your career

137
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,700
as a Navy pilot?

138
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
I'll try.

139
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,500
Yeah, I mean, it's really not that complicated.

140
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
I, you know, I went with a four-year degree.

141
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
You got your degree in...

142
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,260
Mechanical aerospace engineering from Worcester Polytechnical Institute.

143
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:01,620
My junior year, decided that the degree I was going for wasn't really that exciting

144
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
enough, essentially.

145
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,180
I had an internship that really sucked.

146
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:11,820
So I essentially changed my major to the aerospace and decided I wanted to go fly jets, applied

147
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,340
to officer candidate school, got in as a pilot, and essentially, you know, the rest is kind

148
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
of history.

149
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,580
I just kind of kept passing tests and moving forward and, you know, luckily the needs of

150
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,460
the Navy were such that I was able to get the aircraft that I wanted, which isn't always

151
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,460
the case.

152
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:34,860
But yeah, I joined, excuse me, I got in the F-18 Super Hornet for the first time, I believe

153
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,220
in 2011 in VFA 106 on the East Coast.

154
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,940
I was there for a year and then immediately assigned to VFA 11, the Red Rippers, where

155
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,140
I flew the F-18 for three and a half years and two combat deployments.

156
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,540
Once I was finished up with that, I went to Mirdy, Mississippi, where I was an advanced

157
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:59,180
strike fighter instructor and the T-45 Goshawk, teaching people how to land aircraft carriers

158
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,780
and dogfight, drop bombs and fly formation, all that good stuff.

159
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:11,340
And that was when I first actually spoke out about this, kind of near the end of my time

160
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
in that instructor tour.

161
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,620
And that was the last tour before I got out as well.

162
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,860
So I was in for about 11 years.

163
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,860
Wow.

164
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,340
What's it like being a fighter pilot?

165
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,620
I don't know, I'm still figuring it out.

166
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,380
It's one of the most fascinating things.

167
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:35,300
They make movies about it and there's the mechanics of it and it's just hard to wrap

168
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,380
your mind around flying a machine like that and then landing it on this boat in the middle

169
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
of the ocean.

170
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,580
And I mean, it's just, it's hard to grasp, you know?

171
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,420
A lot of people in the military do kind of like mundane things that aren't necessarily

172
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,980
as thrilling as flying in a jet, you know?

173
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,020
Even people that are, you know, boots on the ground in the Middle East and stuff like that,

174
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:03,180
it's kind of, it's just not as, I mean, it's definitely terrifying, but doing what you

175
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,180
were doing is just like on a whole nother level, it feels like.

176
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,860
Well, I mean, I was very fortunate to be able to be in a position like that.

177
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,180
Truly, for most of it, it's, you know, a matter of your own skill and how you can perform.

178
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:25,620
So in a way, it's unique in that there's just so much concentrated effort and focus on applying

179
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,940
the skill sets to the maximum capability of the aircraft and the weapons, right?

180
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,820
We don't go out there and fight at 60%, we're always pushing the envelope, we're always

181
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,900
max performing the jet.

182
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,740
Guys and gals on the ground as well are doing that, but we're up there, we're very protected

183
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,180
in a sense, even going into combat, at least in the environments we've been in, we're not

184
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,260
doing air-to-air combat.

185
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,820
And so my job may have been more thrilling, but I have that much respect for the folks

186
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,020
that are on the ground doing the hard work there.

187
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,540
It was my great honor to be able to fly around in Afghanistan and Iraq to provide support

188
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,260
for the people on the ground.

189
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,660
That's essentially what I was there to do.

190
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,660
What can you talk about as far as what you were doing in the Middle East, flying and

191
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,140
like what sort of missions or objectives did you have?

192
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,020
How similar was it to the Top Gun movie?

193
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:25,580
Well, I was trained to do flights like you see in the Top Gun movie, that's typically

194
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,420
called like a high threat, we would call it close air support.

195
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,860
That was a pre-planned strike, which is relatively rare, but we do train to do low ingresses

196
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,300
like that.

197
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,340
The reality is a little more complicated, however, because typically what we're doing

198
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,700
is kind of playing chess when we're down there, we're not necessarily just trying to go as

199
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,100
fast as we can toward the target.

200
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,540
We're usually identifying things and executing tactics while we're performing down there.

201
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,020
And to answer your question earlier, that's really what's so difficult about being a fighter

202
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
pilot.

203
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,060
It's not the flying itself, it's learning how to employ that weapon, because that's

204
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,700
what it is to us, is we don't learn to fly the F-18 for very long, maybe a couple months.

205
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,860
I think it's our third flight is when we fly by ourselves in it.

206
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,860
We're trained aviators at that point, what we're doing is learning how to employ a weapon

207
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,860
system.

208
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,900
It's very complicated to learn the tactics and the timings and the distances and all

209
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:21,820
the things that are required to survive up there if we are to go into combat.

210
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,940
So what sort of targets are you going after and what sort of objectives do you have?

211
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,120
What is day-to-day life like on the aircraft carrier in the Middle East?

212
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,140
Are you spending your days and nights on an aircraft carrier, I'm assuming?

213
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,420
Yeah, so once we leave, we're pretty much out there for 9, 10, 11 months or so, depending

214
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,020
on how long it is.

215
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:49,020
But on a daily basis, essentially, you're looking at anywhere between 8 and 9-hour missions.

216
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,540
You're going to launch sometime between 5 in the morning and, well, I don't want to

217
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,420
use times, but pretty much all day we're launching and going out on those missions.

218
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,580
And once we fly out there, it's very complex to kind of get into the battle space.

219
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,860
We fuel several times with tankers to get out there.

220
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,940
So it's quite the trip.

221
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,460
And then once we're out there, really what we do is we get tasked to various ticks, as

222
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:17,100
they're often called, troops in contact scenarios where we have to buster over as fast as we

223
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,100
can to provide support to those troops that are in combat.

224
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,180
And that either looks like us identifying targets on our own with our sensor systems

225
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,820
and either questioning or having authorization due to the role of engagement to employ on

226
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,980
that or talking with someone that's on the ground or in some base somewhere that is identifying

227
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
targets for us.

228
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,660
Then we come in and prosecute them.

229
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,700
So that's the majority of what we do on a regular basis in Afghanistan or Iraq, at least

230
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,500
what we were doing.

231
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:57,900
However, a few years ago, we were also operating near Syria and there were aircraft that were

232
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,300
launched and we actually had one of our first combat shoot downs since the early 90s, not

233
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,860
too long ago.

234
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,420
First one since the early 90s.

235
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:15,100
I believe it was a Syrian MiG that was essentially getting too close to one of the fueling operations,

236
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,540
fueling tankers, loaded jet.

237
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,660
I don't know the specifics, but either way, so we were seeing a little bit of air to air

238
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,140
combat over there as well, which is somewhat unique.

239
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,620
Air to air combat is unique.

240
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Like dogfighting?

241
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,660
It is.

242
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,300
It's not something we do on a regular basis or train to at least over the past decade

243
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
or so.

244
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,020
You guys more have like strategic strikes from air to ground, right?

245
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,500
Well, let me be clear.

246
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,700
We do train all of it, like 100%.

247
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,340
We don't even prioritize one over the other.

248
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,620
But when we are in those operations in the Middle East, we already have air superiority,

249
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,420
so we're not focused on air to air combat.

250
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,580
We're simply employing on the ground.

251
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,580
Right, right.

252
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,060
Not to say we don't carry, we do have the weapons as we've seen with that shoot down,

253
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,300
but primarily it's air to surface.

254
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:06,300
When you're training to become a pilot, how important is vision, like human vision?

255
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,780
Do you do any tests on vision?

256
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
And what is that like?

257
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,780
Can you walk me through that?

258
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,180
Well, I don't think it's overly complicated.

259
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,980
Is your vision correctable to 2020 and below some limit?

260
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,980
My vision was not.

261
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,580
I had to have PRK, laser eye surgery, before I joined.

262
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
Wow.

263
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,780
I did one eye at a time since I was still in college at the time, so I could still see

264
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
the blackboard.

265
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,460
So I did that to correct my vision so I could fly.

266
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
And it's pretty, pretty common.

267
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,380
I mean, you can fly with glasses, yeah, it just has to be correctable.

268
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Interesting.

269
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,380
Yeah, because you're moving so fast and you have to make, I heard you describe it before,

270
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,700
like when you're flying, you're kind of, you're moving so fast, you kind of just don't even

271
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,100
have, you don't even have time to think about anything.

272
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,220
You're just sort of reacting to your environment and just using your senses and your intuition

273
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,460
to make decisions.

274
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
A lot of times, yeah.

275
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,420
I mean, I think, you know, the trait of a good fighter pilot would be to overcome that

276
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,860
to some degree and push that.

277
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,260
There are best practices and there are tactics and there's standard operating procedure.

278
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,500
How do we push past that bubble to adapt to a real life scenario in order to engage the

279
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
targets?

280
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,740
Now in air to surface arena, everything's pretty static and fixed, but when you start

281
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,580
talking about large air to air battles, that's when it gets a little more art, a little

282
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,580
less science.

283
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,460
What are the biggest dangers of your job or your job when you're a fighter pilot?

284
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,900
Probably crashing into the back of the boat.

285
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
Oh, really?

286
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,700
Yeah, that's probably the most riskiest thing we do.

287
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
What is that like?

288
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,540
How do you, how can you describe the difficulties and landing and taking off from an aircraft

289
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
carrier?

290
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,340
Yeah, so I guess the best way to describe it, and so I was, I was actually a landing

291
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,500
which means I was specially trained as kind of an authority to land on the boat within

292
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,740
my squadron air wing.

293
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:58,780
I was eventually trained up to head landing signal officer for my squadron, which generally

294
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,300
means that means I would go to the back of the boat with my team with an actual like

295
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,140
telephone looking thing and talk to the pilots as they're coming into land.

296
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,580
And what we do is we train them to our voices so that if we give a verbal command, they

297
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:17,140
immediately apply that command, whether they agree with it or not, because there are misconceptions,

298
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,660
visual misconceptions and cues that they can receive under certain scenarios.

299
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,460
And that's why it's so important that they listen to our voice.

300
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:30,020
Once we start talking over what we call the ball with the lens landing system.

301
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,980
And so, you know, what is it like?

302
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,700
It's difficult and it's never something you don't just get it one day.

303
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,380
You know, I've seen commanders and admirals, you know, having the worst passes just like

304
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,580
the new guys.

305
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:47,100
And so it's very much, it's very much kind of like one on one in a sense, you know, it's

306
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
just you in the boat.

307
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:54,500
And a lot of times you'll, at least for me, it was very meditative and almost serene,

308
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,900
especially at night on these long straight ends when you can barely see anything.

309
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,540
I can send you a video of a night landing that I have.

310
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,540
Really?

311
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,540
It's pretty cool.

312
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,420
I just see a speck of light in the distance for a while and then it's just an aircraft

313
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,380
carrier all of a sudden as we're landing on it.

314
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,140
But you know, how do you do it?

315
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,780
You have to, it's so difficult because imagine if you were driving a car at about 170 miles

316
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,300
an hour and, you know, three dimensionally, a car is kind of easy because you can only

317
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:28,460
go two ways really, but you need to drive this car within a one foot, one foot box or

318
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,220
fly your head through a one foot by one foot box while you're in the cockpit going over

319
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,620
the aircraft carrier at a particular plane.

320
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,540
Your head needs to go through that one foot by one foot box in order to catch a three

321
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,380
wire on a perfect pass essentially.

322
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,060
So 170 miles an hour, you're constantly making corrections to the right because the aircraft

323
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,260
carrier is an angled deck and so it's slightly moving to the right.

324
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,620
So as you come down, you're making these little corrections, looking to fly your head kind

325
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,540
of on that curve, you know, you're kind of curving down a little bit to fly your head

326
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,140
through that, that box.

327
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
And that's, that's essentially a perfect pass.

328
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,140
Wow, man.

329
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,940
It can be tough.

330
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,380
And there's a lot of risk there.

331
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,860
Flying a perfect pass is not what we teach.

332
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,380
We don't want people to fly a perfect pass.

333
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,340
We want them to fly a slightly high pass because that's, that's safer.

334
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,300
Because if you're flying a perfect pass, any, any descent is going to put you below glide

335
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,540
slope and that's, that's where it's dangerous.

336
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:24,360
Have you ever failed in doing that or have you, was every, every single landing kind

337
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
of flawless?

338
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,620
Oh, no, definitely not flawless, but fail now I'm still here.

339
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
So right.

340
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,940
But I'm sure not every, every failed attempt would be fatal, would it?

341
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
No.

342
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,420
So when we come in, well, I want to call it a failure, not the trap.

343
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,460
So sometimes you do everything right and you just don't trap.

344
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,340
So what we do when we come down is we immediately put our speed brakes in, which kind of slows

345
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,420
us down and we bring the throttles all the way up as soon as we touch down, we rotate.

346
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,900
So it's almost as if, if we didn't catch the wire, we're just bouncing off the deck, which

347
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,220
is exactly what we do.

348
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,680
If we do catch the wire, then it stops us there.

349
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,220
And so if we miss it, we just outs up and go and do it again.

350
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,580
I don't know if I call that a failure per se, but that's kind of the, you know, the

351
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,420
negative, the negative example of a pass that doesn't involve a crash.

352
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
Right.

353
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,660
That would be the best case scenario other than catching the hook on the wire.

354
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,660
Pretty much.

355
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,660
Yeah.

356
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,100
The worst thing you'd want to do is clip the edge of the ship and take off your landing

357
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
gear.

358
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,140
What's the worst thing you ever saw on the aircraft carrier like that, like with a landing

359
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
gone wrong?

360
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,980
I've seen a tail hook hit the back of the boat.

361
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,900
It's called a ramp strike, but it wasn't too bad.

362
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,380
It didn't explode, which was nice.

363
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,340
I mean, because sometimes the hook, it hits the back of the carrier and the metal shrapnel

364
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,340
goes everywhere.

365
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,380
But that didn't happen.

366
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,940
My buddy ejected off the front of the cat, it wasn't a landing, but he ingested foreign

367
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:54,700
object debris or FOD during the cat shot, which took out one of his engines.

368
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,700
And there was a subsequent issue with the other engine as well.

369
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,140
They ended up ejecting shortly off the front of the boat.

370
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,140
Really?

371
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,960
They were pretty low too.

372
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,860
His WIZO weapon system officer in the back seat got pretty messed up, broke his back

373
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,060
in several spots and you know, X, Y, and Z. He's actually flying again.

374
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,620
I think he either was or is the commanding officer at XO of the Blue Angels now, actually.

375
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,620
Wow.

376
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,940
How rare is it for someone to eject, especially during training?

377
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,620
I don't know the numbers, but I'm sure there's a number calculated in hours of flight time.

378
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,220
I've witnessed, I think, five ejections?

379
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,780
You've witnessed five ejections?

380
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,260
I've flown over two of them.

381
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,180
The fireball is in the jet.

382
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,180
What?

383
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,660
Is this during combat missions?

384
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,060
No, these are all training.

385
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,060
These are all training?

386
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,820
Training is much more dangerous in combat typically.

387
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,940
But you yourself, you've never had to eject?

388
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
No.

389
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Nope.

390
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
I don't think I would have survived my back.

391
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,980
It would have got messed up.

392
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
What are these guys?

393
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,700
Did you ever talk to these guys after they ejected?

394
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,980
I was responsible for investigating some of these mishaps, so I had to interview these

395
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,980
guys.

396
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,980
Really?

397
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,980
What do they say?

398
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
What is that experience like?

399
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,620
It's a lot, you know?

400
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,340
For some guys, I think it kind of depends.

401
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,980
In movies, they kind of gloss over it.

402
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,460
It seems like something that, when they do it in movies, it seems like the guys are always

403
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
good to go.

404
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,860
Especially the recent Top Gun.

405
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,460
What is he going, like, 10 Mach and then he just walks into a diner?

406
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
We should all be so lucky.

407
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:30,300
But no, I've seen varying degrees of response.

408
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,460
Some younger guys are easy and happy to just brush it off and go back up.

409
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,380
Other guys that have families and stuff, it can really shake them.

410
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,620
These guys are getting almost as close to death as you can get and still surviving some

411
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,620
of these times.

412
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,900
One of the cases I'm thinking about, they basically ejected at the ejection window.

413
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,940
Basically 135 degrees down, about 400 feet up from the ground.

414
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,220
They were really ejecting into the ground.

415
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,820
And luckily they came out and they were able to swing at least once before they hit.

416
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,380
And they were fine.

417
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,100
But they had varying responses to how that kind of made them feel in their comfort level.

418
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,740
And they even trained me to be an aviation safety officer.

419
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:14,180
They sent me down to their Naval Aviation Safety School for about five weeks.

420
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
And that was my job.

421
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,380
That was one of my collateral jobs as a pilot.

422
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,660
For when someone goes down, I go out there and I figure it out.

423
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:28,580
I clean the pieces up and figure out what happened and publish a report and then go

424
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,580
into the manuals and try to make it so it doesn't happen again.

425
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,060
We had to do that a number of times.

426
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,060
Every time there's a mishap, that's what happens.

427
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,580
And that's why we say our pocket checklists are typically written in blood because we

428
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,260
usually fix the problems afterwards.

429
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,940
And I've seen that lesson over and over again and I can't say for certain, but perhaps

430
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,380
that was part of my motivation to kind of speak up about the UAP topic because it was

431
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,180
just a matter of time before someone just slammed into one of these objects and we lost

432
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,180
aircrew.

433
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,180
Yeah.

434
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:02,380
So when was the first time you experienced one of these objects, the first time that

435
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,460
you noticed one of these things?

436
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,900
Can you explain what was happening before you saw them and then what was happening after

437
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,900
you saw them?

438
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,820
From what I understand, you had some new equipment.

439
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:16,380
So we got back from our deployment on the USS Enterprise in 2012.

440
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,420
We entered what's called a maintenance phase where essentially we kind of give our good

441
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,740
jets to the forward deployed squadrons and we cannibalize some jets and we fix some stuff.

442
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,780
And our jets just so happened to be ready to be upgraded to a better radar.

443
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,500
Had the cooling systems already installed in X, Y, and Z.

444
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,860
And so eventually we upgraded.

445
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,420
And as soon as we upgraded, we started noticing objects on our radar that we hadn't seen without

446
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,580
that upgrade.

447
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:50,220
And so we went from flying around with our APG-73 radar and we see our little sweep,

448
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,220
right?

449
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,220
Just like a radar you see in a movie.

450
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,780
APG-73 you call it?

451
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
Yeah, APG-73.

452
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
Okay.

453
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,780
And it's kind of like a...

454
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,980
And is this the thing like the clock that goes around in a circle?

455
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,220
Kind of, but we see it kind of just like as a box with a line.

456
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,220
Box with a line.

457
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,020
And so what do we see?

458
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,460
We basically just see like a little icon, a little blip and it tells us the speed and

459
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,460
various kinematics about it.

460
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,740
And that's what we would expect to see.

461
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,540
We weren't seeing anything on the APG-73.

462
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:25,100
We upgraded our radars to the APG-79, big jump, kind of like mechanical to digital in

463
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,540
a sense.

464
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,140
Much better, stronger, more powerful, see farther, all that stuff.

465
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,620
And we'd go out there and we'd see objects.

466
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,420
We'd see things on the radar.

467
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,540
And it's like, okay, well, does my wingman see this?

468
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,660
No, he has a different radar.

469
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,900
So we kind of just thought it was some kind of error at first.

470
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,980
We were seeing objects on our radar that weren't there with the other one.

471
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,020
It was just a natural assumption.

472
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,460
They were vulnerable, not vulnerable, but they were prone.

473
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,900
There was all those errors that are involved in things like this.

474
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,700
And so we thought maybe some of those had carried over.

475
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,300
But long story short, we eventually got close enough to see these not only with the radar,

476
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,500
but also with the camera system that's on the jet, the FLIR.

477
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,020
And so that kind of tucks in on our cheek pad here.

478
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,740
Whenever we look at stuff on the radar, all our sensors go to that spot.

479
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,020
And so as people were kind of noticing these and taking locks on them and our sensors would

480
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,020
go over, eventually people were close enough to see that there was IR energy coming from

481
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,660
those spots as well.

482
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,100
What kind of energy?

483
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Infrared energy.

484
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,100
Okay.

485
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,780
So our camera system, the FLIR, shows us either just like a camera view or IR energy, heat

486
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,220
energy.

487
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,500
And so that's what you see on, say, the gimbal video, that black and white.

488
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,420
He's able to switch it from black to white, right?

489
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,100
You can switch it from black hot to white hot, which means the white is the hot that

490
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,620
you see on the screen or black, just changing the contrast.

491
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,860
Or you can go to like a full color mode, which is TV, you know, it doesn't show you heat,

492
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,700
but it shows you what you'd look through on a camera.

493
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,220
We typically fly with IR because you can see better, you can see further, it's more prominent.

494
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,700
And yeah, we were seeing IR energy come from these spots where radar was dropping us off

495
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,140
essentially.

496
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,460
And so at this point, we had to conclude that there was physically something there and we

497
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,980
had to at least respect it as aviators and not, you know, get too close to these objects

498
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,180
or just ignore them and fly around them because we thought they were clutter.

499
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,140
Yeah, at this point, you know, we were confident they were physical, though we didn't know

500
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,780
the origins or even that it was overly remarkable.

501
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,260
What do you mean confident they were physical?

502
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,780
What does that mean?

503
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,660
That if we were to fly through the spot that we, our radar was showing us, there was something

504
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,740
that we could damage our aircraft.

505
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
Okay.

506
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,740
Generally speaking, right?

507
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,300
What are the possibilities of if it wasn't something physical, what would show up on

508
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,020
the radar that wasn't physical?

509
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,860
Well, there could be energy in that spot.

510
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:51,060
There are, I believe plasmas can be captured on a radar and other things you can have extremely

511
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,180
thick clouds can return radar signals in the AVG-73.

512
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:00,500
And so even like temperature inversions where the air is extra thick with the older systems

513
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,300
could potentially show you radar track files.

514
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,500
So that was our initial assumption that there were some strange things like that.

515
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,860
But now to have energy coming from that spot in the sky as well in a very precise manner,

516
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,380
as if someone was shining an IR flashlight at us, we had to make the assumption that

517
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,700
they were physical at that point just for safety of flight.

518
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,980
This episode of the podcast is brought to you by Hostage Tape.

519
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,220
Nobody wants to be a mouth breather, but the truth is 25 to 50% of the population habitually

520
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,020
breathes through their mouths.

521
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,420
I like many people learned about the importance of nasal breathing when I first read James

522
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,540
Nestor's book.

523
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,900
And I have actually been sleeping with my mouth hole taped shut for the past two years.

524
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,940
And the problem isn't just snoring and sleep apnea.

525
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,680
There is tons of science behind how mouth breathing actually is responsible for an array

526
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,300
of neurological, respiratory, and even metabolic problems in humans.

527
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,480
The nose not only filters bacteria in the air, it humidifies it, it removes particulates

528
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,400
in the air and gives you a huge release of nitric oxide, which is extremely effective

529
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,720
in fighting off pathogens and viruses.

530
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,440
Now I've tried probably close to a dozen different brands of mouth tapes from Amazon and they

531
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
all suck.

532
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,760
Hostage Tape is the king of mouth tapes.

533
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
It's perfect.

534
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,920
It sticks perfectly.

535
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,960
Even if you have a beard and it's easy to get off, you just put it here.

536
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
I'll show you.

537
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,560
Just like this comes off easily, doesn't chap your lips when it comes off, head on over

538
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,720
to hostagetape.com forward slash concrete to get your year supply of hostage tape for

539
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:36,620
a $150 discount, which equals like 55 cents a day to sleep better and be healthier.

540
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,000
That's hostagetape.com forward slash K-O-N-C-R-E-T-E.

541
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,360
It's linked below back to the show.

542
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,560
When you saw these things, you mentioned you were flying with a wingman.

543
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,040
What does that mean when you're flying with a wing?

544
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
That's not the whizzo.

545
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,920
That's not the person in the cockpit with you, right?

546
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Nope.

547
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,440
We'll have one person in the back seat called a weapon system officer, and then if we have

548
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:04,640
a wingman with us, if we're a section, that's two aircraft, lead, kind of trail like this,

549
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,280
flying formation like that, and we'll go do our mission.

550
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,440
Once we get out there, maybe we'll break up, maybe we'll be fighting against each other.

551
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,200
Maybe we'll fly around as pairs and drop bombs.

552
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,720
There's a million things we could do, but we'll fly out there in close formation.

553
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,800
Once we get into the areas, we'll do our stuff and then we'll join back up and fly back as

554
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,520
a pair.

555
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,680
Is that typically how all missions are carried out with multiple jets flying in formations

556
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,240
and planned attacks like that?

557
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,400
Is there ever a solo jet flying?

558
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
There is.

559
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,360
There is all the time, but I would say it's just as common to go out in two.

560
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,640
We pretty much ... It's just one of those things you might just go out by yourself,

561
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:48,960
but there's plenty of two sections or singles or even four aircraft in what we call a division.

562
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,780
Just all of the above, frankly.

563
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,020
What is it like to ... Sorry, I'm going off on a bunch of different things, but flying

564
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,800
in formation, how hard is that to learn?

565
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,300
That's like flying at the boat.

566
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,540
That's what I would tell the students because I had to teach them that as well.

567
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,180
It's the same power motions when you do that as when you land at the boat because when

568
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,740
you're on the boat, you have to ride a glide slope.

569
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,420
If I add power, I'm going to start going above that glide slope.

570
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,540
If I just keep the power there, I'm going to keep going.

571
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,260
That's to make what's called three-point power corrections.

572
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,060
I have to add power, get myself going in the right direction, pull it back to de-accelerate,

573
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,180
then re-add power a little bit less to stabilize on that new higher glide slope.

574
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,380
Every time I have to make an adjustment, it requires three power corrections every time.

575
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,060
When you're flying the ball, boat, you're doing this the whole way down, just very,

576
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,060
very small.

577
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,300
Actually, we'll leave our pinky up like this on the rail too so we can have a reference

578
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
point where we are.

579
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Wow.

580
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
When you get close, you'll be just doing it fingered.

581
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,020
Now, I'm moving the two throttles just with your fingers and using that as a reference

582
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
point, essentially.

583
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,140
When you're flying formation, same thing.

584
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
Pinky up there.

585
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,860
Now, instead of your reference being the glide slope, your reference is the other aircraft.

586
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:05,620
If I am falling behind, I have to add power to stop that de-acceleration so I can catch

587
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,620
back up.

588
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,340
Then, I have to take power off to de-accelerate and then add a little bit back to stabilize

589
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,380
where I am in that relative position, so three-point power corrections all day long.

590
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:21,020
If you're in perfectly clear skies, you might go out to a mile and do that in a transit

591
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,380
position where it's much easier and the small mistakes, it's not dangerous to look away

592
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,500
for a second.

593
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,380
If you're in bad weather, man, you're going to be a few feet away, potentially for hours.

594
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,380
Hours?

595
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,380
Oh, gosh, yeah.

596
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
It's painful.

597
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,380
It's going to be very painful.

598
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,420
Holy shit, man.

599
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:42,860
My first flight into Iraq, I was on day one missions when our squadron got there.

600
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:48,660
I was one of the senior lieutenants in the air rank at the time and only one in our squadron

601
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,780
lieutenant anyways that had been on a prior combat deployment.

602
00:32:52,780 --> 00:33:01,300
I got to go in on day one and we had to go through a damn thunderstorm and not only that,

603
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,060
but we had to tank in it.

604
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,420
We were all running out of gas, we were in a thunderstorm, the tanker is there.

605
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,620
You're free-fueling in the air?

606
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
Oh, yeah.

607
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
In a thunderstorm?

608
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,620
Yeah.

609
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,540
The very first guy, he could not get in the basket.

610
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
He couldn't get in.

611
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:20,780
He was getting frustrated, he ended up going below his bingo number, which means he should

612
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:26,740
have already diverted, which is not good, day one, we don't necessarily have bases set

613
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,740
up, things of that nature.

614
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,940
But anyway, long story short, he ended up getting in and just how it is, it's just something

615
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,860
to deal with all the time when you're flying, you never know what you're going to get.

616
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,740
Back to where we were, first time you saw one of these objects, you guys were flying

617
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,300
in formation doing a training day.

618
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,060
What was the weather like that day?

619
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,460
Well, let me correct you a little bit.

620
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,980
It's hard for me to say what the first time was, because we were seeing his radar, it

621
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,620
never was like, okay, we're seeing them, we didn't quite realize they were real, and then

622
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,620
they're on the FLIR.

623
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,700
But then we did see them with our eyeballs.

624
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,780
So this wasn't just like the first time it happened, it wasn't just like this unbelievable

625
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,780
experience?

626
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,220
No, it was just kind of like, ugh, you know, something's messed up, right?

627
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,220
The radar's messed up.

628
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,140
And then when we're seeing energy, it's like, okay, our curiosity is peaking a little bit,

629
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,460
but you know, your drive to survive and do what you're doing out there takes precedence

630
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,460
over a lot of things.

631
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
This is 2014?

632
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,460
Yep.

633
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,220
But we were getting more curious as we were seeing them more.

634
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:27,460
And then eventually, one of my squadron mates, well, four of them, but one saw it, they were

635
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,120
flying out in a section.

636
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,780
So two aircraft, four people, again, in this kind of formation, flying out to the working

637
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,340
areas.

638
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,740
And there's a single spot in the sky where all the traffic going in to those working

639
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,420
areas goes through.

640
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,420
Cap point?

641
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,260
Not a cap point, just an entry point.

642
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
An entry point.

643
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
Okay.

644
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
What is the...

645
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,260
Difference?

646
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,260
Yeah.

647
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Well, what, yeah, definitely.

648
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,260
What is the difference?

649
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,260
But what is the reason for that?

650
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,640
So a cap point is a, is kind of a tactical term that we use as a combat air patrol holding

651
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,220
position when we're looking for a line of defense against enemies.

652
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,740
We might be holding at that cap point such that we give a command to push and now we're

653
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,740
attacking enemies.

654
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,060
An entry point is just the administrative point in the sky that we all agree upon that

655
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,660
is the safest way to enter an area.

656
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,660
For entering only?

657
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,660
Yes.

658
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,100
And there's a separate spot for exiting?

659
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,620
Same spot, thousand feet below.

660
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,620
Oh, wow.

661
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
Okay.

662
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,620
All right.

663
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,900
And so it's one of the busiest places, you know, on East Coast probably for air traffic.

664
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
And so they...

665
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,900
How far offshore?

666
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Ten miles.

667
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Ten miles.

668
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
Okay.

669
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,900
Yep.

670
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,980
Like maybe 12...

671
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,980
I forget.

672
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,940
Maybe it's like 18 or 19,000 feet, I can't remember.

673
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
Maybe 12 actually.

674
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
It's been a while.

675
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,820
But either way, you know, it's not like at 2,000 feet.

676
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:44,140
You're not going to be seeing Cessna's up there very often either way.

677
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,900
They were flying in that formation and right at the entry point, one of these objects went

678
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,180
right between their aircraft, closer towards the lead side.

679
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:56,380
The lead aircrew saw it, the aircrew and the other aircraft did not, which is not surprising

680
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,780
because you're so focused in on flying formation, you're not, you don't have much of a scan

681
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,780
going on.

682
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,780
You're not taking in the scenery.

683
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
No.

684
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
But lead does.

685
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,780
And lead did see the object.

686
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
And...

687
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,780
Who?

688
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,780
The lead aircraft.

689
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
The lead aircraft.

690
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
Okay.

691
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,780
Yeah.

692
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,780
And they...

693
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:19,260
He just described it as a dark gray cube or black cube inside a clear sphere.

694
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,460
That's the description.

695
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,780
And it went in between their aircraft, but I'd be careful when I say that because we

696
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,980
don't know whether it was moving or not necessarily, right?

697
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,900
I don't believe he had it on the radar.

698
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,660
If he did, I don't think he would have flown through it because we knew they were physical

699
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
at this point.

700
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,660
Right.

701
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,540
I also just can't remember whether he had a radar or not, but my assumption is he did

702
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,540
not.

703
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,300
They ended up turning around and coming home after that.

704
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,300
They didn't trust their radar anymore, right?

705
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,700
And they're going to do a combat mission, or not combat mission, but you know, like

706
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,420
a dog fighting training set, something that requires a radar.

707
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,340
So if you're not even seeing objects and it was hitting them, it's time to come home.

708
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,340
Right.

709
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:00,740
But he came back and, you know, he had all the gear on the ready room and he was describing

710
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,260
what he saw, just as I just described it.

711
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,420
And you know, he's just like, I don't see one of those fucking things, you know, because

712
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,420
we were all very familiar.

713
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,460
We didn't have a name for them or anything, but we all were aware of them that they were

714
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,940
a potential safety issue and, you know, but no one had seen one with a naked eye.

715
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Not yet.

716
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,220
Not until this point.

717
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,220
So now, of course, now we're all like, well, this is getting weird, right?

718
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,420
Maybe there's some kind of weird drone thing or X, Y or Z.

719
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,540
I mean, he didn't describe any propulsion.

720
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,500
There's no obvious lifting services, but hey, that's what he saw.

721
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,620
So we're kind of thinking it was a drone at this point or something.

722
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:40,300
So we submitted a safety report, a hazard report, which is something you submit when

723
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,380
there's a chance of a mishap in the future.

724
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,620
Like maybe you got lucky this time, but next time you might not be so lucky.

725
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,520
And this is a good example of that.

726
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,180
And so we submitted out and, you know, we were thinking, hey, maybe this is someone's

727
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
classified drone program.

728
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:58,900
Maybe this is, who knows what, but maybe by submitting this report, they'll get the message

729
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,420
that, you know, they're stepping out of their lane here and creating a safety hazard.

730
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,980
They, right, we assumed it was some classified program at this point.

731
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,100
Of course, nothing actually happened.

732
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,900
I forget the total number of reports that are related to UAP off the East Coast in that

733
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,300
period, somewhere around eight or 10, I think.

734
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,380
So it wasn't just our squadron, it was other squadrons that had this type of radar.

735
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,700
And you know, over the course of time, we weren't necessarily going out and, you know,

736
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,820
interviewing people or taking any type of data sets.

737
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,900
But generally speaking, whenever we talked to, whenever I talked to anyone on the East

738
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,060
Coast that was a pilot that had a sufficiently powerful enough radar and they had seen the

739
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,460
objects, they described it the same way, cube and the sphere.

740
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,700
Really?

741
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,180
Which is very unique compared to what Commander Fravor talked about.

742
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,940
He talked about like a tic-tac object that was not even close to what you guys saw on

743
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
the East Coast.

744
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,940
Yeah.

745
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,300
I don't think there's gonna be just one answer for this whole thing.

746
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:09,100
But so there's no, so if I can recall, Commander Fravor talks about sort of trying to chase

747
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,100
this thing, right?

748
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,100
He was trying to chase it and the thing was mimicking him or mirroring his movements.

749
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,020
And then he talks about the thing showing up at his cap point before he even knew where

750
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,980
his cap point was.

751
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,700
He knew where his cap point was, I believe.

752
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,540
He probably had it written down, but he hadn't been there.

753
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,860
Right.

754
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,140
From what I can deduce from what he said, he wasn't sure where, like he didn't even

755
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,180
know where he was gonna be prior to where, like there was no way maybe the object knew

756
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,180
where he was gonna be before he got there.

757
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,900
Yeah, it's kind of like one of those things where you have like a bunch of waypoints and

758
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,340
you're like, I know I need to be at waypoint nine, but I have no idea where it is.

759
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,340
Right.

760
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,340
You know what I mean?

761
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,580
Right, right.

762
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,580
He clicked over like, hey, is that your cap point?

763
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,860
You know, it's like, oh shit.

764
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,620
The guy who saw it with his naked eye and you guys were in the ready room and he was

765
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:59,780
describing that, who else was there and what was like, could you read the room?

766
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,220
What did you take in from the other people that were there and what was their reaction

767
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
to it?

768
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,580
Kind of had a similar reaction to the look that everyone had on their faces when we watched

769
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
the Goodwill video.

770
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:13,500
It wasn't the same people, but kind of had that like looking around with a dumb look

771
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,900
on everyone's face, like what the fuck?

772
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,380
I mean, the commanding officer of our squadron was there, four or five lieutenants like myself,

773
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,260
the duty officer who is always there, is always someone at the desk and he's the one on the

774
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:31,140
radio with the planes, welcome back and troubleshooting and stuff, dealing with issues of the day,

775
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,140
which this was.

776
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,420
And yeah, everyone's kind of like, I was hit with one of those things and it's like, well,

777
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,340
what are we gonna do now?

778
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,180
And the answer was to talk to the safety officer and submit a hazard report.

779
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,780
Eventually, the hazard report, of course, didn't change anything, it's more of a data

780
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:56,220
collection mechanism than a proactive prevention mechanism, aviation and safety.

781
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:03,340
Like I said, a lot of our procedures are written in blood, but yeah, sorry, I forgot where

782
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,340
I was going with that.

783
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,340
Did you ever see one of these things with your own eyes?

784
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,700
No, I didn't.

785
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:13,900
I looked, what would happen is crazy and I talked, again, when I didn't talk to people

786
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,100
that had seen it, almost all the others had seen it, but not physically seen it, but seen

787
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,540
on the radar or had tried to see it but couldn't, much like myself.

788
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:26,380
And so what that looks like is, okay, we have something on a radar, maybe it's 20 miles

789
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,180
away or some distance, not within visual range.

790
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,580
As you get closer, you start to pick it up on your FLIR, you dial in your course and

791
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,220
you're trying to have a 500-foot pass with it.

792
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,100
All your sensors are slewed, your radar is looking at it, your camera is looking at it,

793
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,020
your weapon system cameras and sensors that are on your weapon, individual weapons are

794
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,820
now all looking at it.

795
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,580
All that information is getting pumped into my helmet and so when I look out, I can see

796
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:56,660
a box around where I should be looking and I look back at my radar and yes, I still have

797
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,420
the object locked and it's right in front of me and I look over at the FLIR and yes,

798
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,900
I can still see the energy coming out of that piece of the sky, very precisely.

799
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,340
And then my sensors are telling me where to look and we fly right by it within a few

800
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,420
feet or a few hundred feet and I just can't see anything.

801
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,180
And you don't see anything.

802
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,540
But then it's still on the FLIR, it's still on the radar.

803
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,380
What is going through your mind when you see it on every single one of your instruments

804
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,700
but you can't see it with your bare eyes, your naked eye?

805
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,620
You know, I don't know.

806
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,380
We didn't make anything of it in a sense.

807
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,020
You think it was like something's fishy with the radar, something's wonky with the mechanical

808
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,020
instruments?

809
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:41,460
At this point, it's inconceivable to us that our radar and FLIR and visuals would potentially

810
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,900
be – now, not for everyone, right?

811
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:48,180
Not everyone, but for the cases that we did see objects, to be able to fool all three

812
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,180
of those is interesting.

813
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,060
Now, what you can do is you can say, okay, well, perhaps some were physical and some

814
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,500
were not, right?

815
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,260
That's one way you could go down this and bottom line is we just don't have the data

816
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,260
for that, right?

817
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,560
To say whether every object represented a physical object or there were only some physical

818
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,240
objects and the others were not physical.

819
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,640
We just don't have enough data to kind of make that assumption, but when you're flying

820
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,240
around out there, you have to make the assumption that they're all physical.

821
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,680
Right.

822
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:21,840
And how long did it take before people on the boat, when you guys got back and did debriefs

823
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:28,800
or went over – how many of these reports were there before things started to change?

824
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,400
Or did things ever change?

825
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,800
I don't know how many reports there were.

826
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,840
There were about, I think, eight or so hazard reports that were submitted to the Aviation

827
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:45,320
Safety Center that were specifically referencing objects that were, I don't want to say unexplainable,

828
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,080
but not identified as drones or anything else.

829
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:55,000
There's a lot of others that indicate it's a drone, but what else are you going to call

830
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,320
it, right?

831
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,200
But I don't know how many because we weren't really tracking it, right?

832
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,020
And so then what did change, essentially, to answer your question, eventually the Navy

833
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:12,400
implemented a reporting process through the UAP Task Force where they were mandating,

834
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:20,520
I believe, naval aviators submit reports upon landing of any objects that they witnessed.

835
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,840
And it didn't go through the Naval Aviation Safety Reporting Method.

836
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,280
It went to the UAP Task Force.

837
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,960
And so that is what changed.

838
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,920
I don't know how many incidents there were before that, but the UAP Task Force report

839
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,160
and now the ODNI report that came out shows that it's happening quite often.

840
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,720
You spoke about, I forget which podcast it was, but you spoke about a moment when you

841
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:49,200
were in the room and there was a senior officer, like a top guy who was reviewing it, and then

842
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,240
he looked at it and he's like, mm-hmm, and he turned around and walked away.

843
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
What was that?

844
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,160
So everything we've talked up to this point has been off the east coast of Virginia Beach

845
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,840
with no aircraft carrier involved.

846
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:07,360
In 2015, we started to prepare for our workups, or actually it was 2014, but it was right

847
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,720
at the change of the year.

848
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,560
But we left essentially on aircraft carrier to essentially get ready for war.

849
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,600
It's called a workup cycle.

850
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,080
We spent months on the boat and we basically do all that training from the boat just to

851
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,120
practice like we play.

852
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,920
And while we were off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, that's when we filmed the gimbal

853
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,840
video that people are familiar with.

854
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,240
And so yeah, it's pretty intense.

855
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,640
And there's actually bases on the coast where they have called Red Air, contract Red Air

856
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,000
essentially where they come out and test us, right?

857
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,800
So they'll, day and night, they'll come out and fly out and try to like penetration test

858
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,800
the carrier, right?

859
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,800
While we're doing missions.

860
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,720
We might be on like a training mission and then we might need to break off of that because

861
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:55,000
we're going to intercept some other Red Air fighters that have been launched off the coast

862
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,880
to test whether we can intercept them before they get within weapons range of the boat

863
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,160
or things of that nature, right?

864
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,520
So it's kind of, I mean, in one sense, it's awesome fun, right?

865
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:08,760
I mean, you're out there sipping around, intercepting aircraft as they try to break their way into

866
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
the carrier.

867
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
So it's kind of like...

868
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,280
Where are these guys coming from?

869
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,680
Various bases off the East coast near Jacksonville.

870
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:22,800
I forget where they are, but they just buzz right out there and they're essentially targets

871
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,800
for us.

872
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,800
And we do that for our air to air training as well.

873
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,800
But anyways, we were doing an air to air mission out there.

874
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,960
This is actually, well, interesting little tidbit.

875
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,600
I'll get to that after.

876
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,240
No, please.

877
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,920
Right after I tell the gimbal story, I'll tell you this little piece that doesn't get

878
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:47,800
talked about much, but yeah, we'd gone out doing an air to air mission, the air crew

879
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,640
that filmed the gimbal essentially started coming back to the boat after they had run

880
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,000
out of gas or waiting to land.

881
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,600
You don't like just come back and land, you have to wait for the deck to open up.

882
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,920
So what that means is you essentially have to just slow down and do what's called like

883
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,440
a max endurance profile, fly at a certain airspeed that maximizes your time airborne

884
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,440
versus being an afterburner in a dogfight.

885
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,800
That burns the least amount of fuel.

886
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,800
Yeah.

887
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,720
So if you're in like some dogfight training mission in the boat, you're eventually going

888
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,320
to hit a fuel number and you bring your throttle back and you essentially just hang out.

889
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,920
You're done being tactical at that point.

890
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,080
And so that's the position they were in.

891
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:30,960
They were coming back and they ended up seeing these radar contacts on their radar and they

892
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,400
initially thought it was a penetration test as I had talked about.

893
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,400
So they went over to intercept the aircraft and they were looking on the radar and all

894
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,320
that, but the kind of mechanics of it didn't really jive with what they would expect to

895
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,320
see.

896
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:49,960
It's too slow and performing turns that they wouldn't expect to see.

897
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,860
Long story short, they essentially went to stern convert the object, which what that

898
00:47:54,860 --> 00:48:00,760
means is you essentially want to, if the object's just flying around, you're in any position,

899
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,000
you want it to kind of arrive in a position like this, stern convert.

900
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,880
And so what that really looks like in real life, usually you're like 10 miles apart.

901
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,600
You make this big arcing turn, kind of come in like that.

902
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:17,960
So generally that's what they were doing as they were trying to get closer to the objects.

903
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:26,720
What they saw on the radar was one object and then nearby were about five other objects

904
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,000
that were flying in like a wedge formation.

905
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,240
And so the wedge essentially proceeded along more or less a straight line and then kind

906
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,560
of got jumbled up and did a very tight turn essentially and started proceeding in the

907
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,760
opposite direction.

908
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,360
These objects that are in formation is my assumption that they were the object we were

909
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,320
seeing off the East coast on a regular basis.

910
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,960
And I say that because they appeared on the radar similarly as what we were seeing on

911
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,300
the East coast.

912
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:00,160
There are ways that we could identify it, such as the way the objects kind of like skipped

913
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,600
around a bit with what we were seeing on the radar.

914
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:07,240
It wasn't like a perfectly clear radar representation.

915
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,600
It would kind of skip around as if it couldn't really tell exactly which direction it was

916
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:16,080
going, even though it was showing it moving in a consistent manner, which is confusing.

917
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,440
But that's how we were able to identify them on the radar.

918
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,440
And these look similar.

919
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,840
So it's an assumption that they were the same.

920
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,880
However, the gimbal object we had not seen before, that was kind of located below the

921
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,200
objects, I'll say, or maybe to the south, if we assume up is north, but they're kind

922
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,640
of like below the wedge and falling in the same direction, just slightly behind.

923
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,320
And when the wedge made that turn and then rolled out in the opposite direction back

924
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:47,480
in formation, the gimbal object just kind of went, it just kind of was going one direction

925
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,640
and appeared from a God's eye view, and it just started going in the other direction

926
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,720
with no radius of turn.

927
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,880
That gimbal video was from a God's eye view?

928
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,880
No.

929
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,880
Okay.

930
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,400
But what I saw on the situational awareness page, you hear the pilots referencing, that's

931
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,640
a God's eye view.

932
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,560
And so that screen, typically between our legs, we have one screen here, screen here,

933
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,560
screen here.

934
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,200
So typically we keep the SA page down here, and then we'll have our radar here, or our

935
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,280
FLIR, and a different type of radar over here.

936
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,760
And so the SA page takes all of our sensors and has a fused image.

937
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:29,040
It's a God's eye view, 360 degrees around our aircraft, the aircraft in the middle,

938
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,000
with color maps and all this stuff.

939
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,200
So that's kind of like the conglomerator of all the data.

940
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,200
Right.

941
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,200
Okay.

942
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,200
That makes sense.

943
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,200
And that's a God's eye view.

944
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,200
The thing's here, and then the other thing you can pull down here, these turn, and then

945
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,760
this just kind of, with no radius of turn, just start going in the other direction from

946
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,120
a God's eye view.

947
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:54,240
What that turned out to be, it seems, upon further analysis, was that the object did

948
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,480
with a vertical turn, essentially like a vertical J-hook, whereas if you're looking from a God's

949
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,480
eye view-

950
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,480
So like that?

951
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,480
Yeah.

952
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,400
in like a few hundred feet, the reverse direction.

953
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,200
Which is not something you see a fighter jet do.

954
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
No, certainly not.

955
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,640
It takes almost a mile for a fighter jet to turn.

956
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,960
But I don't think this was fighter jet size, per se, it was smaller.

957
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:27,880
And I say that because our velocity vector, which is in the HUD, but also gets transcribed

958
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,840
onto the FLIR, that's set to a size.

959
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,600
And we can set that in our jet so that if we're in a dogfight and the wings of the aircraft

960
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,600
in front of us in our HUD are equal to the size of that velocity vector, it gives us

961
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,120
a rough estimate of the distance of the aircraft.

962
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,440
And so if I look at that velocity vector and we're 10 miles away and that object is half

963
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,480
the size of that velocity vector, it gives me a rough estimate of the size.

964
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,120
And I don't know what they necessarily have it set to, so I can't necessarily make a judgment

965
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,120
on the size.

966
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:05,120
However, if it was set to standard, I don't have a number, but looking at it, it would

967
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:09,120
be smaller than an F-18 based on its relative size to the velocity vector.

968
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,720
Smaller than an F-18.

969
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,720
How long is an F-18?

970
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,720
Oh, shit.

971
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,720
Put me on that.

972
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,720
That's something you should know, right?

973
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,720
Yeah, 30 feet, 35 feet, something like that.

974
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,120
35 feet long, and the wingspan, roughly-

975
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
28.

976
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,120
28.

977
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,120
We're going to have to cut this part because I'm probably wrong.

978
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,760
Maybe you can find that.

979
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,760
We've pride ourselves in not doing stuff that doesn't affect us in combat.

980
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,760
56 feet?

981
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,760
Ah, man.

982
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,760
Wow.

983
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,760
That's big.

984
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,760
No, that's the Hornet.

985
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,920
So the Super Hornet is twice the size.

986
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,920
Not necessarily length, but it's a big aircraft.

987
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,920
60 feet.

988
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Yep.

989
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,920
That was way wrong.

990
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
Whoa.

991
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,920
So that's what you were flying?

992
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,920
Yep.

993
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,920
The Super Hornet.

994
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Find some better images of this thing.

995
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:56,360
It's 33% larger overall, carry different engines, electronics, and all that.

996
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,280
Carry lots of weapons.

997
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,640
Wow.

998
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,680
That's incredible, man.

999
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,040
So yeah, anyways-

1000
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,040
Look at that one.

1001
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,880
Look at all the bombs on the bottom of that one.

1002
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,880
The one in the middle?

1003
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,880
Yeah, right there.

1004
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,880
Jeez, that thing is loaded.

1005
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,840
What?

1006
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:29,800
It's an Argum ER, advanced anti-radiation guided missile, extra range, Argum ER.

1007
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,160
So that is something that you would shoot, and that's actually not an F-18 right there.

1008
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,160
Oh, it's not?

1009
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,160
No.

1010
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,160
That is actually a growler.

1011
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,160
A growler.

1012
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,160
Yeah.

1013
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,480
And actually, well, I'll tell you what, that's actually probably a test one.

1014
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,960
What is the sickest jet that exists?

1015
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,960
Oh, man.

1016
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,560
I hate this question.

1017
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,720
I'm partial to the F-35 because it's just the right aircraft for the digital environment

1018
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,460
that they need to operate in.

1019
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,880
We talked about flying and operating a weapon.

1020
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,880
That's a 36.

1021
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,880
Yeah, I don't think a 36 exists.

1022
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,560
Okay, this is a 35.

1023
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,560
Yeah.

1024
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,160
I mean, the F-22 is a great jet as well.

1025
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,160
I mean, the F-22-

1026
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,160
Wow.

1027
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
That thing looks pretty cool.

1028
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,720
It's like very stealth looking.

1029
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,080
It is a stealth aircraft.

1030
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,120
That's a gen five stealth aircraft that's designed for penetration.

1031
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,920
Okay.

1032
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,280
Like basically every fifth generation fighter is nowadays.

1033
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,520
That has pluses and minuses.

1034
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,600
For example, the F-22, fantastic aircraft, lots of thrust, ability to operate high and

1035
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:41,680
fast, all the good stuff, and it's stealthy, and all its weapons are carried internally.

1036
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,880
But that also means the sensors on those weapons can't look out either.

1037
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,680
What does that mean?

1038
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,160
The sensors on the weapons can't look out?

1039
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:56,400
You build weapons, say there's one called the AIM-9X, which is an IR seeking missile,

1040
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,160
which we use to employ it in close range.

1041
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:07,040
It could also be used for, let's consider high off-boresight shots.

1042
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,720
That sensor needs to be able to kind of almost look behind you in a sense to find that guy.

1043
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:15,440
If your weapons are loaded internally to your bay, it doesn't have the ability to do that.

1044
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Right?

1045
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,840
So there's some interesting problems.

1046
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,040
I know they've worked through them at this point to some degree so that those aren't

1047
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:26,360
as much of an issue, but no fighter is perfect is the point, and they're built for different

1048
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,360
things.

1049
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,040
The F-22 is no different, and the F-35 is no different.

1050
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,120
Very different aircraft, but both applicable in the modern warfare.

1051
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,120
Yeah.

1052
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:38,880
You know, it's funny, isn't it true that when the first, I forget the name of it, but the

1053
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:45,400
first, that big triangular black stealth bomber came out.

1054
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,040
There was, I think the government was going along with stories that it was UFO.

1055
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:54,800
They were trying to push the fact that it was a conspiracy because they hadn't officially

1056
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,800
announced it yet.

1057
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,480
So this is the gimbal video, right?

1058
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,680
So this is the object we were seeing next to the five other objects.

1059
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,680
Okay.

1060
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,680
Yeah.

1061
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,680
Let's go ahead and roll it.

1062
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,280
These are friends of yours.

1063
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,280
It was so weird when I was, I'll tell you a sec.

1064
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:43,960
Yeah, one of them was at my wedding party.

1065
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,960
Really?

1066
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,440
I won't say which one, but one of them I spent most of my career with.

1067
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,100
We went through training together in the fleet replacement squadron when we first met.

1068
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,000
So we were like in a five person class together.

1069
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,400
We trained together and he ended up going on the boat with me.

1070
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,920
He was like my whizzo, not my whizzo, but he was the whiz on the back seat.

1071
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,360
We went to do our night landing for the very first time.

1072
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,360
Oh really?

1073
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:14,160
And it was his first time landing on a boat because the whizzos don't do that until later.

1074
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,440
But the pilots get day traps when they're in the advanced strike fighter training.

1075
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,960
So with the whizzo, they don't do the landing though, right?

1076
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,960
They don't.

1077
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,960
Right.

1078
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,480
But it's still like, this is like now they're like with another student, right?

1079
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,320
And this might the student's first time landing on a boat and now he's in the back seat.

1080
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,320
You know what I mean?

1081
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,840
So it's kind of like this big trust thing in a way.

1082
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,800
It's like, all right, saddle up.

1083
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,080
You know, here's a guy who's never been in a boat before doing it by himself and you're

1084
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,080
sitting in the back.

1085
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,080
Oh God.

1086
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,080
Right?

1087
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,080
So I imagine it's a little nerve wracking.

1088
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,080
They don't have a stick.

1089
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,080
I mean, they're not pilots.

1090
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,080
Right.

1091
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,080
They're just holding their breath.

1092
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,080
Yeah.

1093
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,080
So we did this.

1094
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,080
We did this together and it was an interesting story.

1095
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,080
Hey, I know that guy.

1096
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,080
We live two guys.

1097
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,080
Yeah.

1098
00:57:53,080 --> 00:58:01,640
So we were going to do our first night trap together and the way we do that is we hold

1099
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:06,760
way back behind the boat up high and we actually, when it's our time plus or minus three seconds

1100
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,400
of our push time, we have to be at a particular point in the sky.

1101
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:14,160
As soon as we hit that, a certain airspeed would go down eight degrees nose down, 250

1102
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,960
knots, which is pretty aggressive.

1103
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,320
That's like, I'm pretty sure that's aerobatic flight in a Cessna theoretically, but in effect

1104
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,320
it's no big deal.

1105
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,960
We're coming down and then at about 5,000 feet, we arrest our descent from eight degrees

1106
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,280
nose down to four degrees nose down.

1107
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,520
Because there's something called the minute deliverable.

1108
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,620
If we're descending at that eight degrees nose down, our rate of descent is greater

1109
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:43,120
than how much altitude we have left in one minute if we were to continue doing that.

1110
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,560
So you're going to die in one minute if you don't change something here.

1111
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,240
So that's why we bring it up a little bit.

1112
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,960
So what happened was as we were kind of approaching that altitude where we start to roll out,

1113
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,440
we're down eight degrees, everything's steady.

1114
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,440
That's all good.

1115
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,120
But as soon as we start pulling essentially, our mission computer is inside the jet, failed.

1116
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,080
And they started resetting.

1117
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,720
So what that led to was all of our displays going blank and resetting.

1118
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:19,160
So not only, now this is night landing, so there are no external lights, I have no navigation,

1119
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,800
the jet's still flyable, I just can't see where I am.

1120
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,800
And this is just as I start to pull up, which means I've lost my equilibrium.

1121
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,760
So I'm pulling at one G, which means it feels like I'm sitting in a chair, but I could be

1122
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,120
upside down, I could be sideways, I could be inverted about to hit the water, it just

1123
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,280
feels like I'm sitting in my chair, it's no different.

1124
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,720
And that's what's so terrifying.

1125
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,800
The mission computers reset, we're pulling up, they come back and we find ourselves somewhere

1126
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,840
like this, and then they go out again.

1127
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:53,640
So now I'm like, fuck me, and I'm not waiting for the reset, now I'm looking for my flashlight.

1128
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,200
So I can at least turn it on and shine it at my backup instruments, because there's

1129
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,880
no real lights on those either.

1130
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,400
And so I'm trying to do that while I'm fiddling with that, essentially trying to somehow keep

1131
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,640
the plane upright, because there's a layer, overcast layer at 8,000 feet, which means

1132
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,320
there is zero light.

1133
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,200
If there's just no moon and just sunlight, that's cool.

1134
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,480
You can see the waves, you can see the ground, but when there's an overcast, like 8,000,

1135
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,280
you might as well have your eyes closed, you just can't tell.

1136
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,440
What is this?

1137
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,440
What is it?

1138
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,440
Night landing?

1139
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,720
Oh, this is a night landing.

1140
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,880
Yeah, I have a video just like this.

1141
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,040
What are we even looking at right now?

1142
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,080
This is a tiny, looks like, oh, it's the aircraft carrier.

1143
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,000
There it is.

1144
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Wow.

1145
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
So that's, I mean, see how it's like black up there?

1146
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,320
That's what it looks like if you have that overcast layer, you literally can't see anything.

1147
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,920
So you're basically surrounded in blackness, and you lost all your, all your...

1148
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,560
It's like I just went blind.

1149
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:56,240
Everything went gone, and you pull out your flashlight in the cockpit and you're shining

1150
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,240
it on your back of the instruments.

1151
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,240
I'm trying to at this point, yeah.

1152
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,680
I'm like trying to get it out because it's strapped right here, and I'm like, I'll just

1153
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,880
tilt it down, turn it on, and then it'll be like, I don't want to hold it.

1154
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,760
Meanwhile, you don't know if you're about to hit the water, hit the, are you above the

1155
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,760
water?

1156
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,760
You're above the...

1157
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,080
Yeah, it's all ocean below us.

1158
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,560
We can't see it, like I said, because of that overcast layer.

1159
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:19,720
So yeah, it was just like, man, we ended up, you know, the mission computers were rebooting

1160
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,720
again.

1161
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,520
The rebooting is staying up that time.

1162
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,720
We were somewhere like this, you know, kind of just floating there around like 3,500 feet

1163
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,840
or so as we were kind of coming down like this, just slicing down like this more or

1164
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,840
less, you know?

1165
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,840
Oh my God.

1166
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,840
And so again, we had a minute.

1167
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,840
It takes about 10 or 15 seconds to reboot.

1168
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,240
What is the protocol?

1169
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,640
What if your instruments don't come back online?

1170
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,640
What is the protocol?

1171
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,620
What is the, what are you supposed to do?

1172
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:48,600
Go to my standby instruments, yeah, and then fly that back, essentially.

1173
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,260
So at this point, we declared an emergency.

1174
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:57,280
We were probably about four miles, five miles from, like two miles from actually like being

1175
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,280
on the path.

1176
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,280
You know what I mean?

1177
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,920
Like being in that image where you like see the runway and there's a lens over there.

1178
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,800
So we declared an emergency and that was the easiest landing.

1179
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,920
I thought it was going to be very difficult and stressful to land at the boat for the

1180
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,920
first time.

1181
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,560
But as soon as I saw the landing lens in the runway, essentially the boat, I was like,

1182
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,640
wow, you know, at least I won't hit the ground because I know where it is now.

1183
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:20,400
And so everything else was just easy because I was just happy to be able to see, you know,

1184
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,600
see the ground essentially if it went out again.

1185
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,920
Wow, that's terrifying, man.

1186
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:33,440
So anyways, we did that together and then we ended up going to the boat and I was taught

1187
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,560
my class on the boat.

1188
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,000
They sent me priority alpha, which means I was deployable to, or I was, I could be sent

1189
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,720
to a forward deploy squadron just because my grades were high and then I did well enough.

1190
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:49,160
And so about two weeks after I finished that training, I was sent out to the USS Enterprise

1191
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,680
and I flew my first combat mission about a week after that.

1192
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,440
And the gentleman I was just talking about, he actually got assigned to the same squadron.

1193
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,800
So then we hung out for the next three years, we did specialized training together.

1194
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:06,240
And then when I left, he left too, and he actually transitioned to be a pilot.

1195
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,080
And so he actually ended up in Meridian, Mississippi when I was an instructor there as well.

1196
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,080
No way.

1197
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,760
So we pretty much spent our whole career together.

1198
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,760
That's incredible.

1199
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,760
Pretty cool.

1200
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,440
So this, that gimbal video that we just watched, it was only 35 seconds long.

1201
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,360
It was much longer than that though, right?

1202
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,920
I don't know if I want to say much longer, but it was definitely more there.

1203
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,920
Yeah.

1204
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,640
Why, why are they only, why do we only get 30 seconds?

1205
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,640
I don't know.

1206
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,640
I don't know.

1207
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,360
Do you have any speculation why?

1208
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:39,440
I mean, there, you mentioned that there was like the wedge shape formation.

1209
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,560
Is that a part of this video?

1210
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:47,680
I never saw those on the FLIR, but what I did see them on was the, the essay page.

1211
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,680
Okay.

1212
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,560
And that was primarily what I was looking on.

1213
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:56,080
And when I did look at the FLIR, basically saw the same image that you saw, plus maybe

1214
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,400
a little bit more near the end as the flight mechanics seem to get rockier.

1215
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:06,360
So it kind of, it kept kind of doing that, that motion that you see that kind of seemed

1216
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,560
unstable in a sense.

1217
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,840
I don't want to put words onto it until it comes out because it has been like six years

1218
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,920
for me now since I've seen that video and it hasn't, you know.

1219
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,920
Which one is this?

1220
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,840
Just the more of the gimbal, essentially.

1221
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,840
The full version.

1222
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,840
Oh yeah.

1223
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,720
So correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Christopher Mellon was the one who sort of

1224
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:28,520
leaked these videos and is the reason they even came out in the first place back in,

1225
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,560
what was the year that first came out in the New York Times?

1226
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,120
I think it was 2017.

1227
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,120
2017.

1228
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,120
That's what it was.

1229
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,120
Yeah.

1230
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:39,400
We talked about in James Fox's documentary, The Phenomenon, how there's much more, these

1231
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,080
videos are much longer and they're yet to release the full videos for whatever reason.

1232
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,000
Do you have any speculation of why they wouldn't release the full videos?

1233
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,840
Well I think it depends on your definition.

1234
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:56,400
So full video, the full video has radar data, right?

1235
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,520
So the FLIR and the radar and the situational awareness page are recorded at the same time.

1236
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,840
Not necessarily those two pages, but the screens that they're displayed on.

1237
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,680
So if you have one, you have the other.

1238
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:11,520
So what that means is the situational awareness page with all the radar data, it did exist.

1239
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,880
I don't know if it still does exist, but that's what you'd want to see because it has all

1240
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:21,080
the radar, the kinematics, and it's going to show it over the entire course of when

1241
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,160
they were detectable, whether they were directly looking at it or not.

1242
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:30,320
So there is much more data to be had even outside of just the video.

1243
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,520
What is your buddy, the guy who actually filmed this, the guy who was in your wedding party,

1244
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,120
did you guys talk about this often?

1245
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:41,680
Not really, he's still in, he's deployed a lot, he's very busy, so he just heads down.

1246
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,680
But no, not really.

1247
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,160
I'm eager to engage with him when the time is right.

1248
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:49,760
I know this isn't the time to be distracting him with stuff like this and I'm sure he already

1249
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,600
has enough of it from the people inside.

1250
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:56,400
It's no secret who he is within the military just based off the uniqueness of his response

1251
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,400
to the video.

1252
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,720
Is that the reason that he hasn't gone public about it is because he's still in there and

1253
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,480
he just doesn't want to, he doesn't want the attention?

1254
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,320
Not even attention.

1255
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,120
Legally, he's not allowed to speak about it.

1256
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,120
Legally, he's not allowed to.

1257
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:12,680
Do you see any other military people just kind of talking about it?

1258
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,680
You?

1259
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,560
Yeah, I was almost arrested for that.

1260
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,560
Really?

1261
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,400
Yeah, that's what I've been told.

1262
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:25,440
So when I did that, I communicated to the best extent I could that I was just communicating

1263
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,120
as a private citizen about experiences I had.

1264
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:36,800
The night before I left to go to D.C., I got a call at like 10 p.m. saying that I now had

1265
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,840
orders to be there and I needed to be there in my uniform, my whites, essentially, and

1266
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:48,120
I needed to go to the Pentagon before I went to Congress and the Senate, which was not

1267
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,200
a great revelation.

1268
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,840
So I was scrambling, right?

1269
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:56,120
I was months away from getting out, my uniforms packed up and shipped across the country

1270
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,120
at this point.

1271
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:02,920
I wasn't expecting to wear in case someone died or something, really.

1272
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:08,680
So I'm going around to my buddy's houses at midnight, borrowing their uniforms and their

1273
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,880
stuff so I could show up because my flight was out like six in the morning the next day.

1274
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,880
Oh my gosh.

1275
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,200
So it was a bit of a scramble.

1276
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:22,800
I ended up going to the Pentagon into the bowels with some naval intelligence folks,

1277
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:27,040
some who we might be more familiar with nowadays since the public hearings.

1278
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,040
Who?

1279
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,040
I'm so bad with names.

1280
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:38,160
But we had a conversation about our experiences.

1281
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,560
It was nothing nefarious, necessarily.

1282
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,560
It was more, I think, wanting to hear from the horse's mouth before him.

1283
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,240
I got quite the entourage from there over to the Senate.

1284
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:55,040
There were representatives from the numerous admirals from the Navy and the Pentagon that

1285
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:00,640
accompanied me to that meeting, which included representatives from the executive branch,

1286
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,640
Pentagon, Senate, elsewhere.

1287
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:10,560
And essentially, me at a table like this with Pentagon folks on one side and senators and

1288
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:14,400
whatnot and their staffers over here and me at the head of the table.

1289
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,400
How old are you at this point?

1290
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,400
That's a good question.

1291
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,400
How old am I now?

1292
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,360
How old am I now?

1293
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,360
That's a great question.

1294
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:25,360
I was probably 27, 28.

1295
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,360
Wow.

1296
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,360
Yeah, maybe a little bit older.

1297
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,360
What was that like?

1298
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,360
What was the conversation like?

1299
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,880
What did they seem interested in?

1300
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,960
What did you sense the priority was there with them?

1301
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,080
They seemed to just want to understand what they were seeing.

1302
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:47,600
So from the Pentagon side, it seemed like they had some understanding that there was

1303
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,600
a problem in this regard, but it was classified.

1304
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:56,720
We weren't really able to have too much of an open conversation about it in that environment.

1305
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,640
I would say things.

1306
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,800
Senators would ask me questions and they'd ask the DOD folks, do you have any comment

1307
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,800
on that?

1308
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:09,640
And the answer would be yes, no, or we'll talk about it under a higher classification,

1309
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,640
essentially.

1310
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:16,440
They didn't have a lot to add to that conversation on the Pentagon side, but it was clear that

1311
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:23,240
the folks on the Senate side were intrigued and were interested and they seemed to be

1312
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,240
asking the right questions.

1313
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,400
Of course, at the time, I didn't know where it was going to go.

1314
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:33,560
I said my piece and then just headed back, essentially.

1315
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:39,040
It was maybe an hour maybe conversation, I think.

1316
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,040
What were you afraid was going to happen?

1317
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:44,240
Were you afraid that something was going to happen and they were going to get fired or

1318
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,240
something?

1319
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,720
Yeah, that or Leavenworth, I suppose, but you can't really get fired from the military

1320
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,720
per se.

1321
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:57,160
I mean, you can a little bit, but I don't think that was the fear.

1322
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,880
What do they say?

1323
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:06,200
I was ignorant of all this kind of drama going on in the background.

1324
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:14,200
That night, I got a call from someone who was in the meeting that we had on the Hill

1325
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:20,400
inquiring whether the Pentagon had intimidated me or whether they had tried to influence

1326
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,200
my story or anything of that nature.

1327
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,840
There seemed to be somewhat of a distrust between those two.

1328
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,840
Wow.

1329
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,840
That's very interesting.

1330
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,120
What I communicated was that that was not the case.

1331
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,640
I did not perceive that.

1332
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,640
Well, maybe a little bit.

1333
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:41,200
Well, I imagine that's got to be an intimidating situation for a 27-year-old to be called up

1334
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:45,760
there the next day and sitting down in front of all these people, especially discussing

1335
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,760
things.

1336
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,640
I mean, it was classified stuff, right?

1337
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,640
It was not.

1338
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,640
It was not classified.

1339
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,400
It was not classified because it wasn't happening, right?

1340
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,640
Like this wasn't a thing.

1341
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,640
What made you think that you were almost going to be arrested?

1342
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,680
What indication did you have of that?

1343
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,680
Did they make that clear?

1344
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,840
The person that ended up being responsible for giving me the orders came up to me and

1345
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,880
told me they did that so I would not be arrested.

1346
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,880
That's how I know that.

1347
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:12,880
Wow, man.

1348
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,680
Well, that explains why no one else is speaking out about it then.

1349
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:23,880
Again, I wouldn't expect military members to publicly speak to the press about this.

1350
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:29,800
That is, I would suggest, out of bounds, especially now that there is action going on.

1351
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,160
There is a proper way to alleviate this through the system.

1352
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,880
I didn't have that luxury at the time.

1353
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,920
Not only did I not have that luxury, people didn't even think this was a real thing.

1354
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:43,280
So I made a decision I made so that we could prevent someone from getting into a misapprentive

1355
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,920
instead of it happening and then us writing our PCL in blood again.

1356
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,160
When was the first time you ever spoke to Commander Fravor about this stuff?

1357
01:11:51,520 --> 01:12:00,480
I spoke to Commander Fravor the first time I interviewed with the History Channel for

1358
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,680
the show Unidentified.

1359
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,600
Not the first time, the only time I did.

1360
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,200
They introduced me to Dave Pryor and then he was there as well.

1361
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:14,000
I think they were kind of using it as a kind of a comfort thing for me to show that there

1362
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,320
was someone else.

1363
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:19,600
I actually had recognized Dave because I hadn't known him personally at all but he was in

1364
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:26,160
a show called Carrier, which is kind of like a documentary of Squadron and he was the commanding

1365
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,640
officer of the Squadron at the time Dave was.

1366
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,720
So I had seen him actually before I was even a pilot on that show.

1367
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,720
Oh really?

1368
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:36,560
It was funny to, you know, and we're friends now.

1369
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,560
We talk a lot now.

1370
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,800
But yeah, that was the first time I met him.

1371
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,960
I know the objects were very different and the stories are very different, but what was

1372
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,520
the biggest thing that stuck out to you talking to him?

1373
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,760
I don't know if it's the biggest thing, but the thing that kind of seemed similar was

1374
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,760
just kind of what the reaction was, right?

1375
01:12:53,760 --> 01:13:00,400
How it was just completely laughed off and ignored and trivialized, which always pissed

1376
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,560
me off.

1377
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:08,240
Not because, I mean, you know, we all joke and it's fun, that's all good, but you know,

1378
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:14,600
this is directly something that we train for and have a lot of respect for, which is not

1379
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:19,600
only aviation safety hazards in the sky, but tactical threats as well.

1380
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,440
We're very well aware that other nations are spying on us, you know, at various times we're

1381
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:28,120
flying out there and this could very easily be an extension in some cases, or it could

1382
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:35,280
be leveraged to be a vulnerability for us if a foreign nation wanted to do so.

1383
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:41,380
And so from my perspective, I just wasn't, I don't approve of the mocking from that angle

1384
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:44,320
because this is exactly what we're trained to do.

1385
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:50,080
A friend of mine, James Fox, he produced the movie, The Phenomenon, I'm sure you're familiar

1386
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,360
with it, I don't know if you are or not, but he was very close with Jacques Vallee, who

1387
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:58,160
is one of the, I don't know how close you pay attention, I don't know how close you

1388
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:02,840
pay attention to like the history of UFO sightings and the different documentaries that have

1389
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,840
come out about it.

1390
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,640
I know Commander Fabric doesn't, I know he's not very interested in UFOs in general, but

1391
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,760
James is a big name in like the UFO community as far as investigating the different events

1392
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,280
that have happened throughout history of the United States and around the world.

1393
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:25,740
But when he was making that movie, The Phenomenon, he told me before he went to interview Commander

1394
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:30,560
Fravor for the first time, he was working close with Dr. Jacques Vallee and he asked

1395
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,780
him if he had any sort of, you know, can you give me any sort of guidance to how I can

1396
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,920
approach this guy?

1397
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:45,080
And Jacques Vallee, his question was, I'm very interested in the possibility of them

1398
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:49,520
seeing it, if they ever saw it with the naked eye or not, or if it was only on radar, because

1399
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:55,960
his main concern was holograms in the sky.

1400
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:00,480
So and when he brought this up to Commander Fravor, he was actually kind of like, he almost

1401
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,560
stopped the interview because of, he's like, how, you think I'm an idiot?

1402
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,760
You think, you think I don't know what DARPA is, you think I know what holograms are, you

1403
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,760
don't think I knew what I saw?

1404
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,080
He said, he was very like, not happy about that question.

1405
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,880
But a lot of people speculate, especially on, depending on where you look online or

1406
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:23,360
wherever, that a lot of these things could potentially be some sort of secret military

1407
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:29,920
technology that is used to confuse enemy radar, like with different holograms or whatever

1408
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:30,920
it may be.

1409
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,320
I don't know which part of the military would be responsible for this.

1410
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,720
I don't know if it'd be the Navy or the Air Force or whatever.

1411
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,080
But are you familiar with this idea?

1412
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,080
Yeah.

1413
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,480
What are your thoughts on it?

1414
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,060
In particular, I even had a guy on here that was a Harvard professor that was contracted

1415
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,060
by DARPA.

1416
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,880
He was the one who brought this up to me in the first place.

1417
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:56,080
And he claimed, he said to me that these sort of holograms that are designed to distract

1418
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,960
enemy radar are a real thing.

1419
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:58,960
Something I've never heard of before.

1420
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:03,280
Yeah, let me just kind of provide some background on what DARPA actually does.

1421
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:11,120
I've worked with DARPA, it'd probably be mad at me, but Dave's worked with DARPA.

1422
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:17,520
He works generally, well, I don't want to say anything more, but DARPA is a very low

1423
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,800
technology readiness level organization.

1424
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:27,360
What that means is they work on things that are very low TRL, call that TRL 0, where the

1425
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,520
other end of the spectrum would be TRL or technology readiness level 9.

1426
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:37,320
And 9 means that it's a capability that is deployable for testing, essentially, with

1427
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,320
operators.

1428
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,320
Right?

1429
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,320
9.

1430
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:45,200
And so DARPA usually works around the 0 to maybe like doing a little bit more of like

1431
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,520
3 or 4 TRL.

1432
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,160
So what that means is the technology is not really proven.

1433
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,680
If it's a 0, it might be math equations.

1434
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:59,360
And so when people talk about DARPA doing things, DARPA's MO isn't to build an operational

1435
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,960
technology and then test it for years.

1436
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:03,960
That's not what they do.

1437
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,920
That would be post TRL 9.

1438
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:11,400
That would be another organization, it would be the Navy.

1439
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:15,880
Because they would be the ones, or perhaps another organization, and I don't think there's

1440
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,160
a relevant like NSA or CIA, like they could potentially leverage that technology and take

1441
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,160
it in.

1442
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:27,720
If we're talking about Nemesis, which is what I understand to be kind of generally speaking,

1443
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:33,800
kind of the holographic EW confusion type technology, it would be the Navy testing it

1444
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,880
in our most active training ranges off the East Coast.

1445
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:37,880
That's what that would mean.

1446
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,920
It would mean that they were doing it for the better part of a decade and still doing

1447
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:42,920
it.

1448
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,960
It would also mean that they're doing it over international waters, which means any country

1449
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,240
can go out there and study it.

1450
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:57,000
And it would also mean that we're not testing these things at our billion dollar ranges

1451
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,080
that we have out in the Western US that are designed specifically for this type of activity,

1452
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:07,560
such as Navy China Lake or any of these other testing facilities that we have.

1453
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,560
Navy China Lake?

1454
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,560
Yeah.

1455
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:15,200
It's a weapons testing place that a lot of test pilots go to in the Navy or other places.

1456
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,560
It's where we develop weapons, essentially, and test them out.

1457
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:22,760
We get a new bomb sent to China Lake strapped on F-18 of the test pilot and see what happens

1458
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,760
when you drop it.

1459
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,880
It's an operational test area.

1460
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,080
So we have places to test this type of stuff.

1461
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:33,640
So when people talk about these programs like that, that's all well and good.

1462
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:38,040
There's a lot of interesting technology that could be pieced together to provide examples

1463
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,320
of how something could be feasible.

1464
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:45,240
If you step away from that and look at the application and the implementation of that

1465
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:49,040
technology, it starts to not make as much sense.

1466
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,960
Why would we be testing this for seven, eight, nine years after it's been public in international

1467
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:59,040
waters off the coast, especially when there's safety reports now?

1468
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:04,720
Why would we be testing it for eight to 10 years in international waters?

1469
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,480
Like you're saying that we wouldn't typically do it for that long?

1470
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,480
No.

1471
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,840
That's a whole cycle of development.

1472
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,520
Ten years is a long time to be testing a particular piece of technology in a public yet hidden

1473
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,520
manner.

1474
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,160
So this doesn't directly refute what you're saying, I understand that, but I'm just kind

1475
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:30,200
of providing some context around these systems and why it becomes a little probability.

1476
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,520
I think what you said about DARPA is very interesting and a lot of people could gain

1477
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,920
some context from that.

1478
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:38,000
So you said you worked with DARPA.

1479
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,800
Why would a Navy pilot work with DARPA and what exactly is DARPA for people who don't

1480
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,800
know?

1481
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:45,800
Navy pilot, yeah.

1482
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,760
So Navy pilot in it, but when I was working at BAA Systems as a technology development

1483
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:54,680
manager, that was my job was essentially to source or create or ideate on technology that

1484
01:19:54,680 --> 01:20:00,880
would be relevant to the war fighter in 10 to 15 years that I could essentially pitch

1485
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,160
to DARPA and we build it.

1486
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:07,600
And so primarily what I was doing when I was at BAA System was automating my job as a fighter

1487
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,600
pilot.

1488
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:14,240
I was working on multi-agent intelligences, right, so autonomous wingman, forward edge

1489
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:20,720
tactical systems such as tactics on weapons or aircraft related to autonomous systems,

1490
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,360
the reality of what hypersonic weapons and tactics look like.

1491
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,200
So this is all areas I was working in.

1492
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,200
Wow.

1493
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,360
So and what specifically does DARPA do, what does it stand for?

1494
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,120
DARPA is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

1495
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,700
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, okay.

1496
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:47,460
So their charge is to work on technologies that are highly risky, that could fail.

1497
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:48,980
They expect a lot of their projects to fail.

1498
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,060
In fact, they call it DARPA hard projects.

1499
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:54,700
Like if you bring a project that's not hard enough, they'll just tell you no, right?

1500
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:58,100
They would prefer to see something that has a lower probability of success, but a greater

1501
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:01,100
reward if it's successful, right?

1502
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,780
So that's kind of the regime that they work in.

1503
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:06,220
And they work close with these quote unquote think tanks, correct?

1504
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:07,220
Is that?

1505
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:09,500
I don't know if that's the case or not.

1506
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,940
I mean, what is a think tank?

1507
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,940
I don't know.

1508
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:13,940
I mean, I'm sure a think tank.

1509
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:14,940
Sounds cool.

1510
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,940
Yeah.

1511
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,460
I mean, I think tank could potentially just be a group of smart people that bid on a contract

1512
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:22,420
for that DARPA was put out and they have the specialty to win that contract.

1513
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:28,260
But DARPA typically works with big defense corporations, but also with the startup community

1514
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:29,260
in some sense.

1515
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:34,060
The intelligence community essentially has its own version of DARPA that is specific

1516
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:35,780
for intelligence type operations.

1517
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:37,020
DARPA is more military.

1518
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,460
But yeah, that's what they do.

1519
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:43,260
So are you aware of anything?

1520
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:47,700
Is there any sort of technology that's utilized with the military to confuse enemy radar like

1521
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,700
this though?

1522
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:52,500
Like is there even if there's tons of it, not like this per se, but there's a ton of

1523
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,500
that, right?

1524
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:57,180
That falls under general category of electronic warfare or even cyber warfare.

1525
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,180
You could consider it that.

1526
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:02,300
I mean, another branch essentially that's being stood up at this point, cyber command,

1527
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,300
having an understanding.

1528
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:07,660
The F-35 that I told you about is very much an electronic warfare aircraft.

1529
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,980
It soaks everything up.

1530
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:09,980
It can jam.

1531
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:11,580
It can do all sorts of stuff.

1532
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:17,860
When we start talking about, and it's not just us, you know, everyone wants to see how

1533
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:21,900
we can fool the next, the first wave essentially, right?

1534
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:26,980
If we have a World War III with anyone or whatever, there's going to be a lot of jamming

1535
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:31,140
and missiles are going to be falling out of the sky and things of that nature.

1536
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:34,980
And one way to do that is with fooling radars to make them think that there's something

1537
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:38,620
there when there's not.

1538
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,540
I don't know why you would then take that and apply that to IR.

1539
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,260
I guess there are some reasons.

1540
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:48,500
IR sensors are getting better for combat, I'll say.

1541
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:56,300
There's something called the IRST, and that is essentially an IR targeting pod.

1542
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:59,580
The Russians have been using them for a while, but we didn't quite use them that much because

1543
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:00,580
our radars were better.

1544
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:04,420
They were essentially compensating for a lack of radar technology by having them.

1545
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,940
But we're getting IRST now as well.

1546
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:13,700
And so really what that is is a different way of being able to target into these things

1547
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:14,700
at range.

1548
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:21,260
Because if you think of the way Fravor talked about the tic-tac moving, it seemed like he

1549
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,580
was basically describing a laser pointer, right?

1550
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:24,980
That's the way those things moved.

1551
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:28,500
If you point it at a wall...

1552
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:32,820
It was moving as if it didn't have mass, I think was the way of describing it.

1553
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:38,780
Light does not really have mass, so a shadow or something that was nonmassive could move

1554
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,700
as if it didn't have mass if it wasn't physically real.

1555
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:50,220
So it was nuts and bolts, but it was also psychic, if you will, like knew where he was

1556
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:52,220
going to be, right?

1557
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:56,060
Yeah, I mean, the objects showed up at the cap point.

1558
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,380
Is that...

1559
01:23:58,380 --> 01:23:59,820
That wouldn't be psychic.

1560
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:08,620
I know sort of the way these things are moving doesn't necessarily jive with general relativity,

1561
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:09,620
right?

1562
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:19,460
These things could be using some sort of propulsion that is gravity, like anti-gravity, or it's

1563
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:23,740
not necessarily like a jet, it's not shooting something out the back to move.

1564
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:27,580
It's somehow manipulating gravity to move like that.

1565
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:31,260
I'll agree that we don't see them spitting stuff out the back, but the mechanism that

1566
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:37,460
they are using, although gravity and space-time metric engineering is a potential option for

1567
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,740
that, there I think are others as well.

1568
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:40,740
Really?

1569
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:41,740
Yeah.

1570
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:42,740
So there's...

1571
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,940
Well, let me just say this.

1572
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:49,260
Transportation really at the end of the day comes down to energy, right?

1573
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:54,500
If you can put enough energy into one piece, we have the math to build a warp drive or

1574
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:59,780
what have you, engineer space-time metric, warp space-time, which therefore would be

1575
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:03,260
warping gravity and allow you to potentially move super-liminally.

1576
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:08,460
That's one fun theory.

1577
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:12,060
Mass reduction is a technology that has been proposed.

1578
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:15,660
If you are able to reduce the mass of an object, then moving it through the air would be much

1579
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:17,860
more seamless.

1580
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:22,940
Is it warping space-time around it to avoid the friction or is it somehow moving air particles

1581
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:24,620
around it, right?

1582
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,060
We just don't know the answer to these questions.

1583
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:31,460
So one of the things I'm doing is trying to get the answers to those.

1584
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:35,300
And the way I'm doing it is through the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,

1585
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:38,700
where I chair the UAP Integration and Outreach Committing.

1586
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:46,620
It's about a 50-person large engineering organization under the AIAA, or AIAA as I call it, which

1587
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:51,140
is a professional engineering organization with 30,000-plus members.

1588
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:56,180
And we've built a team of fantastic industry engineers that are coming out of the woodwork

1589
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:59,540
to study this from an industry-first viewpoint.

1590
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:03,240
And one of the projects that we have underway is to help define what some of the detection

1591
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,300
mechanisms could be for these objects.

1592
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:09,300
And just like you said, is it affecting gravity and how can we detect that?

1593
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:17,220
Is it using some type of ionization and magnetohydrodynamics to move air around the vehicle?

1594
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:18,820
And if that's the case, how can we detect that?

1595
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:24,380
And so we're going to be promulgating a document to the engineering industry on a yearly basis

1596
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:28,460
that updates the best-sensing phenomenologies and lessons learned and everything we know

1597
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:31,740
so that the rest of the industry can start putting technology together to expand our

1598
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:33,020
data sets.

1599
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:38,460
So there's a lot of private aerospace companies that are working on this, correct?

1600
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:43,700
That are basically sharing information and trying to work together to put more data together

1601
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,260
to try to understand this?

1602
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,540
I don't have information on that.

1603
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:47,540
I thought I read that.

1604
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:51,740
That was part of, what is it, AAIA?

1605
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:56,860
Our group is made up of engineers and scientists from all across the industry, from NASA to

1606
01:26:56,860 --> 01:27:00,940
various DOD, to industry, to startups.

1607
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:03,740
So I wouldn't say necessarily any of those companies they represent.

1608
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:07,740
Actually, I would say they don't represent the companies at all when they're there.

1609
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:11,060
But there are members across the industry that are very interested in this.

1610
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:19,980
Do you think it's possible that there is private aerospace companies, contractors, that have

1611
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:25,540
technology that they're not sharing with the mainstream academia?

1612
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:26,540
Technology?

1613
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:27,540
Yeah, absolutely.

1614
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,540
100%.

1615
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,540
Science?

1616
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,420
I don't know.

1617
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,420
Like, anti-gravity.

1618
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:39,020
Do you think it's possible that there's some sort of private aerospace weapons contractor,

1619
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:45,580
like whatever, for example, Boeing or Lockheed, that has figured out anti-gravity and it's

1620
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,180
not being shared with the public?

1621
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,180
I think it's possible.

1622
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:52,620
Because it would effectively, it would be immune to FOIA requests, right?

1623
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,500
Because it's a private company.

1624
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,300
That's a theory I've heard, or maybe it's not even a theory, maybe it's a fact.

1625
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:01,980
Generally speaking, yeah, I think that is possible that private defense industries and

1626
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:08,220
contractors have technology that isn't promulgated and is classified.

1627
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:13,460
But it would be for them to be testing it off the coast of...

1628
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,420
That's not a defense contractor.

1629
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,020
That would be a government program.

1630
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,020
It would have to be, right?

1631
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:19,020
Yeah.

1632
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,580
Lockheed wouldn't just be out in those areas.

1633
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:25,420
That would have to be, again, approved military tests, which means...

1634
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,460
I mean, forgive me if this is like an ignorant question.

1635
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:29,940
I don't know anything about this stuff.

1636
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:34,980
So Lockheed wouldn't be able to get permission or work with the military to do this kind

1637
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:35,980
of testing?

1638
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:36,980
I'm not saying it's impossible.

1639
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:40,020
I'm just saying that's not the way things work on a regular basis.

1640
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,380
They go to ranges all the time.

1641
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:46,780
I've been to ranges in the defense industry to work on various technologies.

1642
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:51,500
But operational flight training areas and flight operation areas are a totally different

1643
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,500
beast.

1644
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:56,660
I mean, that's a difference between...

1645
01:28:56,660 --> 01:29:01,380
I don't even know the best way to phrase it.

1646
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:05,940
But like I said, that entry area to our working area is one of the busiest places in the sky

1647
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:07,860
on the eastern seaboard.

1648
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:12,580
So we're now testing objects by putting them directly at the entry point of that area at

1649
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:17,340
altitude after hazard reports have been submitted for eight years.

1650
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:18,340
I don't see the logic.

1651
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:21,860
I don't see how we could be testing against ourselves.

1652
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:24,900
Especially when we kind of zoom out and say, okay, where are we now in the world about

1653
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:25,900
this topic?

1654
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:31,820
Do we really think that John Ratcliffe and former President Obama are going out on a

1655
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:38,140
limb because we're testing some EW on the East Coast?

1656
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:44,780
The conversation's got too large to support the thesis that we're testing EW.

1657
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:49,900
In my opinion, we've gone beyond that just based off of how much conversation has been

1658
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:54,100
around this because we're just drawing more attention to this, you know what I mean?

1659
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,100
Right.

1660
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:58,100
And that's another kind of element you have to throw into this whole thing is if it was

1661
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,540
something we had, why would we be throwing all this attention?

1662
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:07,340
Why would the U.S. government intentionally kind of like acknowledge this like this?

1663
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:09,980
Why would the Pentagon acknowledge it so much?

1664
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:15,060
You always have to question their intentions just based on history, right?

1665
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:19,180
Speaking of history, one thing I often think of, this isn't necessarily a leading question,

1666
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:25,300
but what lessons did we learn from the proliferation of nuclear weapons?

1667
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:31,260
We create a nuclear weapon and others are trying to create it and now we live in a world

1668
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:34,740
that has nuclear weapons everywhere and it's a fear.

1669
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:40,260
If we developed a technology that had the power of a nuclear weapon, perhaps even greater,

1670
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:45,580
what lessons would we have learned from that proliferation and taken that and applied to

1671
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:48,340
this new technology?

1672
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:53,900
Where would we have blackened out the conversation, the engineering side, at the fundamental science

1673
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:54,900
side?

1674
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:58,140
I don't know the answer to these questions, but I imagine we learned some lessons from

1675
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,140
that.

1676
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:00,140
Yeah, I don't know, man.

1677
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:06,580
I feel like we're a species that has amnesia when it comes to this kind of stuff.

1678
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:14,540
You know what really kind of like tipped me off to or made me start leaning in the direction

1679
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:21,100
of it could be human technology is that when the Pentagon started really acknowledging

1680
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:27,300
it and putting out the New York Times dropping these articles and the Pentagon putting out

1681
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:34,020
more and more information about it and declassifying these reports, but not showing the whole thing.

1682
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:40,660
That's when I started to switch to maybe this isn't some sort of extraterrestrial thing.

1683
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:44,940
Maybe this could very plausibly be something a foreign nation has or that we have that

1684
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,740
we're just not getting the whole truth about it.

1685
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:50,580
I bet it's probably somewhere in the middle.

1686
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:54,620
I would think somewhere in the middle as in like we took the technology that we found

1687
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:58,260
from somewhere off earth and then we sort of like back engineered it or something.

1688
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:03,860
I think that'd be the safer bet to make that assumption that it's very probable if this

1689
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:08,600
has been going on for a while that some of what we're seeing is our own, but originates

1690
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:15,280
from something else and not to say alien or whatever the flavor of other you like,

1691
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:20,520
but I think that's a very feasible consideration to think that we've been trying to work in

1692
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,160
engineering this and some sightings could be contributed to that.

1693
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,160
That's a reasonable statement.

1694
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,480
What do you think about Bob Lazar's story?

1695
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,960
How much credit do you give that?

1696
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,200
Have you ever talked to him?

1697
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,520
No, personally, no.

1698
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,560
I mean it's interesting and like I told Joe, I want to believe it, it's interesting, but

1699
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,560
I just don't have any evidence other than, you know, the media that's been created to

1700
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:46,200
tell his story and that's just not sufficient for me to draw a conclusion on my own.

1701
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:56,960
What do you think about the way he describes the anti-gravity propulsion and being able

1702
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,240
to manipulate time?

1703
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,440
That's something that you study, right?

1704
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:06,280
That's grounded in good science.

1705
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:10,760
Any time that you would create some type of field that warps space-time around you, you

1706
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:15,200
would be by necessity warping time as well.

1707
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:21,480
Any increase in gravity or concentration of it in some sense is going to cause time to

1708
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:29,760
slow down the more dense and the stronger the gravity is.

1709
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,040
I don't know if that supports his story necessarily.

1710
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:36,200
That's something we've known for a long time, 20s or so.

1711
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:41,160
It is consistent with I think special relativity or excuse me, general relativity.

1712
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:46,320
Being a pilot and experiencing everything you've experienced and just being like immersed

1713
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:53,160
in this technology, this war technology, which is incredible, what do you see as the future

1714
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:57,760
of war and technology developing together and what does that look like?

1715
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,760
Does it look like some of these objects, you think eventually in the future this is just

1716
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,680
like there's no more pilots in fighter jets?

1717
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,680
What do you think it looks like?

1718
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,680
Yeah.

1719
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,680
I think that's where we're going.

1720
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:13,040
I think the direction we're going is, you could call it objective-based autonomy in

1721
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:16,040
a sense.

1722
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:23,400
A mission commander who might be in F-35 or eventually maybe back on the boat or elsewhere

1723
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:29,720
will likely assign mission objectives that need to be accomplished to a swarm of assets

1724
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:32,800
that the pilot doesn't necessarily know what they are.

1725
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,800
He doesn't know where they are.

1726
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,360
He doesn't know what weapons they carry.

1727
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:38,120
He doesn't even know what they look like potentially.

1728
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:42,480
I'm moving around.

1729
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:50,480
But he verifies the target and validates it and issues the commands and then the target

1730
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:53,000
is prosecuted with those assets.

1731
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,360
The autonomy is suggested, we're going to use this and this and this to create those

1732
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,760
effects first.

1733
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:02,080
Taking one jet with a bunch of different weapons and saying, okay, try to make those effects

1734
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,360
work with what you have.

1735
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,400
And there's more of almost like a cloud concept of warfare and the mission commander is making

1736
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,400
those decisions.

1737
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:11,360
And so I see autonomy playing a massive role in that.

1738
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:19,120
And what that's going to lead to is more congested battle space, which is kind of what all this

1739
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:21,120
kind of talk about EW is all about.

1740
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:25,200
It's about congesting the battle space and making it more difficult to target and making

1741
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:30,080
it so the pilots don't know if the radar contact they just shot at is a real aircraft or not

1742
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,800
or if they just wasted a missile.

1743
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:33,800
Wasting missiles is great.

1744
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:34,800
You only have so many of them.

1745
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:40,600
So you can have the enemy shoot at drones or at false tracks on the radar.

1746
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,960
Then you're going to win that fight eventually.

1747
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:49,200
What this could lead to is a reemergence of dogfighting as a valuable skill.

1748
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:52,280
So our fights actually take place over such long distances.

1749
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:57,520
If it is a true war type scenario where missions need to be accomplished, eventually you're

1750
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:01,360
going to have to go in and increase your risk if all your long-range weapons are gone

1751
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:04,640
or if they've been trashed through EW.

1752
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:09,240
So what that means is getting closer and using your guns and IR missiles in a dogfight.

1753
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:13,120
And so there is a potential, should things get bad, to actually kind of reinvigorate

1754
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:18,360
the dogfighting regime if there'll likely be a transitioning period where there are

1755
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:24,800
still pilots where if that has passed, then it'll just be all autonomous stuff fighting

1756
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:25,800
each other.

1757
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,840
But before that, you could have a chance where the EW is so good that everyone's trying to

1758
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,120
employ their weapons, they get trashed, so you have to go in close.

1759
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:38,940
So if that's the case, well, I'm going to go into that.

1760
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:40,360
So what does it look like?

1761
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:43,880
It looks like congestion, right?

1762
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,840
It looks like a fog of war.

1763
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,840
It's more confusing.

1764
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,840
There's more uncertainty.

1765
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,000
There's more wasted assets.

1766
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,940
There's more ability to be clever and tricky perhaps.

1767
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:55,520
There's a weird thing that happens.

1768
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:59,280
I had a guy on here who was a drone pilot.

1769
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:05,560
He was working at a base in Las Vegas, and he was operating drones and pulling the trigger

1770
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:08,240
and killing people on the ground.

1771
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:10,280
I forget in what country.

1772
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:15,480
But there's a thing that happens, there's a disconnect between people who are doing

1773
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:20,160
that across the world, operating some drone like a video game, and then someone who's

1774
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:24,860
actually flying a plane and being there in person.

1775
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:34,700
And I just wonder the psychology of if that's what war comes to, people being across the

1776
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:40,460
world just hitting buttons on a controller versus being there in real life, what are

1777
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:45,060
the long-term implications of that, and how does that affect the world?

1778
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:54,060
I think the long-term implications is that it could probably get to a new deterrent system

1779
01:37:54,180 --> 01:37:59,340
similar to nuclear weapons in a sense.

1780
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:05,620
If you have confidence in your ability to be successful without risking lives or making

1781
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:11,060
it politically tricky, then it might be more likely in order to engage in those type of

1782
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:12,060
skirmishes.

1783
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,620
That would be the fear in a sense.

1784
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,860
It's like life becomes more disposable almost.

1785
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:23,940
In a sense though, the technology, and I've argued for this, in fact, when I was at BIA

1786
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:30,780
we had some interns come in, and one of them actually took the opportunity to ask, how

1787
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:35,860
do you justify this type of work, creating weapons and things of that nature at this

1788
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:36,860
point?

1789
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:41,940
And as someone who has been out there employing these weapons, it was easy for me to answer

1790
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:50,580
because accuracy enables safer warfare if you have a moral government in a sense.

1791
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:55,540
If your government doesn't want to kill civilians, being more precise is better.

1792
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:56,540
And that's what I said.

1793
01:38:56,540 --> 01:39:00,820
As long as we assume we have moral leadership, then we would want our weapons to be as essentially

1794
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:06,340
powerful and as accurate as possible as a mitigating force.

1795
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:08,260
And so I think that's where we go.

1796
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:12,100
Things will continue to get more accurate and more precise, which may have negative

1797
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:15,900
consequences because people may feel more justified using them.

1798
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:18,860
So I think you're the perfect person to ask this question.

1799
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:20,620
What is hypersonic?

1800
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:21,860
I hear about it all the time.

1801
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:26,180
I hear about missiles being hypersonic, especially when it comes to this war in Ukraine and Russia

1802
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:29,660
and Russia having these hypersonic missiles.

1803
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:30,660
What is that?

1804
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:31,660
What does that mean?

1805
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:35,460
Is it the same thing as like mock levels, like Mach 1 through 10?

1806
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:38,700
Everything below Mach 5 is just supersonic, they call it.

1807
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:42,060
Above Mach 5 is hypersonic.

1808
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:47,100
So hypersonic, I forget what the barrier is, but there's also a thermal barrier that you

1809
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:50,100
need to get through to go certain speeds.

1810
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,620
You can't just continuously go faster.

1811
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:54,860
You have a more powerful engine because you're going to start to melt stuff.

1812
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:58,180
So there's kind of a thermal barrier that's related to our material science and engineering

1813
01:39:58,180 --> 01:39:59,180
level.

1814
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:00,780
But generally, it is what it sounds like.

1815
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:01,780
Things are just going a lot faster.

1816
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:02,780
Just faster.

1817
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:10,500
And what does that mean?

1818
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:12,860
War is not that complicated at the end of the day.

1819
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:16,460
You just need to do the simple thing better than the other person in a way.

1820
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:21,460
And when we have these ICBMs and cruise missiles and all these things like that, the most important

1821
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:25,660
consideration is how long can I intercept that missile for?

1822
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,180
When is it visible to me?

1823
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:29,020
It's visible when it's on my radar.

1824
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:32,680
So if there's curvature of the earth, depending on where the missile is launched, we put radar

1825
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:35,340
sites in various places so we can see the missile sooner.

1826
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:40,140
We put them in space so we can see them as soon as they launch, perhaps.

1827
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:46,220
Hypersonic missiles reduce the time that you can see the missiles because they're traveling

1828
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:53,060
so fast that they can go at altitudes that prevent radars from seeing them due to the

1829
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:55,740
curvature of the earth in some cases.

1830
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:59,300
And then it also decreases the time to intercept that missile.

1831
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:03,860
And so, for example, if Russia had a hypersonic missile that could just travel over to the

1832
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:09,980
U.S., that could pose a significant issue because our systems might not be calibrated

1833
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:13,300
to be able to hit hypersonic missiles, maybe only supersonic missiles.

1834
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:16,180
So it's just a stair step, just like everything in war, it seems.

1835
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:20,060
Something's fast, you find a way to take it out, let's speed it up so those other systems

1836
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:21,060
don't work anymore.

1837
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:26,340
Are there any sort of missiles that can just change direction on a dime?

1838
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:29,700
Well, no.

1839
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:34,300
There's some interesting stuff you could do if you had like a throttled missile, but that's

1840
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:39,180
not what you're describing, instantaneous movement or anything like that.

1841
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:44,500
Even if we had a missile, the way these missiles work is that you lock up your chute and they'll

1842
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:45,700
go near the object.

1843
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:50,060
And once they get within a certain range, they'll save some energy so they can perform

1844
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:54,040
what they call like a Max-G maneuver at the very end in order to trade all their energy

1845
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:57,740
to get close enough to impact the aircraft with shrapnel.

1846
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:04,580
And so when they do that, they might pull like 70 or 80 Gs, which is a lot, but compared

1847
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:15,020
to an ejection where the first few milliseconds is like 300 Gs for like a millisecond.

1848
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:18,540
And then it backs off to like 12 Gs, but it just kicks off very fast.

1849
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:23,540
The only reason that's survivable is just due to the inertia of your body and the blood.

1850
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:25,940
Yeah, so 300, boom, and then it slows down.

1851
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:29,340
Yeah, sorry, I forgot where we're going with that, though.

1852
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:32,540
Yeah, we were just talking about like the way the missiles travel and how fast they

1853
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:35,020
travel and then you got into ejecting at 300 Gs.

1854
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:39,140
Yeah, but when you start talking about something like what David Fravor and moving position

1855
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:41,780
very fast and the Gs in there could be in the thousands.

1856
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:49,740
That's the first thing I just thought about is if there were actual like beings inside

1857
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:52,740
of those things, they would just be liquefied.

1858
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:59,740
Potentially, if they had mass and if they were operating with our normal space time

1859
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:00,740
frame, right?

1860
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:03,740
So if you're bending space time, then you're going to be in your own isolated bucket and

1861
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:06,540
you're not going to be feeling those inertia changes, right?

1862
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,660
Because gravity is a field, right?

1863
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:11,340
Gravity is affecting the atoms of your body all at the same time.

1864
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:13,140
It doesn't pull on your head and then pull on here.

1865
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:15,780
It's a field that's pulling all in the same direction.

1866
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:19,140
So if you're moving gravity, you're not going to be feeling that inertia changes.

1867
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:20,900
That's one way you could do that.

1868
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:25,780
Another way is to reduce somehow the mass of the object so that it doesn't have as much

1869
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:26,780
effect from inertia.

1870
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:27,780
Right, right.

1871
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:28,780
And I don't have all the answers here.

1872
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:36,420
I'm just kind of just explaining a couple potential options where you could see that

1873
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:39,100
movement and still survive.

1874
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:42,100
If we don't assume any of that and assume they're operating in a normal environment

1875
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:47,820
without reducing mass or affecting space time, then yeah, the G-forces would be probably

1876
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,300
well, not probably.

1877
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:51,100
They would be too much even for hardware.

1878
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:56,860
Has anybody ever seen one of these things manipulate the environment, like, for example,

1879
01:43:56,860 --> 01:44:04,300
punch through clouds or affect the water at all or anything like that?

1880
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:11,420
Well, Dave Fravor talked about kind of the water being spun up underneath the tic-tac.

1881
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:15,740
But I'm not aware really, no, I'm not really aware of any cases like you described.

1882
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:20,820
Well, yeah, what did he say about how the thing was like hovering right above the water

1883
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:24,100
and there was just sort of like white water below him or?

1884
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:28,340
Yeah, I think they kind of described it as like foaming or bubbly in a sense.

1885
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:35,380
Because that's another huge element of this is being underwater.

1886
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:39,580
How much attention do you guys pay to being a Navy pilot?

1887
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:44,980
How much attention do you guys pay to like things happening on the surface of the water

1888
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,140
or ever?

1889
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:47,140
Do you ever?

1890
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:48,140
Yeah, no, we do.

1891
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:49,900
We have particular radar modes for ships.

1892
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:51,980
Are submarines a threat?

1893
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:52,980
Not to me.

1894
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:53,980
Not to aircrafts?

1895
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:54,980
Okay.

1896
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:55,980
Not that I'm aware of.

1897
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:56,980
Okay.

1898
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:59,700
But they're certainly, well, if we're on an aircraft carrier, they are.

1899
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:02,780
If the submarine comes to the surface, though, could they be a threat?

1900
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:06,940
I honestly don't know enough about submarine weapon systems to tell you.

1901
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:07,940
I hope not.

1902
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:11,500
But no, typically we're not worried about submarines.

1903
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:15,940
But we don't really have the capability to track objects in a transmedia manner.

1904
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:21,220
So if we see something get close to the ocean, we may have trouble tracking it depending

1905
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:22,420
on how close it gets.

1906
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:24,940
Just do the movement of water and all that stuff.

1907
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:27,540
And then if it goes below, it's just going to disappear off our radar.

1908
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,580
There's no continuation.

1909
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:32,780
So we can't necessarily make that assessment of it going in the water.

1910
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,300
We just see it and then we'll see it.

1911
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:37,380
Our radar, it can see very far away.

1912
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:44,180
So almost 99.9% of the time, what we're seeing on the radar is well beyond our visual range.

1913
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:51,460
What is sort of happening currently within the government, publicly or not, that you're

1914
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:58,340
aware of to sort of move this whole conversation forward and push it more into, get it away

1915
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:01,060
from the stigmatization that people are used to?

1916
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:02,060
Yeah.

1917
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:04,900
And we were seeing a lot of good work on that.

1918
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:10,980
Within the AIAA, that's one of our primary missions is to mitigate the stigma around

1919
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:14,460
this topic so that we can do real science on the topic.

1920
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:17,020
And we're seeing that form up now.

1921
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:21,520
We're seeing the engineering skill sets and prowess come in that want to approach this

1922
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,360
scientifically and agnostically.

1923
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:29,060
Within the government itself, we have the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or as

1924
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:30,060
I call it, AERO.

1925
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:31,060
It's a mouthful.

1926
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:32,060
Yeah.

1927
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:35,580
Yeah, AIAA.

1928
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:44,100
But there seems to be a very concerted effort to actually get to the bottom of this in my

1929
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,100
view.

1930
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:53,260
Dr. Shankar Patrick of AERO, I've heard him express that he believes he has all the access

1931
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:56,580
that he needs in order to continue investigating this.

1932
01:46:57,580 --> 01:47:02,340
I know that he's made trips to national archives and he's really putting the legwork in to

1933
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:03,340
understand this.

1934
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:08,980
So I believe that he is truly working to uncover this to the best of his ability.

1935
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:13,460
And from my perspective, he's getting the support he needs from the Senate and Congress

1936
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,300
in order to do that.

1937
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:21,300
With the National Defense Authorization Act that was signed by President Biden recently.

1938
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:22,300
What is that one?

1939
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:23,300
What is that act?

1940
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:26,300
National Defense Authorization Act.

1941
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:33,220
That's somewhere around 30 pages of UAP-related legislation in there that essentially forces

1942
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:38,340
a reckoning of any classified programs or manipulation attempts on the public related

1943
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:41,500
to this topic going back all the way to 1945.

1944
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:49,380
Additionally, it removes whistleblower limitations for potential whistleblowers from $300,000

1945
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:52,380
for liability to unlimited.

1946
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:53,460
I heard about that.

1947
01:47:53,460 --> 01:48:00,580
And that applies both for defense contractors as well as military folks as well.

1948
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:05,780
And so really what we see is this is a mechanism for kind of opening it up and allowing Congress

1949
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:09,580
and Senate to really run this to ground.

1950
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:10,580
Yeah.

1951
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:17,620
Oh, and by the way, the NDA also has AERO reporting, I believe to the SEC-DEF or deputy

1952
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:20,460
SEC-DEF now versus ODI and I.

1953
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:25,620
And so the last report that came out was an ODI-based report.

1954
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:30,580
I would think going forward, there might be a little more ease in communication now that

1955
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:33,580
there's been a transfer.

1956
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:37,620
Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, what is his background and what is his?

1957
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:43,140
He's a former chief scientist at the, I think the Missile Defense Agency, US.

1958
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:48,700
So he's been, he's a well-established and published scientist that has been working

1959
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:53,180
for the DOD in various capacities for quite some time.

1960
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:54,180
Okay.

1961
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:56,940
How much attention do you pay to some of the other stories that are coming out?

1962
01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:01,820
I mean, obviously you, your background is very objective, is very science-based, very

1963
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:02,940
tactical.

1964
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:06,460
But when it comes to like some of these other stories and some of these other things that

1965
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:11,140
are coming out, like, for example, like James Fox's latest documentaries, how much attention

1966
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:14,100
do you pay to that kind of stuff?

1967
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:18,100
Or even like abduction stories, is that just too out there for you or do you pay attention

1968
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:19,980
to it?

1969
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:21,900
I'm doing my homework to some degree.

1970
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:25,220
It's just, oh, there's a lot out there.

1971
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:31,460
I, you talk about the, how do you pronounce it, Varginha?

1972
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:32,460
Varginha.

1973
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:33,460
Is that the one?

1974
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:34,460
Yeah.

1975
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:35,460
Did you hear about that?

1976
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:36,460
Yeah, I watched that.

1977
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:37,460
It was fascinating.

1978
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:41,020
I mean, it's interesting, but generally speaking, it's not the way I kind of, so there's two

1979
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:43,300
ways I kind of approach this topic.

1980
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:51,220
One is, in a sense, it's almost due diligence where I am engaging in those types of stories

1981
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:52,220
to some small degree.

1982
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:55,500
I mean, not small degree, but, you know, just through the literature.

1983
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:59,100
I'm not actively investigating or like talking to...

1984
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:01,500
The problem is it's so entertaining, right?

1985
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,500
Yeah.

1986
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:07,780
It's, well, there's been a trend, I think, in the past where due to lack of data, probably

1987
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:11,580
for one reason, that there has been an entertainment industry of sorts that has kind of folded

1988
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:14,420
on around this.

1989
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:17,580
I don't see myself as necessarily participating in that.

1990
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:21,460
And so, yeah, go back a second, you know, I try to do my homework to get a broad understanding

1991
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:25,740
of this, but I'm very focused on the future as well.

1992
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:29,580
I think that there are real solutions that we can bring forward in order to better understand

1993
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:31,940
this outside of the military leash, right?

1994
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:37,980
I don't think the way to expand this conversation is to just wait for the government to essentially

1995
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:40,740
provide us with the answers.

1996
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:42,780
We know we can see these things, right?

1997
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:44,700
We can see them on certain radars.

1998
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:45,940
These radars aren't...

1999
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:48,820
They're classified, but the technology necessarily isn't.

2000
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:52,180
You can find phasor-age radars out there.

2001
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:55,900
And the democratization and access to these technologies, I think, are going to allow

2002
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:59,220
us to expand this conversation with or without the government.

2003
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:02,620
And I think that maybe is why this time is so unique.

2004
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:06,780
The tools that you have access to can provide answers that the government can't necessarily

2005
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:07,780
keep a leash on.

2006
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:08,780
Yeah, man.

2007
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:14,860
But the Virginia case is so interesting too, because a lot of the people that were there

2008
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:19,580
that day, James says that they were just intimidated to the point where they would not talk about

2009
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:20,580
it.

2010
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:23,380
The one guy, he literally chased him off, threatened to shoot him and kill him if he

2011
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:25,140
didn't leave his property.

2012
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:28,660
Because the government intimidation, they say these people, these quote unquote men

2013
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:33,060
in black would come and basically tell them, if you love your family, don't say a word

2014
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:34,700
about this to anyone.

2015
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:39,900
And then additionally to that, this so-and-so, this so-called being that was found, the

2016
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:43,380
Air Force, the United States Air Force, all these United States planes landed the next

2017
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:49,260
day and basically hushed everyone up and took all the evidence and went back to the United

2018
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:50,580
States.

2019
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:56,980
So it's almost like the biggest barrier is at the same time the government, even though

2020
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:01,500
the government is claiming to put all these things out in the New York Times, the Pentagon

2021
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:02,940
wants to openly talk about it.

2022
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:06,820
It's like, this is what we're doing on the public side, but on the other side, we're

2023
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:11,420
also doing all this stuff with intimidation and all this stuff to keep people to shut

2024
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:12,420
up.

2025
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:13,420
Yeah, I don't disagree.

2026
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:18,660
But I think one of the misconceptions is that the government is extremely well run.

2027
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:19,660
Yeah.

2028
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:21,900
One, I think there are different factions.

2029
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:25,340
I think there's different people within the government that are involved in this.

2030
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:28,100
And I don't necessarily think that they all work together.

2031
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:32,740
The government is so big and there's so many people and personalities and interests.

2032
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:35,780
It's not as monolithic as people make it out to seem.

2033
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:43,620
And this story you just described, it's interesting because what official channel of communication

2034
01:52:43,620 --> 01:52:49,420
exists between Brazil and the United States in order to facilitate something like that?

2035
01:52:49,420 --> 01:52:54,060
That must be an ongoing relationship of some degree or form then.

2036
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:58,180
Brazil, from what I understand, really relies on the United States and they rely on having

2037
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:00,580
a good, strong relationship with the United States.

2038
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:02,140
I could be wrong, but...

2039
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:04,180
On UAP?

2040
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:07,820
On anything, if they had something and...

2041
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:11,700
So if you're Brazil, why would you want to keep that from the U.S.?

2042
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:12,700
Was the U.S. even studying?

2043
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:13,700
Right?

2044
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,060
Like officially the government wasn't really studying this.

2045
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:17,360
So was there some communication between them?

2046
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:24,540
If there were some high level commander or like the head of the military in Brazil, do

2047
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:27,700
you think they have an open line of communication to somebody here?

2048
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:28,700
No.

2049
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:29,700
No?

2050
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:37,580
So I don't have any answer here, but these are the things that interest me.

2051
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:41,220
The case is very interesting, but what does that relationship tell us?

2052
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:42,220
When did it start?

2053
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:45,980
Did it start then or did it start elsewhere and if it started elsewhere, why did it start

2054
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:46,980
there?

2055
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:49,980
What else do we know?

2056
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:54,580
And so the case is fascinating, I want to know more, I want it to be true.

2057
01:53:55,340 --> 01:54:01,940
These are the clues I try to look for to help better understand really what's going on.

2058
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:07,660
And it's so much different than what you're seeing too, because if that case was true,

2059
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:15,300
there was a biological being inside of a craft that accidentally crashed.

2060
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:20,260
If these things are so advanced, how the hell would it accidentally crash?

2061
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:30,820
Why would they travel so far and put a biological being that is of importance to whatever civilization

2062
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:31,820
it came from?

2063
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:32,820
Why would they leave it?

2064
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:33,820
Why would it be strange?

2065
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:36,540
It seems like they're so advanced that that sort of thing wouldn't happen.

2066
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:39,940
I think there's some assumptions in there that I'll push back on.

2067
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:55,060
Even if you take that to the extreme scale, is there a 100% success rate?

2068
01:54:55,060 --> 01:54:58,900
I don't know, that's just one poor argument against the crashing, right?

2069
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:03,580
If you were to take one back to 3000 BC and drop someone in a car, you'd probably think

2070
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:04,820
it worked all the time too.

2071
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:09,180
But let's just put that aside.

2072
01:55:09,180 --> 01:55:14,100
Let's put it aside for the most part and then talk about the assumption around a biological

2073
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:16,420
entity having importance.

2074
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:21,380
I would imagine that technology would move into an area where you'd be able to replicate

2075
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:27,620
biology artificially and that would be probably a much more efficient means of reproduction

2076
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:34,300
of the asset or modification of it and the maintenance of it versus, say, a heavy mechanical

2077
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:36,020
object.

2078
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:38,580
I'm not saying that's true or anything, but I'm just saying...

2079
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:42,340
We would be able to print, like 3D print, our bodies, right?

2080
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:46,420
Just because something's biological doesn't mean that it's evolved over billions of years

2081
01:55:46,420 --> 01:55:51,300
to be a self-intelligent, its own agent, right?

2082
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:52,300
Intelligent agent.

2083
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:56,460
It's biological, but does that mean it's not a robot in some sense?

2084
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:57,460
Right.

2085
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:58,460
I know that's an assumption, I think.

2086
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:03,500
So just because it's biological, maybe that's just the best means for doing the thing.

2087
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:04,500
Right.

2088
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:05,980
Yeah.

2089
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:06,980
No, no, no.

2090
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:07,980
That doesn't make sense.

2091
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:16,700
And then that goes to the idea that once we do advance to a certain level that we...

2092
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:21,300
Our bottleneck right now is our biological bodies decay and we age and we die.

2093
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:25,860
But if in a thousand years, it seems plausible that we would be able to...

2094
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:26,860
We're already doing it.

2095
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:34,180
We're already cloning ourselves, we're cloning cells and basically 3D printing skin, like

2096
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:35,860
burn victims can get brand new skin.

2097
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:42,860
So why wouldn't we be able to eventually just create new meat vehicles that we're in right

2098
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:48,020
now and just basically take our consciousness and put it into a new one?

2099
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:51,340
So essentially, if this was in a civilization that was that advanced, they would be able

2100
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:53,060
to do something similar to that.

2101
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:54,780
Maybe there is no consciousness, too.

2102
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:55,780
Another assumption.

2103
01:56:55,780 --> 01:57:00,300
You potentially have a biological being that isn't necessarily a conscious agent, perhaps.

2104
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:09,140
We can at least get rid of the consciousness transfer that you mentioned.

2105
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:10,580
We can throw away that assumption.

2106
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:12,300
But these are the fun conversations.

2107
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:15,420
We're never going to get to a conclusion on any of this, but it's interesting because

2108
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:20,340
I try hard to not anthropomorphize this conversation too much and it's so easy, right?

2109
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:24,740
We assume it's a biological entity on there and so that has value to the society in some

2110
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:25,740
sense.

2111
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:26,740
Maybe that's not the case, right?

2112
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:27,740
Right.

2113
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:28,740
Exactly.

2114
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:31,180
That makes this conversation so difficult.

2115
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:32,180
Right.

2116
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:36,180
The thing, though, is it is a very different situation what happened there with the thing

2117
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:41,300
crashing with something in it than what it seems like compared to what you guys were

2118
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:42,300
seeing.

2119
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:46,060
I agree with that.

2120
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:53,900
And then if you were to attribute something like a technology that we have, like some

2121
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:58,900
advanced military technology, then how do you explain all the things that were happening

2122
01:57:58,900 --> 01:57:59,900
in the 40s?

2123
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:06,620
All the different sightings and there's documented cases of all these things hovering above nuclear

2124
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:14,260
bases in the early days, I don't know what decade that was, 50s, 60s, 70s.

2125
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:16,580
How plausible is it that we had that technology back then?

2126
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:18,180
What the hell was going on back then?

2127
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:19,180
Yeah.

2128
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:21,380
I don't have an answer to that question.

2129
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:26,340
That is kind of the weird thing about this subject is it's so entertaining, it's so fun

2130
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:30,660
to talk about, but at the same time, that's at the same time what makes it kind of like

2131
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:35,940
what makes people be able to dismiss it so easily, you know, because you have the history

2132
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:39,740
channel, but the history channel just makes stuff entertainment.

2133
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:40,740
It's really entertainment.

2134
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:43,580
I don't know if you've ever watched a show on the history channel, like some of these

2135
01:58:43,580 --> 01:58:48,180
shows like Skinwalker Ranch, like a person like me who's familiar with like production

2136
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:51,660
and how it works and watching this thing happen, it's just they're making a fucking

2137
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:53,780
movie and they're trying to entertain people.

2138
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:58,260
Like for somebody who understands some of the stuff that has actually happened in these

2139
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:04,340
situations and the research that's been done behind it scientifically and then you watch

2140
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:11,300
it dramatized on television, to me, kind of like doesn't do it any favors.

2141
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:15,700
It makes it less credible to me, but I understand like it's fucking entertaining and people

2142
01:59:15,700 --> 01:59:17,820
want to see it and you can make money.

2143
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:21,260
Things like the history channel and the discovery channel, they make tons of money because it

2144
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:22,260
is entertaining.

2145
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:26,940
And now with the conversations that are happening with, you know, with the New York Times and

2146
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:29,260
the Pentagon, now it's actually getting more and more truth.

2147
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:35,460
So this stuff is becoming more and more of a financial opportunity for entertainment.

2148
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:38,300
Nich, what's that word?

2149
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,300
Nich.

2150
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:40,300
Yeah.

2151
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:44,900
I mean, generally speaking, I think more attention that goes on this, the more people for good

2152
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:49,900
reasons and bad reasons will try to financially gain from it.

2153
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:54,140
I do have one pushback, which is, you know, one thing I've seen a lot is that there seems

2154
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:57,740
to be this almost gatekeeping around the topic where if you're not doing it for the pure

2155
01:59:57,740 --> 02:00:01,620
enjoyment of the topic, then you're doing it for the wrong reasons.

2156
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:04,100
And I don't agree with that.

2157
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:08,420
This has been relegated to a hobby for way too long and a hobby is not a sustainable

2158
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:12,780
way of creating a new industry around something that we were seeing out there that requires

2159
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:17,540
technology and investment and research and people to commit to that research and write

2160
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:18,540
papers.

2161
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:19,540
Right.

2162
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:20,540
And guess how that gets done?

2163
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:21,540
Money.

2164
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:22,540
Yes.

2165
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:24,420
So, hey, eventually we've got to grow up and start putting our money where our mouth is.

2166
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:25,420
Yes.

2167
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:28,540
That doesn't mean necessarily entertainment, but hey, the government, you know, they're

2168
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:32,860
not going to buy censors for the general public to figure this out.

2169
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:33,860
Well, NASA, I doubt it.

2170
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:39,300
I've had conversations, you know, with members from NASA and people from Aero and, you know,

2171
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:43,060
they both are pretty aligned around the fact that the normal funding channels for this

2172
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:48,700
type of work doesn't really exist within DOD and they don't really exist within NASA.

2173
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:50,180
And we're seeing a little bit of a change.

2174
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:53,500
We're seeing, you know, NASA put a little bit of money, $100,000, as they, you know,

2175
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,500
essentially build a program to study this.

2176
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:56,500
They put $100,000.

2177
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:57,500
Yeah.

2178
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,860
So, you know, but the point is that they're not doing work with that.

2179
02:01:00,860 --> 02:01:06,020
They're building a recommendation for a program, right, and that's the output.

2180
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:11,060
They're going to be looking at the data and various things and providing a recommendation

2181
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:15,940
on how NASA can actually gather data to bring answers forward on this.

2182
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:20,020
And so that's when I think more money will come in and stuff.

2183
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:22,820
And you know, to go back to your point on entertainment and stuff, I think that's why

2184
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:26,660
a lot of pilots haven't been willing to talk about this because it has been more in that

2185
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:28,580
UFO attainment type of mindset.

2186
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:29,580
UFO attainment, good word.

2187
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:30,580
Yeah.

2188
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:32,780
And they don't want to, pilots don't want to risk their careers by going on something

2189
02:01:32,780 --> 02:01:38,180
like that and getting labeled as, you know, a believer or something like that, right?

2190
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:43,000
It's I think a little derogatory to kind of label these pilots out of witness things believers

2191
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,020
in a sense, because a lot of these people have seen some very inexplicable things with

2192
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:51,340
their own eyeballs with multiple aircraft and multiple aircrew, like their first officer

2193
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:56,420
and multiple other professional aviators.

2194
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:59,940
And they're seeing things that have changed their lives, you know, that have they've gone

2195
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:04,500
out and talked to artists to do drawings of what they've seen and they've kept in touch

2196
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:06,520
with the pilots they've seen this with.

2197
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:11,540
And so to take those emotional experiences in some cases and take it on to a UFO type

2198
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:17,220
attainment thing, it's just no, they're not going to go anywhere near it.

2199
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:20,220
They will, they will potentially lose their job.

2200
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:23,720
And the way it works in airlines, you can be at a company for 40 years.

2201
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:28,120
And if you leave that company and you go to another airline, you go right to the bottom

2202
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:32,720
of the pile with 20 year olds, you know, that will be more senior to you.

2203
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:33,840
It's all seniority based.

2204
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:37,080
So if you've been in and you have a long career and you want to start talking about something

2205
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:40,040
like this, that's quite the risk to take.

2206
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:44,520
And so, you know, that's why I've created the podcast merge, because I want to provide

2207
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:50,600
a scientifically focused, neutral place for aviators, scientists and innovators to actually

2208
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:54,200
have a serious conversation about this outside of entertainment.

2209
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:57,460
And it'd be more than just a podcast because we're going to be able to take that information

2210
02:02:58,020 --> 02:03:02,300
and we're going to be able to apply that within the AIAA and have conversations about the

2211
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:04,020
technology and perhaps pursue that.

2212
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:08,060
If someone has a good idea and we have a conversation about it, we can go get things done.

2213
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:09,260
We don't just have to talk about it.

2214
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:14,140
We have potentially the resources and the equipment and eventually the equipment and

2215
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:17,540
the people and the minds to actually start to solve this.

2216
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:20,740
And so we want to try to bring those together and have those conversations, both with pilots

2217
02:03:20,740 --> 02:03:22,940
and the people that are going to be able to figure it out.

2218
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:23,940
That's powerful.

2219
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:27,340
I think somebody like you being able to sit down on a podcast and talk to some of your

2220
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:31,420
peers and some of the people that you respect or some of the people that respect you in

2221
02:03:31,420 --> 02:03:34,060
this industry and not have it be wrapped around entertainment.

2222
02:03:34,060 --> 02:03:35,060
But I do understand what you're saying.

2223
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:40,380
Like it is important to have an industry, there should be a big market on this niche

2224
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:43,340
because I mean, that's how you fund things, that's true.

2225
02:03:43,340 --> 02:03:49,500
The market should be, no matter how it happens from the ground up, if it is with some of

2226
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:55,060
this outlandish entertainment, I mean, that's the way naturally it has to evolve.

2227
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:57,780
That's the way that we're going to attract money to the situation.

2228
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:59,500
That's the way people like you, you know.

2229
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:00,500
It got me.

2230
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:01,500
Yeah.

2231
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:02,500
Exactly.

2232
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:03,500
I knew there was something there to talk about.

2233
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:09,220
But the document I talked about being able to release within the AIAA, that's really

2234
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:13,100
what that's going to be centered around is being able to provide a broader understanding

2235
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:18,060
throughout industry of the science and the sensing phenomenologies and things so that

2236
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,380
technology can be built.

2237
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:24,300
So to kind of answer your question, how do we get from there to where we want to be,

2238
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:25,580
we're getting there, right?

2239
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:31,460
We've created scientific organizations, they have been created to actually study this.

2240
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:34,940
What's going to happen from that is we're going to be putting out information and data

2241
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:39,020
and conclusions and results and that is going to go directly into developing new and better

2242
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:42,260
technology that's going to help us understand this problem better.

2243
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:44,500
So we're there, we're getting there, we're establishing that.

2244
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:49,040
And when we look out in the wider scope of things, we see that Aero and others are taking

2245
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,760
a whole-of-government approach on this.

2246
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:57,000
This isn't one department, one agency, one organization, one senator or congressman with

2247
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
a hobby.

2248
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:03,280
The whole government is kind of wrapping itself into this so that we can take that whole approach

2249
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:06,680
and make sure that we're using all the resources we have as a nation to understand that.

2250
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:09,480
And that's what's happening now, whether people see it or not.

2251
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:12,760
We're building the stage, we're setting the stage, and I think this year we're going to

2252
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:16,160
see a lot of activity on that stage.

2253
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:19,440
How many episodes have you recorded of your podcast so far?

2254
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:20,440
Four.

2255
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:21,440
Four episodes.

2256
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:22,640
What kind of people have you had on there?

2257
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:23,640
We had Professor Gary Nolan.

2258
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:26,360
We're going to be airing that episode tomorrow actually.

2259
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:27,360
Oh wow.

2260
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:30,760
And the other three were commercial and F-18 pilots.

2261
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:32,040
Wow, that's amazing.

2262
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:35,600
And is it on YouTube or is it on Apple?

2263
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:38,560
Yeah, you can MergePoint podcast on YouTube.

2264
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:43,040
You can also find us on MergePodcast.com and you'll be able to find all the episodes starting

2265
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,040
tomorrow on there.

2266
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,120
And of course it'll be on...

2267
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:47,120
Starting tomorrow.

2268
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:48,120
Starting tomorrow.

2269
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:49,120
Wow, that's amazing.

2270
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:50,120
Good timing.

2271
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:51,120
This thing won't be released yet.

2272
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:54,080
I'll release this next Tuesday, whatever date that is.

2273
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:55,080
Cool.

2274
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:59,520
Yeah, so I think we're going to be airing about every two weeks now and then hopefully

2275
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:04,240
every week with just constantly interviewing pilots because there's nothing out there and

2276
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:06,800
they have their stories and they've been seeing this for a long time.

2277
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:11,520
So we'll have that conversation and at the same time we'll be bringing in scientists

2278
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:15,920
and not just, you know, I have a lot of respect for Gary Nolan, but he's pretty wrapped into

2279
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:16,920
this conversation.

2280
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:20,800
But I want to bring in some people that people aren't aware of that have been in the industry

2281
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:25,080
for 40 plus years that have now volunteered to help at the AIAA that are really tackling

2282
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:26,080
this.

2283
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:31,480
Known entities, you know, known, you know, I'll say senior engineers and scientists from

2284
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:35,560
across the aerospace industry are really getting around to put their might behind this in a

2285
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:36,560
public manner.

2286
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:40,880
And so we're going to see a lot of progress I think this year and in the future.

2287
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:47,520
Have you thought about what happens once if and when this becomes just accepted public

2288
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:57,080
knowledge that there's, if there is another civilization that is trying to communicate

2289
02:06:57,080 --> 02:07:03,320
or traveling here and monitoring us and that is here with us and we're not alone, like

2290
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:09,320
if that does become common knowledge and accepted knowledge within the world and all the main

2291
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:10,320
governments in the world.

2292
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:13,600
Have you thought about like what the implications of that are?

2293
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:21,160
What are the public implications and how does that affect wars and military and?

2294
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:26,520
Yeah, I don't have the answer for that entirely, but I will say that I know there are efforts

2295
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:32,360
underway to form certain organizations that will study this from a more broad perspective

2296
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:33,360
like that.

2297
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:38,840
Of course, within the AIAA, I'm focusing on science and engineering around this topic,

2298
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:42,840
but I think we'll hear soon about some other efforts that consider the sociological implications

2299
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:49,440
of this, that include the economic implications of this, the xenopolitical nature of this.

2300
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:54,640
But to kind of get to external politics, we have to now consider something other than

2301
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:59,320
ourselves in our relationship with how we interact in the world, perhaps.

2302
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:07,280
How do we retain our agency if we do exist among highly technologically capable societies?

2303
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:10,600
I think that's really what it boils down to if we do come to terms with this is that

2304
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:14,880
how do we maintain our dignity and our sovereignty in such an environment?

2305
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:24,800
And I think truly we have, well, I think that's what it boils down to really.

2306
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:29,840
How do we interface on perhaps a stage like that as the weaker candidate, but with the

2307
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:33,960
self-respect that we should have in order to operate at that level?

2308
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:37,520
These are the conversations and the questions I think that we'll be able to explore in a

2309
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:38,520
more organized manner.

2310
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:43,200
Once we kind of get past this uncertainty phase, you know, there's so many more questions

2311
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:44,200
than there are answers.

2312
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:45,200
That's going to be the fun part.

2313
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:46,200
Can't wait.

2314
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:48,880
I mean, it's scary.

2315
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:52,760
It's scary to think about what could happen because obviously, you know, the human mind

2316
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:57,160
goes to all the fear first, like what could the worst, what would the worst case scenario

2317
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:02,640
be if the public knew that, okay, that we're not everything, there's other beings here.

2318
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:05,840
The economy collapse, what would happen to religion?

2319
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:12,400
Like it's unfathomable, it's unfathomable.

2320
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:13,560
I think we will do okay.

2321
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:14,560
I really do.

2322
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:18,720
I think that one of the reasons that perhaps this is an okay time for this is that our

2323
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:25,000
society is measured in some sense right now by how fast we change, how fast our technology

2324
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,160
advances.

2325
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:29,720
And we see it all the time, our society and our social standards don't necessarily keep

2326
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:31,200
up with the technology.

2327
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:34,960
Our technology is created and then we try to find a way to live with it in a sense.

2328
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:37,600
I don't think this is going to be much different in a sense.

2329
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:41,320
I think as long as we can retain our agency and our self-respect in a manner like we were

2330
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:45,240
just talking about, that we're going to be able to integrate that information because

2331
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:49,680
really that's just, you know, that's how the modern person lives right now.

2332
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:54,320
Every year there's new technology and something different.

2333
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:58,080
Not to mention the state of the world in some sense with COVID and everything else that's

2334
02:09:58,080 --> 02:09:59,080
been going on.

2335
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:03,520
I think people's comfort in reality has been shook a little bit by the events of the past

2336
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:05,200
five to eight years.

2337
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:08,240
If you did want to introduce some drastically different knowledge, I would suggest that

2338
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:11,360
this would probably be a good time as a shock would be lessened.

2339
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:17,320
Yeah, I am optimistic about it to an extent just, you know, hearing some of the stories.

2340
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:23,720
It doesn't seem like these things, if they are from a different civilization, are a threat

2341
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:24,720
to us.

2342
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:26,400
It doesn't seem like they are here for that.

2343
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:31,520
They don't have any any mal intentions, especially when you hear, you know, some of the most

2344
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:40,040
fascinating things to me is how there's been a large number of sightings near schools and,

2345
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:44,040
you know, with young children seeing these things and reporting these things.

2346
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:50,560
And I don't know if you're familiar with the Zimbabwe, the Rua school in Zimbabwe.

2347
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:55,220
Back in the early 90s, there was something that landed and there was like 30 or 40 school

2348
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:57,260
children that all witnessed the same exact thing.

2349
02:10:57,260 --> 02:11:00,580
And there was that famous Harvard psychiatrist who interviewed them all.

2350
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:03,060
And yeah, yeah, John Mack.

2351
02:11:03,060 --> 02:11:05,780
And, you know, there was communications.

2352
02:11:05,780 --> 02:11:10,420
They said that when they stared into the eyes of these things, that they felt this feeling

2353
02:11:10,420 --> 02:11:13,100
of be careful with technology.

2354
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:19,180
Technology can lead you down a dark path or it could be bad for your civilization.

2355
02:11:19,180 --> 02:11:23,860
You know, probably not the thoughts that these children were having, probably not a natural

2356
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:27,540
thought that these children will be having, you know, especially during that time in the

2357
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:28,260
early 90s.

2358
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:35,620
I mean, looking at where the world was then and then, you know, there were so many school

2359
02:11:35,620 --> 02:11:41,260
sightings like this, which is very interesting to me how, you know, because when you think

2360
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:45,500
of children and how much more open minded they are than adults who are just hardwired

2361
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:52,380
into thinking the world is a certain way, that that alone just makes me whether how

2362
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:53,220
real that is or not.

2363
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:55,180
That makes me optimistic about this whole thing.

2364
02:11:56,060 --> 02:12:00,820
And I'll say, too, that I don't think what we're experiencing is probably a new phenomenon.

2365
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:07,420
I think that would be a statistical unlikeliness or be unlikely statistically to think that

2366
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:11,980
this just started in the very recent past.

2367
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:16,180
I work from the assumption that this is probably been going on much longer than that, you

2368
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:20,700
know, what that means in my daily thinking, I don't know, but I don't think this is new.

2369
02:12:20,700 --> 02:12:26,580
And if we if we if we assume that, then I don't think we can we have to have that much

2370
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:29,980
to fear as we better understand this because we're already living in that world.

2371
02:12:29,980 --> 02:12:31,180
We just don't know it. Right.

2372
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:35,380
So the fear is all just our own internal chains that we need to come to terms with.

2373
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:39,620
Yeah. The stories like this, there's only two things you can really do with it in a

2374
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:42,140
sense. You can accept it or you can not.

2375
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:47,020
And I think a lot of people choose the latter, like maybe perhaps a school teacher,

2376
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:53,860
because it's almost like a cognitive dissidence in a sense where you just you cannot

2377
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:57,140
process that information and continue about in your normal life immediately.

2378
02:12:57,140 --> 02:13:04,260
And so your brain just kind of dismisses it as either confusion or temporary stupidity

2379
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:05,580
or what have you. Yeah.

2380
02:13:05,580 --> 02:13:09,580
And go about their lives. And I've noticed that in this conversation that I've been

2381
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:11,740
having more broadly about this topic.

2382
02:13:11,740 --> 02:13:16,100
Sometimes there's just people that and one of the best ways you can identify them is

2383
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:19,900
as soon as you mention something, quote, unquote, aliens or just different or UAP

2384
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:22,180
media laughter. Right.

2385
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:25,940
The first reaction is a ha, you know, like and then they like realize you're not

2386
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:30,860
laughing. And and then they kind of like, oh, OK, but they don't know how to move

2387
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:34,100
forward from that point because they're not ready to integrate that into their

2388
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:37,820
reality yet. I truly think people really do live in their own realities.

2389
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:42,300
Right. You create your you create your perception of the world in your brain.

2390
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:45,820
Right. And you do that based on your experiences, whether they're true or not.

2391
02:13:45,820 --> 02:13:52,700
Right. And a lot of times I think people use that kind of mentality to protect

2392
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:57,180
themselves from this type of information almost as a protection mechanism where

2393
02:13:57,180 --> 02:14:00,420
it's just too outside, you know, their scope of every day for them to really,

2394
02:14:00,420 --> 02:14:03,140
like, just stop and integrate it because it's just too much.

2395
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:04,620
Right. It's too much.

2396
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:07,020
And we're busy. Yeah, we're busy.

2397
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:08,380
We got shit to do. Yeah. Right.

2398
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:10,780
Like it's almost the same thing that you dealt with in the Navy in a way.

2399
02:14:10,900 --> 02:14:12,740
Oh, 100 percent is exactly the same way.

2400
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:14,180
We got missions to do. We got this.

2401
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:15,660
We got that. I want to promote.

2402
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:16,620
I want to do this.

2403
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:19,180
You know, I want to eventually get home and see my wife.

2404
02:14:19,220 --> 02:14:24,420
Right. People are just so focused on their day to day lives and what they have to do

2405
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:27,540
in the next hour and staring at their phones on social media.

2406
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:32,060
I mean, like we were I mean, that was even true for us as fighter pilots when we were

2407
02:14:32,060 --> 02:14:33,980
literally in the sky looking at these objects.

2408
02:14:33,980 --> 02:14:36,220
Right. Which bad on us.

2409
02:14:36,220 --> 02:14:38,780
But, you know, we only have so much fuel and X, Y and Z.

2410
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:40,900
And there's a lot of reasons why that is the best.

2411
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:42,420
You know, that was the right answer.

2412
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:43,100
Of course. Yeah.

2413
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:46,540
But it doesn't prevent me from looking back

2414
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:48,980
with a little bit of regret, wondering what we could have learned

2415
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:52,100
if we paid more attention at the time.

2416
02:14:52,100 --> 02:14:53,980
Well, cool, man. I really appreciate you coming and doing this.

2417
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:54,860
This was fascinating.

2418
02:14:54,860 --> 02:14:56,460
Yeah, it was my pleasure. This is great.

2419
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:56,940
Thanks for having me.

2420
02:14:56,940 --> 02:15:01,300
Tell people again where they can find your new podcast and and whatever else

2421
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:03,500
that you have online, people can follow to learn more about you.

2422
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:04,900
Yeah, absolutely. Oh, look, there it is.

2423
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:07,220
There it is. The Merge podcast.

2424
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:11,300
MergePoint podcast on YouTube or MergePodcast.com.

2425
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:14,660
We're going to start airing our first episode tomorrow.

2426
02:15:14,660 --> 02:15:17,140
It'll already be out by the time you hear this.

2427
02:15:17,140 --> 02:15:20,860
You can also follow me on Twitter at Uncertain Vector.

2428
02:15:20,860 --> 02:15:23,780
And now I can't wait for you guys to see it.

2429
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:26,380
That's incredible. How did you come up with the name Merged?

2430
02:15:26,380 --> 02:15:28,380
Well, that's how we saw these things, right?

2431
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:29,580
We have a merge with them.

2432
02:15:29,580 --> 02:15:33,180
A merge is a fighter pilot term when you get close enough to an object

2433
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:36,820
to visually ID it because you're uncertain of its origin or its makeup.

2434
02:15:36,820 --> 02:15:39,060
And so we go to merges and dogfights all the time.

2435
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:41,940
And that's when we go nose on, we get as close as we can.

2436
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:44,820
We merge plot, which means the radar operators can no longer

2437
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:49,460
distinguish our radar contacts on their scope anymore.

2438
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:51,460
So we've merged into one radar contact.

2439
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:52,740
Oh, that's fascinating. Yeah.

2440
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:54,500
And so that's how we visually ID things.

2441
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:55,820
Appreciate it again, man. Thank you.

2442
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:58,820
And good night, world. Good night.
