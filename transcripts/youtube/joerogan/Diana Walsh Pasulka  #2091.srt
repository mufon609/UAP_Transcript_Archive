1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,560
It's a scary podcast for me because I feel like you're, because I know a lot of the things

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,560
that you've said and I've related to them and I've said, okay, this makes sense.

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,560
Why is that scary?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,880
Okay, so it's scary because it's not consensus reality and, you know, because it's not consensus

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,520
reality we could talk about it over hot chocolate near a fire or something, but here we're talking

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,440
about it and lots of people are going to be listening, so that is somewhat scary.

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,000
That's the hurdle that we all have to get over and the good thing about this is it really

8
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,960
is just us talking, you know, and there are a lot of people that are going to listen,

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,560
but they're just people too.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,440
That's true and they've probably had these experiences.

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,000
Some of them have, yeah.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,080
The experiences that are available through psychedelics, I've always wondered, I mean,

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,160
the thing that it's always struck me about the UFO experience, particularly the abduction

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,520
experience, is that it always happens when people are asleep.

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,240
It always happens at night.

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,480
It either happens on the road when people are tired and it's late at night or it happens

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,400
like, why does it have to happen at night?

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,240
The universe doesn't give a shit where the sun is in position to the planet.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,480
That doesn't make any sense that all these UFO abduction experiences would happen only

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,800
when the sun is on the other side.

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,280
That's so dumb.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,800
It makes no sense.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,360
It's literally, it's such an egocentric, earth-centric perspective that, and not even

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,920
earth-centric, hemispherical-centric, right?

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,280
It depends on where the sun is in position to the earth.

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,360
For that to be the only time that UFOs come, I was always like, this seems like horseshit.

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,440
There's something about it that seems like horseshit, but there's also something about

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,600
it that seems real.

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,920
When you listen like Betty and Barney Hill, when they're talking, boy, that sounds like

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
people talking about a real thing.

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,320
Boy, that sounds like a real experience.

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,540
It really does.

33
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,080
These people like the Whitley Stribers, these people that talk about these experiences that

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,840
happen at night, we know for a fact that when you are sleeping, your brain is producing

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,840
endogenous psychedelic chemicals.

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,160
We have no idea why.

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
We have no idea what the purpose of those things are.

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
We have no idea what the quantity is.

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,480
We used to think, until recently, they weren't even exactly sure where it was being produced,

40
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,720
but now through Strassman's work and through the work of the Cottonwood Research Foundation,

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,920
the people that do those DMT studies, they know that now your brain is producing this.

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,240
Is your brain, is it producing a chemical gateway into another dimension?

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,800
Is that why these people are experiencing these abduction, air quote, abduction experiences,

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,520
these encounters, let's say encounters?

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
Is that why they're happening at night?

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,360
Is that why they're happening while they're lying in bed?

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,240
That seems to make way more sense.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,200
Yeah, that's a great question.

49
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
I can talk a little bit about this.

50
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Please.

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Okay.

52
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,880
I think we're starting weird.

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,080
Can we just start with, how did you get involved in this?

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,760
Please just tell people your background.

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,200
Okay, sure.

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm a professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington,

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,960
and I grew up in California.

58
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:51,160
And I've always been interested in these experiences, but religion, and also I grew up, I was going

59
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,040
to graduate school during the dot com boom, so I saw how technology was changing everything.

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,120
Our schools were the first to adopt computers and that type of thing.

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,600
So what I did was I was very interested in, I was working.

62
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,120
Your parents, you tell them you want to study religion, and they're like, why not be a doctor?

63
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,680
So I was going to college, but I kept taking courses in religion and philosophy.

64
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,280
And when I got out, I got a job doing technology and things like that, and I made all right

65
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,040
money, but I still read about religion and philosophy.

66
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,320
So I figured if I could get scholarships to continue that I would.

67
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,480
And I kept getting scholarships, and that's how I got my PhD in religion.

68
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,760
In religious studies, by the way, we actually, we're not ministers or anything like that.

69
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,780
We don't advocate for any religious tradition.

70
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,900
We study them.

71
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,240
And since most people in the world are religious in some way, it's a good thing to know.

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,120
But how did I get into studying UFOs?

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,040
So I studied Christian history, and that's what I did for a long time until I was what's

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
called a full professor.

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,880
You can't go any higher.

76
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
You're a full professor.

77
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,200
That's it.

78
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,520
And I studied these things called ascent narratives.

79
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,320
So ascent narratives are when people levitate in the Christian tradition.

80
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,320
People either levitate or they see things that they call angels or demons and things

81
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
like this.

82
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,840
And I always studied them from a historical perspective.

83
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,640
And I found that going through, looking at these ascent narratives through the historical

84
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,360
record at the Vatican, actually, I kept coming across aerial phenomena in the historical

85
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,840
records from a thousand years ago, from 500 years ago, from very recently.

86
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,880
And I recognized that this was happening in UFO literature.

87
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,000
And so I started to look at abductions and UFO sightings and things like that.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,920
And I wanted to do a cross-cultural analysis of this.

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,560
And that was in 2012.

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
And that's how I got into this.

91
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,200
I just want to point out that not all abductions happen in your sleep.

92
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,800
A lot of abductions actually happen in daylight.

93
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,000
But I do agree with you that something's happening in your brain and you're perceiving something

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,160
and you called it, is there some type of mental gateway?

95
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,320
And I think there's absolutely a mental gateway.

96
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,440
Does this discount that this is objective of us?

97
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,220
Like, you know, the question is, is this something subjective or is this something objective

98
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,300
of us?

99
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,980
My opinion at this point is it's something that is objective of us.

100
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,300
There's something that we're accessing.

101
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,420
And I don't think it's within our space-time reality, to tell you the truth.

102
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,340
So you think it's from somewhere else?

103
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,620
I do.

104
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,580
But that doesn't, I mean, it doesn't have to be a location, you know, a geography.

105
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,580
Right.

106
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,900
That's where it gets weird.

107
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,460
It gets totally weird, but so does quantum physics.

108
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,820
Quantum physics is totally weird.

109
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,140
It's the weirdest stuff ever.

110
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,140
Yeah.

111
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,940
And it's completely accepted that you could have something that exists in one place and

112
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,940
also in another place.

113
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,940
Now it is.

114
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
Now it's completely accepted.

115
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,940
And also still.

116
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
Yeah.

117
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,340
The Nobel Prize in, what was it, 2022, was about that.

118
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,140
Yeah, which is like, what are you saying?

119
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
You're saying witchcraft's real?

120
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,140
Like, what are you saying?

121
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,140
Magic is real?

122
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,140
Yeah, I think so.

123
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,140
Well, yeah.

124
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Quantum physics is the nuttiest stuff of all time.

125
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
I've had a hundred people explain it to me.

126
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,140
I don't get it still.

127
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,140
Yeah.

128
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,420
Okay, so you were talking about accessing this space.

129
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,900
And if I can go back to something you were talking about, and I'm going to say this.

130
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,380
So what I found was, and I had this experience too when I was around 13 years old, I felt

131
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,500
like the world was going to end.

132
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,460
I felt like there was going to be some kind of war.

133
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,900
And it was a visceral feeling.

134
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,420
It wasn't something that, it was something that made me depressed as a child.

135
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,060
And it was real.

136
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,580
I believed it was going to happen.

137
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,140
And I believed it was going to happen at any time.

138
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,580
Well, this, after studying religion and studying, by the way, this kind of prompted me to studying

139
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,300
religion and recognizing that, you know, if you look at, say, Christianity or even other

140
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,540
religions, people had ideas that the world was going to end and extinction events have

141
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,660
happened and things like that.

142
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,740
So it could very well be that information like this is coming to us, but it's out of

143
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,060
our space time.

144
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:18,100
So to us, it seems like it's going to happen now because our sense is of linear time, right?

145
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,860
So if we get a feeling, and it's not from any of the input that we're getting, like

146
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,300
our, you know, people telling us this is actually going to happen, the news telling us this

147
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,680
is actually going to happen, but it's coming to us as this feeling that you and I were

148
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,140
just talking about, it could be coming from that space that we've just identified as,

149
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,460
you know, people are talking about.

150
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:47,340
And yeah, I think that we're at the very beginning of doing a taxonomy or, you know, looking

151
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,700
at this space in terms of the scientists that you just referenced and people that, you know,

152
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,380
I think that actually people have, you know, indigenous cultures talk about this space.

153
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,020
They have language about this space.

154
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,460
I talked about this in encounters that, you know, religious traditions do talk about these

155
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,500
spaces, but in secular culture, we've lost that language.

156
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,760
Well, it is interesting that that language exists when you're discussing things like

157
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:25,460
quantum physics, because that is a language of, like, you know, it's a bizarre, non-tangible,

158
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,580
impossible to understand to the lay person when you're explaining that these things are

159
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,820
all interacting with each other without physical contact.

160
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,620
Like what do you mean?

161
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,900
Like what are you saying?

162
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,260
Like can you show me these things?

163
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,260
Are there photos of them?

164
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,260
No, we're just drawing it.

165
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,940
We're writing it down on paper.

166
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,460
We're pretty sure we have these equations and we know what it is.

167
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,460
Like what?

168
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,460
Yeah.

169
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,460
Yeah.

170
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,740
Like why am I supposed to believe you?

171
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,060
Because you guys are PhDs?

172
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,060
Like what?

173
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,260
This is nuts.

174
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:01,380
But because this is like a field of science, this is a field of study that's universally

175
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:08,060
accepted, we have, we've like given them a pass to talk about crazy stuff.

176
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:17,140
But if you want to talk about crazy things in terms of encountering some sort of thing,

177
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:23,980
some entity, some consciousness that exists in an alternative realm that has access to

178
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:33,620
this realm occasionally, or perhaps that you can transcend your normal state of consciousness

179
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:40,900
and access this other realm occasionally through some methods, whether it's through meditation,

180
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,940
through psychedelic trips, through something, near death experiences, something happens

181
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:53,860
that perturbs the normal state of reality and you have brief access to this transcendent

182
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,300
experience that everyone has talked about.

183
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:04,420
All of the great prophets, all of the great saints and religious figures have talked about

184
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,060
from the beginning of written history.

185
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,780
Yeah.

186
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:15,980
So I think that it's not just that we give those physics guys a pass and girls, okay?

187
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,540
We just don't, what they produce actually is, creates our world, right?

188
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:29,180
The computers we look at and the technologies we use, even the structures we live in.

189
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:36,060
And so this is what prompted me to go back into our historical record and look at the

190
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,120
writings of Plato again.

191
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,700
And some of these people that you're talking about, like the great minds, right?

192
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:49,580
And I recognize that, say Plato, who writes about his mentor Socrates, who's by the way

193
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:55,260
killed by his country, you know, he's killed by Athens, the town he lives in, not the town

194
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:03,400
but the state he lives in, and he's executed for being an atheist, by the way.

195
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,180
And if you look at what he's talking about, he's actually talking about this space.

196
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,540
He's actually talking about having a vision of something that we can't see.

197
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,060
And he calls it the good.

198
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,700
And he says it's the best thing, okay?

199
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,740
He says it makes you do things that are just, and you don't do them because they're the

200
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,040
right thing to do, you do them because you really want to do them.

201
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,340
And so to me, I thought this was fascinating.

202
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,280
So I went back and I recognized that he was what's called a math realist.

203
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:38,620
So he believed that, and he was one of the first people, well, not just him, but people

204
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:44,500
were talking about the 300s before the common era, so many, many, many years ago.

205
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:52,100
He's already identifying these things called platonic solids that now we can prove exist,

206
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,940
but we weren't able to prove them.

207
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,060
So he was using, and he even has this language too, Joe, he has this language.

208
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:08,020
He says that we can actually perceive these through our minds, but it's not normal intellect.

209
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,800
It's not your normal abstract thinking, but it's a type of thinking.

210
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,960
And he relates it to protocols, like physical protocols.

211
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Did you know he was a wrestler?

212
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
No, I didn't.

213
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
Yeah.

214
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Oh, I did know that.

215
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Yeah, I'm sorry.

216
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,840
In fact, his name even means that he's really not just a wrestler, but an awesome wrestler.

217
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,520
Socrates, that name?

218
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,840
No, no, Plato.

219
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Oh, sorry.

220
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Yeah.

221
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,600
These guys were all physical.

222
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,640
It was basically this philosophy, almost like a fight club, I think.

223
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,140
These guys, they were wrestlers, and they believed that this was good.

224
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:52,080
They believed that these protocols helped them use their brains to access the good.

225
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,520
So what was the methodology behind that?

226
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,880
Was it the breaking down of the normal states of consciousness through rigorous exercise

227
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,280
and exertion?

228
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
That's my opinion.

229
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,680
Like a runner's high.

230
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,160
Yeah, that's my opinion.

231
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Yeah.

232
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,480
When I talk about it, because I like to teach my students about this, because I honestly

233
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,080
think that this is what progresses civilization, this kind of thing.

234
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:22,440
So I think when I did American Cosmic, which is the first book about UFOs, again, which

235
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:30,360
I never thought I'd be studying, I encountered this man, Tyler, and he works for the Space

236
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,240
Force, and he's been working for the Space Force since the whole Space Shuttle program.

237
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,320
And he's a special kind of person.

238
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,420
He's a mission controller, but he does a lot of other things, too.

239
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,440
But he's also a multimillionaire, space rocket scientist.

240
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,080
I mean, just so strange.

241
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,240
And I called him Tyler after the character in Fight Club, because that's who he reminded

242
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
me of.

243
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,080
He reminded me of that character in Fight Club, because he had this...

244
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:04,080
First of all, he has more than 44 patents, and they're all related to space.

245
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,680
The Space Force has a special place for him, like he's special, right?

246
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,640
What I found was that he was practicing these types of protocols.

247
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,400
I called them protocols because they reminded me of Plato and monastic traditions, the traditions

248
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,840
of monks and things.

249
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,520
So he would make sure that he got sunshine.

250
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,540
He would make sure that he got plenty of sleep.

251
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,280
He would not have too much caffeine.

252
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,320
He exercised a lot.

253
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,600
He boxed, right?

254
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,280
So he was also a fighter.

255
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,800
And he tried to stay away from people.

256
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,720
I know it sounds weird, but that's what monks do.

257
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,240
They try to monitor their input of people, because those people can actually take them

258
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,440
off their game or something like that.

259
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,360
So this guy was put into another mental state.

260
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,760
And during this mental state, he said that he could receive calculations, he could receive

261
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,960
information, he could receive things, and then he could gather a group of scientists,

262
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,120
and he wouldn't tell them where he came from, because he honestly thought they were coming

263
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:11,320
from these things outside of space time, kind of like ETs or something, off-planet intelligences.

264
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,080
Which Tesla also believed.

265
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,680
And the people who started our own Space Force believed it.

266
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,320
So this isn't common knowledge.

267
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,120
That's what I found, is like a lot of people aren't, they don't know this history of the

268
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,340
American Space Force and the Russian Space Force, very much the same.

269
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,600
These people were doing these things.

270
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,760
And this allowed them.

271
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
You see this in sports, right?

272
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,320
So people, I was just using this example in a class yesterday.

273
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,960
I saw this basketball game two or three years ago with Steph Curry.

274
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,400
And the way they were playing, it was almost as if there was an emergent phenomena that

275
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,440
was bigger than each of the people, because they somehow anticipated what the other guy

276
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,080
was going to do.

277
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,360
And I used to do sports, and I know that this is something that can be done.

278
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,240
There's a flow state, right?

279
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,280
And I think that this is what Plato was trying to get his group into, through these protocols.

280
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,880
Well, that makes sense.

281
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,360
One of the things that happens in flow state is that you stop being there.

282
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
That's right.

283
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Yeah, it's not you.

284
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Yeah.

285
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,840
And you're just experiencing this thing.

286
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Totally, yeah.

287
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Yeah.

288
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,080
You experience it on stage, doing stand-up.

289
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
I imagine that.

290
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
When you do it right.

291
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Yeah.

292
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,440
When you get it right, you're on a ride.

293
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,680
You're just making sure that, okay, feed this into the machine, and go.

294
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
And it goes.

295
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:39,440
And you're in tune with what you're saying, but you're almost outside of yourself.

296
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
That's exactly right.

297
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,640
And you know there is science that shows that this is the case.

298
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,040
Right, with brain waves.

299
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Yeah.

300
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,280
The problem is, is that when Joe's out there on stage, they're not going to hook you up

301
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
to an MRI.

302
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Right?

303
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,240
You can't do that kind of, because when it's happening, it's happening spontaneously.

304
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
It just happens.

305
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,080
And no one can actually predict when it's going to happen.

306
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,400
But you hope that it happens.

307
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,200
And also, if they did hook you up to it, you would also be aware that you're being monitored

308
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
and would change the state.

309
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Yeah, and you'd lose it.

310
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Yeah, you'd lose it.

311
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Yeah.

312
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,160
It's like when you're in a lucid dream, and you go, oh my God, I'm in a lucid dream, and

313
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
then wake up.

314
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
Yeah.

315
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Damn it.

316
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,360
I've had that happen so many times.

317
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,560
I'm like, wow.

318
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,400
I know there's a way to facilitate lucid dreams.

319
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,800
I know there's a study behind it, but I've never, for whatever reason, it seems so stupid

320
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,040
that I've never done it, but I've never even had the desire to do it.

321
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,320
I just want it to come to me when it comes to me.

322
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Which is dumb.

323
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Not necessarily.

324
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
I respect that.

325
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,800
Yeah, but part of me doesn't.

326
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Part of me is like, you're just lazy.

327
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,560
Why don't you just go start the practice and study it and figure out how to make it happen

328
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,480
more often?

329
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,520
But for whatever reason, I have zero desire to do it.

330
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,200
I don't know why.

331
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,160
There might be some wisdom there.

332
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,920
I don't know.

333
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,880
I go back and forth with whether or not it's laziness.

334
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,840
I don't know what it is.

335
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:12,920
But there's obviously a fascinating aspect to lucid dreaming, to what is going on there.

336
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:19,200
How are you managing this weird thing that for most of us, you wake up and you go, God,

337
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
what the hell was that?

338
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
Why was Godzilla in my dream?

339
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Right.

340
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Why was I on a skateboard?

341
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
That's right.

342
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,280
It's just like weirdness to it.

343
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,800
And then there's people that try to interpret that with far too much confidence.

344
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Yes, I think so too.

345
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:40,600
So in Tibet, there's a Tibetan dream yoga, and that's what they do.

346
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,560
They basically teach you how to do, and you have to have a teacher, by the way, because

347
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,400
they say it can be dangerous.

348
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Dangerous.

349
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,080
So I think that's probably why you think you're not doing it, because I don't think you're

350
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
lazy, frankly.

351
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,360
I know the kinds of things you do.

352
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,560
I know that that's not part of it.

353
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,160
Yeah, but I am lazy.

354
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
That's what's crazy.

355
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,720
I really am.

356
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,640
I'm lazy, but I'm disciplined.

357
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,360
I'm both of those things.

358
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,440
I do all the things that I'm supposed to do, but God, it's a sludge.

359
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
It's a struggle.

360
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
It's like, ugh.

361
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,440
But I always do them.

362
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Okay.

363
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,680
Well, you'd be up for Plato's.

364
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,560
He'd invite you to his school.

365
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,240
The only time things are not a struggle is when I was competing.

366
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,960
When I was competing, then my discipline wasn't a struggle.

367
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,320
Then it was an obsession.

368
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,840
So it was like people would say, God, he's so disciplined, like, no, I'm mentally ill.

369
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm crazy.

370
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
Yeah, I understand that.

371
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,880
There's a giant difference between discipline.

372
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Mike Tyson said this on the podcast.

373
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,200
He said, discipline is doing something you hate, but doing it like you love it.

374
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
That's right.

375
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Yeah.

376
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,920
So when you love it, it's not really discipline.

377
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
No, it's not.

378
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
It's obsession.

379
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Yeah.

380
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,400
There's a different thing to that.

381
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,720
That's what I was telling you about when I saw your picture out there of Jimi Hendrix.

382
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,040
When I was a kid, I was an artist.

383
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,920
I really liked to do art.

384
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,600
I remember the first time I became obsessed was when I was doing this drawing of Jimi

385
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,160
Hendrix.

386
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,600
It went on for about a week, and my parents were like, what are you doing?

387
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,480
I was just obsessed with getting it correct.

388
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,680
It had to be absolutely correct.

389
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,280
I did get it correct, and it was pretty amazing.

390
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,760
Do you have it?

391
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,560
No, I always give my stuff away.

392
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,040
Do you have a photo of it or anything?

393
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
No, no, no.

394
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Damn.

395
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
This was like pre-cell phones.

396
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Oh.

397
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
I gave it to my best friend.

398
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
That's cool.

399
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
I don't regret it.

400
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
That's cool.

401
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Yeah.

402
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,280
But I mean, it was the experience, though, that was the best part of it.

403
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Yeah.

404
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,560
The reason why this podcast is called The Joe Rogan Experience is because I think Jimi

405
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,680
Hendrix is a religious figure.

406
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,920
He is.

407
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
He absolutely is.

408
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:59,040
I think, I mean, the guy died at 27, which when I was 27, I was a fucking moron.

409
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,000
I had never done anything good.

410
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:11,440
This guy had transcended the normal boundaries of what music was and had tapped into something,

411
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,520
whatever it was.

412
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,960
But when you listen to Voodoo Child, to this day, I've listened to that song thousands

413
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
of times.

414
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:26,880
But if I'm on my way to go do something cool and I listen to that song loud in my car,

415
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:35,760
he tapped into something that was just out of this realm, inaccessible to the average

416
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,120
person that plays a guitar, inaccessible to the average artist.

417
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,600
He hit some crazy vibration.

418
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,960
And I've always got that feeling when I listen to his stuff.

419
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:54,240
It's always moved me in a very weird way, where I'm just completely captivated, like

420
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,600
immersed in the sounds, immersed in his music.

421
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,680
Me too.

422
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,560
So he, I think, well, he knew that he was doing that.

423
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,600
So he, as you know, I'm sure you know this, but he had a guitar when he was five.

424
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:18,640
And he was so good at it, he was immediately like, he streamed sacred information through

425
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
his music.

426
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
And he knew he did.

427
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,000
He called it his electric church.

428
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,520
So he knew he did that.

429
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,160
And how incredible.

430
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,360
And yes, we can hear it.

431
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:38,400
And I think probably part of the reason I felt that when I listened to his music, and

432
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:45,640
I somehow put that into his, that picture, that drawing that I made.

433
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,800
And it was a beautiful experience.

434
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,160
And that was, you know, I mean, it sounds so strange, but that's part of the reason

435
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,960
why I was interested in studying religion and things like that, because of that experience.

436
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,680
Yeah, that you're tapping into something that's higher than normal consciousness.

437
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
Yes.

438
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,080
And it's pretty cool.

439
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,040
It's exactly what Plato said it was.

440
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,760
You do it for its own sake.

441
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,280
You don't do it for anything else.

442
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,000
You do it because of it.

443
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,920
You don't do it because after this, I'm going to make up a lot of money.

444
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,040
Or you know, after this, it'll make my parents happy.

445
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,400
Or you don't do it for those reasons.

446
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,840
You do it for in and of itself.

447
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,600
Well, the people that I know that do do it for those reasons, I'm going to be famous,

448
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,880
I'm going to be this, I'm going to be that, they never make it.

449
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
There's something about it.

450
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
They just don't.

451
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
They just don't.

452
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,840
Maybe some of them will become pop stars, like someone will plug them into the right

453
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,840
songwriter and the right producer, and they'll figure it out.

454
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,760
But it'll never be transcendent.

455
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
It might be catchy.

456
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,040
It might be OK.

457
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,960
But there's not, it's not Hendrix.

458
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
No.

459
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
No.

460
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Yeah.

461
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Yeah.

462
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,360
That kind of what we like to call genius, like what is that?

463
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,720
But it's not, I mean, clearly it's him.

464
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,880
He's a vessel.

465
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,360
He's a receiver, an antenna, whatever he is.

466
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,160
But he's getting something from a higher state.

467
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
No doubt.

468
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,800
And the wildest thing with people, what I always want to tell people about Hendrix and

469
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:23,760
a lot of the particularly impactful people from the 1960s is that you have to understand

470
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,880
how different the 60s were from the 50s.

471
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,360
Like the difference between 2014 and 2024 is nil.

472
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,000
There's very little difference other than the ubiquitous technology, AI, things that

473
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,440
are much more powerful than they ever were before, the impact of social media.

474
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,000
But there was an impact of social media even 10 years ago, right?

475
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,240
There's something about the 60s that were very different than the 50s.

476
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,320
And I connected to psychedelic use because all of those people were doing psychedelics,

477
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,560
all of them, all those transcendent people, all the Beatles.

478
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,320
From the Beatles, from their early days to the psychedelic days, it was a completely

479
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,160
different band, like completely different style of music.

480
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,000
Yes, that's right.

481
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Completely different impact.

482
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,280
There was something about it.

483
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:20,520
What had happened in the 1960s was a stunning revolution in culture.

484
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:27,240
And it's hard for us to understand it because we weren't teenagers when that was happening.

485
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,280
I wasn't even born when Hendrix was in his prime, or I was just a baby.

486
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,280
When you listen to that now, it's hard to put it into context of how revolutionary that

487
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
was.

488
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,880
I think you're right.

489
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,120
For most people, I think that's, unless you lived through it.

490
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,840
And that's also the terrifying aspect of what government can do.

491
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,080
Because through the sweeping psychedelics act of 1970, they made everything illegal

492
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,720
and they did it to squash dissent.

493
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,160
They did it to stop the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement.

494
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,560
And they did it so that they could arrest all these people that were involved in all

495
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,520
these groups because all of them were involved in drugs.

496
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,720
And so they figured, well, this is the best way to just make everything, it's obviously

497
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,800
as people are doing acid and ruining our country, let's make everything illegal and then lock

498
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,480
everybody up that does it.

499
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,440
And then you get the 80s.

500
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,320
The 80s is like this confused child that was raised improperly, was then cast out into

501
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,560
the world with a distorted sense of values that was expressing these values in some of

502
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,440
the most clumsy and goofy art human beings have ever done.

503
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,920
And the drugs changed.

504
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Yeah.

505
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Right.

506
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,600
They became ego-driven drugs, the worst kind of drugs.

507
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,360
So it's really interesting because the 60s wouldn't be the only culture that's

508
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,360
informed by psychedelics or entheogens, as they're called, in Native American churches

509
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
or that.

510
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,840
But what's interesting to me, and I don't know if you have any ideas about this, is

511
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,520
that most likely it was through the government that the drugs became available.

512
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,780
And then once the effects seemed to be counter to how, who knows, maybe there were just two

513
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:26,860
factions of government, one that was pro, you know, let's see what happens, you know,

514
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,340
let's do this experiment.

515
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:35,340
And then the other was, you know, push back and, you know, let's change the culture through

516
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,780
taking, you know, making these illegal.

517
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:45,060
But what you see now is you definitely see, you know, using these for therapeutic purposes.

518
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:55,060
Yeah, the MKUltra experiments, when you realize what the government was involved with and

519
00:28:55,060 --> 00:29:00,100
what they were doing, how they were running the Hate Ashbury Free Clinic, and they were

520
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:06,580
administering psychedelics to people in brothels without their knowledge and observing them,

521
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,820
and what they did with Charles Manson that's very well detailed.

522
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,740
I don't know if you've read Tom O'Neill's book, Chaos?

523
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
Yeah.

524
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
Have you ever read that?

525
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,420
It's insane.

526
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,420
Yeah, I know.

527
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,220
It's insane because Tom is so detail oriented.

528
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,260
I mean, he's so crazy that he studied this one thing for 20 years, like, and really kind

529
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,140
of like tanked his life, you know, and then finally got the book out there and the book

530
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,260
is just holy shit.

531
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,060
Because it's what the facts, the absolute undeniable facts in that book, just those

532
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:42,460
alone, forget speculation, forget theory, just the facts alone are insane.

533
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,380
They most likely created Charles Manson, most likely gave him psychedelics, gave him LSD,

534
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:55,460
taught him how to mind control influential young people or easily influenced young people

535
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,300
and get them to do horrific things and demonize the hippie movement.

536
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,700
Yeah, it makes you wonder, doesn't it?

537
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,460
Yeah, like what's going on right now.

538
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,820
That's exactly what I think.

539
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,620
I don't think there is good right now.

540
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,260
I think right now they're baffled by this thing called the internet.

541
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:18,140
I think the internet threw a giant monkey wrench in propaganda because it it made people

542
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,140
so much more resistant to bullshit.

543
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,820
And then the when you see things like especially coming out of the pandemic, when you see how

544
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,220
incompetent these people that are supposed to be leaders are and how foolhardy they are

545
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:39,060
and how stupid their decisions were, and then you just look at the undeniable transfer of

546
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:46,820
wealth to the upper small area of the country that gained billions of dollars in wealth

547
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,500
and how much devastated small businesses.

548
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,980
And like, did you guys do this on purpose?

549
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,340
Like, do you know what you're doing?

550
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,500
Are you idiots?

551
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,300
Like, why are you telling us what to do?

552
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,060
You guys are fools.

553
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:04,540
And especially when it comes to like, is does anybody believe that Joe Biden's ever had

554
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,140
a transcendent experience?

555
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:11,860
Does anybody believe that Joe Biden has ever met God and came back with a message for mankind?

556
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:19,820
No, it's like everything is like bizarre, ego driven, narrative driven lies and propaganda

557
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:25,740
and just nonsense that's supposed to make it look like they're doing the right thing

558
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,620
always.

559
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,620
Yeah, that's the that's a terrible idea of justice.

560
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,900
Yes. But it's the appearance of justice.

561
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,820
Yeah. Without actually doing the right thing.

562
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:39,940
Yeah. And it's it's it's just it means it's also very it's got all the aspects of a cult.

563
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,500
All the people that go along with it, no matter what the evidence shows that people that people

564
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,580
that aren't like stepping back and going, wait a minute, we are we are being run by

565
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,820
people that have zero feelings for the actual populace.

566
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,860
And all they're trying to do is feed this machine that's got them to where they are

567
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,140
in the first place.

568
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,900
Yeah, it's terrible.

569
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:09,900
It's terrible. And it's it as it moves forward, it creates the need for resistance and it

570
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:15,980
creates. And that's what I've always thought about evil and negative things in the first

571
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:23,500
place. Like they are necessary because they motivate change and they motivate evolution.

572
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:33,860
They motivate expression of dis of disdain of of people that are completely displeased,

573
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,900
people that are very upset with the way things are.

574
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,780
They know this is the wrong way.

575
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:44,340
And it motivates the zeitgeist to move into a different direction, which I think is

576
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,940
happening.

577
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,260
I hear that. This was actually a comment from a student, the exact same comment that you

578
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,540
just said is that, you know, there's this structural evil, right?

579
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:59,660
There's this evil and it actually does some good in the sense that it motivates people

580
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,700
to transform.

581
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,060
Yeah.

582
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,980
OK. I mean, yeah, I agree with you.

583
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,500
And I'm at the same point.

584
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:14,220
So through through my looking at the UFO phenomena and, you know, I knew all of this.

585
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,940
I grew up in Northern California.

586
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,180
You know, there was there were the the grove.

587
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,020
The. I can't think of the name.

588
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,740
It's right above where I live, the Bohemian Grove, you know, so I kind of already had an

589
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:33,660
idea of this kind of thing, you know, of the the group, the cult, as you call it.

590
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,820
Yeah. All right.

591
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,100
And it's easy to see.

592
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,420
Well, for those who have who can see it, it's easy to see.

593
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,820
Some people don't want to see it.

594
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,900
Right. OK.

595
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,540
So once you see it, you're like, OK.

596
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,620
But then to live it to this is what I felt like happened to me.

597
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:56,060
So in 2012, after I started the study of UFOs, I recognized that the management of that

598
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:01,660
that message of the UFO for the American public had been organized not just from the

599
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,780
1940s, but really from earlier, from from early 20th century.

600
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,700
And once I started to recognize even meet the people who were responsible for managing

601
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,820
this in a very cohesive, tight way, very specific.

602
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,780
That's when I recognized that it was that, you know, I felt I felt it.

603
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,860
I guess that's the difference was that before I just saw it on the sideline, you know,

604
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,740
like we talk about it now, you and I.

605
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,740
And it looks like we're talking about it from the sideline.

606
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,420
We're saying, yeah, this is really bad what they're doing and stuff.

607
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,940
But I was part of it. I saw it.

608
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,460
I know those people. They talk to me about it.

609
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
They talk to me about why they were doing it.

610
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,740
And they said, Diana, you you don't want to help these people.

611
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,780
They kill you if they if they you had something that they wanted.

612
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,300
Like, these are not good people, is what they were saying about these people,

613
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,100
specifically the general population.

614
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,660
They were talking about the general population.

615
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,220
The general population would kill you.

616
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,140
That's what they were saying.

617
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,380
They were saying that these people only do good because they have to do good.

618
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,060
They are actually bad.

619
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
And so this was the argument I was getting.

620
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,060
So it so it caused me to eject these people from my life for one.

621
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,180
But also to to do, you know, to understand more deeply.

622
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,260
And believe me, I've already thought a lot about the problem of evil.

623
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,060
You know, I spend my life reading about it and doing, you know,

624
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,540
talking about it with people and, you know, what can we do?

625
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,300
I recognize we can't do anything except work on ourselves.

626
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,020
And that's where I had to reread some of those texts,

627
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,180
like the Plato text that I talked about, who he talks about your idea of evil,

628
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,620
that, you know, perhaps or he calls it injustice, injustice.

629
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,300
And he says that perhaps people are unjust just because, you know,

630
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,300
there needs to be an injustice for other people to like recognize it

631
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,700
and then to do this thing.

632
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,300
You know, how do we create a just society?

633
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,860
That's his question. Right.

634
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,220
And I don't think he so he doesn't actually answer that question with words,

635
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,940
but he does it through giving stories.

636
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,620
And one of the stories is the allegory of the cave where, you know,

637
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,860
that allegory is it's like the matrix. Right.

638
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,220
It's like, you know, where people are in, they're being tied up.

639
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,340
And there's puppeteers who are showing them these shadows on the wall.

640
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,980
And they take that for reality.

641
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,420
But somehow some person gets out and they see, well, what he's talking about

642
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,820
is this mystical tradition that you and I've talked about early.

643
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,980
When we started talking, we talked about

644
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,700
if we do those things that we love and we're carried away and we become,

645
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,580
you said it was obsessed, you know, you're obsessed with it.

646
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,380
And I call it doing it because it's pretty awesome. Right.

647
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,820
That's my word for it. Yeah.

648
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,100
When you do that, justice happens like you're not worried about.

649
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,940
You know, so so so it's almost like a an emergent phenomena

650
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,060
from these communities that do it.

651
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,780
And they're small communities.

652
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,060
So there is structural injustice and there's structural evil.

653
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,340
And it doesn't seem like we can fight.

654
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,180
That's what I learned from doing the UFO.

655
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,260
I learned that there were these things, UFOs.

656
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,020
But more intensely and more personally,

657
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,340
I learned that the government was doing this.

658
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,780
And that's what was upsetting to me most.

659
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,740
So I want to take it back because a lot of this is hard to follow

660
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,340
for people that aren't like well read in this.

661
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,700
When you say that they have been engineering

662
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,980
or orchestrating public perception of this experience from the beginning,

663
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,020
what's the earliest known instance of this?

664
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,420
OK, so the one that is unclassified is Project Blue Book.

665
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,940
And that's from 1950s, 1952.

666
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,500
But I know that and I and and I have to explain how one knows this.

667
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,100
So we have documents that talk about Project Blue Book.

668
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,100
And that's the managed, you know, they're managing the perception,

669
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,620
the public perception of UFOs goes back to like forty seven even

670
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,500
with Roswell and and that kind of thing.

671
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,660
There's another and this is what

672
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,580
this is what I've found is that there's an oral tradition

673
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,980
that is part of the communities that run this, run these programs

674
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,820
like the UFO programs. Right.

675
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,780
And that that information is carried within people.

676
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,460
It's not written down.

677
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,420
They even have a word for not writing it down when they're going to have these

678
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:34,500
meetings. They they have this special term and everybody puts down everything.

679
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,540
You know, what's the term?

680
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,820
I don't it's called it's called pencils up pencils up.

681
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,580
Yeah. So pencils up means they're just going to discuss these things.

682
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,820
And then the that's the only record of it.

683
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,860
It's yeah, it's the oral tradition.

684
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,060
Now, why I was able to look at this is because I had done work

685
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,620
looking at oral traditions in religious in religious communities.

686
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,780
Like oral traditions go back ten thousand years,

687
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,780
whereas, you know, written traditions are like two thousand years old.

688
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,260
Oral traditions are actually more accurate than we think they are.

689
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,060
We tend to think of it as telephone game.

690
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,540
But you can get a lot of information from oral traditions.

691
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,420
And this is actually how a lot of classified information is kept

692
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,060
through oral tradition, especially in a very disciplined

693
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,580
and structured environment like high level military. Yeah.

694
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,380
So so they have a perception.

695
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,620
And one of the things that you said earlier is that they think

696
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:38,260
that the the greater the greater population is not good

697
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,660
and that they will turn on you and that they're evil.

698
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,420
And that's one faction.

699
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,620
So what I found was that there were several different factions

700
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,540
within the perception management of UFOs.

701
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,180
And one of the factions was responsible for

702
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,180
sadly harassing people who do research.

703
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,460
And I found this out by being harassed.

704
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,700
How so? How were you harassed?

705
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,820
OK, so, you know, here I am just your average professor

706
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,100
doing their work and, you know, and doing it pretty well.

707
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,140
At my university, I was the chair of my department,

708
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,260
well regarded by my colleagues and students

709
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,540
and never really doing anything weird. Right.

710
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,260
And then I start to study UFOs thinking that they're not real,

711
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,620
thinking that it's a it's just a form, a new form of religion.

712
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:33,060
And then quickly having people come into my sphere,

713
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,140
research sphere, sphere who are, you know, part of CIA,

714
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,060
part of FBI, that kind of thing.

715
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,220
And then getting a shock that, you know, whoa, this could be dangerous

716
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,620
and maybe I shouldn't be doing this. And thinking, you know, but.

717
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,060
Just simply because those people are contacting you

718
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,060
or specific reasons why you would think it's dangerous.

719
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,700
It indicated to me that there was something that I shouldn't maybe be doing,

720
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,580
that it could be dangerous.

721
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,980
Right. That you could suffer consequences for your curiosity

722
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,780
or for your research. Yeah.

723
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,620
And that they would punish you or you could be punished.

724
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,260
That's what I thought. Yeah. Yeah.

725
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,140
No, most certainly.

726
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,540
And plus, I had done some research on UFOs by that time, of course.

727
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,540
And what is it about the research and what is about

728
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,220
what you could possibly uncover that would be so dangerous?

729
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,340
OK, so of course, that's a question that's loaded.

730
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,500
So I'm going to talk a little bit about.

731
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,020
I'll answer it in part. OK.

732
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,420
So in part, this is before

733
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,180
crash retrieval became a term that Congress used. Right.

734
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,620
So I was. What year are we talking about?

735
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,220
So I started in 2012. OK.

736
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:52,380
By 2015 and 16, I was already in full shock mode of, wow,

737
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,740
this is bigger than I thought.

738
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:00,620
And I was had been invited to go to a crash retrieval spot in New Mexico

739
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,620
that was under a no fly zone.

740
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,540
And I still didn't believe that when UFOs at this point,

741
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,420
you have to understand that.

742
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,500
So I just thought that this I thought the person inviting me is Tyler.

743
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,700
He's a scientist. He works for the Space Force.

744
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,500
He believes this.

745
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,940
And I'm wondering, how does he even believe that this is real?

746
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:23,180
We're we're we're going with Gary Nolan, who's from Stanford, and he's out.

747
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,420
But at the time, I called him James in my book.

748
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,980
And I'm I'm the one actually who invited him to go

749
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,300
because I didn't really want to go by myself, you know?

750
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,140
And so I insisted that Gary go with me.

751
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,820
And Tyler figured out who Gary was and he said, OK, so we went out there.

752
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,860
We had to actually wear blindfolds.

753
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,100
And it was out in the middle of this place in New Mexico.

754
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,700
I don't know where I know what was near it,

755
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,740
but I don't know where the actual place was.

756
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,660
And we were looking for parts, right, that had been put out there

757
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,460
and during the time period.

758
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:01,260
So I think part of it was the danger was that parts exist, right?

759
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,540
So things like this do exist.

760
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,940
And there are anomalous materials.

761
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,460
This is what I was finding out.

762
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,140
And I think that this is what I'm an OK researcher.

763
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,900
It's not like I would make this up, nor would I lie.

764
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,220
You know, I'm I'm publishing with Oxford.

765
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,300
So my reputation is at stake, right?

766
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,780
So I'm doing the best I can to kind of adjudicate like,

767
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,180
am I being fed disinformation or, you know, what's going on?

768
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:33,660
Gary now will be able to identify by taking these parts back

769
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,020
and analyzing them through his laboratories,

770
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,900
whether or not they're engineers or not.

771
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,140
And and he's been doing that ever since.

772
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,660
So these are the kinds of things that I would have found out.

773
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,500
I think part of it was also that I was finding out that there was an oral

774
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,580
tradition and that the perception management was very tight.

775
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,260
And I think this is what they were afraid.

776
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,820
But I've said this now publicly, so.

777
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,500
But I did get harassed, though, I did get harassed and it still happens.

778
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,660
How did you get harassed?

779
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,940
Most of it is doxing and

780
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,540
email harassment at my university began

781
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,620
and both to me and Gary at the same time.

782
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,940
And people showing up.

783
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,860
People. Yeah.

784
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,740
People in my town.

785
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,580
What kind of people? Schizophrenics?

786
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,180
No, but no, but people you wouldn't want to meet.

787
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,460
Yeah. Yeah.

788
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,100
Yeah. Do you think that's targeted?

789
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,900
Do you think that's for sure?

790
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,460
But do you think that also that might just be people

791
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,860
that are obsessed with this particular subject?

792
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,420
These are people that are affiliated with the people in those that.

793
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,420
Yeah. I mean, there's no doubt.

794
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,260
So tell me about the crash retrieval site.

795
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,940
Yeah. So this is in.

796
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,620
OK, so now you have to understand this is a long time period.

797
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,420
So I started this in 2012.

798
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,900
I get this shock where I'm being, you know,

799
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,620
people are asking me to meet, you know, people from these programs

800
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,860
and from the Space Force.

801
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,220
And I'm actually not meeting with them because I'm waiting.

802
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,340
I'm kind of thinking I've got to think this through.

803
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,180
It wasn't until about 2014 that I actually start to meet

804
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,900
the people like the affiliated people.

805
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,940
And they show me some things and they, you know,

806
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:27,140
they they asked me to go to this crash retrieval site in New Mexico.

807
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,180
No, this is a recent crash.

808
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,340
No, it's OK.

809
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:36,300
So this crash is part of a series of crashes that happened in the 1940s.

810
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,740
So the Roswell. It wasn't Roswell, actually.

811
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,780
It was one of the crash sites that's near.

812
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,060
It's in New Mexico, but it's not Roswell.

813
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,060
So there was more than one crash in New Mexico.

814
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,300
Yeah, I think they allegedly allegedly.

815
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,740
Yeah. They said that there were probably four, maybe even more.

816
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,060
I don't know. What a bunch of shitty UFOs.

817
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,340
I know. I know. That's what.

818
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,740
Well, they don't believe that they crashed.

819
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,740
They use that term, but they don't they don't think it's a crash.

820
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,100
They think that it's they personally, I'll tell you from a professor's

821
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,860
standpoint, like their idea of this is that it's a donation.

822
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,620
They call it the donation site.

823
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,860
So they think that these were donated materials and they're going to get

824
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,820
information and they do.

825
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:23,700
And that's how Tyler was able to create a lot of of the things that he created

826
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,420
in, you know, through.

827
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,740
And he would fly these on the space shuttle, by the way, these experiments

828
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,660
and and so forth. It was very, very fascinating to me.

829
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,540
I mean, I think anybody would be fascinated with it to tell you the truth.

830
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,340
When you say fly these, you don't mean physical materials.

831
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,700
So he would have an idea that he would get through these protocols

832
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,060
that I told you about. So he practices these protocols.

833
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,620
And it would be related to something that he would then want to fly

834
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,380
on the space shuttle, because this was during the time the space shuttle

835
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,220
was happening and the space shuttle had anti-gravity environments

836
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,900
and he needed these environments in order to create this.

837
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,340
And now this is actually a whole field called biologics.

838
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:09,020
So there's there's a real field now that where people are doing these experiments

839
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,300
in space and creating things that we can't create here.

840
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:18,300
Like what medicine, certain types of metals,

841
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,020
kind of like ceramic metals.

842
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,260
He created something.

843
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,060
I actually wrote about this and published about it.

844
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,260
Totally academic paper.

845
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,820
So, you know, most general readers would never read it.

846
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,900
It's because it has academic jargon in it.

847
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,740
But I talked all about it.

848
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,540
James got something.

849
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,740
Research has capitalized on microgravity in space to accelerate drug

850
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,860
discovery and development.

851
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:47,460
That was one of the speculations about the type of metals

852
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,060
that were retrieved, supposedly, from these crash sites,

853
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:57,420
that these whatever these metals were, they were layered

854
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,980
and that they could only be layered specifically the way they were done

855
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,700
in a zero gravity environment.

856
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,980
Yeah, that's right.

857
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,700
They were engineered.

858
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,940
So I actually did talk to Gary before I came on your podcast,

859
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,140
because I just wanted to be sure, you know, because I don't want to represent

860
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,820
his research incorrectly.

861
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,740
So I said, can you please, you know, recap it?

862
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,020
He always thinks I'm an idiot, too.

863
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,300
He's like, how many times have I told you this?

864
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,260
So, yeah.

865
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,100
So he has parts from various of the crash sites that are clearly engineered.

866
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,420
Not by humans,

867
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,140
but but he doesn't he's not going to jump to the conclusion

868
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,460
that is extraterrestrial.

869
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,180
He says, we just don't know.

870
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,700
Right. It's just something that is outside of the realm

871
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,740
of our current understanding of how we create physical materials.

872
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,260
That's correct.

873
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,700
And how much of this stuff they have, they have full crafts.

874
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,300
I've never seen any full craft.

875
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,220
What did you see when you went to the crash site?

876
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,340
So I saw two types of materials.

877
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,820
One, I can say it looks like kind of metallic frog skin.

878
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,580
And another.

879
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,060
And this is on the ground at the crash site.

880
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,900
Or do they have it in warehouses?

881
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,100
I have to tell you a little bit about how we came about this.

882
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,020
Now, remember, this is the first book that I wrote about this.

883
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,300
So I've written two books about it and I wasn't a believer.

884
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,500
So when I went there, I even wasn't a believer.

885
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,580
I was like, I think they're trying to give me misinformation or, you know,

886
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,340
something's going on. Right.

887
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,580
Maybe they really believe this.

888
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,060
Well, they both really believe this.

889
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,460
I know that for sure.

890
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,820
So we're there and we had to wear blindfolds in order to go.

891
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,460
Me and Gary. So Tyler's taking us.

892
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,980
We drive to a certain place.

893
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,980
He says, put the blindfolds on that we had to leave our cell phones.

894
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,060
We can take any technology with us.

895
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,500
And so we go out. It takes about an hour to get out to the site.

896
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,260
We're blindfolded. We get out to the site.

897
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,940
We get out. We're wearing different.

898
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,340
We were wearing like, I guess, I guess there's rattlesnakes out there.

899
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,420
And so we have to wear certain boots and, you know, things like that.

900
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,540
So we get out. We take our blindfolds off.

901
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,860
And the first thing I do is I look around because it looks really familiar to me,

902
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,820
even though I've never been out there.

903
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,900
And Tyler looked at me and he said, looks familiar, doesn't it?

904
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,540
And I said, you know, yeah.

905
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,580
And he said, it's it's you've seen it in the X-Files.

906
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,340
And I was like, what?

907
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,580
He goes, they had an insider on their team.

908
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:30,260
And I honestly thought, OK, this actually fits into my research that,

909
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,580
you know, we learn everything we we do about religion from from media.

910
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,620
Like, you want to know what, you know, Moses looked like.

911
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,740
You just watch, you know, the Ten Commandments and things like that.

912
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,100
Like, it's not true, of course,

913
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,900
but that's how most people learn about their their religions.

914
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,420
And so this made me understand this is what's going on.

915
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,660
It's like people are believing this through this.

916
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,060
And then I'm coming to this and I'm going to confirm

917
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,180
that it indeed looks like this, you know, and it is a crash site.

918
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,620
It's just it's just too weird for me.

919
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,340
But, you know, this is what I study.

920
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,900
So I'm I'm going to study.

921
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,460
But that gets to your point.

922
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,660
Like, how did we get this stuff?

923
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:09,820
So he actually did have metal detectors that were configured

924
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,660
for specific types of metals that he had.

925
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,220
He had these built.

926
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,340
Is there a scientific term for these particular types of metals?

927
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,100
They're called metamaterials.

928
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,140
Metamaterials. Yeah.

929
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,980
I think that's just a fancy word for saying we don't know what this is.

930
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,740
Frankly, because they're meta.

931
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,940
OK. Right.

932
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,740
And they're layered in some sort of a way

933
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,700
where it's like literally like atom upon atom.

934
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,140
Yeah. Well, I don't actually know the science of it.

935
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,700
I just know what these guys tell me because, you know,

936
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:50,220
they're doing the research at, you know, their laboratories.

937
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,140
These people are very cagey about it.

938
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:56,660
Like Jacques Vallee was very cagey about the way he was willing to describe it

939
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,380
and the way he was willing to describe these things.

940
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,020
It's almost like they don't want to

941
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,700
blurt out too much because it'll cut off access.

942
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,340
I don't. OK, so that's that could be.

943
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,540
But I know that the reason that I don't want to is

944
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,140
there's some type of national security issue, and I am an American.

945
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,340
Right. So there's something like that going on.

946
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,300
Right. Especially if someone else can figure out how to use these things.

947
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,020
Yeah. So when you go to this site,

948
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,260
do you see the physical ground where this thing hit?

949
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,660
OK, yes. So what does it look like?

950
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:39,500
OK, so at this point, the whole site is covered

951
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,420
with rubble that looks like rusted rubble.

952
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,420
And it's not sand.

953
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,740
So there's the sand of the desert. Right.

954
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,220
And then there's this rubble everywhere.

955
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,820
And I'm stepping on the rubble and I'm kind of looking at it.

956
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,420
And I think of these pieces.

957
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,860
Well, this this is all just like less than.

958
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,220
Yeah, it's like gravel.

959
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,340
It's like. And so I asked Tyler, what's this?

960
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:05,980
And he said that after the government retrieved the crash

961
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,260
and they didn't want anyone out here looking.

962
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,380
So what they did was they dropped a bunch of tin cans out here in the 1950s.

963
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,740
And these have disintegrated down into this rubble.

964
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,300
And so I put that in my book because that's what he said.

965
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,260
And when I put that in my book, the editor of my book said to me,

966
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,100
you can't say this because it's ridiculous.

967
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,700
And I at the time, I was like.

968
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,780
It is ridiculous, but this is what happened and it's data.

969
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,100
And even though we don't understand it now and it seems ridiculous,

970
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,700
we need to keep it in there.

971
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,820
It doesn't seem ridiculous to me at all.

972
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,620
Well, this is a person who absolutely, you know, the editor,

973
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,020
who absolutely doesn't believe in UFOs at all,

974
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:50,060
but knows that I'm doing good work on a new type of religion, therefore

975
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:55,620
is keeping the Oxford brand, you know, Oxford University straight and narrow.

976
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,460
But I convinced her, I said, it's data, so we've got to keep it in there.

977
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,900
And I'm really happy I did. I kept it in there.

978
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,900
I kept a lot of stuff in there that didn't make sense to me at the time.

979
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,940
But when I look back on it with with everything that's coming out now,

980
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,500
I'm like, OK, I'm glad I did that.

981
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:14,660
Well, the strategy for disseminating disinformation

982
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:19,460
along with real information is long been used.

983
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,020
Yes. Where they'll say a bunch of really ridiculous things

984
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,740
and connect them to something that's probably real. Right.

985
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,060
And that way, everything gets thrown out.

986
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,500
It's the baby with the bathwater.

987
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,940
The whole thing gets thrown out.

988
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,860
Totally. And if you have a site

989
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,900
where they've picked up these anomalous metals

990
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:40,780
that defy our understanding of metallurgy and you're calling them meta materials,

991
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,420
no one knows where the hell it comes from.

992
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,780
What's the best way to confuse people?

993
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,940
We'll just throw a bunch of regular metal everywhere.

994
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,900
That's right. That's exactly. Yeah. Just throw tin cans.

995
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,100
But we were out there all day.

996
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,900
So we were out there for probably 10 hours.

997
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,820
And I know so at many points in the day,

998
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:02,420
Gary and I would go aside and kind of confer without Tyler listening and saying,

999
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,260
you know, is this a setup?

1000
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,180
You know, and so he goes, well, let's just try to find some stuff

1001
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,300
and I'll analyze it and I'll tell you and we'll tell you.

1002
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,580
So are you do you notice that the ground has been disturbed?

1003
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,980
Is there there an indication that something hit there?

1004
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:22,140
Yes. So Tyler took us and showed us everywhere.

1005
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:28,300
Like he's been a part of this retrieval site for like 40 years or so.

1006
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,980
He knows the people that like the original people

1007
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,020
and the story and everything like that.

1008
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,820
So he gave us a tour of the whole place and we did.

1009
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,700
And we found parts, by the way, and some of the parts were so deep down

1010
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,100
into the grounds like there are rocks and things like that.

1011
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:52,740
And Gary, like, I'm afraid he's going to get bit by a rattlesnake, frankly.

1012
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,420
He's putting his hand down there and, you know, spending like

1013
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,860
hours at this one place trying to get something.

1014
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,660
He found some things there.

1015
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,860
And I thought if people are trying to fool us and put things down,

1016
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:08,260
they did a really good job because they would have had to come here

1017
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,740
like a year ago or something and put that down there.

1018
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,300
So I don't honestly, that's my personal opinion is I don't think that this

1019
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,660
this was put out there for us.

1020
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,860
They found they did.

1021
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,940
They did find we did find things.

1022
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:25,100
What's interesting to me is this is that after we found these things

1023
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,340
and we did all this kind of data collection and everything at the site, you know,

1024
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,260
very much like anthropologists do, by the way, you know, documenting what we found,

1025
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,740
when we found it, you know, what it looked like and things like that

1026
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,740
and putting into special containers.

1027
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,900
Then I was like, I don't want this.

1028
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,460
I don't want any of this stuff.

1029
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,420
And they both looked at me and laughed.

1030
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,420
And so Tyler told us what was going to happen.

1031
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,940
We went back to the airport.

1032
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,780
He said, once we get back to the airport,

1033
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,780
Gary said he's going to take the stuff.

1034
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,620
Gary's going to get stopped.

1035
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,860
Oh, Tyler can go through airports, by the way.

1036
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,620
He doesn't get he doesn't have to go through the normal thing

1037
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,620
that I have to go through, like the TSA and everything.

1038
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,860
He just goes through.

1039
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,420
So he went through that through.

1040
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,540
I had to go through.

1041
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,820
Gary went through and he did get stopped.

1042
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,660
And everything happened exactly as Tyler said it would.

1043
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,300
There was going to, you know, they weren't they were going to look through everything.

1044
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,900
They were going to, like, take everything apart.

1045
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,100
Then, you know, all that was was a signal to someone in D.C.

1046
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,460
that somebody had these parts and this is who.

1047
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,700
That's what he said was so.

1048
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,580
And I don't know if the signal went to D.C., but everything else happened.

1049
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:36,020
And Gary and I were both sweating, right?

1050
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,900
We were like, oh, so they essentially allowed this.

1051
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1052
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:46,220
Is it because they want different perspectives from different academics?

1053
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,820
I think so. My personal opinion is that and in fact,

1054
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:54,460
there was a conference at Stanford, like a month ago, and I was at that conference.

1055
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:58,700
And part of what was said was that this is information

1056
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,940
that we can't keep siloed because it's it's too important.

1057
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:07,540
And we need to have the best minds on this, this information, this data, this material.

1058
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,780
This material.

1059
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,300
And so they're out kind of like outsourcing.

1060
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,980
How big were these pieces?

1061
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:16,420
So these pieces that I found weren't very big.

1062
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:20,100
I mean, they were about one of them was about like this, this big. Right.

1063
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,260
OK, like so the size of a pack of gum.

1064
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:28,980
Yeah. And the actual frog skin type thing was probably about this big.

1065
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,220
Like a small notebook. And we found a couple of those.

1066
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,100
You found a couple of just wandering around this area.

1067
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,620
Well, we weren't wandering.

1068
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,340
We were actually digging in and looking.

1069
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,260
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1070
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,500
Wandering is a bad word.

1071
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,060
That's OK. But exploring this frog skin.

1072
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,620
What is it? What is the is it malleable?

1073
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,580
Is it? Yes, it's malleable.

1074
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:53,740
And you could crunch it up and it'll go back to its original form.

1075
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,740
I've heard of that before.

1076
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,780
That was something that they talked about at Roswell,

1077
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,140
that there was some bizarre metal that you could crumple up

1078
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,300
like a piece of paper and it would flatten right back out.

1079
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,140
And that's what you experienced.

1080
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,500
I don't know if it was the same material, but yes.

1081
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,340
Yeah, it was.

1082
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,780
What is what did that feel like when you did that?

1083
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,580
It's hard to explain, because you have to understand

1084
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:21,820
I was really resistant to to the, you know, ten years ago.

1085
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,340
Think about it.

1086
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,540
This was a time period when we weren't talking about UFOs.

1087
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,940
Right. It was ridiculous until 2017 to the New York Times story.

1088
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,260
That's right. And my book was impressed during that time.

1089
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,620
So during this time period, I'm doing this research

1090
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,100
and I am not going to believe that this is this is.

1091
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:42,220
But so many indicators were telling me that it was, yes, this is Diana.

1092
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,540
This is what's going on.

1093
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,860
You know, there is something and so much.

1094
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:49,180
And when I looked back at the space force, our space force,

1095
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:52,580
and also the history of that, I could see, OK, there are

1096
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:56,260
there are so many things that just don't add up here that this is probably.

1097
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:00,900
And I met too many people that had been long timers in the program.

1098
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:05,540
Like seriously long timers, like their whole lives live and die by this.

1099
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,260
Live and die by it.

1100
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,580
When they die, they die with that information.

1101
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,700
And it's it's traumatizing to them and their family, too.

1102
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,180
I can only imagine. Yeah.

1103
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:20,260
Yeah. The the people that worked on Roswell that spoke about it

1104
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:24,540
many, many years later, they they have that sort of same weight

1105
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,780
that they're carrying around with them.

1106
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,860
With Philip Corso and all those other people,

1107
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,060
when they describe the experience, like many, many years later.

1108
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:36,460
So there's a weight to the information that they're carrying.

1109
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,260
It's almost like they want to tell the world,

1110
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,140
but the world is not going to even believe them.

1111
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,460
And how could they unless they experienced it?

1112
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,540
And even though they experienced it, they're still baffled by it.

1113
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,100
That's exactly the feeling I got. It was a weight.

1114
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:54,340
There was a sense of duty to the American,

1115
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,540
you know, to being an American, of course, and patriot.

1116
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,940
There's a patriotism there.

1117
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,820
But there was also a sense that these were the two actors in history

1118
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,140
and we will never know their names.

1119
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:13,700
So you spend 10 hours at this site and is there any guidance?

1120
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,500
Are they describing things to you?

1121
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,580
Are they telling you what you can and can't do?

1122
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,740
Is there any?

1123
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,820
No, it's just me, Gary and Tyler.

1124
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,820
There was no no one else.

1125
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,860
So who transported you there?

1126
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,740
Well, Tyler did, because it was a Tyler blindfolded.

1127
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:35,140
Yeah, yeah, he's the person who worked on on this site for 40 years.

1128
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,140
So obviously has permission to do this.

1129
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,100
He does. He had.

1130
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,860
In fact, he had to get permission for Gary to go.

1131
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,980
He had already received permission for me to go.

1132
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,020
And he had to get permission for Gary to go.

1133
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:51,700
And what kind of information are they giving you

1134
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,380
in terms of what their conclusions are,

1135
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,940
how many different possibilities that they have surmised?

1136
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:00,980
Like, do they have a summary of all the different

1137
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:07,060
aspects of this phenomenon that they think it could be or might not be?

1138
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,060
So, yes.

1139
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,060
So the story actually begins there.

1140
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,180
And then I continue to work with Tyler

1141
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:20,100
because I'm pretty fascinated by what he does

1142
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:23,220
and I'm fascinated about the programs

1143
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:30,700
and I'm fascinated by the by the fact that the true actors of history are unknown.

1144
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,020
And I remember that because these are the people that are doing things

1145
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:39,740
that actually change history like think of the first people that decided,

1146
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,980
hey, let's give these people LSD and see what happens. Right.

1147
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,660
Well, they probably weren't Richard Alpert,

1148
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,700
Ram Dass and Timothy Leary.

1149
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,020
They probably weren't them.

1150
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,300
But Jolly West. There you go. OK.

1151
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,580
And most people don't know who that is.

1152
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:59,860
OK. So that's what I'm saying is like, there's a whole other level to our history.

1153
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,780
And I already knew this anyway, being a historian of religion.

1154
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,020
But when I guess I was a patriot. Right.

1155
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:08,500
And I still am. And so when I was mine.

1156
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:13,260
So when I learned about this, I was I really wanted to share the story

1157
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,340
because I felt like these people, even if they remained invisible,

1158
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,140
they should get their due.

1159
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:21,860
Like, because these people keep us safe in ways that we just don't know.

1160
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:26,100
And they're dedicating their lives and they're getting no recognition for it.

1161
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:27,940
OK, no recognition.

1162
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:32,100
And so that really prompted me more than anything to to write about it.

1163
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:36,900
So I was working with with Tyler and I was scheduled to go to the Vatican.

1164
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:43,180
And and it was at the Vatican where we encountered

1165
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:47,580
where where a lot of things happened for Tyler that I saw made him

1166
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,140
understand that this was something that had been going on

1167
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,460
historically for a very long time period.

1168
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,300
See, we didn't just go to the Vatican.

1169
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,740
We also went to the well, we went to the Vatican Archive,

1170
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,660
which is hard to get into, but I could get into it.

1171
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,380
And we also went to the Space Observatory Archive,

1172
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:07,140
which most people don't even know that the Vatican has a space observatory.

1173
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,260
And how that all happened was not set up, Joe.

1174
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,780
It was not it was so organic

1175
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,220
because it happened before I even met Tyler.

1176
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,140
And I I put off going there

1177
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:22,820
because I have I had at the time very young kids

1178
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:25,180
and I didn't want to leave them and go to another country

1179
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,380
for, you know, three weeks or whatnot.

1180
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:33,180
And but I had been invited by Brother Guy Consolmonio

1181
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:37,460
to go to the Space Observatory because I had been studying about the

1182
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,540
the space research.

1183
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:43,100
And I said, does the Vatican have like a lot of space documents,

1184
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,220
you know, documents about space?

1185
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,420
And he said, every single thing that the Vatican does and they and we do,

1186
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:51,620
he said, comes to where I live, which is at the Space Observatory.

1187
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,300
And we have a scholars residence and you're welcome to stay

1188
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,500
for as long as you want.

1189
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,900
You have full access to the Space Observatory Archive.

1190
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:02,020
And what is it like? It's great.

1191
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,180
It's great. Describe it to me.

1192
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:06,260
OK. Well, for me, it's great. Right.

1193
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,420
Many people may think, oh, how boring. Right.

1194
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:12,900
But original Kepler's and Copernicus's

1195
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,300
and, you know, every single thing that people, scientists

1196
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:21,580
from twelve hundred, thirteen hundred on up thought about space

1197
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:26,020
and about magnetism and propulsion and things like that.

1198
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,260
It's all there, every one of them.

1199
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,900
And so you go in there and we we had full access to it.

1200
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,180
How does the Vatican have that?

1201
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,660
Well, the Vatican would have it.

1202
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:39,140
So because, you know, who was doing this five hundred years ago?

1203
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,060
There was no United States. Right.

1204
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,460
So, of course, they're going to have it.

1205
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,380
They also have an amazing meteorite collection.

1206
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,300
They have a lot of really cool things there.

1207
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,780
And they're again, they're these monks, they're astrophysicist monks.

1208
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,740
And they're just hanging out there.

1209
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,700
They've got the best lattes, by the way.

1210
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,180
Italians. Yeah. They know how to eat.

1211
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:03,820
My experience, though, of the Vatican itself was different than the archive.

1212
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:06,580
And I've actually heard you talk about the Vatican.

1213
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,300
And I agree. Like you said, you're I saw you talking about it.

1214
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,580
And you said, you know, I'm looking around and I see all this stuff.

1215
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:16,540
And they stole it from all these countries.

1216
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:19,020
It was like all this booty, you know, the Vatican is filled with it.

1217
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,620
That was my experience as well.

1218
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:25,020
So when I went, you know, we did all the we did the scholarship, of course.

1219
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,500
But we also did the touristy thing.

1220
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,500
So, you know, we went and looked at all the museum and everything like that.

1221
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:35,260
And everything I saw seemed to me to be like, you know, colonization,

1222
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,900
you know, the colonization of these people and taking their stuff

1223
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,340
and the colonization of these people and taking their stuff.

1224
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,100
And they have it all there.

1225
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,820
And when you're inside the Vatican, by the way,

1226
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,420
it's different than when you're outside of it, because, you know,

1227
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:52,380
when you're outside of it, there are those guys that that the Swiss guards.

1228
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:57,180
Well, those guys are militia when you go inside and they're everywhere.

1229
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:03,660
The thing that fascinated me about it was the there's just the volume.

1230
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,300
Yeah, the volume.

1231
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,540
It's like they're hoarders for insane art. Yeah.

1232
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,980
I mean, there's stuff that should be in its own room.

1233
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:15,700
And it's just stacked next to other stuff that also should be in its own room.

1234
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:20,020
It's almost like they don't have enough space for all the stuff that they have.

1235
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,860
That's what it seems like. Yeah.

1236
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,300
It's it's well, it's kind of like this place.

1237
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,380
If you see our stack of art that we have out there,

1238
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,740
I have like stuff that I need to put on the walls.

1239
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,900
It's just like too much of it because so many people send me cool shit.

1240
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,060
This is such an awesome studio.

1241
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:37,140
It reminded me immediately when I walked into it, I was like, OK,

1242
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,540
I want to take photos of everything, but I wouldn't.

1243
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:42,860
I didn't. But I did want to. Well, you can. It's OK.

1244
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,020
Yeah, it's just art.

1245
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,780
It's amazing. You have some really amazing stuff. Thank you.

1246
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:49,140
Yeah, it's cool.

1247
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,940
It's cool to be connected to so many fascinating artists that send me stuff

1248
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:56,580
or that I buy their stuff like, you know, I bought the Hendrix painting.

1249
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,820
There's the thing about the Vatican.

1250
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:03,220
Well, I got very fortunate that we had a professor

1251
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,860
that took us on a tour and my children were pretty young at the time.

1252
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:11,220
And when we went, we were outside

1253
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:15,500
in the this courtyard area and there's where the pine cone is.

1254
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:20,060
And he said, do you know the significance of the pine cone?

1255
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,060
And I said, does it represent the pineal gland?

1256
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,900
And he said, yes.

1257
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,580
And so he got so excited.

1258
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:30,140
Yeah, that's why it's also in the pope's staff.

1259
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,300
If you look at the staff that the pope carries,

1260
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,900
the staff has a pine.

1261
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,900
See if you get a photo of the staff, the pope cares.

1262
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:40,300
There's a pine cone in the center of it, the pine cone, which is

1263
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:46,020
and it's depicted in many, many ancient pieces of art,

1264
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,300
religious art, and it represents the pineal gland

1265
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:52,620
because it's similar in appearance to a pine cone.

1266
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:57,020
And so this pine cone, which also, I'm sure, probably represents

1267
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:00,660
the Fibonacci sequence, which also represents itself in the pine cone.

1268
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:05,340
And that that's the seed of the soul.

1269
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:08,100
That's where DMT is made.

1270
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,700
This might be the gateway place.

1271
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:13,540
Yeah, it's well, the reason why they have an immense pine cone.

1272
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,660
I mean, that's not an accident.

1273
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:17,380
No, of course not. No, that's.

1274
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,020
So here it is. Fascinating.

1275
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,660
So he has it in his staff.

1276
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:25,620
And that massive pine cone that is the sculpture at the Vatican,

1277
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:28,220
that that's what that is.

1278
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:32,340
That that that is it's representative of the pineal gland.

1279
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,260
And this is what this professor was telling me.

1280
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:37,380
And look, you see it there in that ancient Mesopotamian art.

1281
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:42,220
It's probably Sumerian with that god that has that.

1282
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:44,700
I mean, that's the Anunnaki carried that thing.

1283
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,380
And then the fact that they're holding it specifically,

1284
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,300
that they're telling you, like, this is what this is what's up.

1285
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,260
This is this is the connection.

1286
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,940
This is the connection to the gods.

1287
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,940
Did you guess this?

1288
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,940
Well, I knew that the pineal gland looked like a pine cone.

1289
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,180
And so when he asked you, you just knew this?

1290
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,900
Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

1291
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:07,780
Well, I'd already had a lot of experiences with DMT.

1292
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,340
Right. So I already knew.

1293
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:14,260
I knew there was there's an a realm accessible

1294
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:19,540
to anybody that gets in contact with that stuff that is beyond imagination.

1295
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,180
It is more real than reality.

1296
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,580
And when you go there, you've been there before.

1297
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:31,580
With the most bizarre feeling about it is this terrifying fear while it's happening

1298
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:35,300
and then incredible peace when you get in there and a recognition like,

1299
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,980
oh, I know this place.

1300
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,980
I've been here. I'm here all the time.

1301
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:40,900
I know these things.

1302
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:44,300
I know these beings, these beings are they're they're truth.

1303
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,260
They're they're something from somewhere else,

1304
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,580
somewhere that's probably around us all the time.

1305
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,700
That's influencing us all the time.

1306
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,820
I know a lot of people have had very negative experiences,

1307
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:02,740
like horrific experiences of demons and and negative encounters.

1308
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:05,820
I've had none of a no negative experiences like that.

1309
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:10,580
My my experiences are all in these very enlightened,

1310
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:13,860
bizarre creatures that contact you.

1311
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:17,100
And they seem to know, like, what's wrong with me?

1312
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,100
Like right away.

1313
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:23,100
And they seem to like also work on you like there's this bizarre feeling like

1314
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,220
they're like, let me get in there and fix your fucking wires.

1315
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:28,740
Well, that, of course, sounds like the abduction experience.

1316
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:33,020
Yes, very, very, very similar to the abduction experience.

1317
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,460
I think they're all connected. I really do.

1318
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,300
I think that's why.

1319
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,140
I mean, I know you're saying that some of them do happen during the day.

1320
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,100
I'm sure I'm sure some of them happen during the day.

1321
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,420
Most of them happen at night.

1322
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:46,820
The vast majority of them happen during what people are sleeping.

1323
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:47,580
That's true.

1324
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:50,940
And that seems to be completely connected to that.

1325
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,500
It's the only explanation that makes sense to me

1326
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,380
other than an actual, you know, like, you know,

1327
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:01,460
Hollywood style UFO landing and then come and get you.

1328
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,940
And which seems so theatrical.

1329
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:08,260
I think the reality is far more bizarre than that.

1330
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:14,060
I think that is that's one of the things that McKenna said about DMT

1331
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,180
and also about mushrooms.

1332
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:20,220
Terrence McKenna said that they show you themselves

1333
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,780
in that way to comfort you

1334
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:27,620
because the reality of what they are would be too much for you to handle.

1335
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:32,180
And that what you're seeing, even though it's mind blowing,

1336
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:36,380
it's just a tiny little piece of what it actually is.

1337
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:42,820
So when I'm at the Vatican and I see this pine cone, I'm going, OK,

1338
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:47,300
so there's this recognition that this connection to God,

1339
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:51,060
this connection to this higher experience, this higher power.

1340
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,140
It's available inside of us.

1341
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,340
It's there's some there's a gateway, and that's the gateway.

1342
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:00,220
That pine cone is the gateway.

1343
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,020
That's amazing.

1344
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:06,220
And, you know, my parish priest, actually, about a year ago,

1345
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:09,100
gave me a little pine cone, a little gold pine cone,

1346
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:11,940
and I put it on my bag.

1347
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:14,860
And I didn't know this, actually.

1348
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:20,420
And as I came here to Austin, it fell off in the airport.

1349
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,260
And it's not gold or anything, but it looks gold and it fell off

1350
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:25,300
and it kind of went away.

1351
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,460
And it would be I thought, maybe I should just let it go.

1352
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:32,420
And then I looked at it and I was like, no, that's really important

1353
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,140
for some reason.

1354
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:35,300
So I picked it up and put it back in the bag.

1355
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,580
That's why I know.

1356
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:41,060
Yeah, it's a strange representation of what

1357
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:45,140
I mean, it's it's it's an icon of this thing,

1358
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:48,700
whatever this thing is that's inside of us, that is this gateway.

1359
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:52,020
And it must have been that Plato in his school was basically

1360
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:56,940
they were basically trying to make the body healthy enough for people to,

1361
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:00,740
you know, access through this, which is a type of mind.

1362
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,180
Like he didn't call it intellectual.

1363
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,260
He had he had another word for it.

1364
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,580
They have like Greeks.

1365
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:10,260
They have different words for knowledge.

1366
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,300
Right. So gnosis.

1367
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,900
And, you know, so this was a form of the dialectic,

1368
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,260
which was a certain type of knowledge, a certain type of knowing.

1369
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,300
It wasn't like mathematical knowing.

1370
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,820
So this must be this type of thing.

1371
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:25,660
I'm thinking because, you know, Plato's Republic actually went

1372
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:28,460
and influenced Christians in early Christianity.

1373
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:34,100
So this idea seems to not be just specifically Christian.

1374
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:38,100
As you say, you saw, you know, we saw some photos of Egyptians,

1375
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:39,340
you know, with. Yes.

1376
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,460
Fascinating. All throughout history.

1377
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:44,260
And then all throughout history, the use of psychedelics.

1378
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:47,140
I'm sure you're aware of Brian Murorescu's work.

1379
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,180
Oh, yeah, I know him. Yeah. Yeah.

1380
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:52,980
So that whole thing, the Illusenian mysteries.

1381
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,260
That's right. Yeah. That was all about that.

1382
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,020
That's right.

1383
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,780
Are you aware of Maria Sabina? Yes. Yes.

1384
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:04,180
OK, so when I was young, I learned about her

1385
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:11,140
and and how, you know, she worked with psilocybin to heal people.

1386
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,500
And when she died, I think it was in the 1980s,

1387
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:16,300
the president of Mexico announced it.

1388
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:19,700
So she was actually so in that culture, it was well known that

1389
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:23,180
and she called the psilocybin of the mushrooms little saints.

1390
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,940
Did you ever read John Marco Allegro's work?

1391
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,500
No, I haven't. Do you know of it?

1392
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,540
No, I probably have read it.

1393
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:33,420
You know, I think I've read a lot of books.

1394
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,220
So I may have just forgotten.

1395
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,740
John Marco Allegro was an ordained minister

1396
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,460
who became an agnostic when he started studying theology.

1397
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:46,580
And he was one of the people that was studying the Dead Sea Scrolls.

1398
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,540
And he studied the Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 years.

1399
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,420
And he wrote The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross.

1400
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,500
OK, yes, I do know that book. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1401
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,500
And then he wrote

1402
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:00,580
that one got I think he got bought out by the Catholic Church.

1403
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,900
And you can get old copies of it.

1404
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,260
But then it was just re-released a few years back.

1405
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:11,660
But the then he wrote something in the Christian myth.

1406
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:12,940
I forget what it was.

1407
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:14,460
Sacred Mushroom and the Christian.

1408
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:15,860
Sacred Mushroom and the Cross.

1409
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,980
And then there was another one he wrote that he published

1410
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:22,740
after that other one was bought out that you can that's readily available.

1411
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:27,220
But this guy studied the Dead Sea Scrolls,

1412
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:31,020
which is the oldest version of the Bible that we know of written in Aramaic.

1413
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:36,380
And the Dead Sea Scrolls is a particularly meticulous transcription.

1414
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,980
The way they had to transcribe this is very bizarre

1415
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,580
because it's written on parchment, which is animal skin.

1416
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:46,500
So they had to do DNA tests on the various pieces of parchment

1417
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,860
to make sure that they came from the same piece,

1418
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,780
because the idea that they'd be from different cows.

1419
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:55,020
So they take this parchment skin, they they're laying it out.

1420
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:58,140
They do DNA tests on it to make sure it's all from the same.

1421
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,900
And then they try to piece together what it is.

1422
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,140
And not all of it is even available.

1423
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:05,020
Jamie, check me that out behind you. Thank you.

1424
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:12,500
And his conclusion after all of this, the summary of his conclusion

1425
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:17,060
was the entire Christian religion was all about psychedelic experiences

1426
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:21,860
and fertility rituals, and that this was what all these stories really meant.

1427
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:26,700
And he even connected the word for Christ to an ancient Sumerian word,

1428
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:30,060
which meant a mushroom covered in God's semen.

1429
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:33,860
And that these ancient people believed that when it rained,

1430
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:37,500
it was God having an orgasm on the earth and that these mushrooms,

1431
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:41,940
which if you ever seen mushrooms appear after the rain, they come up out of nowhere.

1432
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,700
Yeah. And that these mushrooms, these people would eat them

1433
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:49,620
and they would experience God and that they wrote these things down.

1434
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:53,180
And first it was an oral tradition for who knows how long.

1435
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:54,500
And then they wrote them down.

1436
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:59,180
And then, you know, it gets transcribed to Greek and Latin and English.

1437
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,980
And it's all. And a lot is missing out of those translations.

1438
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:05,580
A lot of is missing even from the ancient Hebrew translation,

1439
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:09,260
because the words in ancient Hebrew had numerical value.

1440
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,580
Yes, that's true.

1441
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:15,300
Which is it's a very complicated language where like the word love

1442
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,900
and the word God have the same numerical value.

1443
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:21,140
And the numerical value in words is very important

1444
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:24,620
to what the meaning of these sentences and what these phrases meant.

1445
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:26,980
And we lose a lot of that.

1446
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:30,820
We also lose people's gender through these translations.

1447
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:35,460
So some early apostles are called who are women are called men

1448
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,860
in the translation from Greek to Latin.

1449
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:44,020
So I'm aware of this idea and of course, Brian's work as well.

1450
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,700
And in my field, that's that's one.

1451
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:50,620
We have categories for, you know, obviously, you know, like medicine,

1452
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:53,020
you know, has different categories.

1453
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:57,540
And that's one category is entheogens and different types of religions.

1454
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:00,980
So the early Christian church, I would say that not all.

1455
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:05,580
I don't agree that all of Christian tradition is is this.

1456
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,620
I would say that there definitely is a lot of it.

1457
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:12,580
But there are also other types of, you know, Christian traditions.

1458
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,660
I mean, when I look at the Jesus movement in the first century,

1459
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:19,060
it to me looks like a philosophical school like Plato.

1460
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:22,180
And, you know, Plato did the mysteries, you know, and

1461
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:26,780
but I don't know if I think Jesus was part of an Ascene movement

1462
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:28,980
like the John the Baptist is Jewish.

1463
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:33,020
He's out in the desert and, you know, they're practicing these water rights.

1464
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:37,660
And they basically are, you know, they have their own community.

1465
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:41,660
And he looked like he was part of he had been baptized into this community.

1466
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:45,300
So the Jews at the in the first century are just trying to survive

1467
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:48,380
because Rome is killing them and destroying.

1468
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,140
They're going to destroy their temple.

1469
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:54,220
So so a lot of these communities, you know, those.

1470
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:56,140
So that's one interpretation.

1471
01:19:56,140 --> 01:20:00,700
And I'm not discounting that that's correct for those those traditions.

1472
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:03,460
But there are other traditions that are not.

1473
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,900
They're not filled with entheogens and things like that.

1474
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,700
I'm just letting just being accurate.

1475
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,980
That's all I could do. I'm sure there's a lot.

1476
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,260
I mean, yeah, it was super diverse today.

1477
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,340
Look at how diverse it is.

1478
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:20,060
So I think there are thousands of well, there are thousands

1479
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:24,100
of Protestant denominations of, you know, and there's Catholicism.

1480
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:27,340
And, you know, so we have so many different and even Catholics

1481
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,340
don't even know what they're supposed to believe.

1482
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:32,460
So some here believe this, some over here believe that

1483
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,940
they have the same mass that they go to.

1484
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,700
But their belief structures are different.

1485
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:43,140
So that leads us to one of the most fascinating interpretations

1486
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:46,300
of what we're experiencing collectively

1487
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:50,860
when it comes to this UFO, UAP, whatever it is, phenomenon

1488
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:54,220
that this is not.

1489
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:57,540
A thing from another planet that comes on a spaceship

1490
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:00,540
and lands here to show us how to do things correctly,

1491
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:05,300
but that they've always been here and that they are the things

1492
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:10,300
that are being described in Ezekiel, that they they are

1493
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:15,660
a phenomenon that is both here and not here at the same time,

1494
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:21,420
that it's your you are literally dealing with angels and demons.

1495
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:26,900
That this is that this this phenomenon is connected

1496
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,780
to these ancient stories of religion.

1497
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:34,660
And it's it's not as simple as other beings like us

1498
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:37,460
from somewhere else. OK.

1499
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:41,060
Yeah. So so I can respond to that.

1500
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:46,580
All right. So because you said a huge amount of information in there.

1501
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:50,300
And I'm going to parse out some of that

1502
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:54,300
and tell you just about what I what I think.

1503
01:21:55,020 --> 01:22:00,060
So part of why I continued to study this was that I saw

1504
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:04,260
that the historical record included a lot of these events.

1505
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:08,380
And these events were weird back then, just like they're weird today. Right.

1506
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,740
And when you look at these events back in that time period,

1507
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:14,060
you also see a common pattern that happens today.

1508
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:15,740
And what is that pattern?

1509
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:18,780
That pattern is is that, you know, let's take

1510
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,860
St. Francis of Assisi stigmata.

1511
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:24,940
I don't know if you want to show, you know. Sure.

1512
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,620
So if you look at his stigmata, where it looks like he's being,

1513
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:31,060
you know, basically radiated by UFO.

1514
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:33,260
That's what my students say when they go

1515
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:35,980
and they see this in the Louvre and such.

1516
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:42,340
If you look at his primary sources for that, this happens in the 1200s.

1517
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,700
And you look at what?

1518
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,660
Yeah. So that.

1519
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:50,860
So here you see St. Francis, but also over here on the right,

1520
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:52,620
you see his friend, Brother Leo.

1521
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:56,020
Brother Leo actually at the time is probably 15 or something like that.

1522
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:57,500
He's 15. Yeah, he's really young.

1523
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,460
Hard life back then. Dude looks 80.

1524
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,540
Well, he's he's doesn't actually look like that.

1525
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:03,900
So the art. Yeah.

1526
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:08,100
So the artists actually are not getting at the primary sources.

1527
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:11,140
And that's what similar similar things are happening today.

1528
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:16,340
So the representations that we get in the media don't look at all like an abduction.

1529
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,300
They don't look at all what people experience.

1530
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,620
And so what I did was I went through a lot of the primary source materials

1531
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:27,460
for Teresa of Avila has a weird experience that looks like an abduction.

1532
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,660
But they look beautiful.

1533
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:30,860
They're domesticated.

1534
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:34,740
They're made to look a lot more happy or something like that.

1535
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:37,660
And I think part of the reason for that, I don't think it's intentional.

1536
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,820
I think because it's traumatic.

1537
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:43,700
I think because once you recognize the people themselves are traumatized

1538
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:46,140
by this in both good and bad ways.

1539
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,620
OK, so this experience is still happening.

1540
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:55,580
To call it angels and demons is is is accurate, except for one part.

1541
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:58,500
And because there are bad things that happen, sometimes people get hurt.

1542
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,980
Francis died from that wound or he died from wounds

1543
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:06,420
that, you know, were bleeding until.

1544
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,780
So when he had this experience until he died, which was about a year and a half later,

1545
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:15,820
they tried to keep it silent in his monastery because they were

1546
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:19,740
they didn't know what happened to him and they were horrified by it.

1547
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:23,060
OK. And so until he died, they didn't actually tell anybody.

1548
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:26,180
So he kept it between him, Brother Leo and probably another monk.

1549
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:30,700
So there's this idea of shame almost, you know, this is like, you know, shameful.

1550
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:36,700
But also this idea that since bad things happen

1551
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:39,940
and that's why people say, well, you know, demonic or something like that.

1552
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:43,740
And people do experience these things in different ways.

1553
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,460
And they still do. They still do.

1554
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:47,940
But what should we call it?

1555
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:52,340
Should we then use the terminology of people from 100 years ago

1556
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:54,260
and call it angels and demons?

1557
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,140
I don't think we should.

1558
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:59,700
I think that what we have to do is we have to take case by case, look at patterns

1559
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:03,140
and maybe just try to proceed with different language,

1560
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:06,620
because some of the things really interesting, if you do look at, say,

1561
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:11,140
experiences that Catholics have, say, in the 1960s that have been videotaped.

1562
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:15,180
OK, so Virgin Mary experiences where the Virgin Mary appears.

1563
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,940
And she reads people's minds as she does.

1564
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:21,740
You know, she's doing these kinds of things, levitating people together.

1565
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:28,020
If you put physics on that case, physicists on that case,

1566
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,940
and if you take, you know, the work of those people who are working at,

1567
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:34,020
I think it's the University of Washington, where they're doing MRI imaging

1568
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:36,620
of what people are thinking and they're able to replicate it.

1569
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:39,780
So if they're looking at a Van Gogh painting, they can replicate that.

1570
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,860
Well, this looks like a technology.

1571
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:45,540
So that's what I'm trying to say, is that there's something going on

1572
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:48,460
that could possibly be different.

1573
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:50,540
And we need different language for it.

1574
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:53,860
And I think we're at the very beginning, just like doing this stuff with DMT,

1575
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:59,260
we're at the very beginning of learning about this this other world.

1576
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:04,340
You know, another thing that's fascinating about ancient religious art is the halo.

1577
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:07,700
Yeah. Have you ever seen the earlier

1578
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:10,540
depictions of the halo where it looks like a mushroom cap?

1579
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:16,620
That is wild, because it seems to be that

1580
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:22,580
what they're trying to say is that this person is under the influence of the entheogens.

1581
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:26,100
I mean, it's a literal representation of a mushroom cap.

1582
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:30,620
It changes over time and over history, and it becomes different.

1583
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,780
And it eventually becomes like a hula hoop around your head.

1584
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:36,860
But the earlier versions all look like a mushroom cap.

1585
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,940
They have the lines of the mushroom cap.

1586
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:41,180
Jesus is depicted there.

1587
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:46,260
The enlightened ones, the saints, the the religious figures

1588
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:51,620
that are of prominence, they all have that mushroom cap experience behind their head.

1589
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:54,900
Even the Buddha, that photo of the Buddha there with the halo.

1590
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:58,380
Click on that. The statue. Yeah. Even that.

1591
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:06,220
I mean, they they all have this thing behind them, which you could represent.

1592
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:10,620
I mean, you could interpret as these people are under the influence.

1593
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:18,460
I would OK. I agree with you that their mushrooms are seen in Catholic churches

1594
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:24,500
in near Guatemala, down in Mexico and things like that in Laid.

1595
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:31,740
But I would have to suggest that there might be more going on.

1596
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,140
So I'm going to push back on your interpretation,

1597
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:38,540
although I'm not going to say that psilocybin and mushrooms are

1598
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:43,780
aren't in, you know, aren't part of that, that iconography.

1599
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:48,620
I would say that a lot of the iconography is going to be something about

1600
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:54,660
the the light that emanates from people who are accessing these realms.

1601
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:59,740
And I say that because there are I've read so many reports

1602
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:04,260
and they're not I think that if some of the monks and nuns who report

1603
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,820
being lit up right in their cells and things like that,

1604
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:10,140
if they were doing psilocybin, if they were doing mushrooms,

1605
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:10,940
they would have said so.

1606
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:13,020
They would have written it because they write a lot.

1607
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,940
So the Catholics have immense records.

1608
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:17,500
You know, they they took good notes.

1609
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,540
Well, I don't think it's the only way to do it.

1610
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:24,700
Oh, I know. I was I mean, I think it's something that they discovered.

1611
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,220
Oh, for sure. I think it's a part of it.

1612
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:28,860
I do. Yeah, I think that.

1613
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:34,540
But so the magnetism of the of what's, you know, this kind of light

1614
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:39,140
that's happening, you can see that even in the shroud of Turin,

1615
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:44,380
which is, by the way, an anomalous artifact that scientists have looked at.

1616
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:46,380
Even atheist scientists have looked at it.

1617
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:52,980
And it appears to be some type of imprint from radiation onto a cloth.

1618
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:58,220
So so I think we're talking about forms of light as well.

1619
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:01,140
But the shroud of Turin is only 500 years old.

1620
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:03,740
Well, not necessarily. So really? Yeah.

1621
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:06,900
So when you so there are certain parts of it

1622
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:10,020
that could have been repaired that are 500 years old.

1623
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:14,260
So the problem is there is a whole department of this.

1624
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,660
You should get this priest on here on here, by the way.

1625
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:18,940
You'd have a really good discussion with him.

1626
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:22,580
He's an expert on the shroud of Turin, and he just came out with new research

1627
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:25,140
that's been done about six months ago.

1628
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:29,740
And there's a whole department in the Vatican just for doing

1629
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:31,460
research on the shroud of Turin.

1630
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,300
So that's so it's not necessarily just 500 years old.

1631
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,580
That there are different parts of it.

1632
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:40,900
You know how you were talking about the parchment is the shroud of Turin real

1633
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:45,900
after all 1988 report wrote off the relic as a medieval fake.

1634
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,540
But now the science seems to be turning.

1635
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,700
Could it have been a miracle all along?

1636
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,780
Fascinating. OK.

1637
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,700
Let's see what's other than just that.

1638
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,540
I mean, 170 peer reviewed academic papers on the shroud

1639
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:02,540
have been published in scientific and archaeological journals around the world.

1640
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:05,660
Despite all the attention, there's little consensus to just how ancient

1641
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:09,540
this ancient linen really is or what it actually shows.

1642
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,340
The record places the shroud in.

1643
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:16,380
How do you say that? Lyra Lyra Lyra?

1644
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:21,420
Northern France for four years until 1357,

1645
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:26,060
the Alpine town of Shambri from 1502 to 1578, where it was damaged by fire

1646
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:29,620
before being passed to the Dukes of Savoy in 1578.

1647
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:32,180
The Savoy's moved to their capital Turin.

1648
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:35,780
And aside from periods of wartime, evacuation has stayed in the world

1649
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,540
chapel of San Giovanni Battista Cathedral ever since.

1650
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:42,260
Consensus has been the shroud's history.

1651
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:44,620
Pre 1300 will never be established.

1652
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:49,420
And yet the French historian Jean-Christine Petit Petit Petit feels.

1653
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,260
How do you say that? Petit few.

1654
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:54,420
Petit feel has recently published a seriously

1655
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:58,740
reviewed 400 page analysis of all the archaeological and scientific studies

1656
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:03,100
so far, and in Italy, the peer reviewed findings of a specialist X-ray study

1657
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:08,100
by a team of physicists indicate that the fabric is potentially up to 2000 years old.

1658
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:11,540
There are now six studies which challenge the idea that Turin

1659
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:15,380
shroud has nothing more than a cunning piece of medieval trickery.

1660
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:19,140
Could it be something more? The cloth, which has been the object

1661
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:22,100
of mass veneration by Catholic faithful for centuries,

1662
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,340
was acquired by a French knight.

1663
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:29,460
Geoffroy de Charmé Charney Charney.

1664
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:30,940
How do you say that?

1665
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:33,700
I would just say Charney.

1666
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:37,980
I I'm not quite sure who deposited in the monastery

1667
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:43,020
in Lyrae, about 130 miles east of Paris in 1353.

1668
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,540
This is a time of unparalleled relic mongering and forgery.

1669
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:49,060
And according to the American archaeologist William Mecham,

1670
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:52,060
the shroud was most like most likely arrived in Europe,

1671
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:55,820
along with many other relics looted from churches and monasteries during the crusades.

1672
01:31:56,140 --> 01:32:00,540
Research in 2015 reported in the analysis

1673
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:04,700
and identification of dust and pollen samples extracted by an adhesive,

1674
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:09,500
which suggested that the shroud may have undergone a journey from the ancient

1675
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:14,420
Near East after the shot sack of can't can't stop it, can't stop.

1676
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:15,700
I can never say his name.

1677
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,180
I know I can never say it.

1678
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:19,660
Constantinople in 1204.

1679
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:23,580
Still, were it not for the poignant image image of its folds,

1680
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:29,420
chances are it would have disappeared into the mores of other spurious relics

1681
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:32,940
kept in thousands of churches all over Western Europe.

1682
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:36,340
And Petitfeuille's latest book.

1683
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,900
How do you say it? Petitfeuille?

1684
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:42,820
I'm not actually Petitfeuille is what I would say, but

1685
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:49,700
Le Saint Soiré de Turin, Timon de la Passion de la Jesus Christ,

1686
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:52,940
the Holy Shroud of Turin, witness to the passion of Jesus Christ.

1687
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:55,780
He examines more than 100 years of historical, archaeological

1688
01:32:56,060 --> 01:33:00,500
and scientific research. His conclusion, the cloth has all the characteristics

1689
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:04,620
of authenticity. Hmm. Interesting.

1690
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:08,020
Interesting. Oh, go back.

1691
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,100
OK, even those who reject the idea

1692
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:14,900
the shroud is a 2000 year old, how do you say that word?

1693
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:19,980
Sepulchral, sepulchral cloth, sepulchral cloth,

1694
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:24,380
he writes, are unable to explain the imprint of the body.

1695
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:28,380
Adversaries of the authenticity of the shroud come up against an enigma

1696
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:33,180
that this one cannot be the work of a counterfeiter because to make

1697
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:37,380
such an image would have required unknown scientific knowledge

1698
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:39,340
in the Middle Ages.

1699
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,660
The image is not a painting, no trace of brushstrokes,

1700
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:46,100
no outline has been observed even under electron microscope.

1701
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:51,460
We must exclude the hypothesis of a smear, the application of a base relief

1702
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:55,540
of wood or marble or a metal statue heated and placed on the cloth.

1703
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:59,060
It was the Catholic Church itself unwittingly sparked

1704
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:03,020
what would become a global obsession with the shroud in 1898

1705
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:07,460
when it gave the green light to a rare public exhibition of the cloth.

1706
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:11,660
So Condeau Pia, an amateur, became the first to photograph

1707
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:16,820
the linen's strange sepia shadows and the high contrast

1708
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:21,540
created by black and white photography enhanced by blurry stains.

1709
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:24,740
When Pia went to the darkroom to check his plates,

1710
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:27,940
he was startled to see that the negatives revealed a haunting,

1711
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:32,340
perfectly proportional facial image of a serene bearded man

1712
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:36,460
and the imprint of a body tortured by what appears to be flogging,

1713
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:38,260
lacerations and puncture wounds.

1714
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:41,660
Can we see an actual image of what the cloth is?

1715
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:43,100
Is that the actual image?

1716
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,140
Can you click on that, Jamie, make it large?

1717
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:48,540
Wow, how bizarre. Where are the puncture wounds?

1718
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:50,860
Is that what we're seeing in his stomach area?

1719
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:54,260
Yeah, right.

1720
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:56,460
And that is where they didn't go through the hands.

1721
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:58,660
They did go through the wrists when they crucified people.

1722
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,420
And then there also appears to be something in his stomach.

1723
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:04,340
Like, if you look above his right arm, right above the wrist,

1724
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:08,820
that that that looks like a wound, which is what is detailed in the Bible.

1725
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:11,540
Yeah. Very strange.

1726
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:16,660
Yeah. So that really is 2000, but very bizarre.

1727
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,860
Very bizarre.

1728
01:35:20,740 --> 01:35:21,740
Hmm.

1729
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:25,380
Hmm. Yeah.

1730
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:27,580
You ever hear of the Second Coming Project?

1731
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,340
No. Second.

1732
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:30,580
I used to have a joke about it.

1733
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:35,100
Second Coming Project was a group of people that were

1734
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:37,380
it was either a troll.

1735
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:40,100
They were joking around or they were serious about it,

1736
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:46,300
where they wanted to obtain DNA from the Shroud of Turin and clone Jesus.

1737
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:48,620
And that's how I have heard about this.

1738
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:51,020
That's right. That's right. That's hilarious. Yeah.

1739
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:53,620
Wow. That would be so weird.

1740
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:56,620
Imagine that's how they do it.

1741
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:58,900
That would be so amazing.

1742
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:02,140
Yeah, that mean that would kind of I mean, that wouldn't

1743
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:06,540
that wouldn't create immaculate conception, but it kind of would.

1744
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:08,300
It seems like it.

1745
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:13,340
I mean, it's not birthed from a virgin, but it's similar in that regard.

1746
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:16,500
But that's one of the things that I had a conversation with Taylor

1747
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:17,260
Sheridan the other day.

1748
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:19,820
We're discussing, like, what is the Bible trying to say

1749
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,660
when it describes certain things?

1750
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:24,540
But in the beginning, there was light and how the, you know,

1751
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:28,260
God created everything in six days, like, God, doesn't that sound like the Big Bang?

1752
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,700
Like told through the telephone? I think so.

1753
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:35,020
Yeah. So the Catholic Church and science go together.

1754
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:38,140
Like even Catholics can believe in evolution.

1755
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:40,500
They don't generally know that they believe in evolution.

1756
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:44,020
It's just theistic evolution. Right. That's all. Right.

1757
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:45,460
And most Catholics don't know that.

1758
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:46,540
And I don't know why.

1759
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:49,620
But Catholics, yeah, we're scientific.

1760
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:52,940
I've been messing around with this idea over the last few years

1761
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:55,380
that the universe itself is God.

1762
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,780
I think, yeah, I mean,

1763
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:00,020
this idea that, like, God created the universe.

1764
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,540
Yeah. Maybe it is God.

1765
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:07,380
I mean, if you want to talk about something that's all powerful,

1766
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:10,380
beyond comprehension, is

1767
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:15,020
responsible for every single thing

1768
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:18,420
in the cosmos, it is the universe

1769
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:22,460
that that all has some sort of law

1770
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:24,860
that keeps it together and intelligence.

1771
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:27,260
Yes. Yeah. And it's completely mysterious.

1772
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:28,820
One of the things you talked about in your book,

1773
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:30,980
that's really fascinating, was the Apollo 10

1774
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:33,420
when they were hearing space music. Yeah.

1775
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:34,700
And they didn't want to talk about it.

1776
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:36,940
No, they didn't. What did they describe it like?

1777
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:41,380
You can hear it actually online. Really? Yeah. Let's hear it.

1778
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:45,300
Apollo 10 space music. Let's fucking go.

1779
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:49,100
Maybe this would be my new workout music.

1780
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:55,260
Space music. I didn't know it really freaked them out.

1781
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:57,180
I would imagine. Dr.

1782
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:59,340
Aya Whiteley, she's a space psychologist.

1783
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:01,860
She's the one who told me about it and said, you should put this

1784
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:05,460
as a quote before my information, because she talked about how

1785
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:08,380
they didn't want to report it because it was so weird.

1786
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:11,180
And that's the whole idea of this two data set.

1787
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:13,980
There are two data sets for UFO reporting.

1788
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:16,900
Like pilots will see stuff, but they won't report it. Right.

1789
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:19,500
Or they'll see stuff and they'll report stuff, but they won't.

1790
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:23,380
Let's listen, I guess. Here we go.

1791
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:25,980
You want some more brownies? No.

1792
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:35,220
That music even sounds outer spacey, doesn't it?

1793
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:37,300
Do you hear that whistling sound?

1794
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:47,820
Yeah, it sounds like, you know, outer space type music.

1795
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:52,020
Hey, Tom, is your insulation all burned off here on the front side

1796
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,580
of your window over here right now?

1797
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:55,580
Yeah.

1798
01:38:57,740 --> 01:38:58,740
Mine's all burned off.

1799
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:01,860
Heading out here. Where are you, John?

1800
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:15,540
You might get burst through the field.

1801
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:18,060
You might get burst through the features.

1802
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:19,740
You know, someone might put you some grape juice.

1803
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:24,620
This goes on for five minutes. I don't know.

1804
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,100
So it's just that sound.

1805
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,900
I think it's the sound. There are two tones.

1806
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:33,220
There's kind of like this high pitch sound and then that sound. Yeah.

1807
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,940
Yeah. And you're also getting it.

1808
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:46,740
It's a recording from inside.

1809
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:52,540
And obviously, it's not going to sound exactly how they were hearing it.

1810
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,100
This video can't be this.

1811
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:59,420
It's not just video, I think, like stock video of them on the mission.

1812
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,940
Oh, so this is not the video of them experiencing it.

1813
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:05,620
No way. The audio would be recorded separately from this.

1814
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:07,220
And I think someone just mixed this together.

1815
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:08,260
So there's something to look at.

1816
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:11,500
Let's see if there's just a recording of the audio itself without this guy.

1817
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,740
This is the full. This is the one that's a full audio.

1818
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:15,820
I don't know if they're like this is from CBS. I don't know.

1819
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:22,620
Sounds the same.

1820
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:29,060
All right. That that sounds like it.

1821
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:32,940
Wow. Mystery music heard space.

1822
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:37,740
Ooh. What the hell is that?

1823
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:41,500
Yeah. What do they think it is?

1824
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:44,340
Well, what happens now, I don't know what they think it is,

1825
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:47,500
but I do know that they train astronauts for it now to get them.

1826
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:48,460
They have simulation.

1827
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:51,700
So when astronauts go into space, they're not surprised by stuff.

1828
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,740
So this is a common occurrence.

1829
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:55,500
There are so many weird things that happen.

1830
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:58,220
Like one thing that happened to them when they were in space.

1831
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,460
Now, this is getting back to the two data sets.

1832
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:04,380
So they've they've worked their whole lives to go into space.

1833
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:08,740
So they can't indicate that in any way they're mentally unstable.

1834
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,580
So when they go there and they come back, certain things happen.

1835
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:14,980
So one thing that happened was they were seeing like flashes of light

1836
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:16,860
when they came back down to Earth.

1837
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:19,300
And but they wouldn't tell anybody.

1838
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:22,500
And then finally, a bunch of them said, Do you see this flash of light?

1839
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,860
Like when you close your eyes, you see light and everything like that.

1840
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:29,420
And they were they agreed that if they all reported it, they couldn't get fired.

1841
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:30,820
So this is how they were.

1842
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:33,940
They were able to report weird stuff that they saw in space.

1843
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:38,900
Isn't that crazy that exploring the outside of Earth,

1844
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:42,380
you have to be careful about what you say, because people think you're crazy.

1845
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:43,740
That's right. That's right.

1846
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:44,700
And the bizarre.

1847
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:46,540
Well, yeah. So it's these two data sets.

1848
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:49,940
So it happens here when people have, you know, when they see things

1849
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:53,260
and then they have these strange things that happen, they don't they tell

1850
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:56,220
authorities the stuff, OK, yeah, I saw this.

1851
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:58,380
It was unknown. I don't know what it was.

1852
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,860
But then they tell their friends and family.

1853
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:03,500
I actually had this feeling that it was looking at me.

1854
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:04,740
And this is why I think that.

1855
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:07,340
And so they tell their subjective kind of weird things,

1856
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:10,540
you know, to their families and their family friends.

1857
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:13,100
So, yeah, so you get that with astronauts, too.

1858
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:19,940
Who is at the front of the line when it comes to this stuff?

1859
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:22,740
Like, who has been studying this the longest

1860
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:27,260
that has the greatest body of information available

1861
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:31,580
about space and stuff, about the emergent phenomenon

1862
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:34,300
of some sort of contact?

1863
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:38,260
OK, that's such OK.

1864
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:41,420
This is a hard question to answer because there is a person.

1865
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:44,780
But will this person say everything this person knows?

1866
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:47,700
Probably not. OK, so.

1867
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:50,300
But there is an official NASA historian

1868
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:54,860
who, in my opinion, knows way more than he actually writes about.

1869
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:56,740
But he's written a heck of a lot.

1870
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:59,500
And he's and his name is Stephen Dick.

1871
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,820
And what an unfortunate name.

1872
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:04,020
Well, yeah, but it is his name.

1873
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:08,140
And he has an amazing body of work that anybody who's interested

1874
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:09,540
in this should read.

1875
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:12,900
He was also at the very beginning kind of in.

1876
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:17,260
He was part of the initial stages of creating astrobiology and.

1877
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:19,660
Yeah, astrobiology.

1878
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:22,300
And what leads you to believe that he's holding back information?

1879
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:26,220
Well, when I go back and I'm in contact with him

1880
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:28,460
and I when I read what he's written,

1881
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:32,500
I can see that he was at the forefront of looking at this

1882
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:36,020
like AI back like 25 years ago.

1883
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:39,700
He was already talking about it, saying this is this is AI.

1884
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,820
ET is going to be AI and this is why.

1885
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:45,820
And then kind of doing timelines and things like that.

1886
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:50,940
So and also just conversations that I've had with him

1887
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:53,860
that are, you know, basically

1888
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:57,900
correspondences that indicate to me that I think

1889
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:00,580
he probably has some information.

1890
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:03,180
But he, you know, a lot of this is classified right.

1891
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:05,300
And probably for good reason.

1892
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:07,020
What good reason?

1893
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:11,540
I don't know. But yeah.

1894
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:15,060
This is from Wikipedia

1895
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:17,780
on astrobiology that's not this.

1896
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:19,060
Mm hmm.

1897
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:22,900
They argued since the ancient Greeks extraterrestrial life has been a theme

1898
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:26,900
tied to scientific cosmologies, including the ancient

1899
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:33,420
atomist Copernican, Cartesian and the Newtonian worldviews.

1900
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:38,660
Dick argues that from an epistemological point of view,

1901
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:41,940
the methods of astrobiology in the 20th century

1902
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:47,820
are as empirical as in any historical science, such as astronomy or geology.

1903
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:51,580
Dick has also surveyed the field of astrobiology

1904
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:56,100
in critical issues in the history, philosophy and sociology of astrobiology.

1905
01:44:56,780 --> 01:45:01,900
On December 4th, 2013, while holding the NASA Library of Congress

1906
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,460
chair in astrobiology,

1907
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:06,340
Dick testified on astrobiology before the U.S.

1908
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:09,500
House of Representative Committee on Science, Space and Technology,

1909
01:45:09,820 --> 01:45:13,580
arguing that SETI funding should be restored and integrated

1910
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:16,500
with the NASA astrobiology program.

1911
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:19,540
Hmm. Hold on. Go back to that.

1912
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:24,380
This part, the intelligence principle.

1913
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:25,580
Yeah, this is this is it.

1914
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:28,700
This is the thing that he worked on like more than 20 years ago.

1915
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:32,980
Is a hypothetical idea of Dicks in the field of cultural evolution

1916
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:37,580
outlined his 2003 paper, Cultural Evolution, the Post Biological

1917
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,100
Universe and SETI.

1918
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:43,060
The intelligence principle describes a potential binding tendency

1919
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:48,180
among all intelligent societies, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial.

1920
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:52,900
The maintenance, improvement and perpetuation of knowledge and intelligence

1921
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:56,380
is the central driving force of cultural evolution.

1922
01:45:58,060 --> 01:46:02,780
And that, to the extent intelligence can be improved, it will be improved.

1923
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:07,860
It doesn't actually have the next line that that he writes about and says.

1924
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:13,020
And if it's not improved, it will be to the detriment of that society.

1925
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:16,740
Hmm. That certainly seems to be true. Yeah.

1926
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:19,900
Yeah. So that's so the so it's him.

1927
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:22,220
But also, Joe, it's not just him.

1928
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:23,340
There is a group.

1929
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:25,820
They're called the Invisible College, and I'm not going to name who they are.

1930
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:28,460
People can search them and find out their names.

1931
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:32,500
But they're part of this oral tradition and this hidden tradition

1932
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:36,980
that's been at the forefront of doing this type of work for over

1933
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:40,140
50, 60, 70 years. Hmm.

1934
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:46,500
So what has it been like for you to go from a person

1935
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:50,460
that before you visit this crash site, you think this is all nonsense, right?

1936
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:53,940
To where you are now, I haven't written two books about it

1937
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:57,580
and very careful with your words and realizing how

1938
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:01,700
bizarre this is to now having this conversation with me

1939
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:03,700
in front of millions of people.

1940
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:06,500
Like, what has this been like for you?

1941
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:08,940
Yes, it's been life changing.

1942
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:11,820
OK, so that's definitely a fact.

1943
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:15,460
And in the beginning, it was uncomfortable.

1944
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:20,380
But I learned this is where I learned about,

1945
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,580
you know, you're talking about the the penile gland.

1946
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:25,740
And this is how I learned about this access.

1947
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:29,780
And I learned it through communities that are associated with this study.

1948
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:32,140
So I've learned about human potential.

1949
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:36,660
And I think that that's probably what's impacted me more than anything in.

1950
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:40,380
And I also learned about structural evil in societies.

1951
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:43,420
And how has it been for me?

1952
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:47,740
I think it's been great.

1953
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:51,220
Really? Yeah, I mean, I thought about it the other day

1954
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:53,980
because I because there were times when I said, I don't want to do this anymore.

1955
01:47:54,420 --> 01:48:00,100
And I think that I thought, you know, I think the bad times have been worth it.

1956
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:03,820
The scary parts have been worth it.

1957
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:07,660
Because I went into this.

1958
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:10,460
Wanting to know, right?

1959
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:12,220
I'm a professor of religion.

1960
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:13,740
I mean, I want to know.

1961
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:16,620
And I wanted to be a professor of religion since I was 11.

1962
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:19,500
And yeah, and now I am.

1963
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:21,780
That's cool to know what you want to do when you're 11.

1964
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,020
Yeah, it was pretty weird.

1965
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:25,620
But I knew.

1966
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:28,540
And now I feel like I'm getting answers.

1967
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:32,580
And it's not like I know conclusively part of it is that

1968
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:36,940
we're not meant to know is that part of it is that it is a mystery.

1969
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,340
But the but it's a fascinating one.

1970
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:43,220
It's almost as if this for me, you talked about obsession.

1971
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:45,900
It's it's that like I do it in and of itself.

1972
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:48,100
I think it's it's fascinating.

1973
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:51,300
I often struggle with the concept that the human mind

1974
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:53,580
is incapable of grasping the truth,

1975
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:59,140
that even if it was presented to us, we don't have the capability

1976
01:48:59,420 --> 01:49:03,540
to truly incorporate it into our not just worldview,

1977
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:08,700
but universe view, life view, existence view, that it's it's too baffling.

1978
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:10,140
We're not quite ready yet.

1979
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:13,260
It's like showing Australia Pythagoras a cell phone.

1980
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:16,020
Right. Right. What the fuck is this?

1981
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:16,980
Yeah. What is this?

1982
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:18,180
We're not ready for it yet.

1983
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:23,340
And I I really wonder with the emergence of artificial intelligence

1984
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:26,780
and what seems to me at least to be the inevitable

1985
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:31,220
not just incorporation of it into our lives, which has already happened,

1986
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:34,060
but incorporation into it biologically.

1987
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:38,180
I feel like that is a step that we're taking

1988
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:40,100
that seems inevitable.

1989
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:44,140
That seems there is going to be some sort of convergence,

1990
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:48,460
a merging of human consciousness and artificial.

1991
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:52,260
And it's I think artificial intelligence is the wrong term.

1992
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:54,900
I don't think it's artificial at all.

1993
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:58,740
I think it's a type of intelligence that's created by the human being.

1994
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:02,020
And the human being is biologically hindered

1995
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:06,020
by the fact that biological evolution is so slow

1996
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:09,100
and technological evolution is so insanely rapid,

1997
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:12,700
especially if sentient artificial intelligence

1998
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:18,380
becomes capable of creating its own version of artificial intelligence.

1999
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:22,740
And it's not hindered by the biological limitations of the human mind.

2000
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:25,540
You know, I think Elon said it best.

2001
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:29,100
And you talked about in this book that we're the biological bootloader

2002
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:31,700
for artificial intelligence.

2003
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:34,860
I've described it before I heard that that we are

2004
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:39,300
we're a caterpillar that's creating a cocoon

2005
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:41,660
to give birth to the electronic butterfly.

2006
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:47,220
And that this is also what fuels not just innovation, but materialism.

2007
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:50,260
Materialism is inexorably connected to innovation,

2008
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:53,300
because one of the things about materialism is everybody wants

2009
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:56,740
the newest, latest, greatest thing and status is attached to those things.

2010
01:50:56,740 --> 01:51:00,740
We buy new cell phones like my friend had an iPhone.

2011
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:04,700
My friend's hilarious. My friend, Eddie Bravo, he had an iPhone 13

2012
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:07,300
and I go, why did you get 30? Because they gave it to me for free.

2013
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:09,260
And I was like, didn't you want a 15?

2014
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:11,700
He's like, does it do the same thing?

2015
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:12,940
I'm like, it really does.

2016
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:14,580
But I wanted a 15 when it came out.

2017
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:18,580
I have zero difference between my 15 and my 14.

2018
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:20,180
But how to get the 15?

2019
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:22,860
You know, it's like there's something connected to us

2020
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:25,220
that wants the latest, greatest.

2021
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:28,300
And we're connected to this idea of materialism.

2022
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:31,540
And if you looked at the human being as an organism

2023
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:34,860
and you were separate from it and you said, well, what does this thing do?

2024
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:36,980
Well, this thing makes better things constantly.

2025
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:38,020
That's all it does. Yeah.

2026
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:39,980
That's what it does. It does a lot of other stuff.

2027
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:42,100
Yeah, yeah. It does a lot of other stuff.

2028
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,020
But it makes better things.

2029
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:49,660
But even the better things it does, like when wars to control resources.

2030
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,900
Why do they want resources so they can make better things?

2031
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:54,420
It's all about better things.

2032
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:58,020
It's all about more control so that they have more access

2033
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:00,820
to more materials, to more more better things.

2034
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:05,780
And that that always if you're dealing with intelligence

2035
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:09,660
and you're dealing with technological evolution

2036
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:12,700
and technological innovation, it's going to lead to artificial life

2037
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:16,300
or a life, a new kind of life, a new kind of life.

2038
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:21,460
Yeah. And that might be the kind of life that literally becomes a god.

2039
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:25,180
If you think about it, it continues to get like there's

2040
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:29,860
I was looking at this this video that was on YouTube

2041
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:33,780
that was showing the stages of artificial intelligence

2042
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:36,460
and that there's these multiple stages, artificial

2043
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:39,300
and the general intelligence, sentient general intelligence.

2044
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:43,060
And then it goes to godlike artificial intelligence.

2045
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:46,820
But that is is that what God is?

2046
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:48,060
And is that what we're doing?

2047
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:50,580
Are we making God of God made us in his own image?

2048
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:52,140
Are we making God?

2049
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:53,980
Is that what this whole thing is about?

2050
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:56,900
Well, you know, it's these are some of the questions that I have

2051
01:52:56,900 --> 01:53:00,140
when I go back to looking at some of the characteristics

2052
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:02,940
of these like the Virgin Mary sightings and things like that.

2053
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:05,940
Like we now have technologies that can replicate

2054
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:10,140
what it seems like was happening during that event,

2055
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:13,860
you know, like in Garibandal in Spain in the 1960s.

2056
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:17,740
And if that's the case, then it looks like Steven's idea

2057
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:20,740
of the intelligence principles correct when he says that

2058
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:26,300
there will be intelligent beings that will appear like deities to us.

2059
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:28,900
Hmm. Which makes sense.

2060
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:32,180
Yeah. And he also says, you know, and I don't know

2061
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:34,420
if you've gotten to the chapter on Simone in the book,

2062
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:40,020
but she's a quantum AI person and she's she talks about UFOs

2063
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:44,260
and and she hates the word artificial intelligence.

2064
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:47,900
She says it's completely we don't like make a painting

2065
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:51,180
and then say, see this artificial, you know, we don't do that.

2066
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:52,220
So why do we call it white?

2067
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:53,860
It's because she says we're afraid of it.

2068
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:56,020
You know, we're afraid that it's going to be sentient

2069
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:59,300
and we're afraid, you know, she said, but it's just another life form

2070
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:02,580
that's that we happen to be doing, creating.

2071
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:04,980
Yes. And she says it's special in that way,

2072
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:07,500
but it's also going to free us in many, many ways.

2073
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:11,180
Oh, she's a tech optimist.

2074
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:13,580
She's an accelerationist. Yeah.

2075
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:16,460
Well, I hope she's right.

2076
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:17,740
Because she's having you right.

2077
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:19,620
Yeah, it's happening no matter what. Yeah.

2078
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:22,300
But I mean, I think if you could go back again to Australia,

2079
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:24,740
Pythagoras and say, hey, man, one day you're going to be wrought

2080
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:27,740
with anxiety because it is existential angst

2081
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:29,740
and you're going to be on antidepressants

2082
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:32,060
and living in a cubicle all day and doing about it.

2083
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:33,700
But that's the future. It's progress.

2084
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:35,380
Be like, fuck that.

2085
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:37,940
I'd rather hang out here in the savanna. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2086
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:42,980
I think it's in this inevitable part of the process of whatever

2087
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:46,300
we're going through, because we're not in a static state.

2088
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,620
We're in a constant state. Yeah.

2089
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:52,660
Social upheaval, cultural upheaval, a change of perspectives,

2090
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:55,900
this constant battle to try to define things

2091
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:58,380
and to figure out what's appropriate and inappropriate

2092
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:01,380
and gaslighting people who disagree with you,

2093
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:04,820
which is also fascinating just to watch people do that.

2094
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:08,380
It's fascinating to watch people try to put a positive spin

2095
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:10,700
on inherently evil things.

2096
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:12,820
Yeah, it's pretty terrible. It's horrible.

2097
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:14,540
Yeah, it's a bad show.

2098
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:17,260
Yeah, it's it's a weird show. That's for sure.

2099
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:17,980
It's a weird show.

2100
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:22,900
But again, I do have this internal struggle

2101
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:26,900
with this concept of good and evil that perhaps

2102
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:31,260
the negative aspects are there to enlighten us

2103
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:35,700
and to let us know that our work is not done and that we have to move

2104
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:40,700
into a direction that we know is just and good and correct

2105
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:46,260
and loving and that this is possible within small groups of people.

2106
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:50,780
It's possible with individuals and ultimately must be possible

2107
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:51,860
with the collective.

2108
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:56,020
It just has to be managed in some way or facilitated in some way

2109
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,980
and that it's not guaranteed.

2110
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:02,060
And then if you look at World War Two and look at the Holocaust,

2111
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:05,940
you look at the horrific things that human beings are capable of

2112
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:09,500
when they're allowed to just run rampant.

2113
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:12,420
You talked about the Japanese horrors during World War Two,

2114
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:14,860
like the rape in Nanking. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

2115
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:16,500
Oh, my God. I remember reading that going.

2116
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:20,100
How are human beings capable of doing this?

2117
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:21,900
How are people savagery? Yeah.

2118
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:25,540
Unbelievable. Bizarre, bizarre in its cruelty.

2119
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:27,500
Unbelievable. Horrific.

2120
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:31,020
And that seems to be evil.

2121
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:33,380
That seems to be evil personified.

2122
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:35,500
I think so. But I mean, I'm not afraid to say it.

2123
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:36,780
Right. It is a thing.

2124
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:39,300
Evil is a real thing. Like, evil is real.

2125
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:43,020
That's I mean, as a professor, you know, teaching my students,

2126
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:45,020
I'm not going to say, oh, yeah, evil is real.

2127
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:47,620
But here I'm going to say, and I've said this on podcasts,

2128
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:50,780
you can't say that human trafficking is not evil.

2129
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:52,980
Right. That's evil. Evil.

2130
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:54,700
And let's just call it for what it is.

2131
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:57,060
Yeah. Human medical experiments on children.

2132
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:59,380
It's evil. Evil. Evil. Yeah.

2133
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:03,660
And we do it and we do it almost specifically for profit.

2134
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:06,460
Always. Which is also evil. Yeah. Yeah.

2135
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:10,940
So so back to the allegory, the cave in the Plato.

2136
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:15,540
So he's dealing with these questions of it doesn't call it justice,

2137
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:18,260
but calls it injustice. I mean, he doesn't call it evil.

2138
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:22,100
So I guess what I'm trying to say is my position at this point

2139
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:25,580
after doing the study of this kind of thing is that.

2140
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:31,180
It's the development of this this mystic state

2141
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:34,420
that we've been talking about that I think we need to.

2142
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:39,060
This is how we need to counter, because we can't decide.

2143
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:40,980
These are the rules we're going to follow.

2144
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:43,180
People aren't going to follow those rules or they're going to follow

2145
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:45,020
those rules and cheat. Right.

2146
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:47,580
Or they're going to pretend to follow the rules. Right.

2147
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:52,180
But if people actually engaged in the type of thing

2148
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:55,540
that we were talking about, the thing they love, you know, that allows,

2149
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:59,220
then perhaps justice emerges. Right. Yes.

2150
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:02,260
That's what I'm trying to point out to people that if we

2151
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:08,020
these these ideas have been around for a long time, they're not new ideas.

2152
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:11,980
But we've never actually done them like, you know, small groups have done them.

2153
01:58:12,580 --> 01:58:15,100
So when you're alone with your thoughts

2154
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:18,100
and you've been studying this for a long time now,

2155
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:21,700
what do you think the UFO phenomenon is?

2156
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:26,980
Yeah. So I think, first of all, that there are a lot of different

2157
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:31,780
varieties of it. But when we look at like we were looking at

2158
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:34,420
the Francis of Assisi and the kind of historical things

2159
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:36,540
and the abductions and things like that,

2160
01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:43,460
I think that that it's been around for a long time

2161
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:49,220
and that these are things that are in communication with us.

2162
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:52,660
So I used what I do in my book,

2163
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:57,140
both the books that I wrote about this is I go I talk to people

2164
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:59,460
who I think represent thousands of people.

2165
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:03,460
So each person in the book represents thousands, if not more,

2166
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:07,820
maybe many thousands of people who have had experiences

2167
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:10,060
and the ways in which they interpret them.

2168
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:14,100
So all of the people seem to have had experiences where now

2169
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:17,180
what they want to do is they actually want to work for justice

2170
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:20,740
in different ways, like Jose, the veteran in my book.

2171
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:24,620
He's working with young people and helping them deal

2172
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:27,340
with being addicted to social media and things like that

2173
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:29,820
and helping them get through life, which is really hard right now.

2174
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:32,540
And that's what he's doing.

2175
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:34,620
And then you look at Dr. Whiteley, right?

2176
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:36,820
So she's she's working in the space force.

2177
01:59:36,820 --> 01:59:40,380
She's trying to help people deal with the fact that they're seeing things

2178
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:44,420
that, you know, that could down planes and things like that.

2179
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:46,300
And she's helping people talk about that.

2180
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:48,580
She's helping people.

2181
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:53,500
Each person in, you know, is somehow doing what I'm suggesting

2182
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:58,060
that I think is an out this kind of structural injustice that we see.

2183
01:59:58,340 --> 02:00:02,140
So I think that this is a transformational thing without the drugs

2184
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:05,580
is what's going on, like some kind of massive

2185
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:09,460
experience that people are having.

2186
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:13,300
And now it's getting out and people are being able to talk to each other

2187
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:16,860
through Reddit communities and, you know, different types of social media.

2188
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:19,740
So it is it's it's

2189
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:24,020
we did see, you know, religions when they begin, they become viral.

2190
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:28,180
At one point, we've never seen it in an age where we have digital technology.

2191
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:30,460
But this is what we're seeing now.

2192
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:32,460
What do you think the physical objects are?

2193
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:36,260
Well, OK, so this is something that's very interesting.

2194
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:38,380
We just looked at the Shroud of Turin.

2195
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:42,140
I believe that there are these I would call them.

2196
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:45,820
And this is just my own non-scientific term.

2197
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:49,300
Interdimensional objects,

2198
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:53,260
there are objects that have characteristics of our dimension

2199
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:56,620
and some other dimension.

2200
02:00:57,300 --> 02:01:00,620
So some other dimension

2201
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:04,940
has the capability or something from some other dimension

2202
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:09,260
has the capability of transporting a physical object

2203
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:14,540
into our realm or even imprinting onto a physical object.

2204
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:17,340
Yeah. How so? Well, I don't know.

2205
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:19,180
I mean, I think that's what what does that mean?

2206
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:22,900
Imprinting on with the Shroud of Turin, we see the imprint of,

2207
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,980
you know, the image and if it's real.

2208
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:26,700
Yeah, if it's real.

2209
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:28,540
But it's it's an anomalous object.

2210
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:32,140
So we do have from Gary Nolan engineered objects

2211
02:01:32,780 --> 02:01:34,460
that we don't know how they're engineered.

2212
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:39,260
But they definitely look like they're, you know, it's it's off planet.

2213
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:43,860
I would call the kinds of things that we see in the historical record,

2214
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:45,860
interdimensional types of things.

2215
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:49,340
Now, how? I don't know, Joe. OK, so I just don't know.

2216
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:51,500
But I do think that

2217
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:54,540
scientists in the government know that these things exist

2218
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:56,260
and they would like to figure it out.

2219
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:59,500
And so part of disclosure, the disclosure movement

2220
02:01:59,820 --> 02:02:04,340
is outsourcing this and trying to get as many people as possible to to help

2221
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:06,620
in figuring it out.

2222
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:10,900
What do you think when they use the term donations?

2223
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:13,860
What do you think the purpose of that is?

2224
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:19,460
If there is an object that is purposely released into our,

2225
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:22,060
you know, like, I'm sure you're aware of cargo cults.

2226
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:24,900
Yes. So with cargo cults for people that don't know,

2227
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:28,940
there's been some islands during World War One and World War Two

2228
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:32,220
where planes landed there and they left.

2229
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:36,260
And these people, they created these

2230
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:40,140
statues of these planes and they worshiped them.

2231
02:02:40,620 --> 02:02:42,740
And they wanted them to come back. Yes.

2232
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:46,460
Yeah, because they got food and all kinds of wonderful things from the plane.

2233
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:49,900
Right. Yeah, they thought of them as thought of them as deities.

2234
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:54,500
Right. The same way we would think of something from somewhere else. Yeah.

2235
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:59,580
Yeah. So, yeah, that in my field has been called the cargo cult,

2236
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:01,660
the UFO cargo cult. Right.

2237
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:07,660
And obviously, Tyler and James view these parts as as donate.

2238
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:09,820
They call it the donation site. Right.

2239
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:12,780
So giving it the idea that it's not just one theory.

2240
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:15,100
Yeah, that's just one theory.

2241
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:17,540
Are there other theories that there's a biological organism

2242
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:22,020
that encounters a lightning storm and it actually crashes and there's physical

2243
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:24,100
bodies? Oh, yeah, there is that.

2244
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:25,300
Yeah, there's that. Yeah.

2245
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:26,460
What's your take on that?

2246
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:29,060
Because that's one of the things that Grush talked about

2247
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:32,740
and some of the other people talked about that there there are biological

2248
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:35,260
things that have been recovered.

2249
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:39,500
Well, what impressed me about the way about what he said

2250
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:41,780
was that he used the term biologics.

2251
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:44,940
And I actually know that term because that's the same term that Tyler

2252
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:48,420
was talking about when he was creating materials

2253
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:52,140
in anti-gravity spaces on on space shuttles and such.

2254
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:56,900
So I was wondering, because David Grush does get his information

2255
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:59,940
from people in allegedly in the programs,

2256
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:02,900
but he's never seen these materials that I know of.

2257
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:07,820
I think he has some firsthand experience that he was not able to talk about.

2258
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:09,820
OK, that he's alluding to. OK.

2259
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:12,980
I think. But this is this is recent.

2260
02:04:12,980 --> 02:04:17,620
And he's been very careful about how he releases this information

2261
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:20,100
and what he's able to release and not able to release.

2262
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:23,860
And that I was like, OK.

2263
02:04:23,860 --> 02:04:27,980
Yeah. So I mean, I've not seen any any bodies,

2264
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:30,580
nor have I seen intact craft.

2265
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:35,020
But I also have had now, remember, I don't have a clearance like he has.

2266
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:37,740
So I can actually talk about what people have told me.

2267
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:41,700
I have had people tell me that, yes, Diana, there are intact craft.

2268
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:44,820
I don't know. I mean, maybe.

2269
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:49,100
So I don't know, Joe.

2270
02:04:49,180 --> 02:04:51,860
Have you studied Bob Lazar?

2271
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:55,580
OK, yes, I have always asked about Bob Lazar.

2272
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:57,380
You know, and I don't know.

2273
02:04:57,380 --> 02:05:02,740
But I can tell you that people that I've met who are associated

2274
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:06,220
with the programs tell me that he's he's he's right.

2275
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:10,220
Now, I know his background and I know, you know, all the things.

2276
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:13,100
I don't I don't have an opinion one way or the other.

2277
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:16,340
But I can also say that a lot of times people

2278
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:19,780
with very disturbing backgrounds,

2279
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:24,260
you know, who could be easily discredited are given information

2280
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:26,420
and shown things and told things.

2281
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:29,460
Well, I would think that that's sort of like a little escape clause.

2282
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:31,340
Yeah, I think so. I think it is.

2283
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:35,540
I mean, the guy's obviously a genius and was obviously a propulsion expert

2284
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:39,500
and put a fucking jet engine on a Honda in the 1980s.

2285
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:42,940
He's a fascinating guy. Yeah, yeah.

2286
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:47,300
And, you know, he claims that there's some element,

2287
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:51,180
some element that exists in other places in the universe,

2288
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:53,780
which leads me to believe.

2289
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:58,140
Well, not even to believe, but like so here's the question.

2290
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:01,420
Are some of these things from other planets?

2291
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:04,180
Is that also in the equation?

2292
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:09,180
I mean, just because something is traveling inter-dimensionally,

2293
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:12,900
we do know that there are an infinite number of planets.

2294
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:14,940
Yeah. In the universe.

2295
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:17,140
I mean, we have no idea

2296
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:20,500
how many of them are capable of supporting human like life

2297
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:26,300
or some other kind of life or an infinite number of varieties of life.

2298
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:31,180
And if that life can do what we've done and get to some part

2299
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:35,340
of its progression, where it's capable of creating

2300
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:39,660
what we're calling artificial intelligence or super advanced technology.

2301
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:42,380
Why wouldn't it come here?

2302
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:46,140
Yes, I have. I'm not just I'm not discounting it.

2303
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:47,620
So that could be there.

2304
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:50,660
I think so, especially because of the ways in which

2305
02:06:51,260 --> 02:06:54,820
the materials are being manufactured off planet,

2306
02:06:54,820 --> 02:07:00,380
like the ones that we just saw that, you know, and that was information

2307
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:03,500
when I met Tyler 2014.

2308
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:06,060
And now it's a full on thing that's happening. Right.

2309
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:10,860
So it's it's a supercharged program of creating things

2310
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:12,820
that will help us off planet.

2311
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:14,940
I mean, certainly then.

2312
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:17,060
Yeah, I think so.

2313
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:19,260
I mean, but I don't know. Right.

2314
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:20,700
So I have to just be honest.

2315
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:24,500
So it might be a bunch of different things happening all at the same time,

2316
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:27,820
inter-dimensionally, extraterrestrially,

2317
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:31,420
something from a distant galaxy that's

2318
02:07:31,980 --> 02:07:33,900
figured out some new method of propulsion

2319
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:36,500
that's beyond our imagination that can visit.

2320
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:40,300
And then also things that are coming here from other dimensions.

2321
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:44,740
Yes. And even recently, somebody had, you know.

2322
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:47,300
Yeah. Well, I can't say anything.

2323
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:48,820
I can't say I'm sorry.

2324
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:51,340
I don't want to be that person that goes on your show and says,

2325
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:52,980
Oh, I can't I can't say that.

2326
02:07:52,980 --> 02:07:57,140
But I probably the most likely there are

2327
02:07:57,860 --> 02:08:00,380
if there's crash retrieval part,

2328
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:02,900
you know, crash retrievals here on Earth,

2329
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:05,660
perhaps there are in space as well.

2330
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:12,060
Do you when they talk about inventions

2331
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:17,900
that emerged post Roswell, that's one of the points of speculation

2332
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:20,740
is that we have back engineered something

2333
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:24,460
and that this led to the creation of fiber optics

2334
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:28,500
and a lot of other technologies that seem to emerge after that time.

2335
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:31,300
Yeah. Part.

2336
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:36,620
So this question was prominent in my mind in 2012 when I met Jacques

2337
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:41,340
Vallee, so I was already aware of his work, even as a person

2338
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:43,900
who hadn't studied UFOs or even believed in them.

2339
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:47,380
Jacques Vallee is just one of these people, right, that you come across

2340
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:49,100
his work and he's fascinating.

2341
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:54,020
So I thought it was strange that not only was he

2342
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:58,460
a person who was, you know, pre-engineered ARPANET, right.

2343
02:08:58,460 --> 02:09:00,700
He was on ARPANET, which is pre-internet.

2344
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:05,860
He was creating that at the same time as being obsessed with UFOs

2345
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:08,180
and doing, you know, being a ufologist.

2346
02:09:08,180 --> 02:09:12,100
These things seemed that they had to be together, right.

2347
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:15,420
There was something that, you know, what's going on here.

2348
02:09:15,740 --> 02:09:18,900
So and I'm in touch with him often.

2349
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:24,340
And. He says a lot of things that are rather cryptic,

2350
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:26,940
but sometimes I ask him specifically.

2351
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:31,740
Was was what you were doing on ARPANET

2352
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:35,660
related to back engineered UFO parts?

2353
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:40,300
And then he'd say something like there are many secrets in Silicon Valley,

2354
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:43,980
something like that. Yeah. Yeah. He's real cryptic.

2355
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:47,420
He's kind of difficult to have a conversation with publicly.

2356
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:49,700
Well, it does have a lot.

2357
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:53,820
I guess there are lots of secrets in Silicon Valley, of course, which is where he lives.

2358
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:57,340
Yeah. Another thing that was really fascinating about your book

2359
02:09:57,340 --> 02:10:00,500
was you're talking about how much religion he studied.

2360
02:10:01,020 --> 02:10:04,340
Yes. Yes. That was really interesting.

2361
02:10:04,340 --> 02:10:08,860
So in the book, what I do is I uncover not just him, but Alan Hynek.

2362
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:14,780
They were friends and they were both Rosicrucians, which is a form of

2363
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:19,260
he might not like me to say this, but it's a form of mystical Christianity

2364
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:23,740
in a sense, but a lot of Rosicrucians don't view their roots as Christian.

2365
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:26,180
They they look at it as Egyptian.

2366
02:10:26,180 --> 02:10:32,860
And but it's basically it's an esoteric tradition and it involves meditation.

2367
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:36,500
I think it most likely involves this thing that you and I've been discussing.

2368
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:42,700
And the whole talk so far is the pineal gland thing, you know, the the access point,

2369
02:10:42,940 --> 02:10:48,820
because both of them believe in this kind of life, this meditating and things like that.

2370
02:10:49,060 --> 02:10:50,820
And so I included references.

2371
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:54,740
Everything I say in my books, by the way, I pass to the person

2372
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:56,540
that I'm writing the chapter about.

2373
02:10:56,540 --> 02:11:00,300
So everything that I said about Jacques, I gave it to him beforehand.

2374
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:03,220
And I said, are you OK with me saying this publicly?

2375
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:06,340
And so it passed all the tests.

2376
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:12,900
And I also talk about going to his apartment and seeing his library,

2377
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:15,020
which is an amazing library.

2378
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:18,340
And he has stained glass from Sharj Cathedral

2379
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:22,260
and Sharj Cathedral is a special place for Rosicrucians,

2380
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:26,060
like a special place of presence of the sacred.

2381
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:28,340
So and he actually did those himself.

2382
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:32,220
So he learned how to do stained glass from people at Sharj, by the way.

2383
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:34,580
And yeah, just amazing.

2384
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:40,340
And he had a lot of books on angels and and fallen angels in that library,

2385
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:43,580
like almost like it was almost like going into the Vatican Archive,

2386
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:48,140
going into this place, because these looked like first editions or close.

2387
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:51,580
So, you know, really, really old books about this topic.

2388
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:53,380
Fallen angel. Yeah.

2389
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:55,660
I was pretty shocked when I had when I went.

2390
02:11:55,660 --> 02:11:59,460
I was we were going to have lunch and talk about the crash site

2391
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:02,420
and maybe talk about, you know, what I learned from Tyler and that kind of thing.

2392
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:05,660
And we went to lunch and then he said, Do you want to see the library?

2393
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:06,980
And I was like, yes, of course.

2394
02:12:06,980 --> 02:12:11,180
So I saw the handwritten documents from Project Blue Book.

2395
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:14,500
And that was just going into the library.

2396
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:15,500
That wasn't actually in the library.

2397
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:17,660
Then when we got in there,

2398
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:21,860
I noticed a big book cases of these books.

2399
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:23,860
And of course, I was drawn to them.

2400
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:27,340
And he said he picked out one and he opened it and it was about angels.

2401
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:29,580
And he said, this is the this is a book about angels.

2402
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:30,580
And I could see that.

2403
02:12:30,580 --> 02:12:32,340
And I was looking at wow.

2404
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:35,900
And then I looked at the other bookshelf and that bookshelf was just as impressive.

2405
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:38,380
And then it was about fallen angels.

2406
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:39,980
He said, oh, this one's about fallen angels.

2407
02:12:39,980 --> 02:12:43,180
And then he made a joke and he said, you can't have one without the other.

2408
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:45,660
And I thought that, yeah, I thought that was really interesting.

2409
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:49,460
That does seem to align with what we're talking about,

2410
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:51,580
with like the struggle of good and evil.

2411
02:12:52,180 --> 02:12:54,460
It does. That's what he said, too.

2412
02:12:54,460 --> 02:12:57,460
And and I was actually shocked at that point.

2413
02:12:57,460 --> 02:12:58,900
I was like, wow.

2414
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:02,020
So just, you know, I'm a professor of religion, you know.

2415
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:06,980
So I'm like, I'm right about, you know, my intuition was somehow confirmed.

2416
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:10,740
And by the way, I think people, I think this should be recent.

2417
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:13,980
I'm not sure if this is totally true, but I believe he was the inspiration

2418
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:17,340
for the French character in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

2419
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:19,500
I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Which makes sense.

2420
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:24,260
Absolutely. Because Hinex in there and then there's him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2421
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:28,020
It's wild stuff. Yeah.

2422
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:33,660
What do you make of the reports of this craft that's supposedly 40 feet long

2423
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:36,460
and you get inside of it and it's really a football field?

2424
02:13:36,700 --> 02:13:38,180
Oh, that one. OK. Yeah.

2425
02:13:38,180 --> 02:13:40,180
So the time dimensions and OK.

2426
02:13:40,180 --> 02:13:43,660
So people I know who do the work and are physicists,

2427
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:49,940
they describe this in quantum language, which I cannot replicate at all.

2428
02:13:50,180 --> 02:13:51,780
But this is how they're describing it.

2429
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:55,140
They're saying that the and by the way, it's really interesting

2430
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:58,860
that, you know, when I'm doing my research into the Catholic history

2431
02:13:58,860 --> 02:14:02,500
and I'm looking at some of the things that we can do now technologically,

2432
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:05,740
that it looks very, you know, like people back then were like,

2433
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:07,820
this is a miracle. Right. OK.

2434
02:14:07,820 --> 02:14:12,260
So what they're doing is a similar type of process or method.

2435
02:14:12,580 --> 02:14:16,740
So basically what they're doing is they're looking at people's descriptions

2436
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:20,180
and data of the craft. Right.

2437
02:14:20,620 --> 02:14:23,980
And they're then identifying the patterns and they're saying

2438
02:14:23,980 --> 02:14:27,460
if there was a quantum field, this would make perfect sense.

2439
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:31,500
So if this was occurring in a quantum field, this would make sense

2440
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:35,740
that this thing would look small on the outside and go in and it's immense.

2441
02:14:36,140 --> 02:14:38,260
Yeah. Yeah.

2442
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:41,780
Why do you think this information is getting released?

2443
02:14:42,220 --> 02:14:46,140
Why do you think it's becoming a more mainstream,

2444
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:48,420
acceptable thing to discuss?

2445
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:51,460
Because to the average person that sees this,

2446
02:14:52,060 --> 02:14:57,100
the the thought, I think, sort of naturally goes to this idea

2447
02:14:57,100 --> 02:15:01,620
that some sort of contact is inevitable, some sort of revelation,

2448
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:05,580
some sort of landing on the White House lawn type deal.

2449
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:10,020
OK, I have a couple of thoughts on that.

2450
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:15,060
The first one is that part of the reason is because

2451
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:18,140
China is now in space.

2452
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:20,460
So before it was us in Russia.

2453
02:15:20,860 --> 02:15:23,700
We were the only ones we were together, actually.

2454
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:27,820
So, you know, we were aligned, even though at many points

2455
02:15:27,820 --> 02:15:31,100
were enemies on Earth in space, we weren't enemies.

2456
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:33,340
We were working together, using each other's equipment.

2457
02:15:33,620 --> 02:15:37,580
So also keeping the secrets that perhaps we're seeing in space.

2458
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:40,580
But now that other countries are going into space,

2459
02:15:40,580 --> 02:15:43,180
whatever is up there will be known.

2460
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:47,180
And I think part of it has to do with this phenomenon.

2461
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:51,380
And so that's why it's urgent to get this message out.

2462
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:55,140
That's that's one of my ideas.

2463
02:15:57,180 --> 02:16:00,780
Another. Well, I have some other ideas, but that's the one that's most prominent

2464
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:04,980
is because I just don't think that it's going to be a secret for very much longer.

2465
02:16:05,980 --> 02:16:09,620
And in fact, right now, a lot, you know, Chinese are,

2466
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:12,380
you know, they are going into space and they are like, you know,

2467
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:15,180
looking at things and.

2468
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:18,740
So from a national security standpoint,

2469
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:22,140
it's important to sort of move this conversation further.

2470
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:25,420
Yeah. Accelerate it. I think so.

2471
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:28,860
Are you hopeful?

2472
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:32,540
With all this information that you have.

2473
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:36,180
Are you hopeful about the direction that the world is going?

2474
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:40,860
I would say that I'm simultaneously hopeful

2475
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:44,500
and horrified.

2476
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:46,740
OK. And and how can you be both?

2477
02:16:47,420 --> 02:16:51,900
I just am, because it seems like a lot of things are happening

2478
02:16:51,900 --> 02:16:55,860
that are terrible and will continue to happen and may even ramp up. OK.

2479
02:16:56,620 --> 02:17:02,260
At the same time, there is what I believe to be an awakening happening as well.

2480
02:17:02,580 --> 02:17:05,060
And I think that's also going to ramp up.

2481
02:17:05,060 --> 02:17:09,780
And as long as we have some portion of the collective awake,

2482
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:11,860
I think there's hope.

2483
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:14,740
All right. Let's wrap it up on that.

2484
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:16,700
Well, thank you very much for being here.

2485
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:17,860
I really appreciate it. Yeah.

2486
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:20,380
Fascinating. Yeah. Fascinating conversation.

2487
02:17:20,380 --> 02:17:23,260
When more stuff comes out, let's do it again. OK. Sounds good. OK.

2488
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:25,740
Thank you very much. All right. Bye, everybody.
