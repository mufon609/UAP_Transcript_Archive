00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
The Joe Rogan Experience, trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,680
What's up, Luke?

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,160
How are you?

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey, sir, I'm doing better than I deserve.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,120
Well, that's a good statement.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,960
There's an old military saying any day above ground is a good day.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,080
There you go.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,960
So tell everybody what your official job was.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
Wow.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,680
I had a lot of official jobs.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,160
With the government in regards to, you know, you know, you know, sure.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,680
Well, these things, that's a allegedly that's a replica of the one that Bob

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,560
Lazar worked on the sport model.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,000
I've heard that before.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,080
Designs by Perry, the E in Perry is a three and he's a dude on Instagram

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,600
that sent me that.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,080
Very cool. Pretty dope, right?

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,920
Yeah.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,560
Well, another one that looks just like it at the mothership at the Comedy Club.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,000
When you walk in, you walk right through like a giant suspended UFO.

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,840
Very cool. So obviously I have issues.

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,160
Well, you know what? This is a neat town.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:19,040
I was strolling the streets yesterday and I came across the the Texas Toy Museum.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,880
Now, I'm not one for museums usually, but something I saw was

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,680
automatically transported me back to when I was a kid.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,680
I'm an old guy, so I grew up 70s and early 50 to.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,040
I'm 57. You are. Yeah.

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,560
Man. Well, I look 10 years older than you.

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,120
I got a lot of a lot of long, hard miles on me, unfortunately.

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,400
I do, too. Believe it or not.

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,680
Well, you'll have to share with me your secret,

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,840
because unfortunately, I tell people this is as good as it gets.

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,640
I'm about as attractive as a cement truck.

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,040
You know, so so I after the army,

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,120
I went into the federal service and had a lot of jobs,

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,480
mostly in counterintelligence and which is looking basically

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,960
what the bad guys know about us from an intelligence perspective.

38
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,720
And in 2008, I changed my job.

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,640
One of my jobs, I was working at the director of national intelligence,

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,600
which for most people may or may not know.

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,040
It's kind of outside of D.C.

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,360
and where I lived, I was on the other side of D.C.

43
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,000
living on a little island in the Chesapeake Bay.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,440
And so my commute was terrible.

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,040
I mean, it really, really frankly took a ferry every day.

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,920
No, but it was about a three hour commute each way.

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,680
You have to go right past Langley.

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
Yeah, it was. Why didn't you move closer?

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
Well, you know, I wanted to I wanted to give my kids a really good quality of life.

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,480
And I did not want to work in the city and then kind of expose them

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,760
to kind of the craziness, if that makes sense, especially D.C.

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,520
D.C. is crazy, especially with kids. Right.

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,440
Yeah. And kind of nuts that they don't clean up the capital of the fucking country.

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,520
It seems like, you know, brother, it's kind of indicative of the rot.

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,000
The whole country is such a disgrace because you bring these foreign dignitaries

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,680
and the first thing they see is is just the dereliction of it.

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,360
And it's a very poor reflection on really what the American spirit is about.

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,000
But, you know, that's that's for another conversation.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Yeah, it seems like they could fix that.

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,880
Yeah, especially in that place.

61
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,240
Yeah. One would hope, right?

62
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,280
Yeah. Jesus Christ. It's the nation's capital. Yeah.

63
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,440
So I was offered a job to go back to the Pentagon in 2008

64
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,760
for a little while and basically run the the integration

65
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,680
between national level intelligence information and local and state

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,560
and tribal law enforcement.

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,640
So after 9-11, the country realized that we had a significant problem

68
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,680
getting national level information down to to the cops on the ground

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,040
that could actually do something about it.

70
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,160
Why? Because he didn't have security clearances.

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,120
So they couldn't they weren't allowed to be provided that information.

72
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,440
So one of my jobs was to try to help fix that.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,080
And shortly thereafter, I got there in 2008.

74
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,000
It was probably early 2009 is when I was approached by two individuals

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,840
who came to me and they said, look, we'd like to consider you for

76
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,920
for for a program that we're part of.

77
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,680
It's a very nuanced program, very secretive program.

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,800
Now, when you're in the government, you hear that all the time.

79
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,080
It's not, you know, people look at maybe, oh, you have a secret clearance

80
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,920
or a top secret clearance.

81
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,360
Millions of people have have some sort of security clearance in the government.

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,920
And a lot, a lot of people have a top secret clearance.

83
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,560
So it's really not that uncommon. It's really not that sexy.

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
It's just so you didn't really know what you're getting involved in.

85
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,120
I didn't at all. Not at all. In fact.

86
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
So, yeah, great question.

87
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,280
So, no, I didn't know what I was getting involved in.

88
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,920
And after several conversations, it occurred to me that their interest in me

89
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,160
was some of my background I had in my early career as a special agent

90
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
in counterintelligence.

91
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,080
I was protecting technologies, critical technologies, critical avionic technologies.

92
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,440
For example, and some aerospace technology.

93
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,760
So think of first stage solid rocket motor booster technology,

94
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,280
Tomahawk cruise missiles, stuff like that, Apache Longbow.

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,720
So advanced avionics was something I was kind of already form

96
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,040
kind of familiar with.

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,040
And at the same time, I had the counterintelligence background.

98
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,000
So I was asked to come in and run the counterintelligence and security aspect

99
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,200
for a particular program, at which time I had no idea what the program even was.

100
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,400
So what does counterintelligence and security mean?

101
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,200
It just simply means making sure that our adversaries like Russia and China

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,440
can't penetrate our organization and steal our secret.

103
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,920
That's all it is. It's kind of a fancy word for just saying security,

104
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
information security and operational security.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,360
So I remember I had a meeting.

106
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,280
They brought me to go see their director.

107
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,520
And it was in a in I would tell you the location,

108
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,800
but I was told by the Pentagon not to say the specific location of this office.

109
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
But it was somewhere in the D.C. area.

110
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,400
It was a facility that wasn't known publicly to be a an intelligence

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,880
to have an intelligence office in there.

112
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,240
So I can't say that the specific location.

113
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,680
But I went there and I went up to the to the top floor.

114
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,400
I think it was the top floor, almost the top floor.

115
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,360
And I met for the first time a gentleman named James Lukatsky,

116
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,440
Dr. James Lukatsky, Ph.D.

117
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,040
And this guy was the epitome of a rocket scientist.

118
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,160
And when I say the epitome, I mean, he was probably and there's no exaggeration,

119
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,280
the number one rocket scientist in the U.S. government.

120
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,640
Now, he's a humble guy, so he'll probably tell you he wasn't.

121
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,760
But he really was an amazing human being and very smart.

122
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,120
And after a very brief conversation, he looked at me and he said,

123
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,920
I want to ask you a question.

124
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,960
OK, sir. And he said, what do you think about UFOs?

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,840
I said, well, I answer truthfully, I said, I don't.

126
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,800
And he said, well, what do you mean, you don't believe in them?

127
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,960
And I said, no, that's not what I said.

128
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,400
You asked me if I think, you know, what do I think about UFOs?

129
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,600
And frankly, I don't think about UFOs.

130
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,080
I really don't have the luxury to think about them.

131
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,320
I'm too busy, you know, working intelligence operations and whatnot.

132
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,400
And I remember him looking over his glasses and

133
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,840
very seriously staring me straight in the eye and says, well,

134
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,960
don't let your personal bias

135
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,560
get the best of you, because what you may learn may surprise you

136
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,720
and may challenge any preconceived notion of what you think

137
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,000
something is or is not.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,280
And so let me backtrack for a minute.

139
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,240
I've never been a UFO guy.

140
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,760
People come up, oh, you're that UFO guy.

141
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm really not. I was never really into science fiction as a kid.

142
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,760
I wasn't into the Star Trek or the Star Wars like a lot of people were.

143
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
So that was not my disposition.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,560
You know, I grew up, I guess, playing GI Joe and stuff like that.

145
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,160
So that wasn't that wasn't my background.

146
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,320
And certainly in college, I I studied microbiology

147
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,200
and immunology with a focus on parasitology, not parapsychology,

148
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,000
the study of parasites, parasitology.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,680
So the scientific method has always been something that has been near

150
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
and dear to me. And then, of course, later on, as a as a special agent,

151
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,240
you know, that when you're when you're conducting investigations,

152
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,560
for me, I was always very fact driven, kind of the old gum shoe,

153
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,720
if you will, just the facts, ma'am, sort of guy.

154
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,080
So I was never really prone to any type of,

155
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,200
if you will, affinity towards science fiction or even the UFO topic.

156
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,920
I just I just never really considered it.

157
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,200
Hmm. So he says this to you.

158
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,880
And then so we're talking about like, what, 16 years ago?

159
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,640
15, 16 years ago. Yeah, I do the math, right.

160
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,360
So it's 2024, 2000, early 2009.

161
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,600
So this is the beginning of your journey

162
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,720
towards this sort of bizarre subject of whatever these things are.

163
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,960
Yeah. So you don't have any real previous interest.

164
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
He says this to you.

165
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,600
And and then what's the steps after that?

166
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,280
Like, how do you get introduced to this idea that these things are alien crafts?

167
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah. So great question.

168
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,520
So for some people, there's this kind of two ways people process this information,

169
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,120
at least in my experience, and there may be others.

170
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,000
This has just been my my observation.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,400
Some people have this kind of revelatory moment, this epiphany,

172
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,000
where it's this aha moment, where, oh, my gosh, this is real. Right.

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,480
Hmm. For other people, it's kind of more of a slow, gradual realization.

174
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,480
And I think for me, I was probably in the second category,

175
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,880
more of a slow, gradual realization that this isn't, you know, a cover for something else.

176
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,120
This is really about UFOs.

177
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,800
So how do you first get introduced to these things?

178
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,360
Well, so it was I didn't get introduced to these things.

179
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,760
It was first of all, I was introduced to the reporting. Right.

180
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,640
So there was these these official reports that we were getting from the field.

181
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,880
There's official videos and whatnot that describe vehicles

182
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,120
doing things, maneuvering in ways that frankly outperform anything

183
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,960
we have in our inventory.

184
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,600
Now, keep in mind, my background was at some point in aerospace.

185
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,920
So I knew all the capabilities of an F-16 or, for example,

186
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
an F-22 or the F-35.

187
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,440
And at the end of the day, as advanced as they are, they're still conventional aircraft.

188
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,600
You know, they still have the old.

189
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,040
There's a there's an adage they use for jet engines.

190
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,440
It may seem a little awkward here, but it's suck, squeeze, bang and blow.

191
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,520
That's what a jet engine does.

192
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,680
Forgive me. That's what it does.

193
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,720
Right. Yeah.

194
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,640
It's a convention, a conventional type engine.

195
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,480
Of course, you have a propeller too that can can displace air and whatnot.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,320
These vehicles are different.

197
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,320
These vehicles, for the most part, didn't have any type of associated

198
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,640
characteristic that you or I or any normal person would associate

199
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,280
with with the plane, with an airplane aircraft. Right.

200
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,120
But and yet it's flying. So how does an airplane work?

201
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,760
Well, let's say this cigar, for example, is an airplane

202
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,960
and there's four fundamental forces.

203
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,960
And so you have thrust, lift, drag and weight.

204
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,560
And if you understand those, you can create, build wings

205
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,160
and you create lift and you can fly.

206
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,680
And then you have to have an engine for that thrust and whatnot.

207
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,840
The things that our military pilots were encountering

208
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
didn't have that. They didn't have wings.

209
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,600
They didn't have rudders and ailerons and control surfaces.

210
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,080
They didn't have cockpits.

211
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,200
They didn't have engines and no obvious signs of propulsion.

212
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,000
They were they were doing things and maneuvering in ways that frankly

213
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,440
defied anything that that we had in our inventory.

214
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,080
And we were pretty certain the enemies didn't have either.

215
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,320
Our adversary didn't have these technologies either.

216
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,320
And even more perplexing is that they were being encountered

217
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,880
over controlled U.S. airspace and over sensitive military installations.

218
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,080
So, you know, from that perspective, you've got a real

219
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,560
you've got a real national security concern on your hands.

220
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,040
So you said video.

221
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,400
What was the do you remember the first thing that you saw?

222
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,320
Boy, there's so many.

223
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,400
You know, I think part of the challenge is that most people here in this country,

224
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,080
they're familiar with the three videos, right,

225
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,480
that have been famously released by the Pentagon.

226
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
The go fast, go fast, gimbal, FLIR. Correct. Right.

227
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,840
But those are those are the least compelling of all the videos

228
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,120
that the government has. Those were unclassified.

229
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,240
And so those were the ones

230
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,000
which are kind of the low hanging fruit that could be released to the general public.

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,760
There's stuff out there that's like 4K ultra high definition. Right.

232
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,240
So when you see something like that from a certain military platform

233
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,120
or a certain military equity or an intelligence collection platform,

234
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,880
you have to look at that and say, well, what what is that?

235
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,480
What the hell is that?

236
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,960
More importantly, that data is being backed up by radar data. Right.

237
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,800
So you've got you've got electro optical data like gun camera footage

238
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,560
or pod or FLIR FLIR video.

239
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,560
And then you've got radar data that's that's that is actually

240
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,520
confirming what the video is picking up.

241
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,600
And then you've got eyewitnesses that are also watching it. Right.

242
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,480
So you've got trained, trained observers, pilots that that can recognize

243
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,000
the silhouette between an SU-22 and a MIG-25 from 20 miles away

244
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,000
and make a split second decision.

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,560
Is it friend or foe? Do I kill it or is it do I let it live?

246
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,840
And they're reporting it.

247
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,360
So you have now, you know, three separate, if you will,

248
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,720
collection platforms that the human eye being one of them,

249
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,080
you've got gun camera footage and you've got radar footage

250
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,040
all describing the same event at the same place at the same time.

251
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
Under the same circumstances. Right.

252
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,560
And so keep in mind with my background as a former special agent

253
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,120
and counterintelligence, if this was in front of a jury,

254
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,320
you know, as I've said before, I think we're well beyond reasonable doubt.

255
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,880
That's that is something there.

256
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,200
I mean, that is real. That's not an atmospheric aberration.

257
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,920
It's not a, you know, anomaly.

258
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,880
That is that is something there. It's tangible.

259
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,320
So was there an aha moment for you?

260
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,920
Like the first thing that you saw that you looked at and you go,

261
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
what the fuck?

262
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,520
No, like I said, for me, it was more slow and gradual.

263
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,080
I didn't. What was the first thing that you saw that made you realize

264
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,480
that there's something going on here that defies conventional wisdom

265
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,840
or conventional understanding of propulsion systems?

266
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,360
I think for me, one of the most compelling moments was when I attended.

267
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
Boy, let me go back in memory banks.

268
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,560
I attended a dinner with some individuals

269
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,960
who were already associated with the larger umbrella program called ASAP.

270
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,040
And I attended dinner at a Washington, D.C.

271
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,080
hotel and a Brazilian general attended this this dinner.

272
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,840
And the dinner was sponsored by a gentleman named Robert Bigelow,

273
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
the famous billionaire hotel. Yeah, I've met him.

274
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,880
Yeah, I met him on the podcast. Yeah.

275
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,880
And by the way, he's he's an American hero. He's a patriot.

276
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,680
He's really he is brilliant.

277
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,120
And he's and people don't realize that he funded,

278
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,400
self-funded a lot of this stuff on behalf of the U.S.

279
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,920
government for by himself.

280
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,040
Like he paid it to do it himself.

281
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,760
He really is a, you know, an American patriot, in my opinion.

282
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,400
But anyways, he flew in this guy named General Uchoa.

283
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
General Uchoa was a Brazilian general,

284
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,000
very, very senior in the Brazilian government who led an investigation

285
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,640
about a an event that occurred over several days.

286
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,000
Is this the Varginha incident?

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,440
No, it's actually called Colares in Brazil.

288
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
Yeah. And the Colares incident.

289
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,680
And they had an overwhelming number of eyewitnesses.

290
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,240
And there was even some some video and photographs

291
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,080
that they had produced internally there to Brazil.

292
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,120
And it was overwhelming, the evidence.

293
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,320
And for me, that was it was more listening to him

294
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,000
and explain the concern they had and some of the interactions

295
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,360
the the Brazilian government officials had with these UAP that really

296
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,760
I left there that that dinner scratching my head and really

297
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,840
at that point beginning to absorb the profoundness that we're

298
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,240
dealing with something that like is real.

299
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,720
This is not a cover plan for some other technology we're trying to protect.

300
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,800
Did he show you this video evidence?

301
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,680
So he was it was I was sitting at the kind of like a table like this.

302
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,200
There was a whole lot of people at the table.

303
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
He was sitting at the head.

304
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,960
That was kind of way down over here.

305
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,560
And he brought a manila envelope and he was showing photographs to everybody.

306
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,600
Right. And some reporting as well.

307
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,520
I think he brought, if I recall correctly, his daughter to translate

308
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,640
because I don't think English was very good.

309
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,280
It wasn't his language.

310
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,000
But for me, that was and I think for one of my colleagues, too,

311
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,920
which I probably can't say his name right now because he hasn't come out publicly yet.

312
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,120
But we both left that dinner.

313
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,520
I think scratching our heads and saying, wow, this is so this is legit.

314
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,360
This is real. The US government is interested in this.

315
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,000
And there is interest by our government

316
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,880
as after that dinner, attending more meetings and beginning to read the reports,

317
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,440
the field reports and speaking to the scientists.

318
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,840
It became evident to me that this was a very serious issue.

319
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,360
We had near misses over some of our our our areas of operation.

320
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,840
In some cases, literally these these UAP splitting a combat formation.

321
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,800
Now, if you know how planes fly, they fly very close in a combat situation.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,160
These things were splitting the formation, right?

323
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,440
That that there were reports being being provided through the Air Force,

324
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,080
mostly through the Navy, about air safety issues

325
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,720
where pilots literally could run into these things.

326
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,200
Right. They're they're they're pervasive.

327
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,920
It wasn't like a onesie and twosies.

328
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,600
Was there ever an incident where a pilot or a jet did run into something?

329
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,440
Not that I'm aware of what I can tell you, that there has been incidents

330
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,920
where there appears to be some sort of provocation, where

331
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,720
one of these things seems to be coming deliberately close to an aircraft,

332
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,520
not necessarily trying to hit it,

333
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,720
but maybe trying to demonstrate performance capabilities.

334
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,240
There was one video in particular

335
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,920
having been cleared by the Pentagon.

336
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,360
So let me see if I can speak about it in general terms.

337
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,480
There's a pilot flying and a a a you can hear on the radio

338
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,040
this chatter back and forth.

339
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,480
Do you see it? You have eyes down on it.

340
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,680
Pilot. Nope. Negative. No eyes down.

341
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
OK, you should have on a radar.

342
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,240
Yeah, I got something on radar, but no eyes.

343
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,320
And I can't see it.

344
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,400
And then all of a sudden, a craft,

345
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,680
an object goes whizzing right by the cockpit.

346
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
And I mean, probably like 15 feet away.

347
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,160
And you can hear the pilot, the expletives of the pilot.

348
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,080
You know, I won't see it here on air, but you can imagine, right,

349
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,720
what what a pilot would say when they're very, very surprised.

350
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,080
That was one there.

351
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,280
Can you describe what he saw?

352
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,200
I think I can. I want to be careful that I don't,

353
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,640
because, again, I haven't had what I what I have approval to talk about.

354
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,760
I've I've spoken about.

355
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,160
Let me preface by saying I still have my security clearance.

356
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,280
And on occasion, I still will consult for the U.S. government.

357
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,360
And so I want to be very mindful.

358
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,120
I have no problem going up all the way to the line. Right. Understood.

359
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,360
But if I put up, you know, a pinky toe over that line, they're right.

360
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,120
Right. Right. Of course.

361
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,720
But it was a wedge shaped craft, wedge shaped, wedge shaped

362
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,880
like triangular, but

363
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,640
you know, like a wedge, like I don't know how to describe it.

364
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,880
I could draw it for you if you want to draw it. Sure. You can. Yeah.

365
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,440
So just like a wedge that you would like split wood with,

366
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,720
like that kind of a wedge.

367
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,480
Yeah. But it was it was silver metallic and like a like a diamond.

368
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,400
Maybe that's a better way to describe it, like a diamond almost.

369
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,120
And it looked kind of like it looked kind of like that.

370
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Really is just a just a little.

371
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,960
And that that kind of shape is something that's been reported multiple times.

372
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,560
So that was the first time I ever saw something like that.

373
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,640
To me, it was keep in mind, I never followed this topic.

374
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,200
So every time I'm seeing one of these videos,

375
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,040
I'm kind of seeing something for the very first time.

376
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,520
So lenticular, whether it's a disc shaped craft or it's it's a wedge shaped craft

377
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,680
or a diamond shaped craft or triangle shaped craft boomerang in some cases.

378
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,360
These were all new to me.

379
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,520
So it was very, very perplexing.

380
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,920
And obviously, to our military pilots, it was very concerning.

381
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,680
And I think when you when you look at some of the gold standard cases

382
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,480
we had, like the Nimitz, for example, that that that case,

383
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,520
you know, you have this overwhelming number of sensors

384
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,480
looking at the same thing going on that the pilots are reporting.

385
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,240
And for me, that was most compelling, like I said, more than

386
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,840
eyewitness testimony is important.

387
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,440
But at the end of the day, you know, grandma seeing some lights in her

388
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,600
backyard doesn't really do it for me.

389
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,000
You know, I'm a fact oriented kind of guy.

390
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,040
I've got to see the data, let the data.

391
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,160
Provide us the information we need so then we can make a conclusion, right?

392
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,880
I'm not, you know, if you start seeing UFOs in the sky everywhere,

393
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,880
well, chances are they're probably not, you know, it was a quadcopter,

394
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,320
it's a balloon, it's an aircraft, it could be all sorts of things.

395
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,000
That's why I think from our perspective, having the fundamental categories,

396
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,160
the observables, we call them, was so important because they are so beyond

397
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,400
what what a normal aircraft, a traditional conventional aircraft can do.

398
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,680
At that point, you realize you're dealing with some some sort of beyond

399
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,480
next generation technology.

400
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,600
And that's when it gets compelling for guys like me. Right. Right.

401
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,480
When you're when you're seeing when you're seeing performance

402
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,320
capabilities that far exceed far surpass anything we have.

403
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,080
And I'm talking even the very, very best technology we have.

404
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,240
We don't come close to that.

405
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,640
And no visible means of propulsion.

406
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,000
No, or obvious signs of lift. Right.

407
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,840
And not even a cockpit.

408
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,480
You have to scratch your head and see what's going on.

409
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,400
Interestingly, I'll share. So no windows. No windows.

410
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,600
Well, in some cases, no windows.

411
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,320
Other cases, people will report what they think are windows.

412
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,000
They say, oh, I saw windows.

413
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,600
But at the end of the day, you know, we're we're we're looking

414
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,160
that in terms of what we think a window is. Right.

415
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,280
You see a car, you see windows or those are windows.

416
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,320
I didn't see any information to suggest that there were actually windows,

417
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
even though an eyewitness might describe a window,

418
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,440
because we are describing in something of something that we recognize. Right.

419
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,720
And so we say, oh, that might be a window or not.

420
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,120
But it might not be a window.

421
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,960
And so I want to be very careful to to say there were no windows.

422
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,480
There could have been.

423
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,240
But the ones that I was privy to that I saw, I didn't see any obvious

424
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
signs of like a windshield or a window.

425
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,120
I didn't see anything like that.

426
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,200
I saw vehicles that were doing things that were

427
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,400
were just left you scratching your head.

428
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,760
And they were real, like I said, because you're

429
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,840
backing it up with all this other sensor data.

430
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,800
And some of the best sophisticated sensor data, by the way,

431
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,560
at the time on the planet that we had, right, like the spy one radar

432
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,560
and the two Hawkeye and some of the other radar capabilities

433
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,240
and technical capabilities that other intelligence agencies have

434
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,760
that I can't discuss here.

435
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,800
You know, that this is the stuff that that helps us put.

436
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,760
Forgive the analogy here.

437
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,280
But warheads on foreheads.

438
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,800
We when we're going to take a strike against a terrorist,

439
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,840
these are the same sensor systems we use to to to prosecute that war,

440
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,160
that that that act both in combat and not in combat.

441
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,960
So yeah, that's that for me was was was very compelling.

442
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,760
And it's lots and lots of videos.

443
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,400
People think that there's only three videos there.

444
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,960
There's those are those those don't even scratch the surface.

445
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,640
There are hundreds and hundreds of videos that that the intelligence

446
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,440
community and the Department of Defense have on these things.

447
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,920
Has there ever been any discussion about releasing any of these?

448
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,120
I don't want to speak on behalf of the government. I

449
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,720
colleagues of mine, like Chris Mellon, who have been very, very, very active

450
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,800
in this topic and have actually been responsible for a lot of what we see

451
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,160
now happening in Congress, has been championing that.

452
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,160
He is the one who says, look, we need more videos to come out

453
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,040
so the American people can see for themselves what we've been dealing with.

454
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,680
When I had Chris Mellon in the Pentagon, he saw those videos.

455
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,480
And up to that point, he you know, he had been when he was a senior person

456
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,280
at the Pentagon, like very senior, one of his jobs as the senior intelligence

457
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,160
official, he asked, hey, do we have any UAP UFO videos, investigations,

458
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,920
anything like that? And he told him no.

459
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,640
So when he came to the Pentagon and saw what we actually did have,

460
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,480
you can imagine someone like Chris Mellon, right?

461
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,600
He wasn't very happy.

462
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,160
He was he was actually pretty, pretty disappointed saying, why?

463
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Why was I told, no, I can I can see these videos clearly.

464
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,600
I see the reports there.

465
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Clearly, this is something that we're interested in as a Department of Defense.

466
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,320
And yet when I was one of the senior guys, he got the Heisman, right?

467
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,160
He was he was being told no.

468
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,520
And so that's that was, I think, a point for him that really

469
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,440
that's probably the I don't want to speak for my friend, Chris, but I suspect

470
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,960
that was probably the spark that got him to the point where he said, OK,

471
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,320
we have to do something about this.

472
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,720
This is this is this is BS.

473
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah. When I was talking to him, it seemed like that was his perspective,

474
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,840
that this was something that really should be,

475
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,320
and at least in some way, shape or form, released to the general public,

476
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,360
just to solidify the conversation, just to let people know like these are real.

477
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,800
This is a real thing.

478
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,640
These are not just if you've seen the one that people were filming

479
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,400
just a couple of days ago in Palmdale, California.

480
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,960
Yeah, I think they said those were drones.

481
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
So if I'm not mistaken, I think the jury came out.

482
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
If I'm not mistaken, I could be wrong

483
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,320
that it was a it was somebody using drones with some LED lights,

484
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,400
which, by the way, wild things with drones.

485
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,480
Now, you absolutely can create images in the sky.

486
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,240
One hundred percent dragons and stuff with.

487
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,760
Yeah, absolutely.

488
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,760
So, you know, we have to be careful as our own technology begins to advance.

489
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
There's going to be pranksters out there, you know,

490
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,080
and that's one of the things that for me in ATIP,

491
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,440
I always went into an investigation or a case

492
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,560
assuming that it was manmade, right?

493
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,120
And until I saw the compelling data that said otherwise,

494
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,960
we were always going to assume or presume that this was something

495
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,880
that was conventional.

496
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,800
It was probably misidentified, but it wasn't it wasn't exotic.

497
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,800
And then once the data suggests otherwise,

498
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,920
then you kind of go into that that that other motive.

499
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,360
OK, now what what are we dealing with again,

500
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,200
especially on the backdrop of the five performance

501
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,040
observables?

502
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,600
That's when you start to say, OK, yeah, this is this is not a

503
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,440
this is not an F-16.

504
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,840
You know, this is not a this is not a Chinese aircraft.

505
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,760
This is this is something different. Right.

506
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,480
What is the oldest video footage or film footage

507
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,960
that you have ever seen or heard civilian or military?

508
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,840
Because what is the oldest where it's like, OK, what the fuck is this?

509
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,520
What's the oldest stuff that's compelling?

510
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,840
Because the point is what I'm trying to get at is a lot of people

511
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,440
point to the possibility that there's some sort of a secret program,

512
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,440
some sort of secret propulsion, gravity based, whatever it is,

513
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,240
that's completely different than conventional propulsion systems

514
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,760
that the U.S. government has and that they're operating these drones.

515
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,280
And the problem with that is always the like

516
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,520
the Kenneth Arnold sightings, the Roswell, the sightings

517
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,200
from a time where that technology just wasn't available at all.

518
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,800
Joe, I'm so glad you asked me that question.

519
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,040
It just so happens I brought you something. Oh.

520
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,080
And glasses come out, you know, serious.

521
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,120
No, it just means it means I'm old to.

522
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,160
Yeah, I'm going to provide you a document here.

523
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,280
It's a it's a short document.

524
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,080
But the portions, I think, are highlighted

525
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,560
that you're going to want to pay attention to.

526
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,800
And let's see here. OK.

527
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,520
So if this is just for you and if your audience is interested,

528
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,280
it's this paragraph here you're going to want to read.

529
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,960
And then it's the last one that's highlighted.

530
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,920
And then take a look at the date and the subject line.

531
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,440
This is it right here. Jamie brought it up here. Oh, great.

532
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,880
Yeah. So which one paragraph six right now.

533
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,800
So if you want to scroll down to paragraph six. OK.

534
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,360
This summary of observations of aerial phenomenon has been prepared

535
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,640
for the purpose of reemphasizing and reiterating the fact that the phenomena

536
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,080
have continuously occurred in the New Mexico skies

537
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,400
during the past 18 months and are continuing to occur.

538
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,040
And secondly, that these phenomena are occurring

539
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,640
in the vicinity of sensitive military and government installations.

540
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,880
And if you want to go back to like paragraph two, there you go.

541
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,240
The highlighted part. Yeah.

542
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,320
The observers of the observers of those phenomenon include scientists,

543
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,240
special agents of the Office of Special Investigations,

544
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,400
the US Air Force, airline pilots, military pilots,

545
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,680
Los Alamos security inspectors, military personnel

546
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,280
and many other persons of various occupations

547
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,800
whose reliability is not questioned.

548
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,120
And now scroll to the top of the very top of that document.

549
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,040
And it says that it was determined that above that,

550
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,680
the summary of observations of aerial phenomenon in the New Mexico area,

551
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,720
December 1948 to May 1950.

552
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,200
And the date of that document, if you scroll a little bit higher,

553
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,040
you are going to see the date of that memo.

554
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,520
Oh, 1950. Yes, sir. May 25th, 1950.

555
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,920
It says that the it was determined that the frequency of unexplained

556
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,640
aerial phenomena in the New Mexico area was such that an organized plan of.

557
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,080
Reporting these observations should be undertaken. Right.

558
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,960
So this is the beginning of Project Blue Book.

559
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,720
So this is the the recognition

560
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,040
that we have a serious problem over our sensitive military installations.

561
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,920
This is nothing new.

562
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,000
This is not 1970s reverse engineered technology

563
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,080
or some sort of special to 1950.

564
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,960
They're talking about we had just broken the sound barrier

565
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,520
and we had not yet entered into space.

566
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,440
And we have these things that are performing in ways that, frankly,

567
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,800
we can't replicate.

568
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,640
I brought a few more of these later on to emphasize that point.

569
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,920
You just brought up at some point, if you're interested. Yeah.

570
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,320
But it highlights that these are official government documents

571
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,240
through official government personnel

572
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,160
raising the alarm bells, just like we did in ASAP and ATIPS.

573
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,520
And so this is nothing new.

574
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,200
Now, if you want to look at this from an adversarial perspective,

575
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,240
let's our governors already said that's not ours. Right.

576
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,400
If you look at a 1950s saber jet, for example,

577
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,480
it wasn't even supersonic.

578
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,240
And yet these things that we are observing in some cases are doing

579
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,040
about some more documents here, multiples of of mock

580
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,160
at doing velocities and doing things that we frankly could not do back then.

581
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,760
And frankly, we still can't do in some cases.

582
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,120
But temporarily speaking, the only two countries in the world

583
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,840
may may have a chance of doing something like that would be Russia and China.

584
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,160
And now in 1950, where was China was in the middle of a famine

585
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,920
at the time. And where was Russia?

586
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,320
Russia was trying to develop the atomic bomb

587
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,960
and still was using horse drawn carts for a lot of their military operations.

588
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,280
So temporally speaking, it doesn't make sense.

589
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,640
This is this is the analogy I've used before, Joe, that it would be like

590
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,680
Sir Carter going into King Tut's tomb for the very first time in the 1920s,

591
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,000
discovering King Tut's tomb.

592
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And when he goes in, he finds a fully assembled 747 jet.

593
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,760
It doesn't make sense.

594
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,920
Temporarily speaking, they did not have that technology.

595
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,760
So is it possible, and I'll be very careful what I say,

596
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,600
that the U.S. government has some sort of exotic technology?

597
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,040
Well, my answer is I sure hope so, because, you know, we want to have

598
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,800
an advantage over our adversaries.

599
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,200
But in 1950, that wasn't the case. Right.

600
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,840
And do they have any film of these crafts from New Mexico?

601
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,760
There is film of many craft and not just New Mexico per se,

602
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,920
but over many military installations here.

603
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,280
I got another one for you. I'll provide you.

604
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,040
You don't have to waste your time reading it.

605
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,800
But the I think you'll appreciate this.

606
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,920
Take a look at the date of this and who it's to and who it's from.

607
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,880
And I think you'll find the subject line very interesting.

608
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,640
OK, which one? What part of my reading here?

609
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,720
Just to highlight a portion.

610
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,480
So you can see the top of the document, who it's from, who it's to in the date

611
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,080
and what the subject line is.

612
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,120
Director of Special Investigate.

613
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,400
What does it say? It's hard because it's all scratchy.

614
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,480
Yeah, it's an old reproduction of official government document.

615
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,200
Bottom line, it's a it's a document from J. Edgar Hoover.

616
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,040
Oh, I see.

617
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,240
From the director of the FBI Department of the Air Force, the Pentagon.

618
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,400
Yeah, J. Edgar Hoover, director of Federal Bureau of Investigations.

619
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,560
And the subject read the subject line of that memo.

620
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,960
Flying. God, it's good.

621
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,560
It's hard to read because it's all screwy.

622
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,960
Flying disks, I should say, flying disks over the savanna.

623
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,520
It's a there's a sensitive facility that we had where we were doing atomic

624
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,480
development. Yeah.

625
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,600
Flying disks reportedly seen in the vicinity of something.

626
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,640
River plant, savanna, river plant. Yes, sir. OK, that's correct.

627
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,160
And so that's atomic energy. Yeah.

628
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,200
And the date of that being, you know, 1952. Right.

629
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,560
So so so this is an this is verified.

630
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,280
This is that was released by the government.

631
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
That is a those are all official.

632
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,880
All these are official U.S.

633
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,240
government documentation that anybody can pull up any time they want.

634
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,600
Did they let you see any of these ancient films, these films from the 1950s

635
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,560
of these things? So great question.

636
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,160
Our focus was really more modern time.

637
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,280
It was more like a picture of where we are now.

638
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,520
I mean, wouldn't you want to just like if you if you really think this thing

639
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,800
is from somewhere else, the best example of it definitely not being ours

640
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
is something from the 1950s. Sure.

641
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,880
And anecdotally, that that's that's great.

642
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,560
But keep in mind on the backdrop of national security,

643
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,520
when you go to a general and you clean this up, by the way, crazy.

644
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,680
It's like half the things blotted out and scratching.

645
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,120
Yeah, that's Uncle Sam for you.

646
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,040
You know, when you go to a general or it makes me suspicious.

647
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,040
No, you can find that. I know, I know, I know.

648
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,120
But it was just like, yeah, the government released that.

649
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,160
I mean, they they admit that that's fucking shitty old 1920 fax machine.

650
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,600
Look at that. Well, they remember they were using typewriters back then, too.

651
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,320
Right. And ink smears.

652
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,000
Yeah, blotchy.

653
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,200
And I'm sure the original is probably much, much cleaner.

654
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,160
But that's what the government put out online for people to review.

655
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,640
So when you're going back to your quite answer your question,

656
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,800
when you are going to a general or you're going to a military leader

657
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,760
about this topic, if you go back to anecdotal stuff like, oh,

658
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,720
this is something from 1950s, they're not interested.

659
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,960
They're like, look, what is going on now? Right.

660
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,880
What is what is the threat now?

661
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,920
I've got a carrier strike group out in the water.

662
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,720
I'm getting reports.

663
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,320
These things are coming in and interrogating the ship.

664
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,720
You know what? I want to see that.

665
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,760
I want to see the videos. I want to see the reporting.

666
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,320
I want to see the deck logs and what the commander says.

667
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,120
And I want to know the pilots.

668
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,280
I want to talk to the pilots, the radar operators. Right.

669
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,240
That's their focus. They're not interested.

670
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,160
And by the way, we've tried a few times.

671
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,320
And the further back in time we go, the less interested they were.

672
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,240
So it was really interesting.

673
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,480
Yeah. It was really the current information.

674
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
What's going on now? I'm not interested in what happened.

675
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,280
They're just taking a pragmatic approach. Yeah.

676
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,640
Yeah. And it's you know, it's understandable.

677
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,280
From a military perspective, a national security perspective,

678
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,080
the other stuff is interesting.

679
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,080
And from the general public's perspective, you know, they're interested.

680
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,320
But from a national security perspective, they're like, hey, man,

681
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,960
that was three decades ago. Right.

682
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,200
Makes sense. I need I need now.

683
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,000
So it is understandable.

684
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,160
A little frustrating because you want to you want to demonstrate.

685
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,720
Look, boss, this is this is nothing new, right?

686
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,560
This is this is a repeated pattern that we're seeing here.

687
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
But they're more interested in the here and now.

688
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,040
So do they have repeated footage because you're seeing three decades?

689
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,600
But obviously, we're talking about 1950.

690
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,400
Do they have stuff from the 1980s or from the 1990s?

691
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
There was reporting. Yeah.

692
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,600
And again, I got to be careful because some of that stuff

693
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,720
I haven't been clear to talk about.

694
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,080
But there there are reports

695
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,200
we call foreign intelligence, FI, foreign intelligence reports.

696
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,600
I can't say where or who or anything like that.

697
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,760
But on classified systems where we know without a shadow of a doubt,

698
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,000
UAPs were encountered in other countries, adversarial countries.

699
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,600
Why? Because we spy on them and we know.

700
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,600
Again, I can't say how we know and whatnot.

701
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,040
I understand trouble, but just so we know this is not a United States phenomenon.

702
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,920
Precisely. It is not a US only phenomenon.

703
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,720
And in fact, in other countries, whether it's in Latin America,

704
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,240
South America or in Europe or Russia and China,

705
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,920
there is an extreme interest in this topic.

706
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,960
In fact, the Chinese was in the newspaper.

707
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,760
I think it was a China Morning Sun.

708
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,280
There's something called the Five Continents Initiative,

709
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,680
where allegedly they were trying to broker a deal with the United Nations

710
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,240
that would allow China to run all the UFO investigations for the United Nations.

711
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,480
So we also know that Russia, they've come out and said,

712
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,840
yeah, we're interested in this topic.

713
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,280
There were some released old KGB footage that showed

714
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,960
MIG interactions with these UAP.

715
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,680
And there's also in Latin America, you have the same thing.

716
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,920
If you go to Latin America now, they don't have the same level of stigma

717
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,480
and taboo associated with this topic like we do.

718
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,840
And so they talk freely about it.

719
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,080
They have no problem talking.

720
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,800
In fact, when I was in in the Patagonia area of Argentina,

721
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,240
there is a near town called Bariloche and Las Lajas.

722
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,880
One of the chief of police was telling me they have there's an area

723
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,680
there called La Miranda.

724
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,880
La Miranda means to see, to view.

725
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,760
And they call it that the town.

726
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,560
And because UAP are so frequent there,

727
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,840
that local law enforcement actually built an observatory,

728
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,320
an observation post to look at these things,

729
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,880
because they were so frequent.

730
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
So this is not a new phenomenon.

731
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,680
This is something that's been around for quite a long time.

732
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,000
The problem is, in my opinion, and I could be wrong, but this is my assessment.

733
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,120
The reason why it's so difficult to have the conversation here

734
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,560
is because our government had placed so much emphasis and interest

735
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,520
trying to stigmatize this topic that it almost worked too well.

736
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,440
Now we're at the point where we should be having this conversation

737
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,960
and people still don't want to because they think it's crazy.

738
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,640
You think of tinfoil hats and Elvis on the mothership.

739
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,360
But in reality, we're talking about a real national security issue.

740
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,520
I mean, these things are here.

741
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,440
You you have, Joe, you have a former director of national intelligence,

742
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,080
Radcliffe, a former director of CIA.

743
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,680
Brennan, you have former presidents all coming out and saying,

744
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,520
yeah, there's something to it. It's real. Right.

745
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,080
Now, what it is, where it's from and all that stuff.

746
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,840
I'm not sure we're quite ready to go there yet.

747
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,160
But the acknowledgement is, hey, man, yeah, this is real.

748
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,840
It's not ours. And we probably should do something about it.

749
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,360
So if we go back to the history of the debunking of it,

750
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,480
you know, like the Project Blue Book stuff, J.

751
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,240
Allen Heineck, after he had left Project Blue Book,

752
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,840
he became a proponent of UFO disclosure

753
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,160
during Project Blue Book.

754
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,880
He it was his job to essentially dismiss everything

755
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,200
and to come up with some sort of a reason, swamp gas,

756
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,960
mass hallucinations, whatever it was to attribute

757
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,600
all these sightings to something that was very easy to explain.

758
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,000
Did they ever is there any documentation

759
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,480
or any discussion of why they did that,

760
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,800
why they chose to debunk everything?

761
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,200
Yeah, my understanding is if you have to look at where America was

762
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,480
at the time they were doing these investigations,

763
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,600
it was at the height of the Cold War. Right.

764
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,360
And, you know, despite what some people think,

765
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,960
the Cold War wasn't very cold at all. It was pretty hot.

766
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,520
And we had Russia and the United States engaging in these proxy wars.

767
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,840
Neither side wanted to let the other side

768
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,080
know what we had and what we didn't know. Right.

769
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,800
So if you have these UAP coming in and out,

770
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,200
the last thing you want to do is tell the other side broadcast.

771
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,840
This is what we've learned from it.

772
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,280
And more importantly, this is what we don't know about it. Right.

773
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,560
And so both sides were keeping this very quiet.

774
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,560
But there was an interesting agreement at the classified level,

775
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,320
I believe, in the late 60s, where there was this relationship

776
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,280
with the United States.

777
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,320
We were putting up our northern tier radar system to detect

778
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,520
then Soviet Union ICBMs, and they were doing the same thing. Right.

779
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,520
Because none of us really trusted each other.

780
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,720
But we trusted each other enough to say, look, before you hit that button,

781
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,960
if you see something coming over the horizon, before you hit that button

782
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,680
and launch, give us a call, because it might be a UFO. Right.

783
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
And we don't want to start World War Three

784
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,760
because either side mistakes the UFO for an ICBM. Right.

785
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,440
And that's how serious they took the topic.

786
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,840
I mean, that's real. That's a real memo that that that existed

787
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,520
between the United States and Russia.

788
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,360
So that's that is an indicator

789
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,320
how much both sides took this topic seriously. Mm hmm. Jesus.

790
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,520
And so when Philip Corso was dismissing all these different things,

791
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,480
did they have anything, any film footage,

792
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,120
any any stuff from that time from Project Blue Book

793
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,440
that was like definitively not ours?

794
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,440
I'm not privy.

795
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,680
I'm aware of the fact that people say it does exist.

796
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,080
And people have been briefed on it.

797
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,480
I wasn't privy to that.

798
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,040
I was, again, more focused on the here and now. Right.

799
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,720
I was aware of people who had attended certain meetings,

800
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,120
very senior level meetings where that was discussed,

801
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,160
where they saw certain footage.

802
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,440
But that's I'm hearing that secondhand.

803
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,840
I I did not see the old footage.

804
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,160
My my focus was more on the on the current what's going on now.

805
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,840
But back to your point, why was this effort to try to create

806
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,360
so much stigma and taboo?

807
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,560
I think it was because of that.

808
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,800
I think because you had Russia and US at this weird stalemate

809
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,880
where neither one wanted to tell the other side what we know

810
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,240
and what we didn't know about UAP.

811
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,840
And really, I think the focus from a national security perspective,

812
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,880
let's say you're a general and I'm a general.

813
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,040
Look, we've got a real Cold War going on here right now.

814
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,960
As long as these things aren't coming in and zapping my people.

815
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,680
That's going to be my focus right now.

816
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,400
That's that's a real potential threat that I have to deal with now.

817
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,800
I've got Russia pointing nukes at me and I'm pointing nukes at them.

818
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,040
At any time we could launch.

819
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,360
Let's focus on that more so than the other stuff.

820
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,640
And that was that is that has been my observation

821
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,680
on why they didn't want to address the the the problem,

822
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,600
the challenge openly with the general public back.

823
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,800
And they also were worried there was there was several studies

824
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,160
that suggested that most people would be very uncomfortable with that idea,

825
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,840
that there's something else in the cosmos potentially or even right here on Earth,

826
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,840
and that it would create some sort of societal disruption.

827
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,920
Right. They didn't want to cause panic.

828
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,040
They were afraid that people would kind of like think of a run on Wall Street.

829
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,600
Right. When people get panic, they do kind of strange things sometimes.

830
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,400
And I think the government was very worried about that.

831
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,520
What's the most compelling modern thing that you've seen?

832
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,360
Oh, my God. I can't talk about it, unfortunately.

833
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,720
That's what that's this is my frustration, Joe, because I know what I see.

834
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,160
I know my colleagues are seeing right.

835
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,640
And to this day, there's there's video that's coming in on a regular

836
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,200
routine basis that is very, very compelling.

837
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,040
And how do they hide this stuff from the general public?

838
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,280
Well, we have classified systems behind a lot of it.

839
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,160
But how is it how is it getting filmed?

840
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,040
Is any of it getting filmed by the general public or is all this military stuff?

841
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,280
So let me backtrack a little bit.

842
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,640
This there is there there's a general public that is filming stuff.

843
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,880
But from a Department of Defense perspective, our focus now

844
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
arrows a different story.

845
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,200
But when I was in the government, we had to be very, very careful

846
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,440
of something that we called intelligence oversight.

847
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,320
Back in the 60s and 70s, the U.S.

848
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,760
intelligence apparatus, particularly in the Department of Defense,

849
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,480
was kind of naughty.

850
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,800
They were doing things they shouldn't do.

851
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,360
They were spying on students and they were spying on American citizens.

852
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,800
You don't do things. Yeah.

853
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,200
Crazy. So it isn't so.

854
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,760
So Congress passed some laws and said, OK, you can no longer

855
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,600
do this kind of stuff on on on on American citizens. Right.

856
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,840
You can't conduct intelligence operations on American citizens.

857
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,920
You can't do it. It's illegal. Right.

858
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,720
You have executive order 123 and all these other rules and laws

859
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,360
and DOD 5240.1 that all come out and say no mass.

860
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,400
So the Department of Defense is supposed to focus on military.

861
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,680
That's it. You don't you don't bring in U.S.

862
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,000
persons information and adjust them into a Department of Defense database,

863
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,000
especially a Department of Defense intelligence database.

864
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,600
That's a super no, no. That's called U.S.

865
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,120
persons information and it's pretty much forbidden.

866
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:54,360
So our focus was looking specifically at military sourced information.

867
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,200
I was not focusing at all on what the private citizens were seeing,

868
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,960
because at the end of the day, we couldn't use it.

869
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,000
You can't you can't do anything.

870
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,160
And it seems like you got plenty of compelling footage from the military.

871
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,800
Overwhelming, overwhelming.

872
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,360
It's there's absolutely no doubt that we didn't have to look at civilian data

873
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,920
because we had better collection sensor systems from the military

874
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,240
that was looking at stuff and giving us better insight.

875
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,800
If you can't tell us about can you give us some sort of an understanding

876
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,240
of like what you're talking about? Yeah, sure.

877
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,800
Without being specific. Yeah.

878
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,280
Let me see. OK. Yeah.

879
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,880
There is a video, high resolution video

880
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,360
of I can't say what platform was taken from.

881
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,000
I can't say where it was taken from.

882
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,200
But an object that, you know, do you know how large an offshore

883
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,480
oil derrick is? They're huge.

884
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,280
They're like almost like a small city, right?

885
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,760
They're like one city block. They're huge. They're enormous things.

886
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,320
There is a video that shows one of these objects underwater

887
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,280
that goes by.

888
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,800
The speed was calculated between 450 and 550 knots underwater.

889
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,920
And it was bigger than the offshore derrick that it was passing,

890
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,320
because you could see in the video the offshore derrick

891
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,320
and you could see this thing zip right by it.

892
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,040
Jesus. Yeah.

893
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,520
So that's a lot of them, right?

894
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,320
A lot of them are reported as being transmedium. Right.

895
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,960
So that exactly why. Why do we use the term UAP? Right.

896
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,720
Now it's unidentified anomalous phenomenon because it's all domain.

897
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,840
Initially was UFO, unidentified flying object.

898
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,840
And for several reasons, they changed the name.

899
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,120
One of them, not just because of stigma, like people think,

900
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,080
but because the word flying object means flight.

901
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,320
And you have to have wings to fly. That's flight.

902
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,680
And these things don't have wings.

903
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,720
So that term, we're not even sure is even accurate anymore

904
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,480
because they're not necessarily flying.

905
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,160
We see them underwater.

906
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,320
We see them super high altitude.

907
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,200
So the term was changed to unidentified aerial phenomenon.

908
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,760
But again, that did not encompass all the observations we were seeing.

909
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,200
So now the term UAP, I think the latest

910
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,880
description of it is unidentified anomalous phenomenon

911
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,360
to help describe this multi-domain or transmedium

912
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:17,080
characteristic that we are beginning to see and record that these things can do.

913
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,760
And that's that is I'm going to, if I can digress for a second,

914
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,360
because that's super important, Joe, we have transmedium vehicles, right?

915
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,960
We have things like seaplanes and it's a plane and it can float on water.

916
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,480
But let's face it, a seaplane is neither a really good plane

917
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,960
or a really good boat, because it's a compromise.

918
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,760
It's a design compromise between an object that you want to perform

919
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,040
in the air and in the sea.

920
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,200
And that's why it's neither really good at both.

921
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,160
Same thing with, for example, the space shuttle goes out into space

922
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,360
and it can glide down, but it's not a very good airplane, comes down like a brick,

923
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,240
you know, because there's design compromises and performance compromises.

924
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,120
But what we are seeing doesn't have any of that attributable compromise.

925
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,360
It's not these objects aren't slowing down.

926
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,280
They're not changing their their their performance capabilities.

927
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,520
They can do the same thing that we're seeing in the air and possibly in space

928
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,040
and even underwater.

929
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,680
So that is a that is a fundamentally different

930
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,800
type of technology than we are used to dealing with.

931
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,680
Is the assumption that they are doing something with space, time

932
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,400
and gravity around them?

933
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,560
Rather than using something like a jet propulsion engine

934
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,560
that blasts fire out the back and it makes it go fast forward, right?

935
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,480
That they're doing something that alters the gravity around them.

936
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,160
Yeah. So that's why they can go through everything.

937
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,640
Yeah. So we had some of the best scientists on the team,

938
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,880
folks like Dr.

939
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,520
Hal Pudoff and some other folks that I'm not allowed to say their names.

940
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,720
Dr. Davis and some others that were doing the calculations,

941
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,400
mathematical calculations on how this is possible.

942
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,800
And the consensus was by by the scientists, not me,

943
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,120
because I'm not a physics expert and I'm not an astrophysicist.

944
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,840
They were saying that.

945
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,120
So let me back up here.

946
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,680
Initially, the government for years was trying to identify

947
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,200
the different exotic technologies that could explain the different

948
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,360
performance characteristics.

949
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,920
And it was during the eight years that the scientists had this consensus

950
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,520
that if you had one type of technology, if you could do one thing,

951
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,600
all these other observables now become possible.

952
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,760
Kind of think of like a unifying theory.

953
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,960
And so if you had the ability to to create this bubble around you

954
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,680
in a localized area that insulated you from the effects of Earth's gravity.

955
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,520
Now, what is gravity?

956
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,560
People think that, you know, when I drop my glasses, that's gravity.

957
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,920
That's not gravity. That's an effect of gravity.

958
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,960
Gravity is the warping of space time.

959
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,840
And that's important because people don't think you hear the term

960
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,080
thrown around a lot, but they don't realize that space and time

961
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,480
are actually connected.

962
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,640
They are they are they are one of the same.

963
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,080
They're opposite sides, if you will, of the same coin.

964
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,880
And so you can't have one without the other.

965
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,800
And so you have this ability to create a bubble around you

966
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,240
that insulates you from the warping of space time.

967
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,600
Let's say in this case, Earth's gravity or something like that.

968
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,520
Then the way you experience time

969
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,000
inside that bubble is perhaps fundamentally different

970
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,280
than the way you might experience space time outside that bubble,

971
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,520
because you're not you're not subject to the effects of gravity,

972
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,520
which would explain potentially potentially why things don't need wings

973
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,960
and why they don't need propulsion systems like that. Right.

974
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,800
So it's a completely different way of looking at

975
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,520
at how we understand physics and how we as humans

976
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,840
move about. Everything we do is fundamentally force

977
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,360
equals mass times acceleration.

978
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,720
F equals m a right mass times acceleration in your force.

979
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,280
This may be something a little bit different.

980
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,040
This is this is not using a set again, conventional thrust.

981
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,680
Or if I put in a Newtonian, right, if I if I push this way,

982
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,640
I have an equal and opposite reaction that way. Right.

983
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,880
That's how there are any theories as to how it's accomplishing this.

984
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,200
There is actually Dr.

985
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,240
Hal Pudoff about three years ago gave a speech on this.

986
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:22,680
A very interesting talk lecture about this technology.

987
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,720
And if you ever had the chance, you really should have him on

988
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,960
because he's a he's a he's incredible human being.

989
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,360
He's also the one who helped start the government's

990
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,200
remote viewing program and a bunch of other stuff for the government.

991
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,960
He's been involved in a lot of our nation's probably most most classified efforts.

992
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,520
But he was working with us on ATP as one of our scientists.

993
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,760
And he gave a lecture about three years ago to some other scientists

994
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,960
about the specifics on how this is possible.

995
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,280
I am not a scientist.

996
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,440
So I'm definitely not going to speak on behalf of Hal Pudoff,

997
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,240
because I'm sure I will muck it up.

998
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,760
But I do recall a time when he came into our skiff

999
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,760
and gave us about a three hour lecture on this unifying theory.

1000
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,760
And at that moment, it was very much for us the epiphany

1001
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,280
that a lot of us had been searching for.

1002
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,320
He's like, look, at the end of the day, this is how it's possible.

1003
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,120
And that was kind of this wow.

1004
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,920
So it's really not can you give us a moron's view of how it's possible?

1005
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,720
Yeah. Explain it to someone like me.

1006
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,280
Yeah, well, I'm in that category, Joe.

1007
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,400
So, you know, we're speaking the same language.

1008
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,360
Yes, sir. Yeah.

1009
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,920
Single syllable grunts, right?

1010
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,280
Yeah. So you have you have an object

1011
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,040
like this cup on your table and you want it to

1012
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,000
be insulated from the effects of Earth's gravity.

1013
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,120
So you you create this bubble artificially

1014
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,160
using a certain energetic source at a certain frequency

1015
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,640
and interacts with certain material, certain metamaterial.

1016
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,040
And again, I got to be careful exactly what I say,

1017
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,280
but certain skin of the craft, this aluminum, the cup here.

1018
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,400
And all of a sudden, you have this bubble around you

1019
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,640
where what you see on the outside is not necessarily what you see on the inside.

1020
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,560
In fact, may do it more drawing for you.

1021
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,320
OK, forgive me. I'm not an artist.

1022
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,840
So I'm going to do this upside down for you.

1023
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,080
And then I'm going to kind of scoot this just a little here.

1024
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,960
All right. Let's do this.

1025
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,280
So. Unfortunately, I know your audience can't see this,

1026
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,720
but actually, it's OK. Some people can.

1027
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,880
There's a video form of it.

1028
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,960
I'm sure this will get a little bit on YouTube as well.

1029
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,920
It's probably good that they don't, because I'm not an artist.

1030
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,400
But let's say this is a two dimensional representation

1031
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,760
of a three dimensional space. OK.

1032
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,400
And in essence.

1033
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,680
So what you've done is essentially you've created a three dimensional

1034
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,000
looking grid stacked, it looked like stack boxes on top of each other.

1035
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,960
Yeah, right. And so you have this you have location A and location B.

1036
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,000
And let's say go from Los Angeles to Baltimore.

1037
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,880
OK. And it takes me five hours to fly at five hundred miles an hour.

1038
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,600
That's a function of distance over time.

1039
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,920
And in essence, you can mark that linearly like this.

1040
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,720
So I fly, take me five hours to fly.

1041
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,840
So I fly, take me five hours.

1042
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,160
There I am. OK.

1043
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,840
If you had the ability to compress space time and not a lot, just a little bit,

1044
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:18,560
and you were able to allow these points to be a little closer together.

1045
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,760
Now, in essence, what took you, let's say, five hours

1046
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,680
and five hundred miles an hour to do it,

1047
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,920
you can do it in one hour and you can do it in much less time.

1048
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,120
But to the observer outside,

1049
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,120
because we're still in the same universe, we would see something like that.

1050
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:42,200
We would see this incredible hopscotching ability to to, if you will,

1051
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,560
take a shortcut through space time.

1052
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,000
And so what would appear to be instantaneous acceleration,

1053
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,400
hypersonic velocity and other things

1054
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,040
now becomes a reality.

1055
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,760
And so that is that is fundamentally

1056
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,280
what what the scientists had discovered.

1057
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,920
And so it seems like science fiction.

1058
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,800
But when you understand the mathematics and some of the theorem

1059
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,400
that they propose, a lot of these other observables become possible.

1060
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,640
So these are essentially just theoretical explanations

1061
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,360
of how these things are moving.

1062
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,760
Yeah. And again, I'm not I'm not a scientist.

1063
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,840
I want to be very careful.

1064
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,000
You know, I don't want to misrepresent anything.

1065
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,360
There's a whole lot of other stuff that if you can do that,

1066
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,000
all of a sudden now makes sense and may describe

1067
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,480
the observations that people are are are seeing

1068
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,480
and why they're kind of hard to see and they seem obscure. Right.

1069
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,640
And so I think from from a from a governmental perspective that

1070
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,200
it was kind of a revelatory moment for for for the folks in our in our program.

1071
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,840
So they realized one of the reasons why these things are weird looking

1072
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,200
is because they're literally creating one light.

1073
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,840
Do you mind? I'm sorry.

1074
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,000
I can't take this. Thank you.

1075
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,840
So the back thing, the other side,

1076
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,240
push that down. There you go.

1077
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,840
Bam. Thank you very much.

1078
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,080
No problem. So how how much of this is theoretical

1079
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,920
and how much of this is observed from recovered vehicles?

1080
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,600
I am not allowed to talk about what the government may or may not have

1081
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,040
in its possession other than that.

1082
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,960
I have so I went through a very lengthy Pentagon review process recently.

1083
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,960
I I wrote I won't talk about it here, but I wrote something

1084
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,000
and I had to go through Pentagon to have a review process.

1085
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And it took almost a year

1086
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,200
in this this thing I wrote.

1087
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,560
I I talk about up to the up to the part I can talk about.

1088
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,240
And they approved for me to talk about up to that point.

1089
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,000
When it comes to what the government may or may not have in its possession,

1090
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,080
all I can simply say is that there is very compelling evidence

1091
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,920
to suggest that the U.S. government is in absolute possession

1092
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,960
of exotic material that is not made by humans.

1093
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,400
Now, beyond that, I can't really expound upon.

1094
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,320
I haven't been given permission to talk about it.

1095
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,240
But what I can say is what I've already said for the record,

1096
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,200
which has been approved by the Pentagon.

1097
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,640
Won't get in trouble by saying it is that that that we are

1098
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,600
there's very compelling data to suggest that we are in possession.

1099
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Why is the Pentagon teasing us?

1100
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,560
Why do they tell you?

1101
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:30,320
Why are they allowing you to say we are in possession of something

1102
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,600
that was not made by human beings, but not allowed to elaborate,

1103
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,000
not allowed to show these very compelling videos

1104
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,920
that you're talking about that you've seen?

1105
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,200
I don't. Well, two reasons.

1106
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,640
I don't think they have a choice.

1107
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,920
I think with now the introduction of cell phones

1108
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,720
and ring cameras, the cat's out of the bag.

1109
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,080
It's the worst kept secret at this point.

1110
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,800
Two, there is a faction, unlike before in the Cold War.

1111
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,800
I believe there is a faction of people inside the government

1112
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,400
that do want this conversation to occur.

1113
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,520
But equally, there's still a faction of people that are very mad with me.

1114
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,080
They do not want me having this conversation and mark my words.

1115
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,960
Just by me being on your show, it is going to cause an absolute storm

1116
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,520
inside the Pentagon.

1117
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,000
And I am sure the other shoe is going to drop.

1118
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,920
I promise you it's going to be you're going to hear all sorts of stuff.

1119
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,560
People make stuff up about me trying to discredit this topic,

1120
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,440
because as many people are in the government that want this topic

1121
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,880
to be discussed now, there's still some people that do not want this.

1122
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,880
Could you steel man their position?

1123
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,680
Say again, steel man their position, meaning could you argue it

1124
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,680
from their perspective? Absolutely.

1125
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,280
Like why would it be a good reason to keep this stuff quiet? Sure.

1126
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,120
And I want to preface here, I'm not I'm not fear mongering.

1127
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:48,160
No, no. But look, if I was if I was a military person, right,

1128
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,640
I would look at this from the perspective of there's three options.

1129
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,440
They're good, they're neutral or they're bad.

1130
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,880
So let's go down this road for a second.

1131
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,000
Let's say they're good, right?

1132
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,640
Well, we've got nothing to worry about.

1133
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,280
The problem is there's nothing to suggest that they truly are benevolent.

1134
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,200
People say, well, you know, they're like they don't want us to nuke ourselves.

1135
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,360
Well, you know, I discuss it in what I wrote that there's no

1136
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,480
there's no there's no data to suggest that they didn't stop us

1137
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,720
from dropping atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki

1138
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,120
and vaporizing 500000 living souls.

1139
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,400
They didn't stop us when we started developing nuclear weapons

1140
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,280
from the atomic age.

1141
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,160
They didn't stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

1142
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:34,040
They didn't stop the testing in the Nevada range of atomic and nuclear weapons.

1143
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,960
And now how many countries have atomic weapons and nuclear weapons?

1144
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,920
A lot, right?

1145
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,680
They didn't stop Chernobyl.

1146
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,240
They didn't stop Fukushima.

1147
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,880
They didn't stop Three Mile Island.

1148
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:48,200
So to say that they're here to help us, I'm not sure there's there's data.

1149
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:53,680
People say, well, you know, in in in Minot and in North Dakota and Montana,

1150
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,680
they the UFOs came in and they stopped.

1151
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,640
They interfered with our nuclear weapons and they brought the entire

1152
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,280
echo flight offline, which, by the way, I have the government report on that

1153
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,600
if you want it.

1154
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,720
But in Russia, a lot of people don't know.

1155
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,280
They turned them on. Right.

1156
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,480
So that's equally scary.

1157
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,840
They're interfering with our nuclear capability, whether to attack

1158
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,480
or to defend ourselves.

1159
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,160
So when you say they turned them on in Russia, this is a Russian report.

1160
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,840
Yeah. So this is a I don't know if you remember the

1161
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,760
hearing congressional hearing that occurred last year, where the

1162
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,320
note, the other one with Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence,

1163
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,680
Ronald Moultrie and some people from the Navy.

1164
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,160
And I think it was Congressman Gallagher that asked the very specific

1165
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,080
question. And he said, are you aware of

1166
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,000
UFOs interfering with our nuclear capabilities?

1167
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,480
And the response was something like, no, not really familiar with it.

1168
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,560
Never heard of it.

1169
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,440
And then the question was, I think we asked specifically at these locations

1170
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,920
and the government's response was no, not familiar with it.

1171
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,640
Well, here's the actual report from the Department of Defense.

1172
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,320
This is the actual intelligence report that was released through FOIA.

1173
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,960
There's a there's a gentleman out there who runs a site called the Black Vault.

1174
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,400
His name is John Greenwald.

1175
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,960
He's probably the world authority on Freedom of Information Act.

1176
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,640
And he has a wealth of data

1177
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,240
that is out available to the public that he has received from the government.

1178
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,240
This is one of those documents.

1179
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,960
This is the document that our own government has no idea

1180
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,800
apparently exists.

1181
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,120
I like how they write it in all caps.

1182
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,640
Yeah. Yeah. That's the old reporting.

1183
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:31,160
So obviously, there's some people that don't want this to be released.

1184
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,880
And obviously, there's some people that think that the general public

1185
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,120
has a right to know.

1186
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:40,080
I believe so. That's that's my that's been my observations in my experience.

1187
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:40,960
Well, that makes sense.

1188
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,760
You know, I mean, like when everybody says the CIA does this, like, OK, who?

1189
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,560
Well, in the CIA, I didn't finish the other parts, right?

1190
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,760
So if they're not here for friend, if they're not, it's not friendly.

1191
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,440
That leaves them neutral like us. Right. Or benevolent, benevolent.

1192
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,040
Now, from a military perspective, and I just want to caveat,

1193
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,320
I don't agree with this, but I can respect the understanding.

1194
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,880
You, sir, are a general.

1195
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,600
And I say to you and I say,

1196
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,640
we cannot prove that they're not here to do something bad.

1197
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,520
But what we do know is that they can interfere.

1198
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,040
They're very interested in our military capabilities.

1199
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,200
And they have interfered with our nuclear capabilities. Right.

1200
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,320
From a military perspective, that looks an awful lot like something

1201
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,320
we call IPB, initial preparations of the battle space, or perhaps even ISR,

1202
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,640
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.

1203
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,160
Whenever we're going to go into a foreign country and invade,

1204
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,600
we do long range surveillance.

1205
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,920
We want to know how the enemy operates, how they react.

1206
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:39,040
So even if there's a two percent chance, five percent chance

1207
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:43,960
that these things are are here to do something malevolent.

1208
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,320
Right. Mm hmm.

1209
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,520
Then we probably should not tip our hands to the fact

1210
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,040
that we are aware of it publicly, because what happens the moment

1211
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:57,160
that the bad guys in a foreign country find our surveillance team over the border?

1212
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,400
We've got 12 hours.

1213
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,560
We've got we got to invade because the element of surprise is now over.

1214
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,880
So some may feel in the government, the mere fact of acknowledging this,

1215
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,960
if there is some sort of malintent may push up artificially a clock

1216
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,600
that exists somewhere for these things to say, oh, OK,

1217
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,680
the the the foolish humans are now the cats out of the bag.

1218
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,880
They know where we're here.

1219
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,400
We need to go in now for whatever reason they may have.

1220
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,480
So that is the military mindset, potentially, of some of these individuals

1221
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,720
who want to keep this secret.

1222
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,720
So they're worried about an actual invasion.

1223
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,840
Well, but they have to be.

1224
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,240
That is that is the role of our national security apparatus. Right.

1225
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,240
Even if there's a one percent chance. Right.

1226
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,280
They have to consider that in their planning and in the decision making matrix.

1227
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,320
So, again, going back to what I said, I respect that.

1228
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,080
I don't agree with it, but I can respect that.

1229
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,160
If that is the reason why, then I would say, OK, look, in your heart,

1230
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,000
you really do have the best interests of the American people.

1231
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,240
You are a patriot.

1232
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,040
I can accept that. Again, I don't think it's your decision to make.

1233
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,320
I think needs to go to Congress.

1234
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,640
I think it needs to go to the president.

1235
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,960
Let the American people decide.

1236
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,600
I think I think America can handle the truth.

1237
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,640
I think America deserves the truth and let the American people decide

1238
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,360
if it's in their best interest.

1239
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,280
I agree with this, but I also could see it from their perspective.

1240
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,720
Like, they're probably insanely busy already.

1241
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,360
And the last thing they want to do is get involved in this thing

1242
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,160
where now they have a PR campaign when they're trying to let people

1243
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,160
know about this thing and not cause mass panic.

1244
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,600
That's right. That's right.

1245
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,720
But you know what, though, I'm also very optimistic, Joe,

1246
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,080
because you and I are having this conversation

1247
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,920
and people aren't making a run on Wall Street.

1248
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,440
People are still paying their mortgages, going to PTA meetings.

1249
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,600
And after the 2017 New York Times report, which was probably

1250
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,840
one of the biggest moments in UFO disclosure,

1251
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,920
because it was in the New York Times.

1252
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,400
And then you see something like that in the New York,

1253
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,280
especially in New York Times in 2017.

1254
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,480
People really respected it.

1255
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,920
It's like this is right.

1256
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,720
This is a real story.

1257
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,600
Well, and this is this is apolitical.

1258
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,240
I mean, how many topics can you go to Congress and have?

1259
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,080
That's not polarized. Right. Right. Right.

1260
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,720
This is one of the only ones where you can have literally have

1261
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,360
Congressman Burchette and Congresswoman AOC

1262
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,080
side by side, agreeing that this this is important. Right.

1263
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,760
This is this is it's a very rare opportunity.

1264
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,160
And so, you know, my concern,

1265
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,280
I'm doing this because I believe it's the right thing to do.

1266
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,560
And my concern is that we're at a point now where I've said before,

1267
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,240
you know, secrets aren't like a fine wine

1268
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,480
where the longer you keep a cork on it, the better it gets.

1269
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,640
I think secrets are perishable.

1270
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,640
I think they have a shelf life.

1271
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,280
I think they're like vegetables in your refrigerator.

1272
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,840
And there comes a point where if you leave them there too long,

1273
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,520
they start to rot and they start to stink

1274
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,600
and it becomes a big mess to clean up. Right.

1275
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,960
And so that's my perspective.

1276
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:45,680
And what I'm trying to do is give the government an ability

1277
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,480
to work its way out of a corner that it's put itself into

1278
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,720
for the last several decades and with no seeming way out. Right. Right.

1279
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,880
You look around like, well, how do we get ourselves out of this trip?

1280
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,480
Is there an issue of legality, like of of spending and like 100 percent?

1281
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,520
100 percent.

1282
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,640
So there's people that would be liable for. Yes.

1283
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,840
Not being straightforward with Congress.

1284
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,680
And I know people want their pound of flesh.

1285
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,160
I know there's people out there you we've been lied to for decades.

1286
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,760
And I want and then they make it a political issue. Right.

1287
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,000
Go after someone. Yeah.

1288
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,720
And I think that's the wrong approach.

1289
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,760
I think, you know, there was a time where we needed to keep this secret.

1290
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,880
And I think what you do is you you you give those guys awards,

1291
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,720
give those guys and gals awards who did it.

1292
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,160
Don't don't make them enemies.

1293
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,120
Make them friends and say, OK, look, but those were different times.

1294
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,720
Now is the time to to to come clean.

1295
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,240
Talk to the members of Congress.

1296
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,920
Forgive all the past sins.

1297
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,680
Yeah. Truth and reconciliation.

1298
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,400
Prosecution. 100 percent.

1299
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,920
And let's just get clear with all this and understand that it was all in good

1300
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,360
faith that you did it in the first place. 100 percent.

1301
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,320
Now, all in the interest of the United States security.

1302
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,280
You talk about legal issues.

1303
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,400
The problem is there are the real legal issues.

1304
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,360
So let's say you have again these cups. Forgive my analogies.

1305
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,680
You have two aerospace companies, company A, company B.

1306
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:02,400
And let's say I am in the Department of Defense back in the 50s, 60s.

1307
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,360
And I come across this interesting technology.

1308
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,520
I have no idea what the hell it is.

1309
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,280
It just came out of the sky.

1310
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,080
And I go to company and I said,

1311
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,000
tell me what you can figure out about that. Right. Right.

1312
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,960
Ten years later, company A becomes a multibillion dollar aerospace company.

1313
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,440
Company B goes bankrupt.

1314
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,760
Two hundred people lose their jobs.

1315
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,280
And now people who have stock investors in that company

1316
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,320
lose their money. Right. Unfair advantage.

1317
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,960
Keep in mind, you're supposed to have fair competition in the U.S. government.

1318
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,640
So if you give an unfair advantage to company A to B,

1319
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,400
you're talking a serious liability.

1320
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,000
There's SEC violations there.

1321
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,160
There's all sorts of concerns one has to pay attention to because someone

1322
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,480
somewhere gave an unfair advantage to one company over another.

1323
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:48,160
So there's there are legal liabilities that we have to we have to recognize.

1324
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,120
It's not just clear cut. OK, forgive and forget.

1325
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,120
You know, there's going to have to be some some additional protection

1326
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,800
and understanding for if if that occurred.

1327
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,960
We need to figure out how we deal with that as well.

1328
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,640
So that would be an impediment to release.

1329
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,200
That makes a lot of sense.

1330
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,440
Yeah. These are big companies, right?

1331
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,640
With the deep pockets and a lot of lawyers.

1332
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:13,680
Well, I mean, also, this is a discussion that we've had on here before.

1333
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,520
If you did find something, who would you bring it to?

1334
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,720
You bring it to the people that build your fucking jets like, hey, guys,

1335
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,160
what the hell is this?

1336
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,840
Like, you know, you make some sort of a top secret agreement.

1337
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:28,120
You bring it to them in some sort of undisclosed facility.

1338
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,080
That's the best and brightest.

1339
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,920
Bring the guys in and go, what the fuck is this thing?

1340
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,040
Yeah, you kind of have to.

1341
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,880
Otherwise, like what else would you do?

1342
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,120
You know, I mean, how else do you find out how these things work?

1343
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,600
And if you were going to do it in a secretive manner,

1344
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,800
you would have to bring it to defense contractors,

1345
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,520
because those are the only people that are capable of making things.

1346
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,680
They make your jets.

1347
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,760
They make they make the, you know, every stealth bomber,

1348
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,040
every whatever the fuck it is, they make all that shit.

1349
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,560
Going back to, you know, a colleague of mine made the comparison.

1350
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:04,800
He said, look, Lou, imagine being during the days of Da Vinci

1351
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,720
and all of a sudden bringing Da Vinci a garage door opener.

1352
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,360
You have no idea what it's used for.

1353
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,600
I've never seen plastic before.

1354
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,040
You don't even understand electromagnetic radiation, right?

1355
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:20,400
But you didn't and an infrared, you know, where do you start on the analysis

1356
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,880
and exploitation of a technology that the physics hasn't even been discovered yet?

1357
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,960
Right. I mean, garage door openers seem like magic.

1358
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,640
Right. It really does.

1359
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,840
You know, I press a button and a door opens like magic.

1360
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,320
Wait, where's the horse? Where's the strings?

1361
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,480
Right. Yeah.

1362
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,680
So it's kind of bananas.

1363
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,120
You press a button on your car and all of a sudden your door opens. Right.

1364
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,840
And you drive in and you press another button and it closes.

1365
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,840
And it's all done through the air. Right.

1366
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,160
Which is bananas. Magic.

1367
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,360
But we're just accustomed to it. That's right. Yeah.

1368
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,800
So this kind of technology,

1369
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,480
I'm sure you're aware of the Bob Lazar story.

1370
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,280
I'm aware. I don't know Bob. I've never met him.

1371
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,360
You never got into that? I did not.

1372
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,120
How could you not with your line of work?

1373
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:05,120
Because, you know, I always wanted to be insulated from prejudicing the jury.

1374
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,880
And I know it sounds kind of strange, but I didn't ever make sense.

1375
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,280
You know, it's it's it's it's kind of something I impose on myself

1376
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,720
because I didn't want to have any preconceived notions of going in.

1377
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,320
Most people kind of, I suspect, would be tempted to say, well,

1378
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,520
I'm going to learn everything I can about, you know, UFO lore.

1379
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,200
I wanted the opposite.

1380
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,600
You're a better man than me.

1381
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,720
Well, I love I'm chasing that shit down.

1382
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:30,600
You know, I think I just I just wanted to be very, very careful

1383
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,840
to preserve the investigative integrity.

1384
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,680
Right. And we're look, we're all humans. We're all bias.

1385
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,560
There's no way around it. We all have some degree of bias.

1386
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,960
Let's let's be honest and truthful here.

1387
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,360
It doesn't matter what type of bias it is.

1388
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,160
We all have some sort of bias somewhere,

1389
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,160
whether it's food or the people you like to date or whatever.

1390
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,840
I wanted to avoid that as much as possible.

1391
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:56,160
And so I always kept it very, very focused on the here and now.

1392
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,640
And, you know, what what can we see today? Right.

1393
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:05,040
You're aware of the story, though, right? The basic tangentially

1394
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,400
that he worked at a particular facility and at that facility,

1395
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,640
he was exposed to some sort of

1396
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,080
UAP technology, that thing, right, that thing, that thing right there,

1397
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,880
the sport model, and that he was brought in

1398
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,240
as a propulsion expert and to try to.

1399
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,800
They didn't know how it exactly worked,

1400
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,120
but they they sort of just said, tell me what this is. Roger.

1401
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,320
And then along the way, he realized, oh, this isn't even ours.

1402
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,560
Yeah, I'm aware of, again, the overarching story.

1403
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,280
I don't know any of the details and I've I've never met him personally.

1404
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,360
So I'm a very, very interesting guy.

1405
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,960
I had dinner with them with my friend, Andrew Schultz and Jeremy Corbell.

1406
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,720
We went to dinner and, you know, informally talked

1407
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,800
and had a fascinating conversation.

1408
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,600
And Jeremy's a great guy. He's a great guy.

1409
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,840
Yeah, he's he's really you know, he's done a lot to say hi.

1410
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,160
Hi. He's pumped that we're talking.

1411
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,480
Yeah, he's done a lot. He's a UFO nut.

1412
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,280
And he got me really way back in with his documentary

1413
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:08,280
of Bob Lazar, Flying Saucers, whatever, wherever the actual title of it is.

1414
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,560
But that that documentary is fantastic.

1415
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,400
And it's essentially going over Bob Lazar's story from the 1980s to today,

1416
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,480
which he's told the exact same story, which is nuts

1417
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,920
that you have one giant lie your whole life.

1418
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,280
Like, come on.

1419
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,640
There's a lot of weirdness to the story, obviously,

1420
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,520
like there is with everything.

1421
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,040
There's a lot of people that want to discredit his his background

1422
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,960
and all sorts of other things.

1423
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,640
But the reality of what he's saying is essentially what we're seeing

1424
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,720
in these crafts, which is very strange.

1425
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,360
So he described how these things worked and how they moved

1426
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,640
and how they would turn sideways and sort of like project this

1427
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,280
whatever this reactor that they have inside of them.

1428
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,920
And he talked about this element, element 115.

1429
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,640
They have a stable version of it that was essentially

1430
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,000
is theoretical at the time in 1980.

1431
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,040
No one really knew whether or not that thing actually even exists.

1432
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,480
89 or whatever it was.

1433
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:07,440
And that they would douse this thing, project radiation upon it,

1434
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,800
and it would create this warp, this gravity warp, this this thing

1435
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:16,560
that allowed this this craft to move in ways

1436
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,840
that defied our understanding.

1437
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,080
That's a hell of a lucky guess.

1438
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,520
Hell of a lucky guess.

1439
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,440
Hell of a lucky guess in 1989.

1440
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,680
Wow. And he drew it.

1441
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:29,040
He has diagrams of what this thing looked like and how it worked.

1442
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,240
And it essentially looked exactly like that little model

1443
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,280
that's on the desk there.

1444
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,240
And that he felt like the whole it didn't make any sense.

1445
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,240
He said the whole thing didn't have any seams,

1446
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,480
which now we understand 3D printing, right?

1447
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,200
So now we know that we can actually give in.

1448
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,800
But only now, not back then, right?

1449
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,040
Of course. Everything had rivets.

1450
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,280
Exactly. The skin of a craft was the skin of an aircraft.

1451
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,120
Exactly. It had rivets and had nuts and bolts.

1452
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,320
And exactly, you know, but now, you know, obviously now we have carbon fiber.

1453
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,480
We have a bunch of different ways of constructing things.

1454
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:01,200
But back then, he didn't know what the fuck that thing was.

1455
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,400
He said it looked like it had all been melted, like into place,

1456
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,960
like that it had been like almost like smooth, like wax, like melted wax,

1457
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,720
and that it had no instrumentation inside of it.

1458
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,680
And it was designed for very small things,

1459
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,200
like something that was like three feet tall,

1460
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:22,040
and that all these things seemed to operate through the being itself

1461
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,440
had some sort of connection to the craft,

1462
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,040
some sort of strange way of interfacing with the craft

1463
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,440
that didn't have anything to do with pulling levers and moving things.

1464
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,960
But, Joe, is that really that much of a stretch?

1465
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:33,800
Let's let's look at this.

1466
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,880
You know, we have we've done experiments where we've had pilots

1467
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,760
be able to control aircraft thousands of miles away

1468
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:44,200
with a helmet that interprets thought. Right. Right.

1469
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,680
So it's, you know, again.

1470
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,680
How does the helmet is it similar to like a Neuralink setup?

1471
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,520
Have you seen the new video of the second Neuralink patient?

1472
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,520
I have not.

1473
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,600
Is this video of him playing Counter-Strike?

1474
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,960
Was it Counter-Strike or is it a is that it?

1475
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:02,480
So Counter-Strike, which is a very popular online 3D game.

1476
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:07,640
And this guy who does not have use of his body has this Neuralink implant.

1477
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,480
He's the second Neuralink patient.

1478
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:13,800
And apparently with each iteration, it gets more and more sophisticated and better.

1479
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,760
So this is a from this person's point of view.

1480
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,720
He's playing this video game entirely with his mind.

1481
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,040
So he's better than I can with my well, better than anybody can.

1482
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,360
Because the first guy who the first Neuralink patient, we had him on.

1483
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,680
And he said essentially is like having an aimbot because you don't miss.

1484
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:36,040
You look at the thing you're trying to shoot at and instantaneously

1485
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,800
your crosshairs go there. Wow.

1486
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,600
Yeah. So he's all this stuff is taking place entirely.

1487
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,360
This is all him doing this entirely with his mind.

1488
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,480
But is that right?

1489
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,920
So if we can do that now. Right. Right.

1490
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:52,200
Is it really that far of a stretch to think that, you know,

1491
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,640
someone who's a little more advanced than us, right?

1492
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,480
Our friends from out of town realize that's the way to do it.

1493
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,640
That's more efficient, right?

1494
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,280
The speed of the processing of the brain, the processes of the brain is much faster.

1495
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,960
It takes us longer to then have to mechanically use our hands

1496
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,280
and manipulate and do things.

1497
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,840
This is almost not quite, but almost instantaneous.

1498
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,560
You don't have that lag. Right. Of course.

1499
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,840
So that would certainly make sense.

1500
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,040
You know, modern warfare, not the game, but actual modern warfare

1501
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,680
is beginning to turn to them.

1502
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:23,560
We're using AI and all these other augmentation to enhance performance.

1503
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,520
And so I I don't think that's out of the realm of of possibility.

1504
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,080
No, certainly not.

1505
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:35,200
I mean, just go from garage door openers to, you know, 500, 600 years ago. Right.

1506
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:39,360
To today and then cell phones, the ability to send video across the world

1507
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,400
instantaneously, all the sophisticated stuff that we've just completely

1508
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,160
take for granted because it's become a normal part of our everyday life.

1509
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,760
That's you know, I used to I used to give a briefing to some folks.

1510
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,800
I'm so glad you mentioned this, because it's this goes back

1511
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,040
to the whole stigma and taboo issue.

1512
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,560
I used to have a slideshow and still have it somewhere.

1513
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:04,640
And I would I would discuss the word that the Latin word prefix of para

1514
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,640
para. And it means above or beside.

1515
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,520
And so what I would do is show up, I would say the word parachute.

1516
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,200
And I'd ask people, what do you think of when you hear the word parachute?

1517
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,600
And people would describe, obviously, something that deploys over your head.

1518
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,080
And hopefully you hit the ground with a with a thump and not a thud. Right.

1519
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,880
But something that's normal, we use every day.

1520
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,040
And then I say, what about the word paramedic?

1521
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,080
And then people would look at it and say, well, I think of a first responder.

1522
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,840
Someone goes some, you know, some sort of medical lifesaver

1523
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,080
that's going to going to be there for your benefit.

1524
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,760
And then I say the word.

1525
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:37,080
When I say the word paranormal, what do you think?

1526
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,280
And people stop for a second.

1527
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,920
Maybe they kind of give you a little sly smile and say, what do you mean?

1528
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,360
So what do you mean? I mean that paranormal.

1529
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,760
The only reason why you're reacting the way you are, because you've been conditioned

1530
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:50,160
that the word paranormal is is cookie stuff.

1531
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,040
When in reality, in science, by definition,

1532
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,240
everything is paranormal until it becomes normal.

1533
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,160
The cell phone that I use every day 50 years ago, absolutely paranormal.

1534
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,520
And so I would go through this exercise of things that were once considered paranormal.

1535
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,760
For example, when the Inca first saw the Spaniards,

1536
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,720
the conquistadores coming from the reconquering,

1537
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,680
they saw them on the shores of the beach and they saw these

1538
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,680
these humans in armor riding on a horse.

1539
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,600
And they assume they've never seen a horse before.

1540
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,840
They assumed it was a single entity.

1541
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,440
It was a single monster.

1542
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,960
And that for them was paranormal.

1543
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,160
They didn't understand it was actually a human riding on a horse with, you know, metal skin.

1544
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,440
Same thing with acupuncture.

1545
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,200
I remember a time when I was growing up as a kid,

1546
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,040
people thought Eastern medicine, acupuncture was nonsense.

1547
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,360
Well, now the Veterans Administration, the VA, for some of my guys in combat,

1548
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,840
they actually prescribe acupuncture as therapy.

1549
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,160
It's not paranormal. Right.

1550
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,040
And so there's all these examples in history

1551
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:49,040
where we think something is kooky and weird when in reality it's not.

1552
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,360
It's just we don't understand it yet.

1553
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:56,360
And we have done such a good job of stigmatizing this conversation

1554
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,840
that the moment you even say the word paranormal or you say the word UFO

1555
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,240
or anything like that, people are conditioned without even thinking about it.

1556
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:07,040
It's reflexive to react a certain way.

1557
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,840
And we have to first deprogram ourselves first a little bit

1558
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,040
before we can start moving forward.

1559
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,080
OK, let's how do we just destigmatize this conversation?

1560
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,960
Well, first of all, what's kooky?

1561
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,680
You know, what do you think is kooky about something that's in our airspace

1562
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,200
that's performing in ways that we can't replicate?

1563
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,600
You know, that people say, well, you know, we wait a minute.

1564
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,120
We spend millions, if not billions of dollars

1565
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,640
putting a probe on Mars to try to find microbial life.

1566
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,640
And by the way, it looks like that may happen.

1567
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,120
It looks like there actually may be some evidence to suggest that.

1568
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,520
We spend lots of money trying to find technosignatures

1569
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,640
of intelligent life, radio signatures in our own Milky Way. Right.

1570
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,160
Well, is it possible within the four and a half billion years

1571
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,280
our planet's been here that maybe intelligent life maybe found us first?

1572
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,840
Is it possible? Could be.

1573
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:03,760
You know, we we have to stop putting these these limitations.

1574
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,320
Joe, when I was when I was in the medical program,

1575
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:10,680
when I was learning to be microbiology and immunology in college,

1576
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:16,160
we learned from our professor that homo sapiens sapien as a modern species

1577
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,400
has been around roughly between 100000 to 200000 years.

1578
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,280
Now, I'm not an expert, but that's that's what they say.

1579
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,360
It was only the Greeks 2000 years ago

1580
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:28,280
that introduced the idea that there's only two types of life forms on this planet.

1581
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,960
And you are either a plant or B, you're an animal.

1582
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,240
And it wasn't the last 300 years.

1583
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,760
So if you look at a 24 hour clock, roughly the last five minutes

1584
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:43,520
in the 24 hours towards midnight, we discovered another form of life

1585
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,680
that is neither plant nor animal that's been here with us on this planet.

1586
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,160
And that is the world of fungus.

1587
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,080
During the Renaissance and the days of Newton,

1588
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,560
we discovered that there was this other life form we've been sharing all along.

1589
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,800
And we so we pat ourselves on the shoulder.

1590
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,960
And it wasn't the last hundred and twenty years.

1591
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,000
Think about it. The last 10 seconds of our existence on this planet,

1592
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,480
so to speak, in a 24 hour clock as a modern species.

1593
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,800
We actually discovered the true dominant life form on this planet.

1594
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,280
And in fact, if you take all the biomass of every plant

1595
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:16,880
and the biomass of every animal and the biomass of every fungus

1596
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,360
and add it all up together, it still will not equal the biomass

1597
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,280
of this hidden kingdom of life.

1598
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,720
That's actually the dominant life form on this planet.

1599
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,200
And that wasn't until we were able to curve glass

1600
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,440
and look through a little steel tube and famously shout, little beasties,

1601
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,320
little beasties, did we discover the world of microorganisms that, yes,

1602
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:39,320
live inside of you and, yes, live on the skin of the ISS space station.

1603
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,920
Yes, live miles underneath the Arctic ice. Right.

1604
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,600
That is the true dominant life form on this planet.

1605
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,680
And it always has been.

1606
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,480
And it wasn't in the last until the last hundred and twenty years.

1607
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,120
We discovered that.

1608
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:53,720
So is it possible that there is something else that is

1609
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,840
just as normal to this world?

1610
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:00,400
Is it possible? Well, the answer is a resounding yes, of course, it's possible

1611
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:05,600
because we're always discovering new, new, new, new ways life can exist.

1612
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,400
When I was growing up as a kid, I was told absolutely, as a matter of fact,

1613
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,880
all life form is derived from photosynthesis.

1614
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,040
Ultimately, when you go all the way down,

1615
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,280
it turns out that's not true.

1616
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,040
It wasn't until we discovered the in the deepest,

1617
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:22,040
deepest depths of our oceans where these things called black smokers,

1618
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,200
we discovered there are creatures that thrive with no light

1619
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,400
and they thrive off of something called chemo synthesis,

1620
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:32,600
a completely different way to metabolize energy to sustain life. Right.

1621
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,240
So every time we put Mother Nature in a little box,

1622
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,920
she always finds a way to wiggle her way out.

1623
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,480
And I think that's important when having this conversation, because

1624
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,320
if there's one thing we know as human beings,

1625
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,960
we're usually wrong at first.

1626
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:51,600
Well, we exist and we do send things to other planets.

1627
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,280
So we do send things into space.

1628
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,520
It only makes sense that something far more intelligent than us

1629
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,880
that would be doing that.

1630
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:01,680
And if they did, they'd probably watch an emerging civilization,

1631
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,680
which is essentially what we are. Right.

1632
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,080
And like you said, two hundred thousand years, which is nothing.

1633
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:13,240
The existence of homo sapiens, they've gone from things that use stones

1634
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:17,360
and Flint map to things that can fly things through the air.

1635
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,040
I mean, if you look at Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright

1636
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,760
when they flew the first airplane, you go from that to the Apollo 11 launch.

1637
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,520
That's only like, what, 50 years. That's right.

1638
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,520
Something crazy like that. That's right.

1639
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,240
That's nuts. Right.

1640
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,280
And you just take that and everything moves exponentially.

1641
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,640
You take that and you would imagine a civilization

1642
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,120
that's been around ten thousand years longer than us,

1643
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,520
a hundred thousand years, a million years longer than us.

1644
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,880
Something that doesn't exist.

1645
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,080
How about a hundred years?

1646
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,720
We have evolved more in the last hundred and fifty years

1647
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,200
than we have in the last hundred and fifty thousand years. Sure.

1648
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,120
So, you know, and then you have the other other.

1649
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:58,160
For me, I find it when people say, well, the space is so huge.

1650
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,880
And, you know, is it possible that things are coming from outer space?

1651
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,280
My response has always been the same.

1652
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,960
Look, I don't know where they're from.

1653
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:06,960
I just know that they're here.

1654
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,920
And could they be from outer space? Sure.

1655
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,080
They can be from inner space or even the space in between.

1656
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,240
And and I say that because the universe is far more complex

1657
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,040
than than we give it credit for.

1658
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,280
Every time there was a time we had Newtonian physics,

1659
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,320
we thought there was a solution.

1660
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,960
Then all of a sudden, Einstein comes along and we realize that weight,

1661
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,040
space and time are actually connected and everything's relative.

1662
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,160
And all of a sudden, now you have quantum mechanics, which is,

1663
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,440
you know, this spooky action at a distance, right,

1664
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,400
where the whole universe is behaving in a way that it shouldn't.

1665
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,920
And yet that looks like the real way the universe works.

1666
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,600
I often tell people we are as humans, we we have five.

1667
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:46,080
Only five fundamental senses that we can base our reality upon.

1668
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,560
And if you can't touch it, taste it, hear it, smell it, et cetera,

1669
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,240
we can't interact with it.

1670
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:53,520
And so where I live in Wyoming, we have these beautiful night skies

1671
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,800
kind of kind of like you have here in your in your studio here.

1672
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,320
300 days of unincluded night skies and as beautiful as those night skies are.

1673
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,680
If you were to look at that same portion of the night sky

1674
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:07,280
through a radio telescope, you would see a whole different reality around you.

1675
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,320
You'd see nebula and you'd see things in different spectra

1676
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,160
that we can't pick up.

1677
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,120
You pick an ultraviolet and infrared.

1678
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,000
So you would see a whole different reality, just like our cell phones, right?

1679
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,360
If you could see in cell phone vision and see in Wi-Fi and 5G and GPS,

1680
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,360
you would interact with your environment completely different.

1681
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,520
You would see reality.

1682
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:29,280
So we can only interact with a very small sliver

1683
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,640
of the reality that we can perceive because we're humans.

1684
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,800
But most of reality is actually beyond that.

1685
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,480
And then, of course, you have scalability issues.

1686
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,880
The universe is is immensely huge.

1687
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,280
And what scientists are now saying, if you look in any direction,

1688
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:47,240
you can see roughly within the visible that let me emphasize

1689
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:53,600
a visible horizon of our universe is about 13.9 billion light years, plus or minus.

1690
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,120
So that means in any direction, I can see 13.9 billion light years

1691
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,600
with the right equipment. What's a light year?

1692
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,160
Well, it's as fast as light can travel in a year.

1693
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,120
Well, light travels pretty fast.

1694
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,800
In fact, it travels at 186,000 miles per second.

1695
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,160
So seven and a half times around our planet in one second.

1696
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,400
So imagine how far you can go in a year.

1697
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,680
Now, multiply that by 13.9 billion.

1698
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,040
And that by scientists estimation.

1699
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,480
So if the universe end to end of our visible,

1700
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,440
we're stuck in the middle, is roughly 27 billion light years.

1701
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,840
Scientists are now saying that's only possibly only 10 percent of the known universe

1702
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,760
because the universe is so big and so vast and so far light

1703
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,680
will never have time to reach Earth.

1704
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:37,280
So that's that's a hunt at a minimum 100 billion light years.

1705
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,560
Right. And so we are this little speck in the middle.

1706
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,320
And as as as crazy as that is to even try to conceive,

1707
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:49,880
if you compare one atom inside the one hydrogen atom, Avogadro's number, right?

1708
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,800
One times 10 to the negative umpteen all the way down.

1709
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,000
It is roughly the same level of scale.

1710
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:02,400
As we are to the universe, meaning that atom is the size of a human,

1711
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,440
as we are the size of the universe, as we are a human to the size of the universe.

1712
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:09,520
So there is this and we, as humans, can only interact

1713
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,880
plus or minus with one order of magnitude up or down.

1714
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,120
Otherwise, the universe is simply too big or too small,

1715
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:21,480
meaning most of the universe and reality lies in those scales.

1716
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:24,560
We live in this little tiny, tiny sliver. And so.

1717
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,680
You hurt my head.

1718
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,400
Well, yeah, we live in a tiny sliver.

1719
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,040
And the idea that we're alone, I think, is preposterous.

1720
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:38,160
I really do. And I know people, they constantly chime in with this.

1721
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,280
So where's the evidence of, you know, Elon's famously said,

1722
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,480
if the aliens are real, they're very subtle.

1723
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,800
I don't know why he says that, though.

1724
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,160
I think I think he probably says that because he doesn't want to sound like a kook

1725
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,320
while he's working with NASA and SpaceX.

1726
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:55,240
You know, I'd probably say some stuff like that, too.

1727
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,840
Well, let me ask you this as human beings. Right.

1728
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,240
How many times do we fly over the Serengeti in a helicopter? Right.

1729
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:05,640
And let's say you want to monitor the health of a particular,

1730
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,360
you know, herd of elephants. Right.

1731
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,560
And so what happens are wildebeest, we fly over, we pick one.

1732
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,960
We we shoot it with a tranquilizer. It falls asleep.

1733
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,640
We go down, we do some tests, pull its blood.

1734
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,800
Now, think about it from the perspective of the wildebeest. Right.

1735
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,040
It wakes up, kind of meanders over to the watering hole and says, Bill,

1736
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:22,920
you're not going to believe this man.

1737
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:26,800
But something out of the sky came down and all of a sudden they were touching me.

1738
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,120
And, you know, I woke up in my butthurt. Right.

1739
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,360
What the hell was that? Right.

1740
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:34,880
To this day, even in China, when we go into a zoo, right.

1741
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,480
And we have the panda bear exhibits.

1742
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,520
What do we do? We put so we don't disrupt the pandas.

1743
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,000
We wear panda suits.

1744
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,800
Now, it sounds silly, but you can actually get online and see zookeepers

1745
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,920
wearing panda suits because they don't want to they want to interfere

1746
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:53,840
as least as possible with the natural flora and fauna.

1747
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,440
They're inside the exhibit.

1748
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,480
Do you think animals could you was it was it reasonable

1749
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,280
to theorize that there's aliens amongst us?

1750
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,880
When you say, well, two things.

1751
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,120
So I don't want to be evasive.

1752
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:09,040
Let me but I also want to be very specific when we say aliens.

1753
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:13,240
And then we also are we are we saying something from another plane

1754
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:16,680
or are we saying non human intelligence that looks like us?

1755
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,840
I moves around with us.

1756
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,200
So is it possible?

1757
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,040
Well, we're doing it already with the panda bear.

1758
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,840
So, you know, it's not that we do a strategy.

1759
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,360
That'd be very simple. Sure.

1760
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,760
And especially if you have the technology now, as far as the bear.

1761
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,080
Yeah, there you go. Right.

1762
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,240
Carrying little baby pandas. Exactly.

1763
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,840
Boy, those are shitty panda bear outfits, too.

1764
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,120
Well, they're fucking terrible.

1765
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,200
They're pretty terrifying, aren't they?

1766
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,320
Actually put that in front of my dog.

1767
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,000
He's going to bark.

1768
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,640
It's like a dude in a dog costume.

1769
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,480
He like a fucking dog.

1770
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,000
Yeah. Well, as a wild panda bear, not know that dude's not a panda bear.

1771
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,560
That's crazy.

1772
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,840
He's a panda terrorist.

1773
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,280
That looks like a fucking alien.

1774
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,480
Like it was really dark out.

1775
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:59,720
And that guy grabbed you and zapped you with a tranquilizer.

1776
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,240
You'd have an alien story.

1777
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:04,360
But yeah, my point is that we always, you know, use camouflage.

1778
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,360
For obvious reason, we do it in military.

1779
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:09,200
Right. I mean, camouflage, camouflage uniform.

1780
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,360
I stealth aircraft, you know, for camouflage.

1781
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,480
Sure. You do it when you go hunting.

1782
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,400
Absolutely. I do. Absolutely.

1783
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,920
So so it's not it's not a stretch of the imagination

1784
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,600
to suggest anything coming here that doesn't want to provoke us.

1785
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,040
Probably wants to blend in.

1786
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,080
Now, of course, do I have any type of empirical evidence

1787
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,320
to suggest that they are living among us?

1788
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,640
I don't want I can say definitively that whatever it is, it's here.

1789
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,440
And and by the way, you already have very senior people

1790
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,960
in our government that have said it's here, whatever it is.

1791
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,360
But these things could also be from under the water.

1792
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,120
These things could be something that is as natural to Earth

1793
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:43,480
as the little beasties were right when we first discovered them.

1794
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,720
Maybe maybe they've been here all along. Right.

1795
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,680
So the the ocean is largely undiscovered.

1796
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,240
One of the things that people need to understand

1797
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:53,240
is that most of the exploration of the ocean is really essentially

1798
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,200
around the outside edges.

1799
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,120
It's around the shores. Less than 10 percent.

1800
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,200
So which is not a buddy of mine. 90 percent of the ocean.

1801
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,160
That's right. Like what?

1802
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,640
We know more about the moon than the bottom of our own ocean.

1803
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,720
And so so crazy. Yeah, that's fact.

1804
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:10,720
And these underwater crafts like this enormous one

1805
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:13,120
that apparently was near this oil rig.

1806
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,000
How many of them have been?

1807
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,200
Has there been more than one of those videos?

1808
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,640
So let me tell you what I can say from open source.

1809
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,760
Yeah. OK.

1810
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,880
And then I'll tell you about a conversation I had without attribution

1811
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,600
because I don't don't want to get in trouble.

1812
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,040
Everybody's when I say everybody, a lot of people are familiar

1813
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,400
with the Air Force's program called the Fast Walker program,

1814
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,760
which is a program that was started by the Air Force, among other things.

1815
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,560
It was to detect UFOs.

1816
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:46,000
That's a fact to actually that was part of their mission to detect a lot of things.

1817
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,920
Adversarial technology.

1818
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,280
But UFOs was one of them was called the Fast Walker program.

1819
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,800
There was some information

1820
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:58,280
that was released publicly about a similar program the Navy has.

1821
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,360
I can't talk about it because I don't have approval to talk about it.

1822
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,440
But obviously, they're interested because they have equities underwater.

1823
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,280
They're interested in if there's anything underwater

1824
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,880
that can perform beyond anything we have.

1825
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,640
And I remember speaking to one individual

1826
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,960
who pulled me aside very privately and he said, Lou,

1827
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:21,320
we were tracking this thing doing and I won't say the exact speed,

1828
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:24,200
but hundreds and hundreds of knots underwater.

1829
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,600
And it was bigger than our own submarine.

1830
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:29,080
And you know how big our submarines are, right? They're huge.

1831
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:31,800
And I asked him naively, I just kind of came out,

1832
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,240
what do you do when you encounter that?

1833
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:38,400
He just said very honestly, he said, we go around just like that.

1834
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,200
We go around.

1835
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,200
Have there been interactions with these things?

1836
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,640
I would not be able to discuss any details about that.

1837
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:48,000
That's not for me to discuss.

1838
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,480
You know, I got to get drunk.

1839
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:54,160
I'm a lightweight. You know, I got to get you drunk.

1840
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,960
Let's go have some whiskey, find out what the fuck is up.

1841
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,080
So this thing is bigger than the sub,

1842
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,920
and they followed it for hundreds of miles.

1843
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,920
Let me give you another great, great event that occurred.

1844
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,240
And I'll talk about this because it's not classified.

1845
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,080
The portions that might be, I don't know about, so I should be fine.

1846
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,480
There's an individual who I'm aware of who was a helipilot,

1847
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,920
helicopter pilot back in the late 90s in the Caribbean,

1848
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,880
and they were doing missile recovery.

1849
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:28,320
So what happened is that the Navy would test fire missiles

1850
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,520
and then they kind of run out of fuel.

1851
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,000
They hit the water and they sink.

1852
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,320
At a predetermined time, they pop to the surface.

1853
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,640
We grab it with a helicopter, bring it back to shore.

1854
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,600
And we test it for telemetry and make sure that, you know,

1855
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,960
this cruise missile was doing what it was supposed to do.

1856
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,440
So they're out there in the helicopter,

1857
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,680
frogmen hanging down the line.

1858
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,680
You got the helipilot, you got the crew chief

1859
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:50,520
and the other co-pilot looking all down at the bubble.

1860
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:54,600
And as they're about to grab this cruise missile out of the ocean,

1861
01:32:55,400 --> 01:33:00,320
something huge and round and what was described to me as black as a devil

1862
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,800
starts to rise to the surface.

1863
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,600
The water begins to churn very much like David Fravor's description

1864
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,520
of the Tic Tac incident and the roiling water.

1865
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,480
The frogman is so freaked out.

1866
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,560
He's literally trying to climb the line back up.

1867
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,320
He's like total panic at the disco, right?

1868
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,240
Yeah. And the helicopter is like, do we do it like an emergency ascent?

1869
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,760
What the hell's going on here?

1870
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,560
And right as this thing is about and by the way,

1871
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,200
it's the size of a small island and round right as this thing is about

1872
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:28,920
to break the surface, it sucks the missile down and disappears.

1873
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,520
And that was, yeah.

1874
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,280
And Dave Fravor could probably tell you that story a little better than I can.

1875
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,040
But when you compare that to other things, you've got to say,

1876
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,360
imagine being that guy hanging from that line.

1877
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:44,080
No, thank you.

1878
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,680
We call that bait.

1879
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,120
Yeah, but it didn't do anything to him.

1880
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,160
No, I would have loved that experience.

1881
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:52,440
Yeah. So that was that was one of the anecdotes that was revealed to us

1882
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,000
by one of the major pilots.

1883
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,320
Who's that guy that was hanging from the frogman?

1884
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:59,720
I know. I don't know.

1885
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,120
I only know the bro. Come, come talk to me.

1886
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,280
Please, sir.

1887
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,360
I only know the pilot.

1888
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,600
Well, put you in a fucking panda outfit.

1889
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:10,400
You know, disguise your voice.

1890
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,560
Tell me what the fuck you saw.

1891
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,880
I want to hear that story.

1892
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,600
Oh, my God. Small island. Yep.

1893
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,480
Black is the devil in a small island and round.

1894
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,920
Yeah. Submarines look like this, right?

1895
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:23,000
They're not round. Right. So, yeah.

1896
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,080
So that was that was one of the anecdotes that was shared with us.

1897
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,320
You know, obviously, Puerto Rico with the other.

1898
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,600
There's been some UAPs that have been recorded off there.

1899
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,840
Everybody knows about Aguadilla, the Aguadilla incident.

1900
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,920
I don't know about it. Oh, I'm sure you do.

1901
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,200
You know what? Tell me. Wow. Trust me.

1902
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,640
So you can look it up online.

1903
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:46,400
There's a video taken by a DHS helicopter of a very interesting object.

1904
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,600
First, it appears to be like a perhaps a balloon,

1905
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,440
but then it does all sorts of weird stuff.

1906
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,720
And as you're tracking it, it enters the water without making a splash.

1907
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,800
You can track it underwater.

1908
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,840
Then it comes up and splits into two.

1909
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,680
And it's called and it's been analyzed over and over again by a lot of experts.

1910
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,720
It's called the Aguadilla incident.

1911
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:04,720
Maybe I have seen this.

1912
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:08,400
Is it kind of blurry looking night vision? That's it. Oh, wow.

1913
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,720
And so keep watching that.

1914
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,560
And I'll tell you a little story about this.

1915
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:15,000
This is a customs and border protection. Release this.

1916
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,800
How fast is this thing going?

1917
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,600
Well, so if you look here, they're looking at this through a form of night vision.

1918
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,440
I don't know the exact velocity.

1919
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:23,960
All that is available.

1920
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,560
But if you keep watching this, something interesting happens.

1921
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,280
So here it goes.

1922
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,400
You're going to see this thing enter the water here.

1923
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:32,200
There he goes underwater.

1924
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,600
And then it pops back up and splits into two.

1925
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,920
Keep their track and it see no waves, no wake.

1926
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:41,400
And then it surfaces and then does something pretty,

1927
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,800
pretty interesting here. So keep watching.

1928
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,400
So it's going high speed through the water underwater.

1929
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,240
That's underwater.

1930
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,200
Then it breaks the surface of the water again.

1931
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,280
Keep watching.

1932
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,720
Boom, underwater, over water, boom, underwater.

1933
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:57,320
Out of water, and then you'll see it split into two.

1934
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,880
So I didn't see it split into two.

1935
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,760
If you watch the rest of the video, the video, there it is.

1936
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:03,280
Oh, there it is.

1937
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,520
The video is actually really long, but that's just one example.

1938
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:10,640
You know, this is these are you can see all these videos.

1939
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,920
They're prevalent everywhere.

1940
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,280
You see that the eight the aircraft on the bottom, right?

1941
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:17,000
You see the UAP on top that's tracking it. Yeah. Yeah.

1942
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:20,320
No wings, no control services.

1943
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:24,360
And it keeps up with the A-10 and does all sorts of interesting maneuvers.

1944
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,960
Right. So that's an A-10 warthog.

1945
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,200
And this thing is just following it.

1946
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,840
Yep. Like it's nothing.

1947
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:34,400
Do you think they're trying to let people see them?

1948
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,360
Like, have you had a guess?

1949
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,560
You know, I don't know.

1950
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,760
I mean, could it be a demonstration of capabilities?

1951
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:44,160
We do that right every time a Russian surveillance aircraft comes by.

1952
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:47,960
We launched two F-22s and we get real close to it and say, hey, you know.

1953
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:48,880
Right. Be careful.

1954
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,920
But not even from a military perspective, like if a civilization

1955
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:56,720
was trying to alert another civilization about its presence,

1956
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:03,120
wouldn't it like go towards whatever military vehicles it has and show itself?

1957
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:07,240
And then I would imagine that if they understand human beings,

1958
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:11,240
they understand our psychology and they understand that some giant

1959
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,640
size of an island, black as the devil, circular craft

1960
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:19,160
that lands next to the Pentagon would fucking end the world.

1961
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,560
We would freak out. No one would know what to do.

1962
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:26,200
That would be stock market crash, mass chaos.

1963
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,520
No one would know what to do.

1964
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,640
The way to introduce yourself, I would imagine, would be gradual

1965
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:36,280
over a long period of time to allow this civilization

1966
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:40,560
to accept the fact these things exist and then slowly but surely

1967
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,800
show versions of themselves.

1968
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,280
Yeah, we call that sensitization.

1969
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,200
You sensitize a population or environment.

1970
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,800
But, you know, the counter argument to that is that's a very human thing.

1971
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,760
Right. We have as humans, we always it's it's almost innate.

1972
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,200
We look at everything through anthropomorphic eyes.

1973
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:03,200
We look at, you know, our pet dogs and we give them human names

1974
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:07,000
and we do things like that because we assign human value to things

1975
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,240
and because we have intentions and motivations.

1976
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,640
But most of nature isn't that way.

1977
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,680
Like, for example, when a shark bites a surfer,

1978
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,320
he's not wanting to hurt the surfer.

1979
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,400
He's just hungry. The shark's hungry.

1980
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,560
I don't care if you're a seal or whatever.

1981
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,280
You know, I don't want to I'm not trying to inflict pain.

1982
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,240
I'm just want to feed my belly.

1983
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,520
Intent and motivation is a very human thing.

1984
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:29,000
And we have to we have to I want to say resist the urge

1985
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,800
because it's almost impossible to do it.

1986
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:35,240
But we have to recognize that there are there are things that may exist

1987
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:38,600
that aren't don't have human motivation, meaning. Right.

1988
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,320
Maybe they don't care about sensitizing us.

1989
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,880
Maybe they do. But maybe it's like a like a computer. Right.

1990
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,800
Maybe it's binary.

1991
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:47,040
Maybe there's some sort of binary thought process, just information in

1992
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,240
and and information out.

1993
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:53,240
So that's the one one of the aspects I've always been very careful with

1994
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:58,720
is to assign human traits to something that is very likely not human. Right.

1995
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,840
But would you have to assign human traits to it or would you have

1996
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,760
if you you could look at it from the perspective of these things

1997
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,320
are aware of our psychology, they're aware of how we function

1998
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:12,000
and they're aware of the fragility of our world view.

1999
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:13,840
No point.

2000
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,800
You don't have to have human intention to have a strategy

2001
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:23,400
for doing the least amount of harm to this civilization to say.

2002
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,760
In fact, there's examples of that.

2003
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:27,240
Let me reinforce your point, because there's examples of that.

2004
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:31,920
My background being science in nature, you know, when lionesses stalk

2005
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,200
the zebras, you know, they get very low into the grass.

2006
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:36,960
They don't want to be seen. Right.

2007
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,240
They're not motivated necessarily because they don't want to spook

2008
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,000
the herd, but they do it.

2009
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,040
It's it's it's it's almost instinctual. Right.

2010
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,640
It's part of their DNA, part of their wiring to have a low profile,

2011
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:51,240
low observability and to get closer to their target,

2012
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:52,600
whether it's prey or anything else.

2013
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,640
So you're right.

2014
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:58,480
That mean there are examples in nature that also can suggest that.

2015
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,960
So it's a very good point.

2016
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,480
Yeah. I mean, it just makes sense that if it understands us,

2017
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:07,080
if it's absurd, look, we understand the behavior characteristics of sloths.

2018
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:08,120
Right. Right.

2019
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,160
We study them.

2020
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,160
We know what they do.

2021
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:13,000
And it would just make sense that if they're studying us,

2022
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,840
they would understand our behavior characteristics.

2023
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:18,560
I mean, the tiger recognizes the behavior characteristics of the zebra, doesn't it?

2024
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,920
Right. Exactly. It studies it.

2025
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,560
And so it knows what it has to do to get close to the zebra.

2026
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,040
So yeah, there's no way they would come here with ignorance.

2027
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:29,200
And I think also it's very likely that what we are

2028
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:33,680
exists in many, many places in the universe

2029
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,120
and that what we are is what they used to be.

2030
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,960
So they probably understand what we are.

2031
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,520
Well, we do that in the Amazon, don't we?

2032
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:43,960
Yeah. And in African tribes, there's lost tribes that are remote.

2033
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:46,520
Right. Separated by outside human contact.

2034
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,680
We study them. We study them from afar.

2035
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:49,720
But we do the same thing.

2036
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,960
Yes. Yeah. No, no question.

2037
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:56,040
And obviously, if they are these super intelligent creatures,

2038
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:58,600
they evolved to become super intelligent creatures.

2039
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,880
So there's probably some sort of a universal process

2040
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:04,160
that takes place amongst all intelligent, creative life

2041
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,480
that has a lust for innovation.

2042
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:10,760
They consistently make better and better versions of these flying crafts

2043
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:13,200
until they figure out how to make this warp drive thing

2044
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,920
that these things apparently have.

2045
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:19,120
Another thing that's odd is that you see the same kind of things

2046
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:21,840
that Kenneth Arnold saw in 1950.

2047
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,120
You see the same kind of things today.

2048
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:28,320
It's almost like, you know, going somewhere in the 1950s

2049
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:32,920
and seeing a 55 Chevy and then in 2024, seeing another 55.

2050
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,000
They're still driving around 55 Chevys.

2051
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,040
Like, what the fuck?

2052
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,240
Well, they do do that in Cuba, right?

2053
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,240
But that's just because they don't have access to other cars.

2054
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,040
They don't have a choice. Really good mechanics.

2055
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,400
That's your people. It is.

2056
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:48,600
It's my I'm really resisting the urge of continuing to smoke this thing right now.

2057
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,200
OK, I feel terrible.

2058
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,200
Don't feel terrible.

2059
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,240
I feel terrible. My wife is going to give me hell for this

2060
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,120
because I told her anything wrong with cigars, man.

2061
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:57,880
Like I was saying before, I never heard of a single person dying from cigars.

2062
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,840
You don't nail them.

2063
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,160
Take a little bit of smoke in your mouth.

2064
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:06,800
It's pleasurable. It's nice.

2065
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,200
Um, I would just think that that's what they would do,

2066
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:12,040
because that's what we would do.

2067
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:14,000
And I think that's what intelligent life would do.

2068
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,520
We've recognized something that wasn't quite as intelligent as us.

2069
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:22,560
We don't rush into these, you know, remote tribes and vaccinate them.

2070
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,800
What do we do? We don't give them.

2071
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,800
But, you know, the thing is, like, they have done some things.

2072
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:32,320
Like they gave Starlink to this one tribe and the kids all started watching porn.

2073
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,640
You hear about that?

2074
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:35,280
Yeah, it became a real problem.

2075
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,360
They're all lazy, hanging out on their phones all day, which makes sense.

2076
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,840
That's what we do.

2077
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,320
Yeah, you know, tribal leaders are not happy.

2078
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,560
You bring up another very interesting point.

2079
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,640
Is there a natural glide slope or a natural evolution

2080
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:53,880
to evolution, meaning any species that reaches a certain point?

2081
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:56,120
Is there a natural progression

2082
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:59,400
of any intelligent species to progress to the point?

2083
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,600
Because all life is expansive.

2084
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,160
Life doesn't contract. Life expands, whether it's bacterial life,

2085
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,120
whether it's animal life or human life.

2086
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:10,240
It is there are certain biological functions to procreate, multiply

2087
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,760
and continue to expand. Right.

2088
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,320
So is that a is that a universal norm?

2089
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:19,520
That is, is that part of like fractals and geometry throughout the universe?

2090
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,640
Is that part of the blueprint of all life?

2091
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,720
Or is it only specific to life here on Earth?

2092
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,800
And that's a great question, because there's probably arguments

2093
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:32,080
to suggest that, yeah, there probably is a natural.

2094
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:34,520
There's a natural blueprint for physics in the universe.

2095
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:38,280
They're probably since life has to abide by physics,

2096
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:42,400
probably a natural, potentially natural blueprint for the evolution of all life,

2097
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:46,680
whether, again, bacterial or animal or human or anything else nonhuman.

2098
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,080
It makes sense.

2099
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:52,600
It makes sense that everything moves into greater levels of complexity

2100
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,360
from single celled organisms to human beings that pilot drones.

2101
01:43:56,600 --> 01:44:00,240
It just keeps going in the same general direction, observably here.

2102
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:04,440
And if the universe is infinite, that means there's infinite versions

2103
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:08,120
of what we're seeing here with us that exists throughout the cosmos

2104
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:11,560
and probably in infinite steps along the way. Right. Right.

2105
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:13,360
A hundred years from now, a thousand years from now.

2106
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,800
Well, not to make light of it, but I'll tell you recently.

2107
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:19,880
So I've learned over the years it's it's there's nothing more expensive

2108
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:21,560
than a than a cheap lawyer.

2109
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:26,000
So I've got a couple good lawyers that I that I work with on just contractual

2110
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,400
stuff, and one of them is named Ivan Hanel.

2111
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,120
I call him the bull.

2112
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:33,920
And I've learned to appreciate the the shout out to Ivan,

2113
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:37,480
the infinite complexity of law and legal. Right.

2114
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,360
So, right.

2115
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:42,240
So if if there is this natural progression, as we're talking about life,

2116
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,800
I mean, we even see it in our own human interactions. Right.

2117
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:49,320
This this this intricate complexity of how things work

2118
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:53,280
and how even in the way we behave with each other socially. Right.

2119
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:56,240
You look at a when I was in the in the government,

2120
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,960
you could look at a terrorist link analysis

2121
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,560
and that link analysis still follows those fractal patterns

2122
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:05,960
that the patterns in our our lungs, the patterns of lightning,

2123
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:10,800
the patterns of super meduline clouds and galaxy super clusters of galaxies

2124
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,880
all have that same pattern.

2125
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,480
And it's not just a physical pattern.

2126
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,000
It's a social pattern. Right.

2127
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,560
And so, again, I not to make joke of it, but I'm learning that it's

2128
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:24,400
beyond these patterns or beyond just physical patterns, you know,

2129
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:28,240
even in something as as as silly, but fundamental as law.

2130
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,720
There are these patterns that continue to spin off and whatnot.

2131
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,720
So, yeah, I can appreciate that.

2132
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,840
I think I think we're at a point now as a species

2133
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,280
where we probably should be having these conversations.

2134
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:42,560
And I'll also say this, Joe, there are parts of this conversation

2135
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,200
I don't feel the government has any place.

2136
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:49,200
There is definitely a national security conversation here.

2137
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:53,520
But the conversation we're having, as you can tell,

2138
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,560
is far beyond national security. Right.

2139
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:59,080
We're talking philosophical, psychological, sociological,

2140
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:04,200
theological implications that I'm not sure I want my government

2141
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:07,760
necessarily dictating for me what I should think about this.

2142
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:09,880
Well, the government is supposed to be working for us ultimately,

2143
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,560
and they are supposed to be us.

2144
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:13,960
You know, the problem is when you have access to information

2145
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,160
that's above and beyond the normal person's realm,

2146
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:19,280
that could affect everyone on this planet,

2147
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,640
this understanding that we are not alone.

2148
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:23,920
But not only that, we're probably not even alone here.

2149
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,120
It's not even that something is visiting us.

2150
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:28,440
Something's probably here all the time.

2151
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:32,760
You know, and this is the main thought about these underwater vehicles.

2152
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,280
Well, life is abundant on this planet, isn't it?

2153
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,760
And it thrives in places that we thought life could never thrive before.

2154
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:40,360
It's it's everywhere.

2155
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,920
It almost seems like a natural function if you have certain

2156
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:47,680
situations and circumstances on on a rock somewhere,

2157
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,760
then life pops up.

2158
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,480
It seems like if we can actually find it on Mars and they're

2159
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:58,400
like you were saying before, they may have found some sort of an evidence

2160
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,760
of microbiological life.

2161
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,440
If we find it on Mars and we find it somewhere,

2162
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:05,280
they think maybe Europa underneath the surface.

2163
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,280
That's right. That's right.

2164
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:10,080
And Europa probably is powered by volcanic vents the same way

2165
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,520
the bottom of our ocean is.

2166
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:13,800
There might be some sort of life.

2167
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,520
Chemosynthesis, not photosynthesis.

2168
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,920
And this is just what we know about here.

2169
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:22,960
You know, imagine all the different potential realities

2170
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,360
in terms of what a planet's atmosphere could be like.

2171
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:30,440
You know, you're dealing with larger planets that have more gravity.

2172
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:34,960
You're dealing with different kinds of temperature variations.

2173
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,320
Look at Titan. It's got a method.

2174
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,120
It's methane. And by the way, that's organic chemistry. Right.

2175
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,120
It's got methane clouds. Right. Right.

2176
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:44,720
So there are things that thrive in these types of environments.

2177
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:47,440
They have cow farts up there, too. Yeah, there are too many.

2178
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,600
But yeah, I mean, you're you're you're absolutely correct.

2179
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,880
I think we have again, this goes back to the original point of

2180
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:55,880
every time we try to put Mother Nature in a box,

2181
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:59,840
she always finds a way to wiggle her way out of it and prove us wrong.

2182
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,360
If the one thing we're right about is that we're always wrong. Right.

2183
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:06,880
How much whatever I don't know if you could talk about this,

2184
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:10,320
but how much of an effort is there to try to detect things

2185
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,840
under the surface of the ocean?

2186
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:16,600
I would defer that to the United States Navy and maybe NOAA.

2187
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,440
No oceanographic district.

2188
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,640
Yeah, no, no, no. Yeah, not the biblical Noah. Oh, Jesus.

2189
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:23,520
Yeah, no, no. I mean, no, I mean, it was that far back.

2190
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:26,240
National Oceanographic and and atmospheric.

2191
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:29,120
Speaking of going that far back, I mean, how much of

2192
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:33,440
I got to think that when people are delving into the stuff,

2193
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,080
they look at ancient scriptures and ancient

2194
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:42,320
these different depictions of things, whether it's the Vyamanas

2195
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:47,680
in the Hindu texts and whether it's in the Bhagavad Gita.

2196
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:50,680
There's all these different stories of in Ezekiel in the Bible.

2197
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:53,160
There's things that seem to.

2198
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,880
If I was a person living thousands of years ago

2199
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,960
and I encountered a flying saucer or encountered some spaceship

2200
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,200
from another planet, I would probably describe it

2201
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,440
in a way that they're describing it.

2202
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:07,320
Yeah, I mean, I mean, like just like sort of the Aztecs.

2203
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:09,880
Today's magic is tomorrow's technology, right?

2204
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:14,080
So I can tell you, when I went to Italy, I spoke to one of the senior

2205
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:18,000
I think it was a monsignor, one of the senior Vatican academics.

2206
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,000
And he said to me, he says, look,

2207
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,240
the Vatican doesn't have problem with this topic.

2208
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,880
This is something, in fact, in the six up into the 1600s,

2209
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:30,360
it was heretical to presume or assume that mankind was the only

2210
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:34,400
if you will, incarnation of God, representation of God.

2211
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,000
It was actually because in essence, you're putting limitations

2212
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,200
on the dominion of what God can and can't do. Right.

2213
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:44,360
And there are these scrolls, in fact, that are in the Vatican archives

2214
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,920
that discuss it's a conversation between a Roman soldier and a Roman general

2215
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:51,720
where they describe there's something called Eclipse.

2216
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:55,040
Eclipse in Latin means like sun eclipse, right?

2217
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,040
It's the shape of the Roman shield.

2218
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:00,520
And they talked about these flaming Roman shields in the sky

2219
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,600
that would follow them from battle space to battle space.

2220
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:07,080
And Mr. Jacques Vallee could probably expound much more upon that than I can.

2221
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:10,120
But this is just a brief conversation I had with with someone there.

2222
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:12,120
Jacques Vallee is very slippery.

2223
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,360
Is he? Very slippery.

2224
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:16,480
You know, he don't commit to anything.

2225
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,920
He looks at you sideways.

2226
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,400
And yeah, he you know, he's he did a lot of a lot of good stuff.

2227
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
And he's an incredibly smart guy.

2228
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,600
Great researcher of just phenomenal, you know, big reason that guy

2229
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,360
close encounters of the third kind.

2230
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:32,880
He's the inspiration for the French guy.

2231
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,160
I heard that. Yeah.

2232
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:35,360
I never had the guts to ask him.

2233
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,600
I figure he gets tired of being heard.

2234
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,240
I'm sure when you talk to him, the guy.

2235
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:43,040
But, you know, there's there's there's a lot of.

2236
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,680
And when you look at what the Vatican is, I mean, really,

2237
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:48,760
it's probably the world's oldest, most capable intelligence organization,

2238
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:52,000
because they have priests around the world that people will report

2239
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,720
miracles to, right, and confessions to.

2240
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,400
And eventually that gets filtered up to the Vatican.

2241
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:01,720
So, you know, talk about, you know, the world's first CIA and KGB.

2242
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:03,280
It was the it was Vatican, baby.

2243
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,280
Those guys had had it going on.

2244
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:10,160
And so no wonder they have all this archival, excuse me, archival information.

2245
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:13,600
And some of it relates to UAP. Wow.

2246
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:18,960
Yeah, it only makes sense that these things, if they're here now,

2247
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,560
they've probably been visiting us since back when we're on horseback.

2248
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:24,480
Yeah. And probably quite a bit before then.

2249
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,840
And maybe that's the scariest thing for people.

2250
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:29,720
They might be responsible for us being humans in the first place.

2251
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:32,200
Well, you remember the stories, right, of even Christopher Columbus

2252
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,280
coming over to the New World.

2253
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:37,000
There were some interesting accounts when they're on the water

2254
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,240
of potentially some sort of UAP interaction.

2255
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:41,280
I did not know that. Yeah, you can look it up online.

2256
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,640
This is all open source, but you can type it up.

2257
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:47,640
And there were some very interesting accounts and even, you know,

2258
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:51,120
old, old, old sailor accounts, you know, of, you know, people say, well,

2259
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:53,640
you know, old sailors also talked about, you know, big giant crack

2260
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,840
and stuff like that, but there was always an element of truth to it.

2261
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:59,160
Now we realize there are giant squid of the Pacific.

2262
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:02,760
Well, not only that, Kraken's, they think likely did exist.

2263
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:06,760
Yeah. Well, they because octopus when they brought, they don't leave anything.

2264
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:10,400
But they did find fossilized suction cups from. They still do.

2265
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:12,440
It's called the Great Squid of the Pacific. We find.

2266
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:14,000
Yeah, that that for sure.

2267
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,480
But they think maybe perhaps even an enormous octopus.

2268
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:19,480
That probably actually did go after boats.

2269
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,120
You know, we call we we call them sea monsters back then.

2270
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:24,720
But really, you know, we we laugh about it now.

2271
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,280
But it turns out there are sea monsters.

2272
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,440
Here's what's called great white sharks and megalodons.

2273
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:30,480
You know, that's a fucking sea monster.

2274
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:31,800
Right. That was a real thing.

2275
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:33,160
A great white shark is now.

2276
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:34,000
I mean, absolutely.

2277
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,440
Go swimming with a great white shark and tell me that's not a monster.

2278
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:37,040
Right. Exactly.

2279
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,920
So, you know, it's we just realize, oh, it's just part of nature.

2280
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,400
It's part of our existing paradigm.

2281
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,640
Tigers are monsters. Right. Absolutely.

2282
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,640
You know, especially at night when you don't have a flashlight,

2283
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:49,800
that thing behind the bush, that's a monster. Right. Right.

2284
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:54,640
Did you find anything on the Columbus stuff?

2285
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:56,720
One thing I'm seeing is from my Ancient Aliens episode.

2286
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:59,080
Now, you know, it's legit.

2287
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:02,080
I saw something crash into the water, but I can't find.

2288
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:04,240
Yeah, there was some reports of some interesting lights

2289
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:06,200
that the crew had reported.

2290
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,560
And it was actually he put it down in his log book.

2291
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,160
Something about some interest.

2292
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:12,120
Now, some folks will come back and say, well, that's St.

2293
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:14,360
Elmo's Fire, which absolutely could be, you know, what is St.

2294
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,920
Elmo's Fire? St. Elmo's Fire is a static charge.

2295
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,760
It occurs on the wingtips of aircraft.

2296
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:22,600
Even the old sailors would report it in certain environmental conditions.

2297
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:25,440
There is this weird greenish blue

2298
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:30,320
plasma glow that will often sometimes be seen on the tips of wingtips

2299
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:33,000
on aircraft. It's actually there's some really good pictures of it online.

2300
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:37,040
And even on the old mariner ships up towards the sails and the mast.

2301
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:40,120
And they believe it's it's

2302
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:42,360
it has to do with static charge.

2303
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,400
And under certain environments,

2304
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:47,800
it creates this this energized plasma and you can see it.

2305
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:49,800
And so is that similar to like ball lightning?

2306
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Well, it could be. Here you go.

2307
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,600
So and they call it St.

2308
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:56,320
Elmo's Fire. See that fucking bad ass.

2309
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:59,040
Yeah. And so that's yeah.

2310
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,080
It's either around the cockpit of the aircraft.

2311
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:03,720
Well, and by the way, you see the patterns, it's fractal, right?

2312
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:04,440
Look at that ship.

2313
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:07,440
So very, very interesting how St.

2314
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:10,320
Elmo's Fire, you know,

2315
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:15,040
can cause some people to, you know, perhaps see things and say it's also

2316
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:17,200
they might be seeing that. Yeah, they might. Right.

2317
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:20,520
But there are some accounts of ancient mariners who report

2318
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,680
strange, bizarre things. Yeah.

2319
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,280
Again, it makes sense.

2320
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:30,000
That was one of the more weird parts of Bob Lazar's

2321
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:36,920
story was that they've always been here and that they view us as containers.

2322
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,800
Containers. Interesting. Yeah.

2323
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:43,720
And he said there's a very thick document

2324
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:45,640
that relates to the

2325
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:50,080
the implications that it has on religion and like what

2326
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:52,600
what they the way they talk about us.

2327
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,640
Well, religion calls us vessels, right? Yeah.

2328
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:56,000
It's religious scripture.

2329
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,240
And a lot of different religions refer to humans as as vessels.

2330
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,160
You know, I'm certainly not a religious expert.

2331
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:05,240
So, you know, I don't want to pontificate here and say something that's inaccurate.

2332
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:08,120
But, you know, that that doesn't surprise me.

2333
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:12,160
Well, I think that the term was I think they were saying vessels for souls.

2334
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:16,560
But if you imagine that a being transcends

2335
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,720
its physical limitations of biological reality, right?

2336
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:23,720
So the biological evolution that led us to become homo sapiens

2337
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:25,800
over the course of, you know, X amount of millions of years,

2338
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:27,640
that's a very slow process.

2339
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:32,560
But technological innovation and technological progress is very quick,

2340
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:36,080
very, especially when you add in artificial intelligence, exponential.

2341
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:39,280
Yeah. So if something comes along, that

2342
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:43,800
is a life form that exists outside of biology,

2343
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:46,760
like something that we create, which it seems like we're doing right now.

2344
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,000
Like AI, right?

2345
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:49,280
When does that become sentient?

2346
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,400
Now is that a life form?

2347
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:55,680
You know, not biologically that thing in order for it to ever occur.

2348
01:55:56,480 --> 01:56:00,520
Maybe that thing needs a thing with a soul

2349
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:05,600
that has a creative desire, that has a lust for innovation

2350
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:07,480
and continues to make better and better things.

2351
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:09,800
And maybe that thing only exists in biology.

2352
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:15,560
And maybe the problem with artificial life is that it has no motivation

2353
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:20,960
and that we have, especially if it's self programmable, right?

2354
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:24,040
So one of the very bizarre things

2355
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,320
that was recently discovered about artificial intelligence,

2356
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:31,840
they gave artificial intelligence a certain amount of time

2357
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,960
to to code something, to figure something out.

2358
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:40,000
And when it didn't have enough time, it changed its code

2359
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:42,360
to give itself more time. Fascinating.

2360
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:45,080
Yeah. Like, what the fuck are you talking about?

2361
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:48,640
It is deciding that it doesn't like its limitations.

2362
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:54,840
So it won't have any of the biological motivation we have, right?

2363
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:56,760
It won't have ego.

2364
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,520
It won't have materialism.

2365
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,960
It won't have a desire for status.

2366
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:02,520
It won't have all the things that lead us

2367
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,440
to do some of the horrible things that human beings do.

2368
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:05,120
I could not agree more.

2369
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:06,720
And also some of the great things that human beings do.

2370
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:09,680
But maybe it also doesn't have any desire to create.

2371
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:13,800
Maybe the only way for its kind of life to exist

2372
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,560
is for a human being, a biological thing

2373
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:21,080
that's super intelligent in comparison to the rest of the animals on this planet

2374
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:27,080
that innovates to the point where it creates this artificial life.

2375
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,680
I'm going to share something very, very personal with you.

2376
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:33,680
And I know when I say with you, I know it's with everybody else, but, you know,

2377
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:38,600
part of my struggle is I can't I can't urge the government to be transparent.

2378
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:40,840
And I'm not transparent myself, right? It's hypocritical.

2379
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:42,800
So let me share with you a very personal story,

2380
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:46,440
because you bring something up that I think is fascinating.

2381
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,600
I'm a human being.

2382
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:53,680
But if for whatever reason I get into a car accident and I lose an arm,

2383
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:55,560
I'm still Lou Elizondo, right?

2384
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:58,040
In fact, if I lose my legs and all my arms, I'm still Lou.

2385
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:03,000
So my body doesn't define who I am and my intellect.

2386
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:06,080
Right. If I suffer a traumatic brain injury,

2387
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:09,240
let's say I'm in Afghanistan in a TBI

2388
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:13,200
and my my my brain is compromised.

2389
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,040
I'm still Lou.

2390
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:18,720
And so so what makes Lou or what makes Joe Joe?

2391
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:23,880
Well, it's not not your physical self and probably not even your intellectual self.

2392
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:27,600
My my mother, I was very close to my mother.

2393
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:31,080
My mother was was was incredible human being.

2394
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:34,640
And I'll share the story with you and take away with it what you want.

2395
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:38,600
I was very young, maybe two, two and a half, three years old.

2396
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:41,320
And I remember watching a show with my mother, one of my very first memories.

2397
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:45,120
And in this TV show, I remember what show it was.

2398
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:47,960
But I remember that a shark had eaten a dog.

2399
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,280
And I was shocked.

2400
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:52,920
My first understanding that what death was.

2401
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:55,200
I looked at my mom and said, Mom, what just happened?

2402
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:58,120
And she said, Well, son, the shark ate the dog.

2403
01:58:58,960 --> 01:58:59,760
So what does that mean?

2404
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,400
Says, Well, the dog is not coming back.

2405
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:02,760
The dog died.

2406
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:05,400
I said, Well, does everything die?

2407
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:07,360
She said, Well, yes, son, everything dies.

2408
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,400
I said, Well, mom, you're not you're not going to die.

2409
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,080
Your mom gave me life.

2410
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:13,720
She says, No, son, one day I'm going to die.

2411
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:18,360
And I remember spending from that day forward, as God as my witness,

2412
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:23,560
I spent every single day of my life knowing one day my mother was going to die.

2413
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,760
And it terrified me.

2414
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:28,120
I was very, very close with her.

2415
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:32,080
And one day that day came.

2416
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,960
My mother was diagnosed with cancer,

2417
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,000
and she started.

2418
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,240
Her body started failing.

2419
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:42,440
And despite the best efforts, she

2420
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,120
we knew she wasn't going to make it.

2421
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:49,280
And, you know, when you love somebody, sometimes

2422
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:53,480
doesn't sound right, but sometimes you deceive them.

2423
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:57,120
You know, they want to know they're in a bad state physically and mentally

2424
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:58,760
and say, you know, am I going to make it?

2425
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:01,360
And you say, Yeah, of course, you're going to make it right.

2426
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,960
Knowing full well that there's probably not a good chance you're going to make it.

2427
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,680
And so we're in the hospital.

2428
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:10,720
And my mother had at this point

2429
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:12,920
been in probably a state of coma for about a week.

2430
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:16,560
And it was just me, my wife and a couple of members of the family.

2431
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:20,240
Very, very sad moment.

2432
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:24,520
And my mother began this process of death called,

2433
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,720
you know, when someone's going to die, there's something called a death rattle.

2434
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:32,280
And it's when the mucus begins in the back of the throat to to congeal

2435
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,280
and it makes breathing.

2436
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:36,600
It can be very unnerving for the people who have to witnesses.

2437
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:40,120
It's very, very common. It's called death rattle.

2438
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,800
It's the body beginning to shut down.

2439
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:45,440
And I knew something told me my mom.

2440
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:49,800
My mom was going to go very quickly within the next 30 seconds to a minute.

2441
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:52,720
So long story short,

2442
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:57,280
my mother's body was at that point, it was a husk, an empty husk.

2443
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:58,720
It was broken.

2444
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:00,960
Her brain had shut down.

2445
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:07,040
And yet the very moment she passed away, within five seconds, I knew it.

2446
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:10,200
There was just something weird, something reached and said, this is it.

2447
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:11,280
She's going.

2448
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,320
And I reached over the bed and I looked at my mom.

2449
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:18,200
Her eyes all of a sudden opened up and she looked right at me.

2450
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:22,520
And even though her brain had been compromised and wasn't working,

2451
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:25,040
her body was was was nothing anymore.

2452
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:26,320
And she was a beautiful woman.

2453
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:28,400
She was she was she worked for Playboy.

2454
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,320
She was a beautiful lady at one time, a model.

2455
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:33,840
She was her body resembled nothing of what she did.

2456
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,200
She looked at me.

2457
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,760
And she passed, but we communicated.

2458
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:45,800
And I knew there was something else at that moment, more to a human being,

2459
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:48,480
more than just a body, more than just a brain.

2460
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:52,560
There is something that is.

2461
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,840
That is beyond the physical and even intellectual part

2462
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:58,600
of what it means to be human.

2463
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:00,440
And I felt it and everybody in the room felt it.

2464
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:01,440
It was undeniable.

2465
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:06,880
You can call it a soul and it achieve whatever, you know, you can put a label on it.

2466
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:07,880
I don't know what it's called.

2467
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:12,000
I don't know what it is, but I do know that was the essence of my mother.

2468
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,320
And the moment she passed, it was this weird feeling because.

2469
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:20,640
As my mother laid there dead in the bed.

2470
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:23,040
It wasn't my mother anymore.

2471
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:26,400
That essence, whatever made my mother my mother.

2472
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,160
And you could see the light in her eyes.

2473
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:31,120
It was like someone turning off the light switch is very.

2474
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:32,520
And I've been around death a lot.

2475
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:36,000
Never, you know, it's a terrible, horrible thing, especially in warfare.

2476
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,760
But but this was something, something visceral.

2477
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,600
This was something far more intimate.

2478
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:44,720
This was this cut to my soul and I could recognize it.

2479
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:49,040
And she recognized me and I recognized her, even though that the brain functions were gone.

2480
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:50,520
So so I guess my point is.

2481
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:54,880
I absolutely believe there's something more to the human experience

2482
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:58,760
than simply a tangible body and in a brain.

2483
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:01,440
And I and I witnessed this firsthand.

2484
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,400
Now, people can say all sorts of stuff they want to.

2485
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:04,280
You know, I don't care.

2486
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:06,000
You know, I got enough haters out there anyways.

2487
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,760
You know, they want to think that I'm trying to, you know,

2488
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:12,520
hope that my mother has a soul and she goes somewhere.

2489
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:15,080
I'm just telling you what I experienced and other people experience, too.

2490
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:18,240
And it was it was proof for me at that moment

2491
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:22,240
that there's much more to to us as as as human beings.

2492
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:26,040
I had a very similar feeling when I went to my grandfather's funeral

2493
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:28,360
and I saw him in the casket

2494
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:31,200
because it was it was an open casket.

2495
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:33,240
And I knew he's gone.

2496
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:34,320
I'm like, that's not him.

2497
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:35,560
That's right. It's just a show.

2498
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:37,160
And you can sense it. You feel it.

2499
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:39,320
Yeah. It was a very strange feeling.

2500
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,880
Yeah. You know, and obviously he's wearing makeup because they've got him

2501
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:44,080
in a suit and the whole deal.

2502
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:46,720
But I was like, that is not my grandfather.

2503
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:47,840
He's not there anymore.

2504
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:51,760
And it's not like you're trying to override this acknowledgement that they're dead.

2505
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:52,840
You know, they're dead.

2506
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:56,080
It's just that whatever made that person that person,

2507
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,320
it's not in the body anymore.

2508
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:03,080
It's gone. There's a bizarre feeling that we have that

2509
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:06,560
you don't you don't think his words for it.

2510
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:09,480
Yeah, I agree with you. It's a feeling it is.

2511
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:12,960
And you can it's again, it's not an intellectual or even a physical thing. Yeah.

2512
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:23,560
The idea that we're containers for souls is just so goddamn creepy.

2513
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:26,160
This is a farm of souls.

2514
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:30,000
I'm not familiar with that hypothesis, but it sounds interesting.

2515
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:32,000
Also scary, perhaps.

2516
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,760
Well, it's scary for us because, you know, but.

2517
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:43,880
Like you, you got to wonder why we are so different than every other creature

2518
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:48,760
in that we have this insane, insatiable desire to change our environment,

2519
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:54,880
constantly build bigger skyscrapers and to move the earth.

2520
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:59,080
And we're constantly inventing new technology.

2521
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:03,640
I mean, it seems to be an instinct that's a part of us.

2522
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:09,960
And I agree this gradual progression of life is life goes from intelligent

2523
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:12,360
biological life to super intelligent.

2524
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:16,760
Whatever it is, whatever, whatever kind of technology creates it,

2525
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,880
that life is not as simple as.

2526
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:27,160
This natural selection model that we have here

2527
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:30,840
that we think applies to life, that this is a type of life.

2528
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:33,560
And then there's a life that this thing creates.

2529
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:37,800
Well, you know, evolution isn't just a physical thing, is it?

2530
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:44,040
Evolution is is the ability to change within one's environment over time.

2531
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:47,760
And that's a that's a that's a fascinating concept you bring up,

2532
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:51,120
because some speculate that it is inevitable

2533
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:53,880
that human beings will eventually evolve into something.

2534
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:56,480
We're just a link in a much longer chain. Right.

2535
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:00,440
And that all intelligent life potentially goes through this process.

2536
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:04,480
And that this is a natural process where eventually we actually make ourselves

2537
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:07,280
extinct, not not in the way where we kill ourselves. Right.

2538
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,880
But we wind up creating a life form, whether it's A.I.

2539
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:13,040
or we start enhancing ourselves with more and more machine interface.

2540
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:17,120
And and and, you know, life doesn't have to necessarily be organic. Right.

2541
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:18,080
You could have potential.

2542
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:20,680
Silicon is very, very close to carbon in some cases.

2543
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:25,720
So, you know, is it possible that that life it is it is destiny

2544
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:29,480
for all life eventually to evolve itself out of existence

2545
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:32,520
and bring in or usher in a new type of life form? Yeah.

2546
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:36,320
Is it possible? I mean, certainly from a technological perspective.

2547
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:37,360
I mean, ask Elon Musk.

2548
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:40,160
It seems that we're, you know, we're making a lot of advancements

2549
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:42,360
right now to augment the human experience.

2550
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:47,200
And given, as you said, how technology progresses exponentially, very quickly

2551
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:50,480
in the next 200 years, I mean, we might be there.

2552
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,840
Is this sort of conversation being had in the government

2553
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:56,840
about what these things potentially are?

2554
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:59,600
I not to my knowledge, and I sure hope not,

2555
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:02,920
because I don't think the government this is a conversation.

2556
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:03,960
This is where I go back to.

2557
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:07,680
This is a conversation that involves a lot of people, you know,

2558
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:11,560
whether it's your your priest or your rabbi or your imam

2559
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:15,880
or it is your philosophy teacher at the university.

2560
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:20,560
I think I think we're getting into an area now that is beyond national security.

2561
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:23,040
And I'm honestly, Joe, I'm not comfortable

2562
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:26,640
with my government taking that aspect on,

2563
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:29,160
because frankly, I don't trust my government

2564
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:31,680
to manage what I should think about something.

2565
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:34,280
Tell me what is I'm OK with.

2566
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,400
Don't tell me how to think about it.

2567
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:37,760
Don't tell me how to process that, you know, because now you're

2568
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:40,160
now you're overstepping your bounds.

2569
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:41,840
It's also other human beings.

2570
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:43,680
The government is just human beings.

2571
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:47,600
That's right. Human beings shouldn't have this insane knowledge

2572
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:49,200
and keep it from other human beings.

2573
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:52,280
Well, in fact, it's it's not it's illegal, especially in our democracy.

2574
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:54,760
There's this type of stuff is supposed to be discussed

2575
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:58,000
with certain members of Congress and certain elements of the executive branch.

2576
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:00,120
And when somebody I don't care if you're in the government

2577
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:03,400
or in a religion or anything like that, this goes to the to the fundamental

2578
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:05,960
pillar of something that that agrees me, which is corruption.

2579
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:09,360
Now, when I say corruption, let me let me backtrack a little bit.

2580
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:13,840
My father recently died this this last father's day, not this one,

2581
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:18,560
but the one before. And I had the privilege of of knowing he was sick.

2582
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:20,600
And so we took a road trip down to Miami

2583
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:23,440
and about a month and a half before he died.

2584
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:24,640
And he never told me he was sick.

2585
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:26,840
But but I knew something was wasn't right.

2586
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:30,000
I knew my father for a long time and something wasn't right.

2587
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,720
He started losing weight and I could see he wasn't eating as much.

2588
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:35,680
And there were telltale signs and he didn't want to tell me.

2589
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:39,160
And I asked my father almost almost flippantly, I said, Dad,

2590
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:41,960
I think we're probably somewhere by St.

2591
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:45,200
Louis. And I said, Dad, what is the greatest threat to humanity?

2592
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:46,640
To humans, what is the greatest threat?

2593
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:50,040
Now, I say flippantly because I'm thinking, you know, terrorism, right?

2594
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:53,400
This and that. My father thought for a second, he looks at me, says, son,

2595
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:56,040
it's corruption.

2596
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:57,480
And I said, what do you mean corruption?

2597
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:00,960
Like like like financial corruption, governmental corruption?

2598
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:01,960
He says, no.

2599
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:06,480
Corruption at its heart is when you are willing to

2600
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:12,280
bypass your own moral code, your own ethics for something else.

2601
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:16,000
And whether it's it's financial corruption,

2602
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:19,680
religious corruption, governmental corruption, or even

2603
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:24,720
moral corruption, when you start to compromise on your own values,

2604
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:29,600
it's a very quick downward spiral to to utter chaos.

2605
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:33,240
And he know that firsthand because my father was in the Bay of Pigs invasion.

2606
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:35,200
He was a political prisoner of Castro.

2607
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,120
He actually fought with Castro against Batista.

2608
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:41,080
And then when Castro went communist, my father joined the folks here

2609
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:44,760
and the friendly folks at the CIA and was part of the invasion of the Bay of Pigs.

2610
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:47,600
He spent two years in Castro's prisons being tortured.

2611
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:51,000
Um, so when he came to this country,

2612
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:56,200
this country offered us opportunities that no other country could or would.

2613
02:09:57,120 --> 02:10:00,000
And the reason why Cuba failed was because of corruption.

2614
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:04,520
And he said, look, corruption will be the end of all.

2615
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:07,800
And and if if it's a very quick downward spiral

2616
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:12,680
with democracy, that if democracy becomes corrupt, you now have tyranny.

2617
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:16,840
Right. And so every time someone in the government is willing to

2618
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:21,000
compromise a little bit on the value of what it means to serve the American people

2619
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,320
and they forget that they become corrupt.

2620
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:28,040
And that actually erodes the very essence of what democracy is

2621
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:29,960
and what this country is about.

2622
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:33,760
And that is why it is so important that the individuals in our government

2623
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,800
that don't want to have this conversation and don't want to talk to Congress

2624
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:39,440
and are making the unilateral decision on your behalf

2625
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:42,960
and the American taxpayer in my behalf, that's wrong.

2626
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,680
They don't have the right to do that.

2627
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:47,160
There is a process of rules and laws we have in this country

2628
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:48,880
that we've all agreed to are going to abide by.

2629
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:50,400
And that includes them.

2630
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,280
And they don't have the right to bypass that.

2631
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:54,480
Even if they think they're doing it for the right reason.

2632
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:55,840
I disagree with that.

2633
02:10:55,840 --> 02:11:00,920
I think I think this democracy only works because we all agree it works.

2634
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,400
Right. And the moment you begin to compromise on that,

2635
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:05,920
all of democracy is at risk.

2636
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:07,200
And I mean that sincerely.

2637
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:10,880
It's not a it's not a slow downward spiral.

2638
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:13,200
It's quick. And you can hit rock bottom very, very quickly.

2639
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:16,720
And the only reason why this government works is because we all have faith

2640
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:21,800
and a commitment to what we consider are the American values

2641
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:25,480
and serving the American people and, you know, for the people, by the people.

2642
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:29,400
So I think it's very dangerous when when elements in the government.

2643
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:31,240
And I want I don't want to villainize the whole government

2644
02:11:31,240 --> 02:11:32,600
because the government's full of great people.

2645
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:34,600
They do great things. They keep us safe.

2646
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:37,320
So I'm talking about the minority few.

2647
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:39,560
Some of these people who have actually gone after me

2648
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:41,840
and will probably continue to come after me to try to discredit me

2649
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:44,640
and everything else, despite the volumes of documentation

2650
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:47,040
that I have in my possession and others,

2651
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:48,720
because they don't want to have the conversation.

2652
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:51,080
And they are happy with the status quo.

2653
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:56,480
And to me, that is a greater threat than any UAP could ever have on humanity.

2654
02:11:56,480 --> 02:12:01,760
It's it's the greatest threat is how we perceive ourselves

2655
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:06,560
and what we are willing to do to keep this a secret in violation of the commitment.

2656
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:11,040
And and and what we have done to we've sworn in some cases

2657
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:13,480
to uphold the values of this country.

2658
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:15,560
And I think that's a concern for me.

2659
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:19,000
And that's why I don't want certain elements having this conversation

2660
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,400
of what this means, you know, the bigger macro level conversation,

2661
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,080
because I don't think they're qualified.

2662
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:26,400
I'm not qualified. I knew that.

2663
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,040
I'm damn sure they're not qualified here.

2664
02:12:28,040 --> 02:12:32,920
So this is why I think this type of national level conversation is so important.

2665
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:34,640
At the end of the day, it's not up to me.

2666
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:35,680
People say, Lou, what do you think?

2667
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:37,600
You know what the hell what I think doesn't matter what I think.

2668
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:38,720
What matters is what you think.

2669
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:40,400
Here's the information. Here's the data.

2670
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:41,600
You figure it out.

2671
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:45,360
Don't ask me for what this means, because I'm not entitled to that.

2672
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:47,000
I didn't I didn't earn that privilege.

2673
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,320
And I would definitely never take it away because that is that is that is sacred.

2674
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:53,440
That's you. That's up to you to decide for yourself.

2675
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:56,800
And this is this is part of my frustration

2676
02:12:57,320 --> 02:12:59,880
with this overall conversation, because there are elements

2677
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:03,200
that don't want you to have this conversation.

2678
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:05,240
Well said, Lou. Thank you very much, man.

2679
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:06,840
Thanks for being here. I really enjoyed it.

2680
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:08,320
Really enjoyed our conversation.

2681
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:11,320
Joe, this has been fantastic and truly, truly an honor and privilege.

2682
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:13,680
You have one hell of a responsibility.

2683
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:15,280
You are. You are.

2684
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:18,760
Look, I got to tell you, I don't ever get nervous doing an interview.

2685
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:22,160
You were the first one and probably the only one

2686
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:25,360
I will ever have been nervous coming in just simply because

2687
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:28,800
not because of me, because of you, the responsibilities

2688
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:31,080
you have on your shoulders to have a communicate.

2689
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:33,280
You reach a global audience.

2690
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:36,880
People are listening to this conversation right now.

2691
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:38,800
And by the way, they're part of this conversation.

2692
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:40,600
Very much so. Right.

2693
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:42,640
That is an enormous responsibility.

2694
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:46,880
You have a voice in some cases that exceeds presidents.

2695
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,600
The technology, you now have it available to your fingertips

2696
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:52,040
and this wonderful staff you have.

2697
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:54,440
You are influencing the world.

2698
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:58,080
And I can't imagine that type of responsibility.

2699
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:02,480
I mean, there are world leaders that don't have the voice you have.

2700
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:07,320
And so for me, it is a profound, profound honor and privilege

2701
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:10,560
to be with you here today and your wonderful audience.

2702
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:15,040
You know, if I never see you again, I wish you the best of luck.

2703
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:17,880
You are you're doing America a great service.

2704
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:20,000
Be honest, be candid, speak your mind.

2705
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,320
That's all I can say as a little chicken here in in in the United States.

2706
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:27,840
You you've got big shoulders, man.

2707
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:30,520
You got a big weight on a lot of responsibility on your back.

2708
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:33,360
And I mean, this is freaking me out, man.

2709
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:35,320
Tell you. But thank you very much.

2710
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:37,880
Thanks again. I really appreciate everything you've said.

2711
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:41,680
And I appreciate your everything you said about disclosure

2712
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:44,040
and how important it is. I couldn't agree more.

2713
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:46,320
Joe, it's been my honor and privilege sincerely.

2714
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:47,720
My honor, too. Thank you very much.

2715
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:49,080
Thank you. All right. Bye, everybody.
