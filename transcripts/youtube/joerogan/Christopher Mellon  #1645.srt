1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,560
Alright, well thanks for being here man, I appreciate it.

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
Pleasure, absolutely pleasure.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,760
Tell everybody who you are and what your background is.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,080
Okay, my name is Chris Mellon and I spent about 20 years working for Uncle Sam, worked

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,180
in the Senate for the Intelligence Committee and for Senator Cohen, also did some Armed

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,240
Services Committee work.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,760
When he was asked to become Secretary of Defense, he asked me if I would like to go with him

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,320
to the Pentagon, be part of his team and I was honored and gladly accepted.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,440
So then served for four years in the Defense Department with Senator Cohen, Secretary Cohen

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,640
at that point.

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,480
In various positions, all intelligence related and security related and then I was asked

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:10,060
to stay on after Clinton departed and so I worked for Secretary Rumsfeld and then went

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,120
back to the Senate Intelligence Committee as the Minority Staff Director shortly before

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,420
the Second Iraq War.

15
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,480
So when did you get interested in the subject of UFOs?

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,140
That happened at a surprisingly early age, I was seven years old at a boarding school

17
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,680
and the principal of the school, a friend of his had photographed a video, an old reel-to-reel

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,720
Kodak movie camera, taken a movie, a home movie of a video of a UFO flying in beautiful

19
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:51,660
blue skies, cumulus clouds, huge golden disk that comes into the picture and banks, goes

20
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,980
into a cloud and it disappears into this sort of wispy cloud in a way that would be very

21
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,580
very hard I think to fake somehow, particularly in those days with no computer generated imagery

22
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:10,780
and it comes out the other side and then sort of goes off over the horizon and I was stunned

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,920
and flabbergasted myself and all the other kids ran outside that night and were looking

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,040
at the stars and it just sparked my curiosity, a life-long curiosity.

25
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,720
So once you got into government and once you were, I mean you were there, you were basically

26
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,680
there, you had to start asking questions like did you wait a while?

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,800
Like how long did you ask for, you were like hey, what do you guys know?

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,340
Well, for a long time I waited, very rarely, I looked for openings, I looked for opportunities,

29
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:50,140
so for example, you know the stigma is so great that you're reluctant obviously to raise

30
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
that issue.

31
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,800
A couple times there were some natural opportunities, so one of my colleagues on the Intelligence

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:05,500
Committee was going to Hawaii for some oversight trips, meetings and he went to the Maui Space

33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,620
Optical Tracking Facility and I said to him, why are you there, why don't you just check

34
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,540
and see, do they ever see anything weird they can't explain and so forth.

35
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,820
So he did and Pete called me up and said hey, you wouldn't believe this, I've got this video

36
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,500
tape here and it shows these weird things and so I talked to the Air Force people, they

37
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,420
sent the tape to us, turns out it was totally unclassified, I showed it to Senator Cohen

38
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:42,300
and some others and it ended up on national TV actually but it didn't generate any further

39
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,300
response.

40
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,780
Everybody just kind of threw their hands up in the air and said well, you know, that's

41
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,340
interesting but we don't know what to do with it.

42
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,200
It was a Ted Koppel's Nightline show that this tape was played on and it showed sort

43
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,980
of five objects moving parallel to the ground, possibly in formation, they're in the atmosphere

44
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,620
because they're burning, they're interacting with something, there's plasma coming off

45
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,500
them which wouldn't presumably be happening in space but they seem to be too slow to be

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
meteorites.

47
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,020
So it was mystifying and difficult to explain, never did get an answer.

48
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:24,800
Occasionally something like that would happen but by and large the issue almost never arose.

49
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,740
The issue is a weird issue because if you bring it up in the wrong company or at the

50
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,080
wrong time, you could be dismissed as a loon.

51
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,680
Did you feel that when you were there, as a person who had a budding interest in unidentified

52
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,920
flying objects and what have you, did you feel like this is a politically risky thing

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,800
to discuss, especially to discuss in serious terms, do you believe in these things, what

54
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,480
are they, what do we know?

55
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,120
Was that an issue?

56
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,280
Absolutely.

57
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:05,800
I concealed my interest in the topic for years and very carefully and confided to a few trustworthy

58
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,600
friends, had a few heart-to-heart talks with a couple individuals when I found a fellow

59
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,600
traveler who was interested in this topic but by and large absolutely wanted to conceal

60
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,860
that and not reveal that.

61
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Did you know Clinton?

62
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,340
No.

63
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,340
No?

64
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,340
He would be the guy that I would go to.

65
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,980
There was a request that came to me once that I think was from President Clinton and it

66
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:42,100
was one of the astronauts claimed to have seen a UFO out at Edwards Air Force Base and

67
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:48,820
it was videotaped he said and he described this in his memoir and wanted the president

68
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,660
to get hold of the tape, of the video.

69
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,740
And Secretary Cohen came back to the Pentagon from a meeting and a message came down to

70
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:04,180
me to go to try to find this tape and unfortunately there was, I got nowhere with that.

71
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,740
The Air Force was adamant that there was no such tape, there was no such information,

72
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,180
anything they had on UFOs had been destroyed.

73
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,900
So I had one of these situations that's very common in this area which is you have just

74
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:25,220
two apparently credible sources but utterly conflicting, irreconcilable information which

75
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,820
seems to happen often in this field.

76
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:35,740
Now being as you were in government and very close to literally the machine that runs the

77
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:44,740
world, what's the general perception when people are discussing these things in Washington?

78
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,700
What's the general perception of what's going on with these things?

79
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,620
I'm happy to say that it's changed, that perception has changed considerably in the last few years.

80
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,460
People feel like they have permission to talk about it.

81
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,740
When do you think this happened?

82
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:03,140
This happened after the New York Times article and subsequent press beginning in 2017, December

83
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,180
2017.

84
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:11,020
And that sort of gave people permission to talk about this and I've actually had Pentagon

85
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,140
friends who said you know this is kind of cool, we don't have to go in the closet to

86
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,820
talk about this anymore.

87
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,740
What do you think kept it in the closet before?

88
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
When did the stigma start?

89
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,060
Do you think this was like intentionally sort of set up this way?

90
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,300
It was.

91
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:32,160
It was the Robertson panel commission 1953 and they concluded during those Cold War days

92
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,900
that this was a potential threat to national security because UFO reports might overwhelm

93
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:44,260
our air defense and communication system and that the Soviets might spook the public and

94
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,500
somehow manipulate this issue.

95
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:53,100
So they actually advocated in writing that this issue be debunked and discredited and

96
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:59,460
the government went ahead and did so extremely successfully, unfortunately.

97
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,860
And this all started with the Project Blue Book, correct?

98
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
Correct.

99
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,860
It was during that era.

100
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,660
So what was the gentleman's name that was running Project Blue Book again?

101
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,940
Well there were different people.

102
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
The guy who went on.

103
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,500
The astronomer, Alan Hynek?

104
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Hynek.

105
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,740
And Hynek went on to become a believer.

106
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,580
So he started debunking and was told essentially the way he reported it was that he was told

107
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,460
to kind of debunk every single case.

108
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,860
Everything he could find, whether it was swamp gas or ball lightning, find some way to explain

109
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,080
this away.

110
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,580
But then once he left Project Blue Book, he started openly discussing these cases and

111
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,340
he started discussing his own belief.

112
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
That's correct.

113
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:45,540
He felt badly burned as well because he was trying to carry out his mandate that the Air

114
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,380
Force had given him.

115
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,820
As you may recall, in one instance he went to Michigan and famously declared that the

116
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,340
people of Michigan were misconstruing swamp gas for flying objects.

117
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,460
And so Gerald Ford, who was representing that district, got incensed as did the local population

118
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,100
and Congress took a fleeting interest in the topic.

119
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,780
And Dr. Hynek was very embarrassed and understandably so.

120
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:17,020
It was really quite insulting to these people who had had very clear sightings of these

121
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,100
objects.

122
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:27,380
So he did eventually change his view publicly and was very critical of Project Blue Book.

123
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:33,780
Was all this stuff like being inside the government and knowing how prevalent these sightings

124
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,700
are and how credible some of them are?

125
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,300
Was it frustrating to you to be a part of this and to know that this information is

126
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,100
kind of being squashed and distorted?

127
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,700
It's interesting that what happened actually is that I wasn't seeing information squashed

128
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,060
or distorted in the Pentagon or the intelligence community.

129
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:03,300
I saw one instance of a very technical, very classified report that explained away some

130
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,660
sightings that nobody even knew were being reported otherwise.

131
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:14,220
It was kind of odd to see this explanation about an incident that had not been otherwise

132
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,220
reported.

133
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,260
What was this incident?

134
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,900
This was some military pilots doing reconnaissance missions who were seeing some very unusual

135
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,700
lights.

136
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,420
The Directorate of Science and Technology at CIA did an extensive analysis and found

137
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,820
a plausible explanation for what they had seen that was not extraterrestrial.

138
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,020
They published an article on that.

139
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:42,300
It was a good article, a good piece of research, but that was about the only time I ever saw

140
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,700
anything that in writing about this subject, which the government said it wasn't following,

141
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
it wasn't interested in.

142
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
I had friends who would call me up.

143
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,540
I had a Navy friend who was a pilot, and he said, you wouldn't believe what happened

144
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,540
at our base today.

145
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,540
There was a plane up and there was a UFO flying around it and it landed, and he knew I was

146
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,780
interested in this from college days, and he called me up with his hair on fire to tell

147
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:10,100
me about this incident, but that kind of thing was not going up through channels.

148
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,860
People in the Pentagon, to the best of my knowledge, all the way up to the sec def,

149
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,380
were not hearing or seeing any of these reports.

150
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:25,140
It wasn't until I met Luis Elizondo and his group and some of the Navy guys and talked

151
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,340
to the pilots about what was happening on the East Coast from 2015 onward and the Nimitz

152
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:36,540
incident that I found out that this activity had been going on and just wasn't being reported.

153
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,820
Was it that no one in the Pentagon was seeking this out?

154
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,740
There wasn't a mandate to go look for it?

155
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,340
There wasn't a department that was designed to seek these things out?

156
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,780
What was the reason why it wasn't getting all the way to the Pentagon?

157
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:55,140
Well, specifically in the case of the Navy in 2016, just today I believe, or yesterday,

158
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:01,200
DoD announced that they're going to do an IG investigation of this incident, of this

159
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
phenomenon.

160
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
What's IG mean?

161
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
The Inspector General.

162
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Okay.

163
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Sorry.

164
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,100
So there's going to be an internal investigation at DoD of how they handled this UFO issue.

165
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,620
I believe it's not clear yet.

166
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,020
They just made this announcement and their motives and what sparked this are still a

167
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,180
little bit uncertain, but it appears they're going to focus on this issue of how did this

168
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,900
fall through the cracks for years?

169
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,500
How is it that these guys are flying around, seeing this stuff, it's on the radar, and

170
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,540
nobody up the chain of command is being notified?

171
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:43,780
Policymakers, the Secretary of Defense himself, Congress, et cetera, it was just going into

172
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,780
the ether.

173
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:52,060
There was no effort made to get support to any of those guys and that's when I kind of

174
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,700
threw the bullshit flag and said, this is unacceptable.

175
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,980
So that's when I started jumping into this.

176
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,500
Do you think it was because of the stigma that's attached to the subject that they just

177
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,540
didn't bother bringing it to their superiors?

178
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,100
Absolutely, yeah.

179
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,460
People were afraid to report it, and as we saw in the Nimitz case some years earlier

180
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,260
in 2004.

181
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,420
Let's explain what we're talking about.

182
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,140
We're talking about Commander David Fravor in his sightings off the coast of San Diego,

183
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:23,180
the tic-tac-shaped UFO that moved at extraordinary speed with no known propulsion system.

184
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,180
They tracked it on radar.

185
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,460
It was actively jamming their radar.

186
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,140
It went to their predetermined point where they were supposed to scramble.

187
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,140
Cap point.

188
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,140
Yeah.

189
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,460
Somehow or another it had information as to where they were traveling to.

190
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,460
Extraordinary capability.

191
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Absolutely phenomenal.

192
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,180
Went from 80,000 feet above sea level to one in less than a second.

193
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,020
They have no idea what it is, what it does.

194
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,500
And then the people on the Nimitz were saying they had been seeing these things.

195
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,740
Correct, and on the Princeton.

196
00:13:51,740 --> 00:14:00,340
And when Dave and the other F-18 landed there was no interest on the part of the intelligence

197
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,580
officers of doing anything really other than ridiculing them.

198
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,020
So they came out with tin hats on and foil hats and they were playing the Men in Black

199
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,420
song or something.

200
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,840
But that case was phenomenal because there were so many witnesses and so many different

201
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,220
sensor systems that were verifying independently the visual reporting.

202
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:28,580
So there were multiple radars, there were infrared systems, perfect viewing conditions,

203
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:35,060
broad daylight, middle of the afternoon, multiple aircraft, and all of the data agrees that

204
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,900
these craft are doing things that we thought were impossible.

205
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,900
And then there was also the thing that led them to see it in the first place, which was

206
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,340
that he thought there was something under the surface of the ocean.

207
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,900
What happened was he was vectored, he and his wingman were vectored to intercept that

208
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,660
tic-tac at that point when they arrived and looked down, they saw it moving around and

209
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,060
they saw the water roiled.

210
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,300
In fact, I think first they saw the water before they saw the tic-tac.

211
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,620
They saw something unusual, it looked like white water breaking on a reef kind of thing.

212
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,660
And then they saw the tic-tac and then Dave dove down to get close to it and it reacted

213
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,180
to his presence, turned around, viewed him, and then started taking countermeasures.

214
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:24,540
And it was clear to the pilots in both aircraft that this thing maintained a dominant position

215
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,140
throughout their engagement with it, that it could easily have done what it wanted to

216
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
them.

217
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,900
They had no chance really of getting behind it or getting the upper hand in that engagement.

218
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,660
Then when he went and reported this, that's when things get weird, right?

219
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,140
Because people have to dissect this information and look at this guy, Commander Fravor, very

220
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,500
respected guy, not the type of person who makes up wacky stories.

221
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,900
And when it's supported by all this data, I think that's probably one of the biggest

222
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,620
ones that led to it being included in the New York Times, right?

223
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,300
Correct, absolutely.

224
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,420
Because it was so credible.

225
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,660
And then there was the Go Fast video and the FLIR video and all these other videos that

226
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,900
show these things moving in extraordinary ways.

227
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Correct.

228
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,980
And they're authentic, the Defense Department acknowledged those videos.

229
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,940
Why do you think they did that?

230
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,940
They didn't do it initially, but ultimately they didn't have much choice.

231
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:28,300
And I think the reason that they finally did is because we had taken this issue to Congress.

232
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,220
I had taken, I contacted some former colleagues on the committee and said, you guys really

233
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,220
ought to look at this.

234
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,740
I mean, it sounds crazy, but give me a chance here.

235
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,460
And so a couple of them started taking interest, some of the staffers started meeting with

236
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,900
some of the pilots.

237
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,700
When they started requesting briefings that, coming from the Senate Armed Services and

238
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,980
Intelligence Committees, that went up the flagpole at the top.

239
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,340
And the Navy brass and the senior Pentagon civilians in the Office of the Secretary of

240
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,380
Defense became aware that these committees are taking an official interest now.

241
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,180
And we can't fool around with this.

242
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,820
And we have to really be straight and put it out there.

243
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,900
So at that point, they couldn't tell them in private, yeah, this is real, and then publicly

244
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,060
deny it wasn't.

245
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,260
So they came clean.

246
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,780
So this is the great shift, right?

247
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:23,260
The great shift in our time of, from UFOs being ridiculed and being these silly things

248
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,860
that tinfoil hat conspiracy theory people believe in, to the Defense Department agreeing

249
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,540
that this is an issue.

250
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
That's correct.

251
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
Very interesting to me.

252
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,340
I saw your interview with Elon Musk, and he seemed unaware as...

253
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
He's an alien, bro.

254
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,340
Listen, he's covering up.

255
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,700
Well, okay, maybe he's part of the cover-up.

256
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,300
He seemed unaware that his own government has taken the position that UFOs are real.

257
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,180
I got Elon in trouble because we smoked pot on the show.

258
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,180
I heard about that.

259
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,820
And when he got in trouble, his top-secret clearance was in trouble, and there was a

260
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
lot going on.

261
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,780
And I think he's trying to play it straight and narrow when he's around me now.

262
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
Like, aliens.

263
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,780
Outrageous.

264
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,580
I always advise that getting high in a program would not be a good thing to do.

265
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,580
Yeah, it's not a good move.

266
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,580
Don't do it.

267
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,940
If you want to drink, that's probably a better move.

268
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
I'll stick to the coffee.

269
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,940
Okay, stick to the coffee.

270
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,180
That's a good move.

271
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,180
We want to be clear here, right?

272
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:20,580
We want to be clear-headed when we discuss this because it's such an easily ridiculed

273
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,380
thing.

274
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,220
It's one of those things like psychics and Bigfoot.

275
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,380
You bring it up, and people just automatically start rolling their eyes.

276
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,180
But statistically, if you just look at the size of the universe and you look at the fact

277
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:40,020
that there's so many Goldilocks zone planets that they've already discovered, and then

278
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:47,580
also the wide variety of life that exists in various conditions on Earth, who knows?

279
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,740
And who knows whether or not these things are living in the ocean?

280
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,700
This is what's bizarre to me, is there's a lot of these sightings.

281
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,220
The one in Hawaii recently, and there's another one that Jeremy Korbel leaked, this photograph

282
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,940
that shows something disappearing into the ocean.

283
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,780
There seems to be multiple sightings and multiple witnesses that discuss things going into the

284
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
ocean.

285
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,540
Yeah, that is absolutely true.

286
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:22,740
In terms of backing up on your question there a little bit, people ask me, do you believe

287
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,740
in aliens?

288
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,500
And that's really not the question or the issue for most people.

289
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,020
There are probably, in an infinite universe, an infinite number of alien civilizations.

290
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,340
The question is, could we ever communicate with them or have contact, right?

291
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:43,700
So what's interesting about that to me, in part, is that we have NASA spending billions

292
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,600
to try to find alien life, even if it's microbial.

293
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,700
We have Yuri Milner spending hundreds of millions and supporting the SETI program.

294
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,900
And meanwhile, we have these things flying around our atmosphere that we're seeing on

295
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:02,540
the radar that kind of look and act like what you might expect if somebody sent a probe.

296
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,780
We followed the trajectory, we're on ourselves today.

297
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,980
And they're doing incredible things that we don't understand.

298
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:16,740
And yet the scientific community and the government have not wanted to dare to ask the question

299
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,020
in this context that they ask every day in this other context with NASA and spend billions

300
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,660
of dollars on.

301
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,020
And there's no crosstalk.

302
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,620
You know, scientifically, we would expect actually, you know, they're listening for

303
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:36,460
these signals from outer space, but it's more efficient to send probes and it's safer.

304
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,820
And that's what we are doing ourselves.

305
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,980
And so that's what would probably be more likely.

306
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,940
A probe would give more information.

307
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,540
It wouldn't reveal the location or the source of the civilization that was sending it.

308
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,500
You know, it's more dynamic and versatile, it could get closer to the target, et cetera.

309
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,740
There's all kinds of advantages, including energy.

310
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,180
And it would be easy for a civilization more advanced than ours, we're getting on the cusp

311
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:10,620
of this ourselves, to create, using artificial intelligence, probes that were self-sufficient,

312
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,100
launch them out in whatever numbers, let them go see what they find and report back.

313
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,700
And that's entirely plausible.

314
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,740
There's no scientific reason for thinking that that couldn't happen.

315
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:30,260
If even one spacefaring society started to expand outward as we are in our galaxy, in

316
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:36,180
the Milky Way, within a tiny fraction of the lifetime of the Milky Way, they could explore

317
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,660
and colonize the entire galaxy.

318
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,980
So even if, you know, they haven't achieved superluminal travel, they can't violate the

319
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:49,020
speed of light and go faster than that, if they went, say, 20% the speed of light and

320
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:55,180
just continued to steadily expand their domain and explore outward in the space of two or

321
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,220
three million years, they could have gone from one end of the galaxy to the other.

322
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,860
So it's not an unreasonable proposition.

323
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,740
It's a question of getting the facts, and it's about time some of us think that we take

324
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,260
it seriously and start looking at it.

325
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,340
Do most people who look at this believe that this is some sort of a probe?

326
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,780
Like when you look at the Tic Tac video.

327
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,300
Well, Dave himself says it's not from around here.

328
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,900
It wasn't made here, not made by us.

329
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,500
And he doesn't propose to say where it's from.

330
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,780
Some people suspect, as you suggest, that it could be ultra terrestrial.

331
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,900
It could be something inherently from our planet under the ocean that's been here for

332
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,140
a long, long time.

333
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:49,540
It's a way station that some A.I. established that just is a waypoint here and monitors

334
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,980
what's going on on this planet and stays under the ocean, comes out, looks around, reports

335
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:00,380
back and just has been doing that for thousands of years, but not aliens coming and going.

336
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,420
There's all manner of theories.

337
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,860
That's one of them.

338
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:11,100
But I would say that on the inside, the people that are really close to this in the Pentagon,

339
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,660
they face the dilemma we all face, which is what hypothesis can explain what we're seeing

340
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:23,740
that is prosaic, that doesn't involve either extraterrestrials or ultra terrestrials or

341
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,140
something like that.

342
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:31,820
It's very hard for us to believe that the Chinese or the Russians are that far ahead

343
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,700
of us in such basic technology, such fundamental technologies.

344
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,180
Perhaps it's true, and that's got its own set of problems, but either way, we need to

345
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,220
get to the bottom of it.

346
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,900
That's my position, at least.

347
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,940
Yeah, there's some of these things that it's not outside the realm of possibility that's

348
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:53,820
a drone, like the most recent video, the pyramid-shaped objects that are flying around.

349
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,820
You've seen that, right?

350
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,820
Absolutely, yeah.

351
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,260
What would you take on those things?

352
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,860
I want to see the rest of the data.

353
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,700
They've got radar data on that.

354
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,780
From the radar data, they should be able to gain some real insights as to where these

355
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,540
things are coming from and going to, trajectories, speeds, all that kind of thing.

356
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,620
That hasn't been released, right?

357
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,260
That has not been released.

358
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,780
They're still analyzing that.

359
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,620
I don't think that they will comment publicly on that, unfortunately, but they do have that

360
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,660
information and other information.

361
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,380
We should be able to gain some insights.

362
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,380
It's entirely possible that they are drones.

363
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,700
Tyler Rogeway is a brilliant analyst of aviation issues who works for the war zone.

364
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,740
He's written a very lengthy piece making that assertion.

365
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Could be right.

366
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,860
I'm a little skeptical, but we'll see.

367
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,100
That's why we need more data.

368
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
What do you say?

369
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:55,860
Well, the duration of flight was far longer than drones routinely can perform.

370
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,180
What was the duration?

371
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,180
Hours.

372
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:05,820
Typically, if it's an electric drone, it has a very short flight time.

373
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:11,900
These ships were 100 miles off the coast in conditions of low visibility.

374
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,060
Whoever was operating these things was traversing a long distance, probably.

375
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,580
There were only a few other ships in the area.

376
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,700
They know what those ships were and they deny that they were operating these craft.

377
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,180
They were in the air a long time.

378
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:32,360
They were very rigorous in the manner in which they operated as a unit.

379
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,500
They clearly intended to get our attention.

380
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,700
They were operating in a manner that suggests they were trying to provoke our air defense

381
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:46,840
systems, see how we would react, maybe see what frequencies we start communicating on,

382
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,620
what actions we take and so forth.

383
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:54,100
It's the kind of thing we sometimes do ourselves to the potential adversaries to help game

384
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,380
the situation out.

385
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,100
I have a completely open mind on it.

386
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:06,220
I just want to see the evidence, but there's some features of this that if they are drones,

387
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,380
they're probably more advanced than anything we have.

388
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,380
One of them was flashing.

389
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,620
Jamie, see if you can find that video.

390
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,380
Is that your breathing?

391
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,380
It is.

392
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,220
I was trying to figure out what that noise was.

393
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,540
See if you can find that video.

394
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,540
I've had my COVID test.

395
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,540
It's not that bad.

396
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,540
No, I don't think there's anything wrong with you.

397
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,100
I was just trying to figure out what that noise was.

398
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
The flashing light?

399
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Yes.

400
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
That one, okay.

401
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Have you seen ...

402
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:38,780
I've seen that, and it looks like it's flashing the way an airplane would at the same rate.

403
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,540
What's odd about that is you're in a restricted military airspace.

404
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,580
Commercial aircraft have transponders.

405
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,580
You would know if they were commercial aircraft.

406
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,740
They're looking at the radar picture, so they would know from that if it's a commercial

407
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,940
aircraft.

408
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:00,780
It's hard to understand if it was a commercial aircraft of some kind, or even a private plane,

409
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,380
why they wouldn't be able to identify it.

410
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
Yeah.

411
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,740
Well, the flashing ... You can see it here.

412
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,780
This is the leaked footage, courtesy of Jeremy Corbell.

413
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,260
You see it.

414
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:23,860
Now, either it's reflecting something that's flashing off the ship, or it's flashing.

415
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:31,460
The thing about these things is, yeah, it's extraordinary.

416
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,700
It's crazy looking.

417
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,020
It's weird to see these pyramids floating through the sky, but they're not moving like

418
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,020
the tic-tac.

419
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,900
It's not doing something that we can't do.

420
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,220
You see them move around.

421
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,180
It's really weird, but it's ...

422
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,980
It's not definitive evidence of anything at this point.

423
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,980
It's strange.

424
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,660
It's peculiar that it's happening around a warship, and that our guys don't know what

425
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,660
it is.

426
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:01,460
It looks like some of these things are entering and leaving the water, which is really peculiar.

427
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,420
It's an example of the kind of thing that we just haven't been looking at that's going

428
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,420
on.

429
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
We've been blowing off.

430
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,420
Right.

431
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,780
Now, we're finally getting some traction and getting the government to say, yeah, we probably

432
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,260
really ought to pay attention to this.

433
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:20,380
Do you think that there's more frequent sightings, or do you think they're being reported more

434
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,460
now?

435
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,780
There's certainly more reports coming in, civilian and military.

436
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:33,220
The technology that we have today is leaps and bounds over what we had even a few years

437
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,900
ago in terms of resolution, distance, range, all those kinds of things.

438
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,980
The latest generation of radars that are being deployed are a huge step forward from what

439
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,640
was in the fleet just a few years ago.

440
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,300
That is probably leading to some reporting that we didn't have before, things that were

441
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,420
out there, but the radar cross section was so low they weren't appearing on people's

442
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,420
scopes.

443
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:00,020
I think it's probably a mixture of things, but what is concerning in part is that some

444
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,000
of this activity is more in-your-face kind of stuff.

445
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,020
It's more like not elusive on the edge.

446
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,040
You see it and it flies away.

447
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,420
It's coming to a nuclear power station and buzzing around it and staying there.

448
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,140
It's coming around these warships and making a point of being seen.

449
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:25,780
It's coming to an Air Force base in Guam and doing the same thing.

450
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,820
That's new and that's a little concerning.

451
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,220
Haven't there been reports of them showing up around missiles and doing something with

452
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:40,460
the launch codes or stopping the power from working in these places or something along

453
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,460
those lines?

454
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,540
Some sort of manipulation of the power systems, almost to let you know.

455
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:53,460
This is one of the most provocative and fascinating and important stories in this whole area

456
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,300
of UFOs and national security.

457
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,620
We have retired Air Force officers who've testified to this and there are FOIA documents

458
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:06,140
that support these claims, but the Air Force has never been asked by Congress or anyone

459
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,580
to address this.

460
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,260
They've never acknowledged it.

461
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:14,540
There's an opportunity to do that now and I think it's long overdue.

462
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,300
This is stunning if it's true.

463
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,780
This is the backbone of our nuclear deterrent strategy.

464
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:28,340
It's really the crown jewels of our freedom and independence and ability to deter nuclear

465
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,300
powers like Russia and China.

466
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,020
This is kind of the ultimate insurance policy militarily that we have.

467
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:42,060
If someone can come in there and turn these things off, it's just shocking.

468
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,540
Absolutely shocking.

469
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:51,100
Because of the stigma, Congress has been unwilling even to ask the question, even in private,

470
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,660
even though this is very well documented.

471
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:59,380
These people have come out in their retired uniforms and things and with their documentation

472
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,420
showing where they were assigned.

473
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,860
In one of these cases out at Malmstrom Air Force Base, I believe it was, there's a good

474
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:12,260
book because the local sheriff was responding to so many calls from civilians in the area

475
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,420
to UFOs that were being seen and encountered.

476
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,900
He co-authored a book on what was happening.

477
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,660
So there's a lot of data about this, but yet there's no official confirmation that that

478
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,660
occurred.

479
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:29,780
Yeah, the sheer volume, I would like to know whether or not they are increasing in volume

480
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,580
or whether or not it is just an increase in our ability to detect them.

481
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,580
We don't really know, right?

482
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,860
Because it's been 2017, so it's not that long ago, four years when it really started being

483
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,220
something that people were willing to take seriously.

484
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,420
Because of the New York Times article and because there's just a few videos that are

485
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
pretty extraordinary.

486
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,020
The Go Fast video when you hear the pilots going, what the fuck?

487
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:58,340
And you're watching that thing buzz across the water with no heat signature.

488
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,500
In terms of reporting, there has definitely been an increase, a surge, the last 12 or

489
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,460
so months.

490
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:11,300
And you see this on the public side with organizations that track these things, the Mutual UFO Network

491
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
and so forth.

492
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,460
They've had a surge of maybe 20%.

493
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,380
Some people think, well, maybe it's COVID, more people are outside looking at the night

494
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,380
sky.

495
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,020
That could be some of it.

496
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,060
There are more reports that are coming with video and photographs these days.

497
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:32,380
If you look at these websites, New Fork and MUFON from say 10 years ago, not so many people

498
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,140
had cell phones in their pockets.

499
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,420
Routinely now, you'll see very strange photographs and videos.

500
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:43,740
Frequently, most of the time there's a prosaic explanation, but not always.

501
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,140
And so my sense is that there are probably a little bit of both going on.

502
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,620
More activity, some of it's a little bolder than we've seen in the past, but also better

503
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,820
instrumentation to record this.

504
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,760
Another thing that's happening, certainly on the government side, this is the big thing,

505
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,720
is that people are less afraid to report it.

506
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,640
So there was a lot of stuff going on.

507
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,520
We don't know how much because nobody was reporting it.

508
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:16,240
And I've been in meetings with people at the Pentagon with guys who were commander of an

509
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,400
AWACS aircraft, for example.

510
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,120
And they'd say, yeah, we saw some really weird stuff, but we weren't telling anybody about

511
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
it.

512
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
We tore up the files.

513
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Yeah.

514
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,720
Guys at the National Security Agency or other places who said, I kept a book of anomalies,

515
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
weird things.

516
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
And I didn't turn it over to my replacement.

517
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,800
I just tore it up.

518
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,360
So we have blinded ourselves.

519
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,760
We've done this to ourselves and we're playing catch up now.

520
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,180
Well, unfortunately, some people are full of shit and that muddies the water, right?

521
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,440
Some people do make things up.

522
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
Absolutely.

523
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Absolutely.

524
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
That didn't help for sure.

525
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
Yeah.

526
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
What do you think about mass sightings?

527
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,800
Like what was your take on, like, say the Phoenix Lights?

528
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,680
Yeah, that's fascinating.

529
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,440
There are a number of these mass sighting cases and not just in the U.S.

530
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,240
There was a soccer match in Italy reportedly with 10,000 fans at a stadium.

531
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,520
The game came to a screeching halt.

532
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,120
People watched this thing overhead.

533
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,880
There were some mass sightings in Brazil and other places.

534
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,440
The Phoenix case, what I find most intriguing about that, one of the things is that Fife

535
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,200
Symington, the governor of Arizona, who's a former Air Force officer, himself said after

536
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,360
the fact he saw this thing and it was not a plane, it was not flares, as some of the

537
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
Air Force contended.

538
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,440
And that was the triangle shaped object that was enormous.

539
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,880
He said it was at least a football field long, maybe several football fields.

540
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Correct.

541
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Huge.

542
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,200
And hundreds, if not thousands of people saw this.

543
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,920
They had very similar sightings, yeah.

544
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Yeah, very similar.

545
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,880
And it was coming down from, there was quite a path of sightings.

546
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
So before Phoenix.

547
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
Is there a video?

548
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

549
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,120
Is there a video of the triangle?

550
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
Not that I know of.

551
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
I've not seen it, if there is.

552
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,520
The videos are all just the lights that are in the sky, right?

553
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
Yeah.

554
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Yeah.

555
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,920
And they said that they were flares, but they're hovering.

556
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Right.

557
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Yeah.

558
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,320
Because it takes a long time for, I mean.

559
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,360
There were flares out that night.

560
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,360
And so that muddies the waters, right?

561
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,440
I think they determined there were actually some aircraft doing an exercise to drop some

562
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
flares.

563
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,800
This seems to be something apart from that, at least.

564
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,160
What Fife Simetan and many others reported, hard to reconcile with the flare exercise.

565
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,600
Well, the problem with the flare analogy is unless the flares are suspended with balloons,

566
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,600
where they were slowly lowering from the sky, it doesn't make any sense.

567
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Because they're hovering.

568
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Yeah.

569
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,480
Like, I mean, they might have been flares suspended by balloons and slowly making their

570
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
way down.

571
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,320
But see if you can find the Phoenix Lights video.

572
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
It's weird.

573
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,960
Because if they would just drop flares, they would drop.

574
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
They would drop.

575
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,760
The speed of gravity would be normal.

576
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,560
Well, in some cases, people also saw these lights moving in formation.

577
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,720
So as far as I know, flares don't do that.

578
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,040
I've seen flares and that's not what I observed.

579
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
And this was what?

580
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
The 90s?

581
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Was this the 90s?

582
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
This was late 80s, I believe.

583
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,280
Was it?

584
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,200
And drone technology back then was pretty unsophisticated, right?

585
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,040
That's correct.

586
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,000
The kind of drones we have now, so here it is, like, get the fuck out of here.

587
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's not flares.

588
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,840
Like, those things are not dropping.

589
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
They're just hovering there.

590
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Yeah.

591
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
It's very strange.

592
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,880
Yeah, flares, it doesn't look like a flare to me, also, the way flares illuminate.

593
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Right.

594
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
The way they radiate light.

595
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,360
It could be some different kind of flare.

596
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Possibly.

597
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:45,400
I mean, it could be instead of a flare, it could be some sort of massive LED light.

598
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,960
The sheer size, too, when you look at them hovering over the city, you have to take into

599
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,120
account that, if you look at that image right there, you have to take into account everything

600
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:00,160
you're looking down there is buildings and windows and streetlights and all that jazz.

601
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Those things have to be massive to make that much illumination while they're in the sky.

602
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,000
If you just had a flashlight and you were hanging a flashlight in the sky, like, what

603
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,960
is that, a thousand feet in the air or so?

604
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Who knows?

605
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Whatever it is.

606
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
Probably a thousand feet.

607
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Couple thousand feet.

608
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,600
If you had a couple thousand feet up in the air and you had a flashlight, you could barely

609
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
see that thing.

610
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Absolutely right.

611
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
No way.

612
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,200
You wouldn't see it like that.

613
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Whatever that is, hovering over that city, that's bizarre.

614
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,160
Whatever that is, it was seen by people hundreds of miles in both directions.

615
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:39,840
So it wasn't just Phoenix, it was reported in the sequencing, all fits.

616
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,920
There was something that appeared to be flying down from Nevada, entered northwestern Arizona

617
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,680
continued over Phoenix and then down south and people along that pathway were reporting

618
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,680
this hundreds of people.

619
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,800
Yeah, and this, we were watching the video, it just stays there.

620
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,280
Like, it's not dropping.

621
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,680
Yeah, this one's not moving, which is curious too.

622
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,040
Yeah, if it was going to drop, it would, I mean, if it was just dropped out of a plane

623
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,200
as a flare, I mean, for sure it would be way lower by now.

624
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,120
Like, those things are flying.

625
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,120
Whatever that is.

626
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
Look at her.

627
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,480
The flares I have seen in military exercises dropped at a pretty steady rate.

628
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,320
Yeah, it's pretty clear that's, you know, it looks like something dropping.

629
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,880
That's something hovering.

630
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,600
There was a few other ones that have taken place, the African school children.

631
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
The children.

632
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Ariel?

633
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,040
Yeah, that's a crazy one.

634
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,760
It is crazy and there are other cases like that.

635
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,560
There's a case very similar in Australia.

636
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,280
Supposedly thousands of people were witnesses to that event.

637
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:49,560
And there were dozens, at least 50 school children who saw this thing and teachers.

638
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,800
But yeah, that's really bizarre and that's part of the challenge with this phenomenon

639
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:03,920
is you get into these areas very quickly and it makes it even harder to have the discussion.

640
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,960
It makes it harder for government people, politicians and others to engage.

641
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,200
It reminds me a little bit of Galileo when he was before the Inquisition for claiming

642
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,960
that it's a heliocentric solar system, we're going around the sun, and he said, just look

643
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,840
through the telescope, guys, come on, look through the telescope.

644
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,440
They wouldn't look through the telescope.

645
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,840
When you bring this issue up, a lot of people just stop right there.

646
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,080
They don't want to hear anything else, they don't want to talk anymore about it, they're

647
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,320
So it's a challenge.

648
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,640
I do think there has been a shift.

649
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,040
And I think, I agree with you that the big one was the New York Times, but I also think

650
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,520
the Bob Lazar documentary was a big one too, because when you listen to Bob talk over long

651
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,240
periods of time and you hear him describe what it is that he saw, what he supposedly

652
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,360
worked on in the late 80s, and the way he described the propulsion system, which is

653
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,360
exactly the same way that tic tac thing moves.

654
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,760
That's what's bizarre.

655
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,040
It's like in the other one, was it the FLIR video, which video where it turns sideways

656
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,160
before it takes off?

657
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
That's Gimbal.

658
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,200
Gimbal, I'm sorry.

659
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,120
When you watch that video, you're like, that's Gimbal, yeah.

660
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:23,040
What's really also interesting about Gimbal is that off the screen, there's a formation

661
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,300
of UFOs flying towards the Gimbal and the Navy aircraft that are there.

662
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,260
And when you hear the one guy remark, one of the pilots, he says, look, dude, there's

663
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,140
a whole fleet of them out there.

664
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,140
That's what he's referring to.

665
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:40,100
There was a V-shaped formation of these objects approaching the Gimbal, which then veered

666
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,460
away and flew off.

667
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,220
And they don't have any idea what those were.

668
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,620
Yeah, the Gimbal one is weird.

669
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,420
And I've seen people try to debunk it too.

670
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,820
It's so strange when people try to debunk things that you really can't explain.

671
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:58,360
So here you see this thing move, it's moving, and then at one point it turns sideways.

672
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,960
So they're switching between different ways of viewing it, and they're trying to figure

673
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,880
out what it is.

674
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,440
This is just, what is this, infrared?

675
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,440
Is that what this is?

676
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Correct.

677
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,880
Forward-looking infrared radar.

678
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,480
And so they're tracking it, trying to figure out what it does, and then you see it rotate.

679
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
And that's bizarre.

680
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Yeah, and there's a strong headwind, so it can't be a balloon.

681
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,080
The headwind's like 120 knots or something.

682
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
It's just so...

683
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,920
And off-camera, as I said, you've got this formation approaching, this V-shaped formation

684
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,420
of craft, and they don't have transponders either.

685
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,040
What the hell are they doing in there?

686
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,640
And did they get footage of the formation?

687
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,880
I don't believe so.

688
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,440
Now how does this footage get out?

689
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,360
Did somebody leak it?

690
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
Yeah.

691
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,040
But leak sounds pejorative.

692
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,800
Let me try to put a positive spin on this.

693
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
Somebody released it.

694
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:55,400
Yeah, they went through a proper process, and it came with documentation that said approve

695
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
for public release.

696
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,420
It wasn't like it just went out the back door.

697
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,200
The rub in part is that public affairs didn't know about it, so they got their nose out

698
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,680
of joint.

699
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,220
But it actually had gone through an official review and had documentation saying approve

700
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,880
for public release.

701
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,320
Wow.

702
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
That's interesting.

703
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,800
I wonder why they've decided to approve that for public release.

704
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,680
Well, there were some people on the inside who were worried that this issue was not getting

705
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,880
any attention and were very concerned about what was happening, very concerned about the

706
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,840
national security situation.

707
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:37,820
I had actually introduced Lou Elizondo, who was leading a small effort in the Pentagon

708
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:45,080
to try to track this activity, to two people who were direct reports to General Mattis.

709
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,360
So when I first found out this was going on and it was falling through the cracks,

710
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,600
I thought, well, maybe we can get this up to the front office and at least make them

711
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,240
aware.

712
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,880
And unfortunately, after several meetings and bringing pilots in, these individuals

713
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,340
became aware that, yes, indeed, something is happening, but they were concerned that

714
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:13,560
General Mattis might be contaminated politically from even taking a briefing.

715
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:19,240
They were very protective of his reputation and his stature, which is understandable.

716
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
You mean contaminated if he took a briefing?

717
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,560
If he took a briefing, just from hearing the briefing.

718
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Okay.

719
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
So just-

720
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
That people would question his sanity or something.

721
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,560
Right.

722
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,560
What is it, crazy?

723
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Yeah.

724
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
Yeah.

725
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,560
Got it.

726
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,560
So they didn't want that to happen, and this was kind of happening out of normal channels

727
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,560
which are suffocating in the Defense Department.

728
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,960
Normally, any memo to go to the SecDef has to get routed through like 14 or 17 different

729
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,560
offices all have to approve, and if they have a question, it stops the process and they

730
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,920
have to be briefed and convinced to sign on, and then it goes into a line with thousands

731
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,840
of other packages.

732
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,160
So this was an attempt to sort of expedite this and get it to a senior level.

733
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,000
Is that one of the more extraordinary things about the fact this stuff is being released,

734
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,200
the fact that everything generally does have to go through so many levels that they are

735
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,840
kind of throwing their hands up in the air and going, look, we have to do something or

736
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
say something?

737
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:16,100
Well there were a few, I won't call them whistleblowers, but there were a few people who were very

738
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:22,600
concerned and willing to take this out of normal channels because it wasn't even that

739
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,040
people were having trouble moving along.

740
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,280
It wasn't going anywhere.

741
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,560
Norad didn't even know.

742
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,200
The North American Aerospace Defense Command was not even being notified that this was

743
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,240
happening right off the coast.

744
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,160
Now when you look at the gimbal video, did they have some sort of a radar on this before

745
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,560
they went and tried to meet up with it?

746
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,240
How did they find out where this thing was?

747
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,600
I don't know in that case.

748
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:55,640
I know for certain in the case of the Tic Tac in 2004 with Commander Fravor that the

749
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,420
Princeton was guiding them with its Aegis radar to the intercept point and tracking

750
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,180
it afterward when it went to the cap point.

751
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:10,300
In this case, I suspect it was a ship guiding them, but it may have been their onboard radars

752
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,460
because they have very sophisticated radars.

753
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,020
The pilots that I've spoken with out there said we would see these things all the time.

754
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,120
We'd see them throwing up on radar all the time.

755
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,700
A couple times guys just went to investigate for themselves.

756
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,580
They had enough fuel or coming back from an exercise and said, I'm going to go check that

757
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,460
thing out.

758
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:35,460
I'm not sure in this particular case which it was, but it could have been either.

759
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,140
I think something to take into consideration is the vast spans of the ocean too.

760
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,540
If you were going to try to hide something as it were in plain sight, there's no better

761
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,100
place to do it than the ocean.

762
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,860
There's nothing out there.

763
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,180
It's mostly a desert, a giant wet desert.

764
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:57,160
It's vast and largely unexplored and unknown and inaccessible.

765
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:04,360
We do have the ability to, if we become interested in a particular area, to really do some serious

766
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,820
reconnaissance underwater.

767
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,120
We have resources, but again, somebody has to make a decision.

768
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,200
How specific do we have to be in terms of ... It's not like they can look at the entire

769
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,640
Pacific Ocean, right?

770
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,040
Certainly not, but with bottom scanning, sonars and things like that, they can cover pretty

771
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,040
large areas.

772
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,000
In the case of the Nimitz ...

773
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,680
Do they do this from a ship?

774
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,940
They can do it from ships, they can do it from submarines, they can do it from various

775
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,080
kinds of platforms.

776
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:40,520
Would it be like being in California on a plane trying to look at the entire country?

777
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,520
No.

778
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,560
In the case of the Nimitz, for example, they had a lat long where they had the intercept.

779
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,320
They had a very precise location.

780
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,520
Looking under the ocean ... Lat long being latitude and longitude.

781
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,320
Latitude and longitude where that incident occurred, where they vectored the jets too.

782
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,920
Taking a few square miles around that area would have been very feasible.

783
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,920
That would have been feasible.

784
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,920
A few square miles.

785
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Yeah.

786
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,240
It depends on how much resolution you want.

787
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,040
If you want really precise resolution, there's always a trade-off then in the time it takes

788
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,520
to cover an area.

789
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:19,000
They could do a larger area more quickly at a lower resolution, but to really look closely

790
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,400
and carefully ... The sonar to water sonar is like a radar, kind of, but when it's focused,

791
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,280
it can give you a very strong picture of what you're looking at.

792
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,320
It can also detect metal, it'll bounce off more strongly, you get a stronger signal and

793
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
things.

794
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,960
They can do a pretty efficient search if they want to.

795
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,600
That's assuming that this thing is still going to be there, and also assuming-

796
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,600
Right.

797
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,080
If it were, or if there was still something down there.

798
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,320
That it doesn't recognize that they're there, like the Tic Tac did, and block their tracking,

799
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,800
which it did, right?

800
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,800
Correct.

801
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,800
Yeah.

802
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,800
There was interference.

803
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:03,240
Not with Dave, I think, but at the cap point where yet another F-18, the same day, went

804
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,800
out, Chad Underwood.

805
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,800
That's when they got video of it, right?

806
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,280
That's when they got the FLIR video, and he could not get a lock on, and as I recall,

807
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,000
he felt his system was being interfered with.

808
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yeah.

809
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,760
So, what I was getting at, though, is it's not like we can drop something in the Pacific

810
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,320
Ocean and get a detailed map of the entire ocean.

811
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,320
Hell no.

812
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,320
No.

813
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,320
Yeah.

814
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,320
Impossible.

815
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,600
It kind of would be like looking at the entire country from California in a plane.

816
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,880
You're going to miss a lot.

817
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,400
There's no way you're going to see the whole thing.

818
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,240
What's interesting, I mean, from overhead imagery now, even commercial imagery, with

819
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:46,360
artificial intelligence, we're able to pretty much map the world every day, and if you have

820
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,520
a particular profile you're looking for with these computer algorithms, you could search

821
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,320
all that imagery fairly quickly.

822
00:48:53,320 --> 00:49:01,520
So the reconnaissance capabilities are extensive, and you can cover large areas, particularly

823
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,560
if you're looking for a particular thing and you can describe it well so that if it sees

824
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,640
a match, if the computer sees a match, it identifies it.

825
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,000
There is a lot, there's just mountains of data coming into this panoply of sensors that

826
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,960
we have from thousands of miles out in space to closer in space to the air, ground, sea,

827
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,000
undersea.

828
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,800
There's a layer, a mesh network around the entire planet, essentially.

829
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
Except in the ocean.

830
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,880
Well, in the ocean we have sensors, but it's not the same kind of coverage.

831
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,600
We kind of have to get lucky.

832
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,080
Yeah, I mean, certain areas are very closely monitored.

833
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,080
Choke points, for example, are going to be natural places.

834
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,560
You're going to want to look carefully.

835
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,600
And certain kinds of things are going to give a pretty strong signature.

836
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:57,280
But that gets off pretty quickly into the area that is confidential, the government

837
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,280
keeps confidential.

838
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,280
I bet they do.

839
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,040
But I would imagine, though, that if I was an alien, I would definitely hide in the ocean.

840
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,720
I would say that's the move.

841
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,700
Just be a great place to do it and fly around in there.

842
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:13,780
There was a sub accompanying the Nimitz carrier battle group, and it didn't detect anything

843
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,780
in the water.

844
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:21,260
So there may be an ability to move underwater and remain undetected, much as there's an

845
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:26,940
ability in the air to go at supersonic speeds without creating a shockwave.

846
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,780
Whatever this technology is, it has some very unusual properties.

847
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,460
Yeah, that's the bizarre thing, right?

848
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,180
The supersonic speeds.

849
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:41,020
And then that brings us to Lazar's depiction of how these things worked.

850
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:45,580
That they somehow another bend gravity, these things that he worked on, which is the model

851
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,260
that's on the desk there.

852
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:51,780
That's supposedly a detailed model of what that thing looked like that he worked on,

853
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,500
the sport model, I think they called it.

854
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,500
That's what he called it, yeah.

855
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,500
Yeah.

856
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,940
When you watch him talk and you hear him give his description of his time working there

857
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:06,580
and what he saw and what he thinks those things are, what was your take on that?

858
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,460
I thought it was curious and interesting.

859
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,420
I've been to Area 51.

860
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,860
I didn't see any flying saucers or anything like that.

861
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,420
What did you see?

862
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:24,220
I saw Defense Department experiments being performed and training activities and that

863
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,220
sort of thing.

864
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,100
Nothing that the taxpayer would object to.

865
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,100
Of course not.

866
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,100
But it's a big range.

867
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,740
There's a lot of stuff going on out there and there's a lot of adjacent ranges, if you

868
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,740
look at the maps, actually.

869
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,020
Area S4, where he was.

870
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,020
That's what he said.

871
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,020
Yeah.

872
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,020
That's what he said.

873
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,020
What's your take on him?

874
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,020
I found his explanation's curious.

875
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,020
Yeah?

876
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,020
How so?

877
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:50,580
The complexity of it and the fact that he talked about Laurentium, for example, and

878
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:57,380
then decades later it turns out that apparently there is a more stable form of that than-

879
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,780
That's element 115?

880
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,780
Sounds right.

881
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,780
I couldn't tell you for sure.

882
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,780
But it's called Laurentium?

883
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,780
Laurentium.

884
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,940
That sounds like something from Battlestar Galactica.

885
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:11,580
There's all this stuff that takes you into that.

886
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,860
I'm a little skeptical about his claims, I have to say.

887
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:23,620
A friend of mine claims to know the gal who was his supervisor when he worked out there

888
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:30,900
and knows what he was actually doing and where he was located and claims that he was the

889
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,780
guy who checked radiation on badges.

890
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,780
That's it.

891
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,780
Yeah.

892
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,380
All the rest is fiction.

893
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,140
According to that story.

894
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,540
And this is a person that you know?

895
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,540
Yeah.

896
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,540
Maybe that person's full of shit.

897
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,540
Maybe.

898
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:51,180
I don't have the ground truth on this, but he did falsify his educational records and

899
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,620
he's been involved in some other things and it just doesn't track-

900
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,540
Are you talking about the MIT records?

901
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,540
Yeah.

902
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,540
Yeah.

903
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,540
He explained that to me.

904
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:09,820
He was working on something for the government and they sent him to MIT to learn something.

905
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:14,300
I can't say too much, I'll tell you off air, because he told me not to talk about it, but

906
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,460
it makes more sense when you hear his description of it that essentially it wasn't documented

907
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:27,100
that he was studying there because what he was doing was really a terrible thing, a terrible

908
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,940
experiment they were working on.

909
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:33,460
When I explain it to you, maybe it'll make more sense.

910
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,900
Maybe not though.

911
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,100
Maybe he's full of shit.

912
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,100
Maybe he lied about that.

913
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:43,100
What's interesting though is he's told the same exact story since the late 80s.

914
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,020
And he doesn't seem full of shit.

915
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:49,900
Now some people are really good at lying and I've been tricked before and I'm sure you

916
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,900
have too.

917
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,100
There's some people that are just sociopaths, they're really good at-

918
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,500
Yeah, they don't even know they're lying, they're convinced in their own head why they're

919
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,500
spinning it.

920
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:03,140
He's obviously though, he's obviously very intelligent and he obviously knows a lot about

921
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,140
science.

922
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:09,540
He knows a lot about propulsion systems and he really did work at Los Alamos, which is

923
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:15,180
interesting because he's actually on the employee roster and they tried to say that he didn't.

924
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,100
He knew people that were there, he knew the layout of the building.

925
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,020
When he went there with George Knapp, they went through the building, he knew exactly

926
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,180
where everything was and he knew the people that worked there.

927
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:28,180
So he really did work there, apparently, allegedly.

928
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:33,420
His story, what's interesting to me is that, again, it's the same story over and over and

929
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,500
over again.

930
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:40,740
And then what's also interesting to me is that he knew and took friends to a place where

931
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,140
they were testing these things out.

932
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:48,180
And he knew where it was and he knew when they were doing it and he brought his friends

933
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,900
out there and that's when they got arrested.

934
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,800
It's a very, I think there's some consistency there.

935
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,800
That is hard to explain.

936
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,400
How would he know where to go and what was going on?

937
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,880
There are some possible answers to that.

938
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,160
I've poked into this a bit.

939
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:09,280
Supposedly there was a bar off base where the scientists and a lot of the aviators and

940
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,480
people would go and hang out.

941
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,800
He frequented that place and picked up information.

942
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:19,200
So I hear stories on both sides of this.

943
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:25,880
I don't know what the ground truth is and I remain skeptical.

944
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,560
Hey, there's a lot of crazy stuff going on.

945
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,840
I enjoyed his company.

946
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:36,960
I went to dinner with him and Jeremy and I talked to him for several hours on the podcast

947
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,680
and off the podcast.

948
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,320
I don't know.

949
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,160
But it's a weird one because he never made any money doing that.

950
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,320
He never made any money telling that story.

951
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,760
I'll tell you another story offline.

952
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,320
We can exchange stories offline.

953
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,320
I'm excited.

954
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,480
I can't wait for this to be over now.

955
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,760
What other stories are compelling?

956
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,000
We talked about Travis Walton who is, I got a Travis Walton bobblehead ladies and gentlemen

957
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:06,840
from Travis himself and Travis is the man whom the movie Fire in the Sky was created

958
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:11,000
about his event that happened in Arizona, correct?

959
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Correct.

960
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,480
When he was working for a logging company and encountered an object and went missing

961
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:22,600
for several days and came back with this fantastic story of being abducted by aliens.

962
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:30,200
Yeah, I had the pleasure of meeting him once with my two of my boys and listened to his

963
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,040
story and read the book and so forth.

964
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:39,000
It seems credible, as incredible as it is.

965
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,880
He was missing for those five days.

966
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,560
No one's ever found any explanation of where he was.

967
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,760
There was a full manhunt going on.

968
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:52,560
There were like six or seven other guys who saw the UFOs, saw this beam strike him.

969
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,960
He's told the same story for years.

970
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,680
I asked him a couple of questions and he gave quick, rapid answers.

971
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,240
Of course, he's been telling this story for a long time, but he didn't sound like someone

972
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:09,200
who had to pause and try to have, what am I going to say with this?

973
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,200
It seemed very natural talking about it.

974
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,600
According to that story, as you know, he woke up on an examination table, lashed out.

975
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,080
These beings were examining him.

976
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:28,720
He runs into the hallway, runs into another room, and these very Nordic-looking individuals

977
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,000
come in and settle him down and escort him out and so forth.

978
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Days later, he wakes up next to a road hundreds of miles from where he was last seen.

979
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,280
What do you do with a story like that?

980
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,040
It's just so hard to independently confirm anything.

981
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:53,480
There's nothing that contradicts his story that we have, but it's not possible to confirm

982
00:57:53,480 --> 00:58:00,880
it, so it goes into a category of which there are a great many wild, incredible stories

983
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,720
like that that really make you scratch your head.

984
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,800
There are some where there's a little more evidence.

985
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:15,640
There's the Cash-Lundrum case here in Texas, for example, where a family was severely irradiated.

986
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,640
They saw a UFO blocking the road, stopped, got out of the car.

987
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,640
It fried some of the paint.

988
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:27,160
They ended up in the hospital, serious radiation poisoning, sued the Defense Department thinking

989
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,600
it must be some DOD project.

990
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:35,320
DOD swarping down it wasn't theirs, and they lost the case.

991
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,320
What year was this?

992
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,040
70s or 80s.

993
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,040
I'm not sure.

994
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,040
Cash-Lundrum.

995
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,000
You can find it on Wiki.

996
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It's public knowledge.

997
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,880
Is there any images of their car?

998
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,080
Was there images of their car where the paint got fried?

999
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,080
I believe so.

1000
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,240
I don't want to look at that.

1001
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,240
I'm not aware of that one.

1002
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,240
I hadn't heard that one before.

1003
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,240
Yeah.

1004
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:04,040
There are a number of cases actually like that where people are visibly affected and

1005
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:13,960
physically ill and have red marks on their skin and very ill.

1006
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,440
They're not well known in those cases.

1007
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,440
I see this.

1008
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,440
Not a car.

1009
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,440
This is the burn on their hands?

1010
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,440
Yeah.

1011
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,440
Hmm.

1012
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,440
Yeah.

1013
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:27,320
When I say fried, I mean, I heard the paint was damaged.

1014
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,120
I don't know if there's ...

1015
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,040
And this was where in Texas?

1016
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:40,680
This was Dayton, Texas, near Dayton, Texas, which is a couple or three hours west of here.

1017
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,880
Three live in pain and tear after attack by blazing UFO.

1018
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,920
Is that from the Inquirer?

1019
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,200
Oh, they lost their hair.

1020
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,200
Damn.

1021
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,200
Yeah.

1022
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,200
Typical radiation effect.

1023
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,200
Yeah.

1024
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,200
Very strange.

1025
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,520
Very strange and very well documented.

1026
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,360
The doctors, the medical reports are all there.

1027
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,720
Nobody has a good explanation for it.

1028
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,720
There are other cases like that.

1029
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,720
There are actually quite a few.

1030
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,720
Strange stuff.

1031
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,440
A lot of them are when people are driving, right?

1032
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,240
There are many cases of driving and often the car is cut out, engine stops.

1033
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,240
Yeah.

1034
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,680
One of my favorite ones is Betty and Barney Hill.

1035
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:25,000
There's a woman named Angela Hill who's a top UFC fighter and her grandfather is Barney

1036
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Hill.

1037
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Whoa.

1038
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,560
I didn't even know until after I was done talking to her.

1039
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,560
Then she explained it to me.

1040
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,560
Huh.

1041
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,560
I was like, what?

1042
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,920
I'm like, all right, next time we do a podcast, you got to tell me about your grandpa.

1043
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:43,920
I saw Mrs. Hill one time on an old TV show called Truth or Lies or something like that

1044
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,400
and they would put people on a polygraph test on the show.

1045
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,920
They'd bring them out, interview them, tell your story.

1046
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,840
Then they did a polygraph right there and gave the result to the audience.

1047
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,160
Mrs. Hill came out and passed it with flying colors.

1048
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:02,400
She stuck to her story about the whole induction, passed the lie detector test and I think she'd

1049
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,400
taken them before.

1050
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,160
The other problem I have with that is hypnotic regression.

1051
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:15,200
Hypnotic regression is very odd because you can sort of suggest memories to people.

1052
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:20,880
I don't know what the hypnotic regression was like.

1053
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,640
There's a problem with suggesting things to people in various states of vulnerability

1054
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,920
that those things become false memories.

1055
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,540
It's really common.

1056
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:36,140
You know as well as I do, the human memory is this incredibly flawed thing.

1057
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:41,500
If you're in a state like hypnosis and someone starts suggesting to you that perhaps you

1058
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:47,500
were involved in some incredible experience and so was your husband and this is what he

1059
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,340
saw and did you see something similar?

1060
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,340
I don't know.

1061
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,340
I'm just guessing.

1062
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,140
I just have a problem with hypnotic regression.

1063
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,700
You're right to have those concerns.

1064
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:03,860
I think most cases of alleged abductions that rely on that, you can't really assign any

1065
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,860
credibility to it.

1066
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:05,860
Right.

1067
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:10,260
What was interesting about the Hill case was that they had an individual who was trained

1068
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:17,340
and did not believe in this phenomenon, was not trying to lead them to that outcome.

1069
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:21,860
He was a military guy and it was before this was a thing.

1070
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:22,860
Yes.

1071
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:23,860
That's what's interesting about it.

1072
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:24,860
It's the first one of those.

1073
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,900
Yes.

1074
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:26,900
That had more credibility.

1075
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:32,580
Since that time, I think there have been real problems, serious problems with a lot of the

1076
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,260
hypnotic regression cases.

1077
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,060
What's your take on John Mack?

1078
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,220
Well, that is a case in point.

1079
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:43,580
I've heard questions about that.

1080
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:44,580
Interestingly-

1081
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,580
Can you explain who John Mack was?

1082
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,580
Sure.

1083
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:53,620
Dr. Mack was a Harvard psychiatrist and faculty member and he began studying people who thought

1084
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:57,500
they had been abducted and became persuaded eventually that this was really happening

1085
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:01,980
to them in some cases, not all cases, but in some cases he believed they really were

1086
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,180
having these experiences or at least they sincerely thought they were.

1087
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:10,340
I'm not sure he necessarily went to the point publicly of saying, yeah, I think aliens are

1088
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:13,860
coming down and scarfing them up, but I think these people are telling the truth as they

1089
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:17,140
understand it.

1090
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:22,720
You mentioned the case, the Ariel case in the former Rhodesian Zimbabwe.

1091
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,920
He traveled there, interviewed the kids.

1092
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,360
You can see this in the documentary, The Phenomenon.

1093
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,400
There's good coverage of that.

1094
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,160
You can see Dr. Mack in the movie and get a sense of him as a person.

1095
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:41,680
He seems gentle and kind and thoughtful, but I have heard a lot of questions have been

1096
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:47,200
raised about his hypnotic regression technique, which is what he mostly relied on.

1097
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,200
Yeah.

1098
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,200
Yeah.

1099
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,600
I've heard the same.

1100
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,060
The problem is when someone becomes a believer and then confirmation bias, they're looking

1101
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,060
for something.

1102
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,060
So easy to do.

1103
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,060
Yeah.

1104
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,060
So easy to do.

1105
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:02,640
It's one of those subjects, for whatever reason, it just hits that part of the brain that wants

1106
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,640
to believe.

1107
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,760
I don't think there's another subject on earth other than maybe possibly religion that hits

1108
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:13,320
that part of the brain like the alien abduction or UFO phenomenon does.

1109
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,280
I think it is like religion.

1110
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:23,240
I think it is a desire to connect to something greater, bigger, to the beyond, infinitude,

1111
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,240
immortality.

1112
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,840
I think it relates to all those things.

1113
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:33,320
There's an innate desire people have, and that is going to influence a lot of the reporting.

1114
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,640
Yeah, I think you're 100% right.

1115
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:44,120
It's unfortunate that we don't have a lock-down, rock-solid lie detector test, where you could

1116
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:48,160
give it to someone and go, how much do you really remember?

1117
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,300
Tell me what you remember.

1118
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,520
Let me see inside your brain.

1119
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,680
Yeah, I think we're pretty close to that, actually.

1120
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,680
Do you?

1121
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,680
Yeah.

1122
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,560
I think there are some tests now that they're not being used for that purpose, but the government's

1123
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,680
done a lot of research, and I think there are things right now where they can see, kind

1124
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:07,440
of understand what you're thinking as you're thinking it, and observe how the brain acts

1125
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,280
when people are lying versus when they're not lying, but I've seen some write-ups on

1126
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,280
some of this.

1127
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,280
Write-ups.

1128
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,280
You're hiding stuff, bro.

1129
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,440
You know things.

1130
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,440
Can you tell, Jamie?

1131
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,440
There's some pretty sophisticated stuff out there.

1132
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,440
I can tell.

1133
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,440
You started laughing, too.

1134
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,440
Come on.

1135
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,440
You're deep in the government.

1136
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,440
You know.

1137
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,440
I hope so.

1138
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:27,680
I hope they do have something like that, but how would that do with false memories, though?

1139
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,840
They can plant memories into people's heads.

1140
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,840
That's right.

1141
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:36,400
They might see the brain reacting as though it were either lying or telling the truth,

1142
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,880
but you'd have to probably be further down the path than we are today to know whether

1143
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,880
that could be a recalled memory.

1144
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,480
Right.

1145
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,480
You know, whether that's all you're observing, maybe an implanted memory.

1146
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,480
Yeah.

1147
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,840
Memory is just so shaky.

1148
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:57,360
And when it comes to something that's so extraordinary, like seeing a UFO, I mean, I've never seen

1149
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:03,280
a flying saucer or an alien, but I could imagine if I did, I would probably be so overcome

1150
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,520
with fear and excitement and emotions and all.

1151
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,960
Your brain is short-circuited.

1152
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,560
I could only imagine trying to decipher that, and then if I had to sit here and explain

1153
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:21,640
it to you and be completely honest about my experience, boy, I don't know if I could.

1154
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,440
You know, I don't know what I would get out of that, how much juice I would squeeze out

1155
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,440
of that.

1156
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,920
I've never seen a UFO myself.

1157
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:36,400
The closest thing I've had to something that might be that shocking and terrifying was

1158
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,960
being charged by a grizzly bear.

1159
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,960
Oh, shit.

1160
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,520
I went into sort of a dissociated state, I think.

1161
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,160
Everything kind of slows down, and you're sort of thinking in the back, is this really

1162
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,960
happening or am I in a dream?

1163
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,800
Your mind goes to a different place when that happens, right?

1164
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:00,000
All the adrenaline turns on, and your body automatically does a whole bunch of things

1165
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,680
to protect you.

1166
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,760
I would imagine that happens to these people when they see something close up.

1167
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,360
What happened to you?

1168
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:13,160
We were hiking in Wyoming, my wife and I, and she was ahead of me on the trail.

1169
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,240
And all of a sudden, and I was trying to make noise once in a while, and I was hiking with

1170
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,840
the bear spray in my hand because I was taking that threat very seriously.

1171
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,040
And all of a sudden, there was just spine-teeling roar.

1172
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,000
I mean, I'm coming to kill you right now.

1173
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,640
You are so fucking dead.

1174
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh, no.

1175
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,080
I've never heard anything like it.

1176
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:38,240
I wish we had it on a recording somewhere because it's not like what I've ever seen

1177
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,080
in a video or heard anywhere else.

1178
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,400
It was the epitome of ferocity, you know?

1179
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,480
And so this thing starts charging up at us.

1180
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:53,320
We're up on a trail, on a hiking trail, and I just slip off the safety and start getting

1181
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,000
as much spray out there as I can.

1182
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,400
And it comes up on the trail and stops and looks at us, and he puts his head down, and

1183
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,720
he's gauging us.

1184
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,160
And I'm just standing there, putting the spray out with the sensitivity they have.

1185
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:12,480
I'm sure he was getting that, although he was about 30 feet away, kind of at that point,

1186
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,480
about the limit.

1187
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,480
30 feet away.

1188
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,480
Yeah.

1189
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,480
He was right there.

1190
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,480
Oh, my God.

1191
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,040
I think if it had been a female bear with cubs, I'm not sure that would have worked.

1192
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:25,400
But in this case, after seeing that we weren't attacking him, I guess, when you surprise

1193
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,480
a grizzly, they have this adrenaline gate that opens, and they're full on.

1194
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:33,640
They just go nuclear immediately, not like a black bear.

1195
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,880
And that's what happened here.

1196
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:41,920
But there was enough time lapse, I think, between the startle and when he got up on

1197
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,680
the trail and was getting the pepper spray and saw us, that he then walked, turned around

1198
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,080
and went up the trail the other way.

1199
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:55,480
But yeah, your mind does unusual things when you get in circumstances like that.

1200
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,480
What did your mind do?

1201
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,880
Well, like I said, it was kind of a dissociated state, I think.

1202
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,360
I felt almost like I was in a dream state.

1203
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,920
And part of me was questioning, is this a dream?

1204
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,040
Because this is kind of a nightmare situation.

1205
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,480
It's like the ultimate worst thing I never want to have happen.

1206
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,760
My wife and I get chewed up by a grizzly bear.

1207
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:23,560
And so I was thinking, you know, is this like almost pinching myself literally, you know?

1208
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,520
Because I was questioning, could this really be happening?

1209
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,560
And yet you're on autopilot and you're just kind of doing what you need to do.

1210
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,560
So in this case, it was getting the pepper spray up, taking the safety off and just putting

1211
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:41,520
as much of that between us and the bear as I could and not running.

1212
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:48,200
I think years later, I was talking to a game guy in Africa and he said, I told him my story.

1213
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,760
He had a lot of better stories than mine.

1214
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,000
But he said, well, you know, mate, why you lived?

1215
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And I said, no, why?

1216
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,600
And he said, because you didn't run.

1217
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,560
And for whatever reason, we followed the training and just held our ground.

1218
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,200
Woo, calm under pressure, sir.

1219
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,200
Good job.

1220
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,200
Like I said, it was dissociated state.

1221
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:11,600
I don't know if it was so much calmed as scared into, you know, doing the right thing.

1222
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,640
Well, the fact that you were able to get the safety off and then pump the spray out there,

1223
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,640
that's calm.

1224
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,080
A lot of people just freeze up in those encounters, don't they?

1225
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,080
Probably I don't know that much about it.

1226
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,840
I think the mistake some people make is they have it in their backpack.

1227
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,840
It was like, well, all their gear.

1228
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,440
Oh, where did I put that thing?

1229
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,880
It's a little bit too late to be rummaging around through your backpack at that point.

1230
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,280
I have some friends that were in Alaska and they got charged by a bear.

1231
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:42,360
They had killed an elk and they were packing the elk out and they went back to get it the

1232
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,680
rest of it in the morning because it's a long hike to their camp.

1233
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,200
And a bear had claimed it and they didn't realize that the bear had claimed it until

1234
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,200
it was too late.

1235
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,140
And then it came charging out an enormous black bear.

1236
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:58,000
You know, the black bears in Alaska or excuse me, not brown bear, brown bear in Alaska.

1237
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:04,120
They're so big because they get so much protein, they get so much fish and so it's an 11 foot

1238
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,640
bear just charging them and knocked them over.

1239
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:13,600
One of the guys, one of their friends actually wound up on top of the bear's back as it was

1240
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,960
running down the hill for a brief amount of time.

1241
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,680
So for a second or so, it was actually literally riding this bear's back.

1242
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,920
And these guys all got out of it, okay?

1243
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,120
They all got out of it alive.

1244
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,880
The thing ran off and it huffed.

1245
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,800
I don't think it understood how many people were there.

1246
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,040
It was a large crew filming a television show.

1247
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:34,280
And so as it ran off, it went into the woods for a second and then it was barking at them

1248
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,280
from the woods.

1249
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,640
They all had guns, but they didn't have the guns ready.

1250
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,160
They were eating lunch at the time.

1251
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:44,820
I'm surprised they didn't have their guns ready because I've been hunting up there for

1252
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,600
caribou and mountain goat and other things.

1253
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,460
And when you do have one of those kills, when you go back to it, everybody knows that bears

1254
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:55,340
like to move in on those and they'll just sleep next to it, just wake up, roll over

1255
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,520
and start munching again.

1256
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,880
They even found bear shit as they were walking back.

1257
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,480
They found a pile of bear shit near the carcass.

1258
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,280
Some people hunt bears by doing that.

1259
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,840
They'll go to a carcass or shoot something, leave it out there and they just keep visiting

1260
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,320
the carcass.

1261
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,680
So I'm surprised they were caught off guard that way, but thank goodness everybody came

1262
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:15,680
out.

1263
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:20,000
A famous wildlife photographer was actually killed very recently in Montana.

1264
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,840
See if you can find this, Jamie, because this guy has an amazing Instagram page on his

1265
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:29,300
last post, which was just a few days before he was killed.

1266
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:35,680
He had a really cool photo of a grizzly bear and he said he managed to get, because he

1267
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:43,100
had apparently been fly fishing, and he managed to get that close to the bear because he had

1268
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,960
smelled like he'd been catching trout all day.

1269
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,120
So the bear actually got close to him.

1270
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:54,000
And apparently what had happened was he inadvertently stumbled upon a bear that had killed a moose

1271
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:58,160
and the bear was protecting the moose and I guess he was just trying to get a photograph

1272
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,160
of it or something.

1273
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,640
The bear mauled him and just tore him apart.

1274
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:07,160
And I think he died on the way to the hospital, I think he had a stroke.

1275
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:12,000
These grizzly bears are terrifying, totally unlike our black bears in the east.

1276
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:19,360
Our black bears are slow to anger, slow to move, they're relatively gentle and out west

1277
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,040
the grizzly bears eat the black bears.

1278
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,480
Don't tear a black bear and take him down.

1279
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:29,600
They are absolutely terrifying if you're in that kind of situation.

1280
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,920
I mean they are so powerful, so fast, faster than a horse and a sprint as you probably

1281
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,920
know.

1282
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,920
Or just bananas.

1283
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:43,600
Yeah, this is why I had that pepper spray in my hand, because I was so concerned about

1284
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,600
that possibility.

1285
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,440
As unlikely as it seemed, I was terrified of that.

1286
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,360
It's almost like worth carrying a large rifle.

1287
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:55,200
If I ever went back to grizzly country, it wouldn't be with just pepper spray.

1288
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:00,000
Yeah, like a semi-auto 300 wind mag or something, something heavy.

1289
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,040
What if the wind had been blown the wrong way?

1290
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,040
Right, exactly.

1291
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:10,680
Well, my friend John, John Rivet, he actually runs a hunting camp in Alberta and he's blown

1292
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:16,000
pepper spray from a tree stand at a grizzly bear and he said the bear just walked right

1293
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,160
through like it was nothing because he was angry.

1294
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:24,080
This is funny because some of the pepper spray, a little bit of it got on me and more got

1295
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,760
on my wife because she was just in front of me between me and the bear.

1296
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:33,560
It took like 60 seconds before you started to feel, there was a lag after you got the

1297
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:37,320
pepper spray on you between when it started to burn and then it would get more intense.

1298
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,320
Oh, that's not good.

1299
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,320
Yeah, that's not what you want.

1300
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:44,840
I think if that's doing that to me and I don't have fur and I'm not a grizzly, what's it

1301
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,840
doing to him?

1302
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,640
But yeah, that's a little concerning too.

1303
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,360
Did you find the wildlife photographer, Montana?

1304
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,160
I found the story, I cannot find his Instagram page.

1305
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,160
What's his name?

1306
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,160
Carl Mock.

1307
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,720
And you can't find Carl Mock, wildlife photographer, Instagram?

1308
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:07,560
Well, there's that horrifying story of the bear whisperer guy who got killed with his

1309
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,160
girlfriend and he had his audio running, his tape recorder running while the bear killed

1310
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:15,120
him and ate him.

1311
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,120
And then killed his girlfriend.

1312
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,120
Yeah.

1313
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,440
That's a Werner Herzog's documentary, Grizzly Man.

1314
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,440
Have you watched the documentary?

1315
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,440
I haven't watched it.

1316
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,440
You should.

1317
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,880
You'll have a different opinion.

1318
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:30,640
Once you watch the documentary, you're like, huh, it kind of seems like suicide by bear.

1319
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,560
Yeah, but he was doing crazy stuff.

1320
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,960
It wasn't just crazy.

1321
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:37,200
He was doing what you're never supposed to do.

1322
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,880
He was also there past the time when the bears were supposed to be hibernating.

1323
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,120
So the only bears that are outside of hibernation are really desperate for protein, desperate

1324
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,920
for fat.

1325
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,000
They'll eat anything, and they decide, I think I'm going to eat this dude.

1326
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
And he was annoying.

1327
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,960
He would get close to the bear, hey, Mr. Chocolate.

1328
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:02,880
The video is, the film, rather, is hilarious, unfortunately.

1329
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,360
It's one of the most unintentionally funny movies you'll ever see.

1330
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:13,560
Because the guy, first of all, the man really loved bears, there's no doubt about that,

1331
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,240
and had a deep respect for them, and all those things are true.

1332
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:21,800
But also, he's like a comical kind of a guy.

1333
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,840
He would go up to their poop and go, this was just inside of her.

1334
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,400
Oh my goodness, it's still warm.

1335
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,400
This is amazing.

1336
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,400
I love you.

1337
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,400
I love you.

1338
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,600
And the bears, they're just trying to live.

1339
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,920
They don't give a fuck about you.

1340
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,280
They don't love you back.

1341
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:39,160
They have these dead eyes, these shark eyes.

1342
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,840
And you've looked at the grizzly bear's eyes.

1343
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,000
They are predators.

1344
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,280
They're wild, dangerous wild animals.

1345
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,280
They are not your friend.

1346
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,280
They are not your buddy.

1347
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,120
I don't care who you are.

1348
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,120
It's cool that they're around.

1349
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,560
I mean, it really is.

1350
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,240
It's an amazing thing.

1351
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,840
Grizzly bears, any bear, they're amazing.

1352
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,760
But be careful.

1353
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,760
Absolutely right.

1354
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,260
There's a lot of horrifying stories.

1355
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:04,760
Every year this happens to people.

1356
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,560
It's not an occasional thing.

1357
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,600
It's 10 or 15 or 20 people every year.

1358
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:12,200
Yeah, a couple weeks ago, a guy got chewed up in Yellowstone.

1359
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,960
A guy got his head chewed up by a sow.

1360
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,200
I think that guy lived, fortunately.

1361
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,200
But he got mangled.

1362
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:23,240
You know, it's just, they're so fast and so powerful.

1363
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,320
My friend John saw one kill a moose through a scope.

1364
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:33,360
He was looking through a, and he saw this bear chase the moose and swat it on the back.

1365
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:37,480
And he said it literally broke the moose's back.

1366
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,520
I can believe that.

1367
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,040
Just to mention that.

1368
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:48,560
I've seen a video of a female grizzly whose cub got swept away in the current and washed

1369
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,440
down in front of a big male who was fishing for salmon.

1370
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:57,640
And the male swiped at the cub, and sometimes the males will kill the cubs and eat them.

1371
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:01,200
And the mother went after him.

1372
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,440
And it was much like what we experienced when we were hiking.

1373
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,600
It was just nuclear.

1374
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,840
She was all out.

1375
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:09,840
He was bigger than her.

1376
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,840
She didn't care.

1377
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,120
She attacked him with everything she had, drove him across the stream, chased him up

1378
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,120
a hill.

1379
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,960
And, you know, it happened just like that.

1380
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:18,960
God, life.

1381
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,960
Yeah.

1382
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:20,960
Life is-

1383
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:21,960
It's overpowering.

1384
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:28,840
You know, there's, when you're in that circumstance, you know, you better have a way out or a gun

1385
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,840
or something.

1386
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:35,920
It was just, I think human beings have such a distorted idea of our place in the food

1387
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,920
chain.

1388
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,920
I really do.

1389
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:43,560
Because we're so, you know, we live in houses and we drive in cars and we fly in planes

1390
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,840
and we have guns and, you know, and we can go to the zoo and see a bear.

1391
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,760
But when you're out in the woods and there's no rules and they're acting on the laws of

1392
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,960
nature, I just don't think most people have any idea what that life is like.

1393
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,400
Their life is just ruthless and short.

1394
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,680
It lasts for like, you know, if they're lucky, they get 14, 15 years out of it.

1395
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:08,460
And by the time they're dead, they're just, all their bones are fucked up and their face

1396
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:13,320
is torn apart by other bears and, you know, and they kill things with their face for a

1397
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,320
living.

1398
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,400
That's what they do.

1399
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,920
And that's one of the things that terrifies people about this UAP issue, that, right,

1400
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,440
we're top of the food chain, we're the alpha, we don't have to worry about that.

1401
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:28,440
We're in control of our fate and then like, oh my gosh, well, maybe we're not.

1402
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,760
Why did they change it from UFO to unidentified aerial phenomena?

1403
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,720
The stigma, trying to get away from that loaded term.

1404
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:40,560
Part of the term, the problem with that term is that people don't hear the unidentified

1405
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,560
part.

1406
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,560
They think automatically you mean alien spaceship.

1407
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,560
Right.

1408
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,560
They say, do you believe in UFOs?

1409
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,560
Well, yeah, I believe people see things they don't identify, they can't identify, but that's

1410
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,560
not what people are thinking.

1411
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,840
You know, it's not what they think they're asking you.

1412
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,920
So people wanted a term that was a little more neutral.

1413
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:01,640
Is the worst case scenario that they are beings from another planet or another dimension or

1414
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:07,040
is the worst case scenario that these are things that China has developed or Russia

1415
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:13,600
has developed and they're so far technically superior to us that we can't even imagine.

1416
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:19,120
That's interesting because both situations in a worst case could lead to a similar outcome.

1417
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:29,040
The Chinese are employing AI and information technology in a truly Orwellian fashion.

1418
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:35,720
They are creating a state in which they can monitor what virtually every conversation,

1419
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:40,920
people's movement, people's employment, their location.

1420
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,240
They've got facial recognition detectors.

1421
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:47,160
They've got every cell phone has got like a patriotic scorecard on it, which they can

1422
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:50,760
download at a check checkpoint.

1423
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:56,440
And as they continue to perfect that and implement that, you get a vision of that seems very

1424
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,840
alien of where you extrapolate that out 20 years.

1425
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:05,480
You've got absolute power and control at the top, like a dysfunctional Hollywood sci-fi

1426
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,200
movie.

1427
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:13,520
So it's conceivably almost as bad as the worst case scenario of aliens coming in.

1428
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,960
I don't know what should be worse.

1429
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:21,080
When you think about space and this infinite ocean and the shores it washes up on and the

1430
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:25,860
things that are in the shadows out there, you know, there's no end to where your imagination

1431
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:28,200
can go.

1432
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,920
So it's hard to compare.

1433
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,680
But I don't think either of those would necessarily be a happy scenario.

1434
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:42,640
Well, I would think that best case scenario would be aliens because we would hope that

1435
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,720
aliens would be more enlightened than us.

1436
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,420
We know Chinese are not.

1437
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,040
They're just humans.

1438
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:55,440
You know, we know the Chinese people are no different than the Russians or than the Chechnians

1439
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,400
or the United States people.

1440
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,120
They're just human beings, right?

1441
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,760
Human beings are incredibly flawed and we're territorial apes with thermonuclear weapons.

1442
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,760
Right?

1443
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,800
That's what we are.

1444
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:11,360
We would hope that these things from another planet are far more advanced than us technologically

1445
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:17,680
and hopefully far more advanced than us spiritually.

1446
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:22,440
The way they communicate, maybe they're not warlike at all, which is why there's been

1447
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:27,920
no stories about them attacking and killing people or, you know, blowing up bases or doing

1448
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,000
anything crazy when they've been chased by jets.

1449
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,400
They seem to be completely benign in that respect.

1450
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:41,880
So I think the best case scenario would, at this stage, would be that they're aliens.

1451
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,280
Does that make sense?

1452
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:49,320
Yeah, it does make sense and I think that would be the hope and furthermore that they

1453
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:54,280
would impart a lot of this information to us and technology in ways to...

1454
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,280
Would they though?

1455
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,280
I don't know.

1456
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,280
I don't think they would.

1457
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,600
But in terms of best case scenario would be that they are benign like that and they want

1458
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,280
to help us.

1459
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,600
And so that's, you know, that's what we'd all like to believe.

1460
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:09,000
The help us part maybe, but show us the technology, but we're still us.

1461
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,480
The problem is we're still us.

1462
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,080
We're still ridiculous.

1463
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:18,520
The human animal in just, in general, amazing, beautiful, incredible creations, wonderful

1464
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:24,520
creativity, but also frightening in our anger and our ability to lash out and attack.

1465
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:30,080
I would hope that these beings that can travel across the galaxy would be far past all that

1466
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,080
stuff.

1467
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:36,760
Best case scenario, because if it is Russia or if it is China, you know, they're going

1468
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:43,240
to be like, look, I'm a proud American and I would like to think that the way we behave

1469
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:50,800
and the way we have governed in terms of the way we've used our superpower, although not

1470
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:57,520
perfect, has been better than if it was communist China that was in the same, the CCP that was

1471
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,520
in the same position.

1472
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,360
I would think that we've done a far better job.

1473
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:07,760
I would think that we were certainly not as draconian in the way we treat our citizens.

1474
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,720
We certainly don't do things to our citizens in this current age, the way they did to the

1475
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:12,720
Uighur Muslims.

1476
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:17,600
There's a lot of things that I like about the United States, but if the United States

1477
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,920
have the kind of power where they could just travel through the galaxy and they could just

1478
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,600
show up outside of nuclear bases in China and do whatever the fuck they wanted and just

1479
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,240
disappear into the ocean and we were the only ones that had it, that would disturb the shit

1480
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,040
out of the rest of the world, right?

1481
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:36,840
Even though we are the preeminent superpower, even though we are, you know, we're the number

1482
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,480
one military power on earth right now, currently, for the time being, right?

1483
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:46,160
I wouldn't want us to have that kind of advantage over the rest of the world, but if anybody

1484
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:50,240
did I'd want it to be us, but I definitely don't want it to be China, right?

1485
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,240
Absolutely not.

1486
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,240
That would be the worst.

1487
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,360
That would be worst case scenario.

1488
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,200
We monitor the Chinese and Russians very closely, very carefully.

1489
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:02,800
We spend, I think the unclassified figure is about 70 billion per year on the intelligence

1490
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:09,600
program, the intelligence community, and it would be very surprising and stunning if they

1491
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:16,520
had independently developed technology that was that far ahead of everything else and

1492
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:20,440
everyone else, somehow secretly.

1493
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:25,540
So it doesn't seem likely and we don't think that's the case.

1494
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:30,400
So more likely ultra-terrestrial or extraterrestrial.

1495
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,600
This is the conundrum.

1496
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:36,640
We don't see any evidence that it's the Russians or Chinese or anyone else, and we don't have

1497
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:41,120
any reason to believe that they have technology that can perform in that manner.

1498
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,640
So you know, this is the problem.

1499
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,640
Where does that drive you?

1500
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,640
Right.

1501
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,200
Where does that drive you?

1502
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:52,320
What about the possibility of the things that Babelzar did talk about, whether you believe

1503
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:58,840
Babelzar or not, the thing Babelzar talked about that's fascinating was this possibility

1504
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:05,280
that we have obtained some extraterrestrial craft and that we are in the process of trying

1505
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,880
to back-engineer it.

1506
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:13,480
Yeah, that's a really ticklish question for me and awkward.

1507
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,240
If I were to say, yep, it's true, nobody would believe me.

1508
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:23,080
If I really knew, I couldn't say yes.

1509
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:27,920
And yet, so it's hard to give good answers to that question.

1510
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,600
I think it's plausible.

1511
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:34,160
I don't think that people should rule that out.

1512
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,640
It's a legitimate question to ask.

1513
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:41,640
There's enough information to suggest something like that may have happened.

1514
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,080
We may have recovered some debris.

1515
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,560
What information?

1516
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,600
Well, there's some books about Roswell.

1517
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,880
There's some other cases like that where people have come forward and said I was in the military

1518
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:58,340
and I was at this retrieve where I was a kid and I saw this thing crash and I ran up to

1519
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:03,040
it and I saw what was inside it and blah, blah, blah.

1520
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:08,760
There are some, in fact, there's some investigation going on right now on a new case.

1521
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:12,560
So it's not an off-the-wall question.

1522
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,600
It's a legitimate question.

1523
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:18,680
I think the way it would probably play out in our government is that it would be so deeply

1524
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:24,640
squirreled away that you wouldn't be able to bring in the best scientists, you wouldn't

1525
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:29,920
be able to bring in world-class scientists, you would have available maybe a few people

1526
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:36,320
inside some aerospace company and they'd probably be very hamstrung in their ability to test

1527
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:41,200
and examine the material and so forth and just be locked away somewhere.

1528
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:47,240
That's the argument for Bob Lazar because Bob Lazar at least on paper is not a top scientist.

1529
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:53,840
He was a guy that had not the best credentials in terms of his education but was clearly

1530
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,080
a very intelligent guy who was fascinated with propulsion systems, put a jet engine

1531
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:01,960
on the back of his car and he was kind of a wacky super genius dude.

1532
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:07,720
He was just a little off and when you think about his description of how they ran the

1533
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,640
program, it's even more in line with what you would do with something that was incredibly

1534
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:14,200
top secret whereas everything is compartmentalized.

1535
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:18,480
The metallurgy people didn't talk to the propulsion people, the propulsion people didn't talk

1536
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:23,600
to whoever else was on the project.

1537
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:28,880
I'm not saying that there's no reason to believe we might have some recovered debris.

1538
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,320
I'm skeptical about some of his claims in particular.

1539
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,320
Multiple full crafts, right?

1540
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,880
Didn't he say there were like nine of them?

1541
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,200
Yeah, in different models and things.

1542
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:42,400
Some of the things he say don't sound like the government that I know.

1543
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,400
Like what?

1544
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:47,480
Like 21 levels of, you know, I had 21 levels of security clearance above top secret or

1545
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,480
something.

1546
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:53,040
There's no security system like that that I've ever heard of.

1547
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:58,440
So there are things like that that don't make sense from somebody who's been an insider.

1548
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:03,480
Is it possible that there might be something like that when it gets to a program that's

1549
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:10,560
as bizarre as back engineering extraterrestrial vehicles that they might put in place additional

1550
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:16,720
levels of top secret clearance, especially when you're talking about compartmentalizing

1551
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,720
all these different aspects of the project?

1552
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,800
That's not really the way it works.

1553
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:26,520
The way it works is that they could make a special exception in this case and DOE has

1554
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,000
something sort of like this.

1555
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,040
They have an alphabetical system with tiers of more classified stuff.

1556
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,040
DOE is?

1557
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,040
Department of Energy.

1558
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,040
Okay.

1559
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,920
So, you know, in the classified world, you've got the intelligence community and it has

1560
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,280
its own procedures and so forth.

1561
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:46,960
Then you've got Defense Department, black programs, which are a different world.

1562
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,240
And there's a little bit of overlap in a Venn diagram sense.

1563
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:54,200
And then you've got Department of Energy, which has billions of dollars in black programs,

1564
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:58,080
tens of billions and very little oversight.

1565
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:04,740
So they have a system and a different clearance, which is a result of the Atomic Energy Act,

1566
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:10,800
not an executive order, which establishes the classification for the rest of the government.

1567
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,200
So something like that's not impossible.

1568
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,240
It could happen.

1569
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:21,820
Now the Roswell story is a fascinating one because there was an uptick in UFO sightings

1570
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:27,160
or at least reported sightings that came after World War II.

1571
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:36,160
And the idea is, amongst the UFO cognoscenti, is that they were aware that we had detonated

1572
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:41,040
nuclear weapons and that we had blown up Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

1573
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:46,920
And they're like, okay, these crazy fucks, they're taking this to a new place.

1574
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,120
Let's zoom in and see what's going on down there.

1575
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,000
And then they started visiting us.

1576
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,880
Yeah, I mean, that's the story.

1577
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:56,880
That's plausible to me.

1578
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,760
I mean, if there are aliens here, why are they here?

1579
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,520
What are they doing, right?

1580
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:07,800
And when you look at the behavior of the objects that we're seeing, it's consistent with the

1581
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:12,400
possibility that maybe somebody has an interest in something here they want to protect.

1582
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,720
And if we were to have a nuclear war, it might compromise that interest.

1583
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:23,480
So maybe they have a stake in some resource here or some capability or genetics or just

1584
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,800
whatever.

1585
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:29,040
Maybe it's an experiment in Petri dish somebody started a long time ago.

1586
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,880
They want their experiment to run to its conclusion.

1587
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,680
I mean, that's an interesting perspective.

1588
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:37,160
There's so many possibilities when you start going down that path.

1589
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:47,720
I think probes that are, you know, artificial intelligence probes that have the capability

1590
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:55,440
manufacture or print robots or beings or maybe even genetically create something when it

1591
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:59,760
arrives at a destination is conceivable, right?

1592
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,880
They could travel through space for hundreds of years or thousands of years, arrive at

1593
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:09,920
a destination, consuming very little energy the whole way, all of a sudden, boom, and

1594
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:15,600
they create on board some some beings that can can operate things and perform tasks that

1595
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:20,520
are short live for that purpose, monitor, interact, collect, report.

1596
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:26,120
There's all kinds of possibilities that are within the bounds of science.

1597
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,720
Yeah, the imagination runs wild, right?

1598
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,720
It does.

1599
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,720
Yeah.

1600
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:33,040
And when you think about what's happening currently with human civilization, if you

1601
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:38,920
take it from the advent of the nuclear bomb to where we are today with this weird situation

1602
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:45,200
with Russia and China and just even almost like a civil war, which is potential potentially

1603
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,520
possible in the United States as well.

1604
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:53,600
Like we're in this weird, volatile stage of our development as a civilization.

1605
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,300
Maybe that's a feature of evolution.

1606
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:04,220
Maybe when biological creatures go from being a thing that lives tooth and claw like a grizzly

1607
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:10,500
bear to eventually developing shelter and then eventually developing some semblance

1608
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:15,380
of civilization to eventually developing advanced civilization and space travel and all this

1609
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:16,380
other stuff.

1610
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:22,380
Maybe along the way, there's this real possibility of fucking the whole project up and that it

1611
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:25,620
happens all throughout the universe and maybe they've observed this.

1612
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:31,500
Maybe this is a stage of development that we are being given training wheels and maybe

1613
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:37,420
a little bit of a helping hand by our extraterrestrial brethren who are, okay, they're there.

1614
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:38,420
They're right there.

1615
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:40,100
They're at that nuclear part.

1616
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,060
Let's keep an eye on these fuckers.

1617
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:43,860
That would be a nice, benign view.

1618
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:44,860
I'd love that.

1619
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:51,940
And it's possible that even by acknowledging this phenomenon, if we got to the point down

1620
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:55,940
the road where our government said, wow, there really is something from off planet coming

1621
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:02,980
It might help to resolve some of these differences and disputes between different countries.

1622
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:09,040
Might compel us to collaborate more, to see ourselves more as one species, one people

1623
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:13,340
and not Chinese versus Russians versus Americans.

1624
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:20,340
It would certainly stimulate a lot of technology, much as the space program did after they saw

1625
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:28,340
the Sputnik and people got afraid of the Russians in space and they're ahead of us and it actually

1626
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:30,020
led to cooperation.

1627
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:33,860
It led to progress in technology, a lot of good things.

1628
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:38,580
So I think there's a possibility that this could go in a very positive direction.

1629
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:41,180
That's what I would like to think.

1630
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:46,220
Now Roswell as a case is really interesting, right?

1631
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:48,220
Because there's a lot of witnesses.

1632
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:53,460
There's a lot of people that claim to have seen things and the stories all kind of mesh

1633
01:34:53,460 --> 01:35:00,540
together from Jesse Marcel to all the different people that claim to have seen bodies and

1634
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:06,500
different people that saw caskets to the person who worked at the mortuary who was contacted,

1635
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:12,260
the funeral home that was contacted by the military and told to make small caskets.

1636
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:15,260
There was all this weird shit that goes together.

1637
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:20,620
Now, whenever you have a story like that that becomes a legend, for sure there's some fuckery

1638
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:21,620
involved, right?

1639
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:23,540
There's got to be some shenanigans.

1640
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:27,700
We know the Air Force lied initially and they've now admitted they lied.

1641
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:28,860
So there was-

1642
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:30,060
Let's explain that.

1643
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:37,060
So Congressman Schiff of Arizona took up the case decades after the fact and asked the

1644
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:44,340
general accounting office to investigate and they confronted the Air Force and did a lot

1645
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:49,900
of research and the Air Force story that these were weather balloons crumbled.

1646
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:56,900
And the Air Force did a deep inquiry of its own and produced a big book saying, I forget

1647
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:03,340
what the title was, but essentially they were saying it was actually a classified experiment

1648
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:07,900
that was designed to detect nuclear explosions in the Soviet Union.

1649
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:13,700
So they admitted that their first story was a lie and their new story was, well, it really

1650
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:15,800
was balloons, but they weren't weather balloons.

1651
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,940
They were part of a top secret experiment.

1652
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:25,420
So they've changed their story once and is that now the true story or is it actually

1653
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:26,420
something else?

1654
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:27,420
Right.

1655
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:28,420
And why would they change their story?

1656
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,180
Why do they change it?

1657
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:32,180
Why tell the public?

1658
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:37,060
What benefit could be gained from telling the public that the initial 1947 story was

1659
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:39,300
a lie?

1660
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:42,580
Well I think they were trying to explain some of the discrepancies and hopefully this would

1661
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,620
put it to bed.

1662
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:47,380
Maybe it's just the truth.

1663
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:52,020
You know, I don't know what the motive was behind it.

1664
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:54,580
If you're skeptical, you would say it's a cover story.

1665
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:56,060
They're trying to cover their tracks.

1666
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,460
That's where I'm at.

1667
01:36:57,460 --> 01:36:58,460
I'm skeptical.

1668
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:00,040
Yeah, don't blame you.

1669
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:01,740
We know they lied about it the first time.

1670
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:06,060
Well the first, the report, I don't know where the report came from, but it was reported

1671
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:10,300
in the Roswell Dilley record, right, that they had recovered a crashed flying saucer.

1672
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:12,260
Oh, it was actually reported more widely than that.

1673
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:16,340
I think it was like announced over the radio and across the country.

1674
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:19,300
And then the next day they said it was a weather balloon.

1675
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:28,220
And that's where, was that when Jesse Marcel says he was told to bring in this false debris

1676
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:34,900
and say that this aluminum foil and all this crap was from a weather balloon?

1677
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:35,900
That's right.

1678
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:43,460
I will tell you, I've never said this before, but I've been told by multiple people who

1679
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:50,740
have credentials and access that there is some truth to these stories.

1680
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:54,660
So I don't discount this when people say this.

1681
01:37:54,660 --> 01:38:04,220
I've had people tell me, you know, people that have substantial scientific or military

1682
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:07,060
credentials that they believe is true.

1683
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:10,660
So I encourage people on the Hill to pursue it.

1684
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:16,420
You know, they've got a task force going right now looking into this, trying to understand

1685
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:18,980
what's happening in these restricted military areas.

1686
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:22,320
If you're opening that up, you know, ask all the tough questions.

1687
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,940
Ask about the military bases and the nuclear weapons.

1688
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:32,580
Ask whether there's anything buried somewhere, whether there's materials that we have.

1689
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:33,660
It's been a long time.

1690
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:35,860
I think the people can handle it, the public.

1691
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:36,860
It's their government.

1692
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:38,540
It's their money.

1693
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:39,540
I say go for it.

1694
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:42,900
You know, let's find out the truth, get to the bottom line.

1695
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:47,060
Where do you think that stuff could be if they did really recover?

1696
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:48,060
Oh, yeah.

1697
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:51,060
Well, you know, we have a number of candidate places.

1698
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:56,660
So Area 51, there's Wright-Patt, there's Edwards, there's a whole lot of places, depending what

1699
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:57,660
you were doing with it.

1700
01:38:57,660 --> 01:39:04,980
If you wanted to just squirrel it away, there's facilities not too far from here in the southwest

1701
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,540
that are, you know, you dispose of nuclear waste and other things.

1702
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:10,620
So there's a lot of possibilities.

1703
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:14,900
But wouldn't you, like, who's got the key?

1704
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,820
And who, you know, and that person's dead, right?

1705
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:22,060
So we're talking about several generations, like how do you get the golden key?

1706
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:26,580
Here we got people from 1947 that were in the military and they were adults, most likely

1707
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:28,380
dead now, right?

1708
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,380
Yep.

1709
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,380
Yeah.

1710
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:31,900
We're talking 70 years later.

1711
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:34,180
Not too many World War II vets around.

1712
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:35,180
Yeah.

1713
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:39,220
So how does that torch get passed?

1714
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:45,900
Like, and do they trot out new scientists occasionally when they've sufficiently compromised

1715
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:47,440
them on Epstein's Island?

1716
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:54,020
We have an amazingly dense, complex security apparatus and it really, you know, some people

1717
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:55,580
say, oh, you can't keep stuff secret a long time.

1718
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:56,980
That's not true at all.

1719
01:39:56,980 --> 01:40:03,300
We keep lots of stuff secret for decades and, you know, there are reporters in D.C. that

1720
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:07,420
think they've got the inside track and they know most of the secret stuff.

1721
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:10,060
People who think that are clueless.

1722
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:11,060
They really have no idea.

1723
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:12,060
Yeah.

1724
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:15,940
I think it's pretty delusional to think the government can't keep secrets like a crashed

1725
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,940
UFO.

1726
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:17,940
It's pretty delusional.

1727
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:24,380
Well, the F-117 and the B-2 bomber, you know, when they rolled the F-117 out, it was already

1728
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:29,140
operational up at Tonopah and it was a mission ready unit.

1729
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:33,460
They were flying and the people were shocked all around the world.

1730
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:35,140
People had no idea.

1731
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:36,260
So this thing had been built.

1732
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:41,380
There were tens of thousands of people involved in the production, the design, the deployment.

1733
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:46,100
And you know, there are many smaller things that would be much easier to conceal for a

1734
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:47,580
long time.

1735
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:52,420
What gets compromised and leaked is usually like foreign policy stuff and a policymaker

1736
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:57,500
can see that he can use his advantage in a debate over, you know, should we bomb around

1737
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,660
or something and they'll leak that.

1738
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:03,020
But weapons program stuff almost never leaks.

1739
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:04,500
Why do you think that is?

1740
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,780
It doesn't have press value.

1741
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:08,340
It's often very technical.

1742
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:11,700
There's no advantage and also almost nobody knows about it.

1743
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:13,620
The policymakers don't know about that stuff.

1744
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:18,140
So they're recipients of intelligence products and reporting.

1745
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:24,620
Even when I was in the government, people in the National Security Council and at that

1746
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:29,220
time the director of central intelligence, they didn't have access to the black programs

1747
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:31,140
at DOD.

1748
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:35,900
There was a case where I had a request from the National Security Council for access to

1749
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:39,220
some programs and I took it back to the building and they said no.

1750
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:41,020
That's the president's own staff.

1751
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:46,100
If the president wants it, we'll tell him or maybe the national security advisor or

1752
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,100
something.

1753
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:48,820
Was this Bush or Obama?

1754
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:56,540
This was Clinton, I believe.

1755
01:41:56,540 --> 01:42:01,900
Because I think the staffer was a guy named Richard Clark, famous counter-terrorist advisor

1756
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:06,260
on the NSC staff who was carried over.

1757
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:09,580
So at that point, possibly it was Bush.

1758
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:14,180
Clinton was trying to find out some information about UFOs, correct?

1759
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:15,580
I've heard that...

1760
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:18,860
Publicly, he talked about it on a talk show, I believe.

1761
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:20,220
Yes, he has said that.

1762
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:25,420
I have no inside knowledge of what he has done or who he's asked, but I've heard that

1763
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:29,100
he did ask one of his confidants to dive into this.

1764
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:34,740
Yeah, I wonder how much they tell the president because you think, well, the president has

1765
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:41,780
access to all the information and then you look at Trump and you go, maybe not.

1766
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:45,860
They don't have access to anything close to all the information and they don't need it

1767
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:46,860
and they don't want it.

1768
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:52,060
You know, most of the secret stuff is not sexy or interesting or particularly, you know...

1769
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:58,060
Isn't that a flaw, though, in our system, if that's really legitimately the commander-in-chief?

1770
01:42:58,060 --> 01:43:01,180
That's the commander-in-chief of the greatest army the world's ever known, but you can't

1771
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:02,460
know a lot of shit.

1772
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:08,300
It's not that he can't and he can get briefed on anything he wants, but he could spend the

1773
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:12,180
first six months doing nothing but looking at secret programs and getting briefed on

1774
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:13,660
them.

1775
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:17,540
And it's just not worth his time to be getting briefed on, yeah, this is how we made the

1776
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,180
battle armor on the tank better and, you know...

1777
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:20,660
But let me ask you this.

1778
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:26,700
If you were the president, wouldn't that be the first thing you would ask?

1779
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,580
There is some stuff that I would immediately...

1780
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:29,580
What would you do?

1781
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:30,580
Yeah.

1782
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:31,580
Immediately.

1783
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:32,780
Oh, good question.

1784
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:37,500
So I'd want to get, I want to know the Department of Energy, I'd want to know all their special

1785
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:38,980
programs is one thing.

1786
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:43,780
I'd want to have a sit-down with the director of operations at CIA.

1787
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:49,820
I'd want to talk to, I'd want to review the waived special access programs, Section 119

1788
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:55,180
of Title X, that most of Congress is exempted from reporting to.

1789
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:59,140
It's a very high category of DOD programs.

1790
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:00,140
There's some things like that.

1791
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:04,740
There is a briefing the president gets, of course, shortly after being elected that covers

1792
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:11,140
a lot of the strategic nuclear warfare, some of the key top secret things that he really

1793
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:14,660
needs to know, has to know, should know.

1794
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:18,980
And then there's a category of things that are like, should we tell him or not?

1795
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:19,980
Yeah.

1796
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:24,020
I mean, there's too much stuff, obviously, to convey, so they've got to pick and choose.

1797
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:27,260
Some things are no-brainers, other things are judgment calls.

1798
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:30,460
What do you think the DOE could be working on?

1799
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:35,780
Well, in some cases, a lot of what they're doing is good stuff.

1800
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:39,700
They're trying to secure the weapons stockpile, and they're trying to make sure that now that

1801
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:43,780
we're not testing anymore, will these things still function as they were designed, and

1802
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:47,540
they could do incredible computer modeling and that kind of thing.

1803
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:53,620
But DOE's got its hands in a lot of different areas in terms of power and production and

1804
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:58,140
other kinds of things, and I'd be very interested to know.

1805
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:02,260
They don't seem to get much oversight, unlike the Defense Department and the intelligence

1806
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:03,260
community.

1807
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:06,780
They have a lot of oversight from Capitol Hill, for example.

1808
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:12,220
DOE, I don't think, necessarily discloses its black programs to its oversight committee,

1809
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:14,340
the Energy and Public Works Committee.

1810
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:16,860
I don't know how that works over there.

1811
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:20,620
I'm not sure they get the same, I don't think they get the same level of review.

1812
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:23,420
How are they incentivized to innovate?

1813
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:26,100
Well, they've got to...

1814
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:29,660
As they operate kind of in secrecy.

1815
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:33,260
Yeah, a lot of what they do is not all the R&D is in secret.

1816
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:38,820
They're doing a lot of good stuff related to energy and power and solar power and stuff

1817
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:41,800
that's public, open source.

1818
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:47,580
It's really mostly nuclear weapons related stuff that is secret, that is really, really

1819
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:48,900
close hold.

1820
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:50,500
But that can cover a lot of grounds.

1821
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:51,720
There's been a lot of innovation.

1822
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:55,860
That's an example where, no, the public doesn't know, shouldn't know.

1823
01:45:55,860 --> 01:46:00,060
We wouldn't want that information to be released, a lot of the details of that.

1824
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:03,140
It wouldn't be in our interest, the public's interest.

1825
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,740
And there's a lot of stuff going on there.

1826
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:11,460
And it was, for me, the one sort of pie that I didn't have a lot of deep access to.

1827
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:19,860
I had some access to those programs, but I had a much more prolonged and intimate relationship

1828
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:22,500
with the defense and intelligence community.

1829
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:28,300
Now, if you became president and you wanted to find out more information about UAPs or

1830
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:31,740
UFOs or whatever you want to call them, how would you go about doing that?

1831
01:46:31,740 --> 01:46:32,740
That's an interesting question, too.

1832
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:33,740
Because-

1833
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:34,740
Where would you start?

1834
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:38,340
Yeah, because it's so convoluted, these things.

1835
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:45,760
I would start at the agency and the Air Force.

1836
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:49,380
That's where you're most likely to find these things.

1837
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:54,100
If there's a program like that, that's most likely where it is.

1838
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:57,340
And how would you even get to the right person?

1839
01:46:57,340 --> 01:47:02,020
Because the number of people that have all the information has to be pretty small.

1840
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:05,620
So you'd have to be really careful about who you have lunch with.

1841
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:06,620
Yeah.

1842
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:09,700
When you worked in the field a long time, you get some ideas of where to go and who

1843
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:10,700
to talk to.

1844
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:11,700
You think you got an idea of who to go and who to talk to?

1845
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:12,700
Yeah, I have some ideas.

1846
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:13,700
Yeah?

1847
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:14,700
Yeah.

1848
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:17,700
I know where a lot of the budgets of other offices-

1849
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:20,220
Imagine walking around with that information, though.

1850
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:25,820
Imagine being a guy who's walking around knowing that somewhere in the middle of the Nevada

1851
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:29,760
desert there's a UFO that definitely came from another planet.

1852
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,100
It's being guarded 24-7.

1853
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:34,940
And if the public saw it, it would shatter their belief in reality.

1854
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:35,940
Yeah, crazy.

1855
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:40,940
I'll tell you a story that you can judge how it compares, but this is something that happened

1856
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:44,060
to me in real life that was crazy.

1857
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:49,620
I was one of the hand-pilled people who was told there's a nuclear weapon in New York.

1858
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:55,060
It's going to go off in the next few days, we think, and there's another unlocated.

1859
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:59,380
We think it's heading to D.C., which is where I was living with my family.

1860
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:04,260
So I'm walking around for days, running to people in the street, my neighbors, how you

1861
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:05,260
doing?

1862
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:06,260
Get the hell out of here.

1863
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:08,300
You can't tell anybody anything.

1864
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:16,300
I had my family quietly relocate, but it turned out the source, thankfully, was wrong, but

1865
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:21,780
it was one of those kind of situations where you're aware of something or the possibility

1866
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:27,900
of something that is going to just freak people the hell out if they found out about it for

1867
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:28,900
good reason.

1868
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:31,900
It was a very surreal experience.

1869
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:32,900
Jesus.

1870
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:38,140
Yeah, that always begs the question, like, if you knew that something was going to happen

1871
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:41,180
that was going to destroy the country, what do you do?

1872
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:42,180
You can't even tell anybody.

1873
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:43,180
Like, what's the point?

1874
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:47,220
Like, if an asteroid's coming here, it's going to land smack down the middle of Chicago.

1875
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:51,500
Well, see, that was an interesting case there, right, because they didn't warn New Yorkers

1876
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:52,500
to evacuate.

1877
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,500
Why didn't they do that?

1878
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,500
Because they didn't want to panic?

1879
01:48:54,500 --> 01:49:00,380
I think they made a decision that the panic would be awful and there'd be casualties,

1880
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:03,820
and they didn't have certainty that it was there.

1881
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:06,820
But that would be a terrible policy decision to have to make.

1882
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:07,820
Yeah.

1883
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:09,620
Do we tell people to evacuate or not?

1884
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:15,080
If you tell people to evacuate, there's probably going to be incredible panic and all kinds

1885
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:18,420
of not only just disruption, but people are going to get hurt and probably some people

1886
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:21,780
are going to die in a panic like that.

1887
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:23,660
What do you do if a UFO's coming?

1888
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:30,020
Like, what do you do if they spotted something, they've got some sort of satellite image of

1889
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:34,180
some mothership that's 15 football fields long, and it's headed our way?

1890
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:35,540
Do you even bother telling anybody?

1891
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:37,420
Do you let it just show up?

1892
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:39,580
There's no protocol for that that I know of.

1893
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:42,460
I would think you would want to try to establish communications.

1894
01:49:42,460 --> 01:49:47,940
I think if we actually got to the point of saying, yeah, we're monitoring these things

1895
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:51,740
now, we're seeing where they're coming into orbit, we're seeing where they're dropping

1896
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:54,140
down from orbit, and we're seeing this pattern.

1897
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:58,140
These are ships, they are craft, they're vehicles, they're intelligently controlled.

1898
01:49:58,140 --> 01:49:59,140
What do you do about it?

1899
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:05,020
One of the things you might want to do is try to establish some kind of communication.

1900
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:06,780
Yeah.

1901
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:13,700
I'm sure you're aware of the astronomy professor from Harvard, the chief of astronomy, Dr.

1902
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:19,940
Avi Loeb, and his assessment of that object that went through our solar system, that he

1903
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:25,820
believes it's extraterrestrial in origin, that it's 91% a disk, 91% possibility that

1904
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:31,580
it's some sort of a disk, that it's 10 times more reflective than any other object like

1905
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:35,900
it that we've ever spotted in the solar system, and that it's moving far too fast away from

1906
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:43,980
the sun for it to be something that it's not affected the way we would expect it to be

1907
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:45,540
by the sun's gravity.

1908
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:49,980
That seems to indicate that it's something of extraterrestrial origin.

1909
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:51,580
What do you think of that?

1910
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:52,580
It's interesting.

1911
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:58,940
I have read that since then, an alternative has been identified that many scientists think

1912
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:05,340
clears this up, that explains those anomalies, and he identified a number of anomalies.

1913
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:11,140
One of the things I found interesting though about it is here's an object, maybe discarded,

1914
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:15,420
maybe it's just an artifact, a solar sail that somebody didn't need anymore and it fell

1915
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:24,420
into orbit around our sun, but if it was some kind of a craft, as some people theorized,

1916
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:30,460
think about how inefficient that is compared to a probe in our atmosphere compared to these

1917
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:32,900
things that we're seeing routinely.

1918
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:38,700
It may have taken hundreds or thousands of years to get here, and would you want to design

1919
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:42,380
and build something that after traveling for hundreds of thousands of years, it spends

1920
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:48,140
a few days at a great distance from interesting planets and just kind of whizzes by and then

1921
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:49,140
it's gone?

1922
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:52,520
Isn't it possible that this is one ... Look at what we're doing on Mars, right?

1923
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:57,500
We have this drone that's buzzing around on Mars and the rover.

1924
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:04,140
Isn't it possible that this is an early stage intergalactic spaceship that's now just filled

1925
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,420
with skeletons?

1926
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:07,420
It's possible.

1927
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:15,380
What I think is interesting though is we have this very persuasive and compelling evidence

1928
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:20,300
of intelligently controlled vehicles in our atmosphere that are actually maneuvering,

1929
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:27,660
which this thing was not, and are behaving in ways that you might expect a probe from

1930
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:33,860
somewhere else to behave, including the fact that it's doing radical things we don't understand

1931
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:35,420
that seem like magic.

1932
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:40,500
If you apply that logic to, say, the Nimitz case, I think it's even stronger.

1933
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:44,900
I think it's harder to explain the Nimitz case than it is to Omana Mana.

1934
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:45,900
Yeah.

1935
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:53,940
Omana Mana, though, my take on it is you could go to someone's barn and find a Model T or

1936
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:56,900
you could drive down the road and see a Tesla.

1937
01:52:56,900 --> 01:53:00,780
There are various stages of technological evolution.

1938
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:05,660
Just because we have these amazing things like that Tic Tac that are somehow or another

1939
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:09,660
here and operating, it doesn't mean it's something else.

1940
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:13,340
If we're right about the amount of Goldilocks planets that are out there and we're right

1941
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:19,820
about the infinite scope of the universe, it's possible there's a shitload of civilizations.

1942
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:21,460
We can't compare their technology.

1943
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:25,460
It's almost like comparing the technology of human beings on the same planet to people

1944
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:32,380
that live on North Sentinel Island, the people that are isolated, the small band of human

1945
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:34,820
beings that live in this uncontacted tribe.

1946
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:36,940
Oh yeah, on the Andaman Sea.

1947
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:37,940
Yeah.

1948
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:41,900
So compare them to people who live in Los Angeles.

1949
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:42,900
It's kind of silly, right?

1950
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:47,060
He makes a compelling case for that.

1951
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:52,380
It is bizarre, the shape of it and the luminosity and so forth.

1952
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:57,260
NASA has now, and Congress has agreed, that they should begin looking for things like

1953
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:01,820
that, technosignatures, evidence of alien technology.

1954
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:06,420
And this is another one of these ironies that NASA has said and Congress said, yeah, that's

1955
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:07,540
entirely possible.

1956
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:09,340
You should go look at that stuff.

1957
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:16,940
But oh my God, if it's in our atmosphere, if it's that close, no, that's crazy.

1958
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:20,380
Even though it's happening, our military's encountering these things and we're getting

1959
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:27,020
movies of them and radar tracks, it's very difficult to get anybody to take that seriously

1960
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:29,020
to get interested, to get involved.

1961
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:33,020
Even when they look at video, there's a weird video, I don't even know if it's legit, but

1962
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:38,300
it's a weird video of a thing in our upper atmosphere, it's moving and then it takes

1963
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:40,540
a very hard angle turn away.

1964
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:41,740
Have you seen that thing before?

1965
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:47,580
I'm not sure which one, there's so many out there and that's a common kind of occurrence,

1966
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:50,060
these right angle turns.

1967
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:57,540
That's the thing, it's almost impossible, it's impossible, there's nothing we have that

1968
01:54:57,540 --> 01:54:58,540
can move like that.

1969
01:54:58,540 --> 01:54:59,540
No way.

1970
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:02,540
Not at high speed.

1971
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:06,220
You'd have to imagine it's either faked, like some faked footage that shows these things

1972
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:09,100
because for sure there's a lot of fake stuff.

1973
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:13,620
There was that one guy from, was it Denmark?

1974
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:17,180
There was one guy from another country that made a lot of fake UFO footage.

1975
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:20,820
Oh, probably the Swiss guy.

1976
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:21,820
He's kind of hilarious.

1977
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:25,980
Yeah, there's a number of these fabricators and of course they've polluted the whole space.

1978
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:29,980
I know some guys that are trying to create an AI capability that'll screen all these

1979
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:37,660
videos for signs of manipulation and being hoaxed, etc. so you can have a better sense

1980
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:41,660
of confidence in the ones that get through that process because there's so many out there

1981
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:46,620
and some of them could be really interesting but you have no way of knowing what credibility

1982
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:49,060
to attach to them generally.

1983
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:53,980
Are there any ones from other countries that you find credible, like videos, footage, wasn't

1984
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:59,420
there some images or video that was taken over Mexico City, was there something?

1985
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:03,100
There is an interesting one from the Mexican military.

1986
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:04,620
Don't know much detail about that.

1987
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,620
I've seen it.

1988
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:09,820
There have been a lot of sightings in Mexico and in South America.

1989
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:15,800
There was a sighting off the coast of Chile which I think they found an explanation for.

1990
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:24,340
It was apparently a drug plane that was exuding a lot of its fuel probably because it was

1991
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:28,340
trying to disguise its location or I don't know, change directions or something.

1992
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:31,580
It looked very weird when you saw the original video.

1993
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:34,620
I think that was explained.

1994
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:38,060
The Brazilians have tons of video.

1995
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:39,380
I haven't seen much of it.

1996
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:42,900
I know that they've collected a great deal of information.

1997
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:50,280
They've had some incidents like we did in 52 where the capital of the US was being overflown.

1998
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:55,700
They called it the night of the UFOs and they had like 23 different UFOs being seen in multiple

1999
01:56:56,060 --> 01:57:01,940
fighter jets in the air and it's just going on all over the country, front page news.

2000
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:04,220
There is some other video evidence out there for sure.

2001
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:07,980
There's some video that we haven't released that we have that I've seen.

2002
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,620
What have you seen?

2003
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:15,020
One of them, I've seen a few of them and until the Defense Department releases it, I can't

2004
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:23,180
say too much about it even though it's not classified but they haven't released it yet.

2005
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:27,820
I will say there's some more videos like the ones that have been released that they've

2006
01:57:27,820 --> 01:57:28,820
authenticated.

2007
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:32,180
Do you believe that the Defense Department is going to eventually release this video

2008
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:33,180
that you've seen?

2009
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:34,180
I hope so.

2010
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:37,420
I don't see why they shouldn't.

2011
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:41,040
National security has only been benefiting from this, right?

2012
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:45,380
This was a problem that was being ignored, a very real problem, a problem that should

2013
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:46,380
concern everybody.

2014
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:53,620
How many Americans would believe that we've got craft violating our airspace routinely

2015
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:55,980
in military airspace?

2016
01:57:55,980 --> 01:58:00,860
Most of us tend to think that we're America, we're the alpha, we're the top dog.

2017
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:05,260
Our airspace is secure, we've got it locked down, no way anybody's going to come sneaking

2018
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:06,260
in here.

2019
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:12,020
Well, to find out this is going on, not like occasionally but routinely, even around military

2020
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:16,300
facilities and bases, that's shocking.

2021
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:19,700
It's hard to get traction though.

2022
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:25,220
When that story appeared in the New York Times, I was stunned to learn that almost nobody

2023
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:27,540
in Congress asked for a briefing.

2024
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:28,540
Really?

2025
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:29,540
Yeah.

2026
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:32,700
Here's this front page story with videos, you can see the UFO for yourself, you can

2027
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:38,340
hear the pilots and they're clearly amazed at what they're looking at, they have no idea

2028
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:42,980
what it is, and you'd think the oversight committees would go, what the hell is going

2029
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:43,980
on here?

2030
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:44,980
I want a briefing on that.

2031
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:49,460
Yeah, Jamie, find the GoFast video and play that because that's the best one to hear the

2032
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:54,660
pilot's reaction because they're watching this thing shoot across the surface of the

2033
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:57,660
ocean.

2034
01:58:57,660 --> 01:59:02,740
That was released in the Washington Post a few months after the other two that were in

2035
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:08,180
the New York Times, but it's a good video and it's been authenticated by the Defense

2036
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:10,180
Department.

2037
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:11,180
It looks like a tic-tac.

2038
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:15,500
Yeah, but it's moving at a much more reasonable rate of speed.

2039
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:16,500
Much more reasonable.

2040
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:18,220
What did they estimate the speed at?

2041
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:23,380
You know, I've seen different estimates and there's one debunker who's made a strong case

2042
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:31,100
that it's going like 130 miles an hour, could be right, but he claims it's a balloon.

2043
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:33,340
Was that Mick West?

2044
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:34,340
Yeah.

2045
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:35,340
Yeah, Mick West debunks everything.

2046
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:36,340
Yeah.

2047
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:39,540
That motherfucker doesn't believe shit.

2048
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:42,420
His debunkings are more elaborate than alien theories.

2049
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:47,340
He's got civilian airliners on their sides without transponders and restricted airspace

2050
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:49,820
with three other things happening at the same time.

2051
01:59:49,820 --> 01:59:53,260
His take on the tic-tac is pretty silly.

2052
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:56,420
He hasn't taken into account all the evidence.

2053
01:59:56,420 --> 02:00:01,980
He has no regard for military personnel and their experience with these sensors and these

2054
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:05,220
aircraft and what they're seeing and reporting.

2055
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:06,220
They're attracting systems.

2056
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:09,540
He recounts these people and he's never been in one of these planes, he's never operated

2057
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:13,380
these sensors and he just dismisses these people.

2058
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:14,380
That bothers me.

2059
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:16,540
Yeah, he's an odd duck.

2060
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:17,540
Nice guy though.

2061
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:18,540
You got it?

2062
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:19,540
I don't know.

2063
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:20,540
Let's see.

2064
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:21,540
You don't know?

2065
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:22,540
Yeah, that's it.

2066
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:23,540
That's the gimbal.

2067
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:24,540
No, that's the gimbal.

2068
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:28,500
I was trying to find the other one.

2069
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:31,820
The GoFast one, did you just Google GoFast?

2070
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:32,820
100%.

2071
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:33,820
Yeah.

2072
02:00:33,820 --> 02:00:34,820
Just GoFast.

2073
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:36,140
Is it all in the same video?

2074
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:37,140
Maybe.

2075
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:38,140
Maybe.

2076
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:39,140
Could be.

2077
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:40,140
Yep.

2078
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:41,140
That's it.

2079
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:42,140
That's it.

2080
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:43,140
Yep.

2081
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:44,140
Oh, good!

2082
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:45,140
Woohoo!

2083
02:00:45,140 --> 02:01:06,660
So that is them trying to figure out what the fuck that is.

2084
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:10,420
By the way, this is a segment of a longer video.

2085
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:14,900
I've suggested to some of my friends on the hill that they ask the department to release

2086
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:16,820
the rest of the video.

2087
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:17,820
Why not?

2088
02:01:17,820 --> 02:01:22,700
I mean, they've acknowledged that this is for real, and they've also acknowledged that

2089
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:23,980
there was no compromise.

2090
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:25,700
It wasn't classified.

2091
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:27,820
So why not release the rest of it?

2092
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:31,020
And that might help us resolve some of these ambiguities, because if that makes a right

2093
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:33,460
angle turn, that's not a balloon, obviously.

2094
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:34,460
Right.

2095
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:36,460
Well, the way that thing's moving, to think that's a balloon seems pretty silly.

2096
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:37,460
It does not look like a balloon.

2097
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:38,460
It's like it's on railroad tracks.

2098
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:39,460
I mean, it's just like...

2099
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:40,460
It's flying.

2100
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:42,180
Yeah, and it's really true.

2101
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:43,180
It's straight.

2102
02:01:43,180 --> 02:01:45,540
It's not wobbling or being buffeted by the wind.

2103
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:46,540
No.

2104
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:51,260
That would have to be the most fucking insane wind of all time, like a tunnel wind.

2105
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:56,300
But just the fact that it looks like it's not wiggling at all, it's moving through

2106
02:01:56,300 --> 02:02:01,540
some method of propulsion that can't be determined because it's not giving off a heat signature.

2107
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:07,260
And I mean, to say it's only 150 miles an hour, like maybe, but why would that freak

2108
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:10,100
out pilots who go way faster than that?

2109
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:13,340
I mean, they can go supersonic and they're watching this thing and they're freaking

2110
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:14,340
out and laughing.

2111
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:15,900
Like, look at that thing go.

2112
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:17,620
Like, come on.

2113
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:22,060
They're weirded out by it, obviously, and they're probably being vectored to it by somebody.

2114
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:25,380
It sounds to me like they've been looking for it and somebody's been saying, it's, hey,

2115
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:26,380
it's down here.

2116
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:27,580
Go to this place and you'll find it.

2117
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:30,900
And then these guys finally get on it and somebody gets a lock on it.

2118
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:32,540
And you can hear that amazement in their voice.

2119
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:36,300
So there's a lot more information about that incident and these others, which is in the

2120
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:37,300
public domain.

2121
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:43,420
I've been urging the Defense Department to put more of that out there and ask, you know,

2122
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:47,020
suggest to the committees they might want to ask the department to do that.

2123
02:02:47,020 --> 02:02:49,020
I don't see any reason not to.

2124
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:51,260
An informed public is in our best interest.

2125
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:53,940
It's in our best national security interest.

2126
02:02:53,940 --> 02:03:01,860
And yet the overwhelming default value in the Pentagon is, you know, don't talk about

2127
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:05,180
anything, don't share anything.

2128
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:09,500
Even though they can see in a case like this, until that information got out, nothing was

2129
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:10,500
happening.

2130
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:11,500
Yeah.

2131
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:16,220
And now we've finally getting some attention on a serious national security problem, which

2132
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:19,980
wouldn't have happened if the information hadn't gone public.

2133
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:24,420
And you know, why not make more information public if it's not classified, there's no

2134
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:28,900
sources and methods issue that you're going to compromise, you know, you're not revealing

2135
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:33,580
some super hidden capability that needs to be protected.

2136
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:38,980
Why not put that out and help inform people and it's their country, it's their homes,

2137
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:42,060
their livelihood, their government.

2138
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:46,300
And ultimately, how does Congress make decisions about how to allocate resources if they don't

2139
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:51,620
have the information of what's going on and, you know, what the possible threats are?

2140
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:54,300
None of this information was getting to Congress.

2141
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:59,780
So there was no opportunity for them even to take any action.

2142
02:03:59,780 --> 02:04:05,060
They were completely kept in the dark on this until 2017.

2143
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:06,060
That's pretty crazy.

2144
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:08,540
I couldn't agree more.

2145
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:13,940
What video that you've seen is the most compelling that's been released?

2146
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:17,980
And have you seen anything that hasn't been released that's more compelling?

2147
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:24,940
One of the ones that hasn't been released is got more emotional impact, certainly.

2148
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:25,940
Can you give us a tease?

2149
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:33,140
The UFO is going really close to this guy and he's freaking out for good reason.

2150
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:39,980
But that doesn't mean that the object was necessarily super advanced craft.

2151
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:44,000
He's going so fast, maybe it was actually moving slowly and hanging there and he went

2152
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,240
by it super fast.

2153
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:51,300
But his perception was that something was coming real fast at him and going right between

2154
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:53,420
him and another guy.

2155
02:04:53,420 --> 02:05:01,540
And it's all unclassified stuff, but it doesn't resolve any of these issues, but it's pretty

2156
02:05:01,540 --> 02:05:02,540
compelling.

2157
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:06,380
So there's something like that along those lines.

2158
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:09,420
The Navy has admitted there was a near mid-air collision.

2159
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:11,620
Safety report was filed.

2160
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:15,140
That's all public information.

2161
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:20,960
And I think, you know, again, it's frustrating to see this attitude of, you know, we've got

2162
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,080
to lock everything down.

2163
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:28,200
We've got to classify everything right away, even if it's a guy with an iPhone.

2164
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:31,840
And you know, it's not a secret sensor or anything.

2165
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:36,400
You don't have to worry about the source, you know, because in the foreign public more

2166
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:39,240
of the scientific community will get involved.

2167
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:41,760
They'll bring more expertise to bear.

2168
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:46,840
And people better assess this issue and whether something needs to be done about it.

2169
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:49,560
Because right now almost nothing is being done about it.

2170
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:54,920
They've got a tiny task force with a few guys who are trying to collect information and

2171
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:57,160
write a report for the Senate.

2172
02:05:57,160 --> 02:06:01,240
And I think what's going to be significant about it is it's due next month.

2173
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:05,720
They're not going to be able to say what Project Blue Book said, which was, there's nothing

2174
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:06,760
really happening here.

2175
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:10,200
There's nothing of national security interest.

2176
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:14,360
There's no advanced technology beyond what we have.

2177
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:15,800
Blue Book said both of those things.

2178
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:23,400
He said, not only is it not ET, but we don't see any mysterious technology and we don't

2179
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:26,680
see any reason to be concerned from a national security standpoint.

2180
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:32,120
I don't see how this report can say any of those things.

2181
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:36,840
So I think when that, you know, assuming they do deliver the report and they acknowledge

2182
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:40,080
that this is happening, it's continuing to happen.

2183
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:43,920
They have other classified information that should be weighed and factored into their

2184
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:47,480
unclassified judgment in a report that's released.

2185
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:51,720
They won't give the details, but the people that write the assessment of this should have

2186
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:53,840
the knowledge of that.

2187
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:57,760
And I think if they do a straight up job, they're going to have to acknowledge that

2188
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:04,240
there is, there are indications of technology more advanced than anything we possess and

2189
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:08,160
that there is a legitimate national security issue.

2190
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:12,960
So that one video that flies very close to the pilot, that's the one that you find to

2191
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
be the most compelling.

2192
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,960
That has the most, I think, emotional impact on people.

2193
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:23,280
I think the gimbal video, when you understand that there's a second fleet of UFOs that are

2194
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:28,960
maneuvering near those guys, in addition to what you're seeing there and the pilot's reaction

2195
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:33,800
and the maneuvering, that's probably the most compelling.

2196
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:38,760
The FLIR video that we haven't talked about much does show this instantaneous acceleration,

2197
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:41,480
which is another thing that we don't have, we can't do.

2198
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:46,480
We don't have anything that can sit there hovering and then just suddenly, you know.

2199
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:49,080
And the FLIR video is the one of the Tic Tac, correct?

2200
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:50,480
That was the Tic Tac, correct.

2201
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:53,480
See if you can find the FLIR, correct?

2202
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:54,480
Correct.

2203
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:55,480
What does that stand for?

2204
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:58,200
Forward Looking Infrared Radar.

2205
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:03,240
And this is, again, this is after Commander Fravor had spotted the thing?

2206
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:04,240
Correct.

2207
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:10,320
So there's two aviators in those F-18s, there's a pilot and a weapon system operator behind

2208
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:15,440
him and there were two F-18s that saw the Nimitz with two people in them.

2209
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:19,760
So that's four aviators all seeing the same thing in perfect conditions.

2210
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:24,120
And they're toggling through different methods of viewing this thing to try to get a better

2211
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:25,120
...

2212
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,120
Right.

2213
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:27,120
Correct.

2214
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:28,120
Perspective, a better view of it.

2215
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:33,360
Yeah, and he's been following what was going on earlier in the day and wanted to go out

2216
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:39,720
and try to get on this thing, you know, Gung Ho Navy pilot.

2217
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:44,520
And all of a sudden it decides it doesn't want to be there anymore.

2218
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:50,060
So what we're watching for folks who are just listening is he's toggling also from looking

2219
02:08:50,060 --> 02:08:57,920
at it in what looks like 1X and then he goes and zooms in occasionally, he's going back

2220
02:08:57,920 --> 02:08:59,300
and forth.

2221
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:00,300
What is he doing here?

2222
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:03,780
He's trying to get a lock on it.

2223
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:08,260
And that will enhance his ability to track it.

2224
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:10,660
And he's not able to do that.

2225
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:12,580
His system is not able to get a lock.

2226
02:09:12,580 --> 02:09:15,220
So he keeps trying and then whoop, all of a sudden he just kind of ...

2227
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:16,220
Yeah.

2228
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:17,220
That's bananas.

2229
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:18,220
All of a sudden he's just kind of shh, you know.

2230
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:20,780
Do we have any estimation of how fast it was going when it did that?

2231
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:23,060
We do.

2232
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:26,500
We're talking thousands of miles an hour.

2233
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:33,780
The Scientific Coalition for UFO Research has a website and they did a very deep analysis,

2234
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:40,400
mathematical engineering guys, on the momentums, the g-forces, the speeds.

2235
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:41,400
And they're all crazy.

2236
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:47,580
I mean, some of the g-forces, they're g-forces, if the speed estimates are right, that are

2237
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:53,060
probably five times greater than anything we've ever built could withstand.

2238
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:59,700
I mean, it would just shred any aircraft, any missile, any rocket that we've ever built.

2239
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:05,460
They're so far beyond the design tolerances and limits of systems that we make that it's

2240
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:06,940
crazy.

2241
02:10:06,940 --> 02:10:14,540
So that image or that video alone is probably to you the most compelling or the most ...

2242
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:20,340
I think actually the most compelling case is the Nimitz case because you have so many

2243
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:25,380
witnesses and so many sensors, and the FLIR is part of that, but you really have to look

2244
02:10:25,380 --> 02:10:26,380
at the whole case.

2245
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:31,500
You have to talk to all the pilots involved, which I've done.

2246
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:37,060
You have to talk to the radar operators on the Princeton, there's also radar operators

2247
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:41,660
on the E-2C Hawkeye, which was up there monitoring this, getting sporadic hits.

2248
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:46,260
And then you have this third F-18 that goes up and takes that video.

2249
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:49,500
So there's a lot of different information from a lot of different sources.

2250
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:52,900
And the thing is, it's all perfectly congruent.

2251
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:54,380
It all hangs together.

2252
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:59,060
Nobody's contradicting anybody else's story, and what people are seeing is what the sensors

2253
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:01,220
are reporting.

2254
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:06,100
So that case overall is really the most compelling to my mind.

2255
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:12,260
It's just such a strange occurrence when all those pieces align together like that too,

2256
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:13,260
right?

2257
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:19,180
Where you have the Nimitz, you have Commander Fravor, you have the other ship, and all this

2258
02:11:19,180 --> 02:11:26,380
information about this one thing that they track on this one day, and then they say they've

2259
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:29,420
encountered multiple ones of those over the last few weeks.

2260
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:32,700
You're talking about during the Nimitz round?

2261
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:33,700
Yeah.

2262
02:11:33,700 --> 02:11:34,700
Yes.

2263
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:39,740
They were tracking numerous objects that were moving off the coast of California and the

2264
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:41,480
coast of Mexico.

2265
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:49,680
They were descending from probably the sort of maximum detection range of the Aegis cruiser

2266
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:53,200
there, which they were seeing some of these things starting to appear in their radar at

2267
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:55,480
like 80,000 feet.

2268
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:59,520
They have a low radar cross-section, so most conventional radars couldn't even track them.

2269
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:01,940
Certainly not at any kind of distance.

2270
02:12:01,940 --> 02:12:05,400
So you don't know how high were they coming down from.

2271
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:09,000
They picked them up at 60,000, 80,000 feet, but where did they start?

2272
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:14,160
What was their initial entry point into the atmosphere if they were exo-atmospheric at

2273
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:15,320
some point?

2274
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:16,320
But we don't know that.

2275
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:21,080
But we do know that they came in very high altitudes and then were able to drop down

2276
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:27,920
to 20,000 feet in a matter of like a split second, dropped down to 50 feet when Dave

2277
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:30,440
Fravor appeared on the scene later.

2278
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:35,120
That craft was hovering at 50 feet over the ocean.

2279
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:37,440
So they had this incredible performance range.

2280
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:40,280
There seems to be unlimited time on station.

2281
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:42,240
They don't seem to be running out of fuel.

2282
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:47,080
They seem to be able to just go all day, which of course our aircraft are not able to do,

2283
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:53,680
at these insane speeds and maneuver unlike anything that we know of or understand.

2284
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:54,840
And no heat signature.

2285
02:12:54,840 --> 02:13:00,040
No heat signature, no wings, no exhaust, no air intake.

2286
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:02,320
What is its means of propulsion?

2287
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:06,600
If there's no air intake, there's no exhaust.

2288
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:11,080
There's no heat signature and they're going supersonic without making sound.

2289
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:16,280
So there's some theories about that which are not validated yet.

2290
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:22,440
There are attempts to explain that by manipulating space-time in the immediate vicinity of the

2291
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:28,680
craft that could potentially explain how the contents could survive the g-forces because

2292
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:33,440
they wouldn't be subjected to them and why it wouldn't make sound.

2293
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:35,080
Does it make a shockwave?

2294
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:37,480
Does it cross the sound barrier?

2295
02:13:37,480 --> 02:13:41,880
And lots of other factors associated with this phenomenon.

2296
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:47,480
There are some plausible explanations consistent with science as we understand it.

2297
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:52,280
But it would be really exotic technology and way beyond anything that we even have on the

2298
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:53,360
drawing boards.

2299
02:13:53,360 --> 02:14:01,760
And so by saying that it manipulates space-time, is there any theory of how something like

2300
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:04,680
that could be constructed, something that could manipulate space-time?

2301
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:05,680
Yes.

2302
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:06,680
Yes.

2303
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:08,360
There's something called an Alcubierre drive.

2304
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:12,920
And this is a physicist who developed a theory.

2305
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:16,200
It requires insane amounts of energy to do it.

2306
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:20,360
But it would enable in theory, if you could construct something, a device that could do

2307
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:26,680
that to essentially cause this object to act like it was falling.

2308
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:31,240
And so the people on board, if there were people or whatever's on board, wouldn't feel

2309
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:38,120
those radical G forces and the object would slip through the atmosphere instead of instead

2310
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:43,280
of like penetrating through the atmosphere, be more like the atmosphere was sort of in

2311
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:47,680
front of it was opening up as it as it moved along.

2312
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:54,520
Now there was a paper that I saw just a couple of weeks ago that challenges that theory.

2313
02:14:54,520 --> 02:15:01,160
So perhaps that particular theory is is no longer in good stead in the physics community.

2314
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:05,520
But there are some alternative theories along those lines.

2315
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,400
And of course, there's just so much we don't know.

2316
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:11,240
So what we do know is what we're observing.

2317
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:15,080
And that's really the key is, and that's part of the problem with this debate is we've got

2318
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:16,600
to start with the facts.

2319
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:19,560
The theories have to be consistent with the facts.

2320
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:21,840
The facts don't have to be consistent with the theory.

2321
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:24,240
So I mean, you know, we work in that direction.

2322
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:27,940
We take the facts and we try to come up with hypotheses consistent with that.

2323
02:15:28,060 --> 02:15:32,580
Too many people look at this and say, well, it can't be this and it can't be that.

2324
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:35,060
So the facts are wrong.

2325
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:36,860
You know, this is what some of the debunkers do.

2326
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:41,020
They start with the premise that it couldn't possibly be any of those things.

2327
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:44,540
So he must have been seeing a bubble on his windshield.

2328
02:15:44,540 --> 02:15:46,820
And you know, these guys were having a mass delusion.

2329
02:15:46,820 --> 02:15:51,860
And oh, by the way, the radar operators were mistaking some weather inversion.

2330
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:58,980
You know, they just keep adding on as necessary new conditions, which they have no evidence

2331
02:15:58,980 --> 02:15:59,980
or proof of.

2332
02:15:59,980 --> 02:16:04,140
None of these things have been identified by anybody.

2333
02:16:04,140 --> 02:16:07,860
None of the debunkers have said, you know, it turned out that was United Airlines flight,

2334
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:09,580
blah, blah, blah.

2335
02:16:09,580 --> 02:16:13,060
Or it was this boat or that somebody's drone.

2336
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:15,140
These things all remain unidentified.

2337
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:21,180
Well, whatever that is, the way it moves off like that in that video, in the FLIR video,

2338
02:16:22,180 --> 02:16:23,740
try explaining that.

2339
02:16:23,740 --> 02:16:24,740
Right.

2340
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:30,100
You know, Chad Underwood, I've heard him on a podcast describe that event.

2341
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:37,620
And I actually sent it around to some people because he debunks the debunkers.

2342
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:43,220
He's got thousands of hours of cockpit time, knows those systems, knows those aircraft.

2343
02:16:43,220 --> 02:16:48,020
He says, you know, that was instantaneous acceleration, no ifs, ands, or buts.

2344
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:52,580
And there's no way that was any kind of conventional aircraft out there.

2345
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:56,900
And when you hear the guy talking about firsthand about his experience, I find that generally

2346
02:16:56,900 --> 02:17:01,420
with these pilots, when you sit down with them face to face, you know, they're not

2347
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:02,420
bullshitting you.

2348
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:07,540
It's really clear they're being candid and their emotions are honest and they're befuddled

2349
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:08,720
like the rest of us.

2350
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:13,500
That propulsion system, the way you described it by manipulating space time, isn't that

2351
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:19,140
exactly what Bob Lazar said propels the spaceships that he was working on?

2352
02:17:19,140 --> 02:17:20,140
Yeah.

2353
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:21,140
Don't you think that's kind of interesting?

2354
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:22,140
I understand it.

2355
02:17:22,140 --> 02:17:23,140
I don't.

2356
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:25,660
It's been a long time since I've looked at his theory, but I think you're right.

2357
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:30,340
I think that is what he claims the propulsion system does.

2358
02:17:30,340 --> 02:17:36,500
But that wasn't really a public theory in 1989, was it?

2359
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:41,180
I don't know when the Alcubierre drive theory was published.

2360
02:17:41,180 --> 02:17:43,300
I don't know for sure.

2361
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:48,220
There were other people speculating along those lines, I believe, at that time about

2362
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:50,180
propulsion systems like that.

2363
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:57,900
And this idea of this element 115 being this incredibly dense but stable element that doesn't

2364
02:17:57,900 --> 02:18:06,260
really exist in a stable form here on Earth, that they didn't really have a real evidence

2365
02:18:06,260 --> 02:18:12,100
of this until what was like 2013 or something along those lines?

2366
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:18,500
There was something that he did raise that issue, and it wasn't until long afterward

2367
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:26,100
that scientists discovered that I guess that it is possible for it to be stable for some

2368
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:31,780
brief period of time, which I think before they thought you just couldn't bring it together.

2369
02:18:31,780 --> 02:18:36,420
But it was just detected in a particle drive for the first time in the 2000s, correct?

2370
02:18:36,420 --> 02:18:37,700
That sounds right, yeah.

2371
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:44,500
So when he talked about it in 1989, was it theoretical back then?

2372
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:48,940
I think it was purely theoretical, I don't think anyone had...

2373
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:51,820
But it was discussed theoretically, that there was an element 115.

2374
02:18:51,820 --> 02:18:52,820
I believe so.

2375
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:53,820
So it was sort of like the Higgs-Boson...

2376
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:55,580
I'm not absolutely certain about that.

2377
02:18:55,580 --> 02:18:58,900
It was sort of like the Higgs-Boson or something like that, something that they...

2378
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:02,500
A theoretical particle, theoretical idea.

2379
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:04,900
What about life forms?

2380
02:19:04,900 --> 02:19:11,300
What are your thoughts on not just drones, but alien life forms?

2381
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:18,020
Have you ever heard any compelling stories about some biological thing from another planet,

2382
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:28,540
whether it's a dead thing or a living thing, that it's been observed or that's been obtained?

2383
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:30,340
I've heard a lot of stories.

2384
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:34,820
I bet you have.

2385
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:39,100
So frustrating in this field because it's so hard to get to the bottom of these.

2386
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:45,620
And undoubtedly, many of them are not true, they're legends.

2387
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:56,580
But there are some that come from, say like a foreign military, that really make you wonder

2388
02:19:56,580 --> 02:20:01,220
why would they invent this and be claiming this?

2389
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:08,700
Maybe it's some guy off his rocker, but there are some examples like that that do get your

2390
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:13,720
attention that cause you to think maybe there's something to this.

2391
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:17,620
What has been the most interesting story that you've heard?

2392
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:27,820
There are a number, but one of them involved a foreign military that had several different

2393
02:20:27,820 --> 02:20:29,620
interactions and incidents.

2394
02:20:29,620 --> 02:20:40,300
They had some military officers that allegedly had some contact, and a very senior officer

2395
02:20:40,300 --> 02:20:46,580
allegedly, there was a location, according to this report, where a UFO was appearing

2396
02:20:46,580 --> 02:20:48,340
sort of nightly.

2397
02:20:48,340 --> 02:20:53,480
And he went out there with some of the guys, and on the second or third night, this thing

2398
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:59,720
did appear, and he had some interaction with it, supposedly, and he describes this and

2399
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:04,040
describes communications he received.

2400
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:06,880
But there's no independent corroboration of it.

2401
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:09,880
What about a body?

2402
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:16,320
I've heard the rumors like everybody else, I don't know anything about that.

2403
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:21,480
I know that people claim that they've seen those things, nothing beyond that.

2404
02:21:22,480 --> 02:21:23,480
Imagine.

2405
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:26,840
Come here, man, I want to show you something.

2406
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:29,480
You know the story about Nixon and Jackie Gleason?

2407
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:31,480
I do, yeah.

2408
02:21:31,480 --> 02:21:32,480
That's a great one, isn't it?

2409
02:21:32,480 --> 02:21:35,480
Yeah, there are other stories like that.

2410
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:36,480
Tell me about the story.

2411
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:42,560
Well, as I recall, you probably know it better than I do, but as I recall, Nixon confided

2412
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:48,440
in Gleason that, yes, indeed, we have aliens, and he arranged for Jackie Gleason to actually

2413
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:52,440
go to a facility and see this body or something.

2414
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:54,080
I think it was actually a craft.

2415
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:57,920
A craft, okay, you know the story better than I do, why don't you go ahead.

2416
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:04,840
And then Jackie Gleason actually built a house that was shaped like a UFO, and I think the

2417
02:22:04,840 --> 02:22:06,600
house was for sale at one point in time.

2418
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:09,120
Do you remember that house, Jamie?

2419
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:13,880
We found it online, and you look at it, you go, holy shit, he built a UFO house.

2420
02:22:13,880 --> 02:22:15,960
Was that in Palm West, Palm Desert?

2421
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:16,960
I do not remember.

2422
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:17,960
Okay.

2423
02:22:18,480 --> 02:22:19,480
We'll find out shortly.

2424
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:25,200
But this house at one point in time at least was for sale, and my wife would never let

2425
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:31,000
me buy something like this, but if I was a single man and I was young and stupid, which

2426
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:36,360
I used to be, I would have bought the shit out of that fucking house to have Jackie Gleason's

2427
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:37,360
UFO house.

2428
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:38,360
That's it.

2429
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:39,360
Oh, is that it?

2430
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:40,360
Yeah.

2431
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:41,360
Okay.

2432
02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:42,360
That's not what I was thinking of.

2433
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:46,760
Yeah, he built a house that looked like a UFO inside of it.

2434
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:49,080
Unfortunately, he was obsessed, and I'm obsessed with Jackie Gleason.

2435
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:51,680
I'm a giant Jackie Gleason fan.

2436
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:52,680
Where was this thing?

2437
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:54,880
It was in New York, I think.

2438
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:55,880
Yeah.

2439
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:56,880
Westchester County.

2440
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:57,880
Yeah.

2441
02:22:57,880 --> 02:22:58,880
12 million bucks.

2442
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:01,840
I think that's a property that still would work today.

2443
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:02,840
Recently for sale.

2444
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:03,840
Yeah.

2445
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:04,840
12 million.

2446
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:05,840
How long ago was this?

2447
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:06,840
2018.

2448
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:07,840
No shit.

2449
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:08,840
Damn.

2450
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:12,800
I do not want to live in New York, but if I did, he built that in 1959, is that what

2451
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:13,800
it said?

2452
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:14,800
Mm-hmm.

2453
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:15,800
59.

2454
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:16,840
That's the president.

2455
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:17,840
Look at the neighbors.

2456
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:19,720
I wonder what they're thinking about that.

2457
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:21,720
Maybe he added them to it.

2458
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:22,720
Let me see.

2459
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:23,720
Maybe.

2460
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:24,720
They're horrified.

2461
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:25,720
Maybe they just fucking pumped and lived near Jackie Gleason.

2462
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:26,720
Well, yeah.

2463
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,720
When he was there, I'm sure.

2464
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:34,320
It was a wild ass house, but the fact that he built a wooden house that reminded him

2465
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:36,760
supposedly of this UFO, I mean, who knows?

2466
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:39,720
I mean, it could have been an architect who said, hey, I got an idea.

2467
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:42,800
There's a story like that about Spielberg, have you heard that?

2468
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:43,800
No.

2469
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:51,640
I think Ronald Reagan, and it was one of his iconic Alien movies, and Reagan sort of

2470
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:55,600
quipped to him something like, yeah, it's really true, or we really have those things,

2471
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:56,600
or something like that.

2472
02:23:56,600 --> 02:24:03,400
It's one of these legendary conversations, but maybe in the circles you move in, you

2473
02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:05,400
could find out.

2474
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:06,400
I don't know, dude.

2475
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,400
I don't know if they trust me.

2476
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:11,200
Did somebody bought this house in 1976 for 150 grand?

2477
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:12,200
Wow.

2478
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:13,200
That seems crazy.

2479
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:14,600
No, I don't know.

2480
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:15,600
That seems crazy.

2481
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:16,600
Well, what was 150 grand in 1976, though?

2482
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:18,600
It was probably worth a lot of money.

2483
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:21,200
100 grand, that was probably close to a million, right?

2484
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:22,200
Still.

2485
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:23,200
I know, still.

2486
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:24,200
A house that's that dope.

2487
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:28,200
That used to be Jackie Gleason's house.

2488
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,200
Yeah.

2489
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:31,120
Yeah, I agree.

2490
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:32,880
His comedy probably would translate today.

2491
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:37,120
The Honeymooners, that's probably one of the most, if you watched that show today, it's

2492
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:38,120
still very funny.

2493
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:39,120
I would love for my kids to see that.

2494
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:40,120
Yeah.

2495
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:41,120
I think it would still work for them.

2496
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:47,400
He's also probably the very best pool player, celebrity pool player of all time.

2497
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:51,400
That's why they used him in The Hustler with Paul Newman.

2498
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:54,080
He was a legitimate top flight pool player.

2499
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:55,080
Yeah.

2500
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:56,080
Spent a lot of time.

2501
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:57,080
Brilliant guy.

2502
02:24:57,080 --> 02:24:58,080
Yeah.

2503
02:24:58,080 --> 02:24:59,080
Brilliant guy.

2504
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:00,080
Interesting.

2505
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:01,080
Yeah.

2506
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:02,080
Just like to get drunk.

2507
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:03,080
And funny as hell.

2508
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:04,080
Yeah.

2509
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:05,080
And was always drunk.

2510
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:06,080
Oh, is that right?

2511
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:07,080
Oh, yeah.

2512
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:08,080
That was his whole thing, man.

2513
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:09,080
He loved getting hammered.

2514
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:10,080
He was hammered all the time.

2515
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:14,680
He was a big boulder on a golf course and he's got this crazy souped up golf cart with a

2516
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:15,680
bar in it.

2517
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:16,680
You know?

2518
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:17,680
He's out there golfing and drinking.

2519
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:18,680
Living the big life.

2520
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:19,680
Yeah.

2521
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:20,680
Living large.

2522
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:21,680
Yeah.

2523
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:22,680
He was a character.

2524
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:23,680
Yeah.

2525
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:24,680
Here's the story about Jack Gleason.

2526
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:25,680
Okay, there it is.

2527
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:30,000
Legend has it that Nixon and Gleason drove to a heavily guarded building on Homestead

2528
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:34,400
Air Force Base where the leader of the free world gave the guy who played the bus driver

2529
02:25:34,400 --> 02:25:37,240
from Bensonhurst a private tour.

2530
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:43,960
We drove to the very far end of the base in a regulated and segregated area, finally stopping

2531
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:50,280
near a well guarded building, Gleason told UFO researcher and author Larry Warren, an

2532
02:25:50,280 --> 02:25:58,400
eyewitness to the Rendlesham Forest UFO incident, according to the book, UFOs Among the Stars

2533
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:00,480
by Timothy Green Beckley.

2534
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:05,620
The security police saw us coming and just sort of moved back as we passed them and entered

2535
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:06,720
the structure.

2536
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:09,520
There were a number of labs we passed through.

2537
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:14,200
First before we entered a section where Nixon pointed out what he said was the wreckage

2538
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:18,560
from a flying saucer enclosed in several large cases.

2539
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:24,960
Next, we went to an inner chamber and there were six or eight of what looked like glass

2540
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:27,720
topped coke freezers.

2541
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:32,320
Inside them were the mangled remains of what I took to be children.

2542
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:38,240
Upon closer examination, I saw that some of the other figures looked quite old.

2543
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:42,800
Most of them were terribly mangled as if they had been in an accident.

2544
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:48,000
Jackie Gleason's wife Beverly Gleason told the same story to the magazine Esquire in

2545
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,000
1974.

2546
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,400
It was passed off as a publicity story for her then upcoming autobiography.

2547
02:26:53,400 --> 02:26:58,120
Talks about the house he made, which was somewhere else maybe, I don't know.

2548
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:03,160
It says Gleason's 50 foot wide mothership house was custom made by shipbuilders in an

2549
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:05,960
airplane hangar and moved to Gleason's property.

2550
02:27:05,960 --> 02:27:08,280
The structure has no right angles.

2551
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:18,840
Van Tassel's Integra-tron was built in the Mojave Desert because of its proximity to

2552
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:22,400
the magnetic vortices and the relationship to the Great Pyramids of Egypt.

2553
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:23,880
Okay, you lost me there.

2554
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:24,880
Getting nutty.

2555
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:25,880
They always get nutty.

2556
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:26,880
Right?

2557
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:27,880
That's the thing about UFO stuff.

2558
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:30,640
The problems with this issue, it just goes off the deep end so fast.

2559
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:31,640
Always, right?

2560
02:27:31,640 --> 02:27:32,640
Always.

2561
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:37,760
I have tried to keep it on national security and nuts and bolts stuff, stay away from the

2562
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:38,760
paranormal stuff.

2563
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:39,760
It's hard.

2564
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:40,760
You know, it is hard.

2565
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:41,760
Yeah.

2566
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:42,760
Because it goes there fast.

2567
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:46,200
Yeah, a lot of the people that believe in ... That was one of the things that Terrence

2568
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:48,120
McKenna had said about UFOs.

2569
02:27:48,120 --> 02:27:50,400
It's not whether or not UFOs are real.

2570
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:54,720
When you talk to someone and they believe in UFOs, ask them what they think about psychics.

2571
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:57,480
Ask them what they think about ghosts.

2572
02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:00,720
And then you get these ... And you go, oh, you're into weird shit.

2573
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:01,840
You're into things.

2574
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:02,840
You're into the unknown.

2575
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:07,760
Because the unknown is very compelling, and that's part of the problem is there's, again,

2576
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:10,960
this part of the brain that lights up when you can find out things that we don't know

2577
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:14,600
to be true, whether it's Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster or UFOs.

2578
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:19,560
Yeah, a lot of people are drawn to this, and again, it's like religion.

2579
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:20,560
It's the mystery.

2580
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:21,560
It's the wonder.

2581
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:25,740
It's the connection to something greater.

2582
02:28:25,740 --> 02:28:31,900
There are people that are ... In the intelligence community, there was this remote viewing program,

2583
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:34,900
and some of those people are also people who are interested in this phenomenon and were

2584
02:28:34,900 --> 02:28:35,900
involved in it.

2585
02:28:35,900 --> 02:28:38,660
What's your take on that remote viewing stuff?

2586
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:46,020
Well, they seem to have some individuals, they claim, who could perform better than

2587
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:50,080
chance and could do so consistently.

2588
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:53,860
Some of their research has been disputed.

2589
02:28:53,860 --> 02:29:00,620
So I don't have a strong feeling, but I do know that some people have had some legitimately

2590
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:03,140
crazy experiences.

2591
02:29:03,140 --> 02:29:07,820
The Skinwalker Ranch, there's some strange stuff being documented around there.

2592
02:29:07,820 --> 02:29:14,340
There was strange stuff documented by Bob Bigelow before the present owner had it.

2593
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:20,220
If you read the book Paranormal, you'll hear about incidents that I have discussed with

2594
02:29:20,460 --> 02:29:26,860
some of the protagonists in that book, and it's crazy stuff.

2595
02:29:26,860 --> 02:29:27,860
Look you right in the eye.

2596
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:33,380
There are people with PhDs, and they'll say, yeah, this guy came in the room, and we said,

2597
02:29:33,380 --> 02:29:34,380
what are you doing in here?

2598
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:43,100
Because it's a classified facility, and the guy, big guy with one arm missing in a hook

2599
02:29:43,100 --> 02:29:48,180
or something, and he wheels, turns around, goes out.

2600
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:51,100
The guy who's telling the story runs up and grabs the door and opens it.

2601
02:29:51,100 --> 02:29:53,420
There's nobody in the hallway.

2602
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:59,900
This figure looks exactly like supposedly the figure that someone had seen over their

2603
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:06,460
bed the night before DOE with this one-armed guy spinning around, and you say, well, this

2604
02:30:06,460 --> 02:30:07,460
is insane.

2605
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:08,460
This is nuts.

2606
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:14,820
These are all sober DOE people who are telling stories like this and other scientists.

2607
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:18,380
So it's really crazy.

2608
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:19,380
It's wild.

2609
02:30:19,380 --> 02:30:20,380
It's curious.

2610
02:30:20,380 --> 02:30:21,540
It's intriguing.

2611
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:27,700
Some of these people have advanced degrees, and they tell far out stories about some of

2612
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:28,700
this stuff.

2613
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:31,760
What about tangible things like metallurgy?

2614
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:41,100
What about samples of metal, like samples of various types of metals and combinations

2615
02:30:41,100 --> 02:30:42,100
of metals?

2616
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:43,100
Yeah.

2617
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:46,380
Back to physical science, where we can get grounded and test something.

2618
02:30:46,380 --> 02:30:48,380
Yeah, there's a one-arm spinning guy, so I'm like, check, please.

2619
02:30:48,380 --> 02:30:49,380
Yeah, that's right.

2620
02:30:49,380 --> 02:30:50,380
I understand.

2621
02:30:50,380 --> 02:30:51,380
I get it.

2622
02:30:51,380 --> 02:30:52,380
I felt the same way.

2623
02:30:52,380 --> 02:30:55,780
But actually, it's funny you should mention that, because there's a private researcher

2624
02:30:55,780 --> 02:31:01,500
who you've had on the show, Dr. Jacques Vallee, who has some materials, and I think he is

2625
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:08,180
on the verge of ... He's going through the peer review process and treating it like you

2626
02:31:08,180 --> 02:31:12,740
would any other scientific issue, and I think he's going to be publishing in a peer review

2627
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:15,660
journal some interesting data before too long.

2628
02:31:15,660 --> 02:31:19,460
I think he's been working on that for a long time.

2629
02:31:19,460 --> 02:31:24,700
There are some examples like that that are serious and credible, and some of the materials

2630
02:31:24,700 --> 02:31:31,460
seem to have properties that are difficult to explain that suggest that maybe they were

2631
02:31:31,460 --> 02:31:38,580
engineered not at the molecular level, but at the atomic level, which would be extremely

2632
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:42,260
difficult and expensive to try to replicate.

2633
02:31:42,900 --> 02:31:47,060
He was saying that some of these samples, if you were to recreate them with the technology

2634
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:51,820
that's available today, it would cost billions of dollars, which is insane.

2635
02:31:51,820 --> 02:31:52,820
Exactly.

2636
02:31:52,820 --> 02:31:58,300
Obviously, nobody was doing that here, so where did it come from?

2637
02:31:58,300 --> 02:32:06,100
There's also a discussion that the isotopic ratios of these materials, in some cases,

2638
02:32:06,100 --> 02:32:11,340
are sufficiently statistically different from what is found in nature in our solar

2639
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:18,220
system that it suggests they were born in a different sun, a different star, and all

2640
02:32:18,220 --> 02:32:25,300
the heavier elements are created in these solar explosions and supernovae that cram

2641
02:32:25,300 --> 02:32:33,740
and fuse these protons and neutrons and electrons together and create the heavier elements.

2642
02:32:33,740 --> 02:32:39,100
If they were in our solar system, they all came from one event, and so iron, wherever

2643
02:32:39,100 --> 02:32:44,740
it is in our solar system, will have a certain ratio of isotopes that have a few that have

2644
02:32:44,740 --> 02:32:50,580
an extra neutron or one more or one less kind of thing, so there's sort of a fingerprint

2645
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:51,580
with that.

2646
02:32:51,580 --> 02:32:58,460
Supposedly, as I understand it, some of these materials have a different ratio than you

2647
02:32:58,460 --> 02:33:02,700
would expect of metal found in our solar system.

2648
02:33:02,700 --> 02:33:07,380
At least, that's one of the things they're looking for and testing for.

2649
02:33:07,380 --> 02:33:11,580
These composites, how do they refer to these composites?

2650
02:33:11,580 --> 02:33:17,380
When they talk about the way these things are constructed, do they have a name for this

2651
02:33:17,380 --> 02:33:19,100
type of a composite?

2652
02:33:19,100 --> 02:33:27,860
Well, I'm not sure they're all composites, but I've seen some of these materials, and

2653
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:32,540
some of them look like they're layered, like they're micro-machined to a millionth of an

2654
02:33:32,540 --> 02:33:39,140
inch or a few hundreds of an inch or something, layered on top of one another with fairly

2655
02:33:39,140 --> 02:33:45,220
exotic metals, bismuth and other things that people aren't normally using.

2656
02:33:45,220 --> 02:33:46,220
There it is.

2657
02:33:46,220 --> 02:33:47,220
Yeah, there's one.

2658
02:33:47,220 --> 02:33:50,660
Alleged extraterrestrial material from the bottom of a wedge-shaped craft in the late

2659
02:33:50,660 --> 02:33:51,660
1940s.

2660
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:55,940
So, this is from Roswell, supposedly, or some other craft?

2661
02:33:56,020 --> 02:34:01,460
That's one theory, so I think the story behind this is, if I'm not mistaken, is that somebody

2662
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:07,580
got this from their father, who claimed he was at the site recovering material.

2663
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:10,940
So he gave it to the guy, and this guy turned it over to a researcher.

2664
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:11,940
That's the story I've heard.

2665
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:20,820
It says it's made from 26 alternating layers, 1 to 4 microns dark bismuth, and 100 to 200

2666
02:34:20,820 --> 02:34:27,060
microns silver magnesium-zinc alloy, each of six pieces received from U.S. Army source

2667
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:31,140
were formed with a curvature that tapered.

2668
02:34:31,140 --> 02:34:32,140
Huh.

2669
02:34:32,140 --> 02:34:34,660
Yeah, pretty curious stuff.

2670
02:34:34,660 --> 02:34:41,240
As far as I know, nobody has identified a conventional source for that material or use

2671
02:34:41,240 --> 02:34:42,500
of it.

2672
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:49,640
So it's not like an alloy, it's a very intricate process, and what would be the benefit?

2673
02:34:49,640 --> 02:34:53,920
Is there a theory on what the benefit of making things in so many layers would be?

2674
02:34:53,920 --> 02:35:06,600
Well, supposedly, one theory about that material is that it is a waveguide for microwave radiation.

2675
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:14,840
So it can actually enhance microwave emissions, they could go right through the material,

2676
02:35:14,840 --> 02:35:22,360
And if you were building a craft that was wanting to transmit or receive microwave

2677
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:27,040
radiation for some purpose, propulsion or otherwise, a material like that might help

2678
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:29,420
you accomplish that.

2679
02:35:29,420 --> 02:35:30,640
That's one theory I've heard.

2680
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:34,760
So the material might help accomplish this bizarre propulsion system that we totally

2681
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:35,760
don't understand.

2682
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:42,480
You could have a craft maybe that was also, the shell of the craft was also an antenna,

2683
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:50,360
or was propagating radiation from the inside more efficiently.

2684
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:55,600
I don't know a lot about it, but that's one of the explanations that I've heard.

2685
02:35:55,600 --> 02:35:58,200
Have you physically seen any of these scraps of metal?

2686
02:35:58,200 --> 02:35:59,200
Yes, I have.

2687
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:02,160
What did it look like to you when you looked at it?

2688
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:08,780
Curious and odd, it was silverish, and people were looking at it trying to think whether

2689
02:36:08,780 --> 02:36:17,460
it could be from some known component to some aircraft or ship or something, and nobody

2690
02:36:17,460 --> 02:36:24,260
has identified a conventional industrial counterpart to it, something that was manufactured to

2691
02:36:24,260 --> 02:36:28,300
those specifications for some reason, as far as I know.

2692
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:32,060
So it was lightweight, it was peculiar.

2693
02:36:32,060 --> 02:36:33,940
You touch it in your hands?

2694
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:37,140
I'm trying to remember if I touched that or not.

2695
02:36:37,140 --> 02:36:41,300
I think we had it right on the table, so I probably did.

2696
02:36:41,300 --> 02:36:44,180
When you say we, who?

2697
02:36:44,180 --> 02:36:55,580
Well, to the stars, there was an effort to have some of these materials tested and exploited,

2698
02:36:55,580 --> 02:37:00,220
and we were purchasing, the company, not me, but the company was purchasing some of the

2699
02:37:00,220 --> 02:37:03,420
materials to try to facilitate that.

2700
02:37:03,500 --> 02:37:07,060
So who was in possession of these materials that you could purchase them from?

2701
02:37:07,060 --> 02:37:10,900
In some cases, I don't know about that piece.

2702
02:37:10,900 --> 02:37:14,060
There were some people in the field who had been collectors or researchers and had some

2703
02:37:14,060 --> 02:37:21,980
material just the way Jacques has probably got materials from 15 or 20 different materials,

2704
02:37:21,980 --> 02:37:24,660
pieces from different alleged incidents.

2705
02:37:24,660 --> 02:37:32,540
One was an explosion of an object in Brazil, for example.

2706
02:37:32,540 --> 02:37:37,620
So there are some items out on the market that they're around, not many, but there are

2707
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:38,820
a few.

2708
02:37:38,820 --> 02:37:43,900
When you saw this stuff, was that the most compelling piece of evidence that you had

2709
02:37:43,900 --> 02:37:45,260
ever seen?

2710
02:37:45,260 --> 02:37:50,220
No, I'm actually very agnostic about that.

2711
02:37:50,220 --> 02:37:53,500
I think I haven't seen any test results.

2712
02:37:53,500 --> 02:37:59,420
I'm completely agnostic as to whether it's something that was produced on Earth for some

2713
02:37:59,420 --> 02:38:04,260
obscure reason or whether it's something more exotic.

2714
02:38:04,260 --> 02:38:07,100
I'm not particularly impressed by that.

2715
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:11,660
What impresses me most, I think if I could point to one thing, it would be the Nimitz

2716
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:12,660
case.

2717
02:38:12,660 --> 02:38:13,660
Really?

2718
02:38:13,660 --> 02:38:26,260
Yeah, there's just, yeah, that would be, there's some other stuff that is interesting and impressive

2719
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:33,540
not yet available, but in terms of the stuff we can talk about, I would say that's the

2720
02:38:33,540 --> 02:38:35,820
single most compelling thing.

2721
02:38:35,820 --> 02:38:44,140
Now what can be done in terms of with the government, what can be done to study this

2722
02:38:44,140 --> 02:38:46,260
stuff more carefully?

2723
02:38:46,260 --> 02:38:50,740
Does a whole new department need to be developed?

2724
02:38:51,220 --> 02:38:57,220
All these pieces of evidence, the Nimitz case, the GoFast video, the Gimbal video, all the

2725
02:38:57,220 --> 02:39:01,780
stuff we're talking about, do you think this merits enough attention?

2726
02:39:01,780 --> 02:39:08,060
Does this give enough people curiosity to the point where you could see the government

2727
02:39:08,060 --> 02:39:12,820
investing a considerable amount of capital and resources to studying this stuff on a

2728
02:39:12,820 --> 02:39:14,540
much deeper level?

2729
02:39:14,540 --> 02:39:16,220
I do.

2730
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:23,940
I think advanced propulsion, this suggests there may be some new avenues that, because

2731
02:39:23,940 --> 02:39:27,420
there's proof of principle, we're seeing something doing this, it can be done.

2732
02:39:27,420 --> 02:39:32,300
And there's some theories, as I mentioned, like the Alcubierre Drive and others, probably

2733
02:39:32,300 --> 02:39:36,580
ought to be putting some money on those, investigating them, looking at them.

2734
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:39,900
I do think there needs to be some organizational home for this.

2735
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:45,900
There needs to be an advocate, somebody who is monitoring this and fighting for some money

2736
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:51,380
for it in the budget, doesn't need a huge amount, somebody to send the reports to.

2737
02:39:51,380 --> 02:39:56,060
People right now, they've temporarily got this task force that was established, but

2738
02:39:56,060 --> 02:40:01,900
when that goes away, if there's not some enduring entity left behind, where does all this stuff

2739
02:40:01,900 --> 02:40:02,900
go?

2740
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:03,900
And does anybody care about it?

2741
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:10,480
Or do we go back to the status quo ante, where it just falls on the floor and nobody cares?

2742
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:14,100
So I think we're getting to the point, I hope we're getting to the point where people are

2743
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:16,780
saying, yeah, we can learn a lot from anomalies.

2744
02:40:16,780 --> 02:40:22,260
In science, that's one of the ways breakthroughs most often occur, right, is some anomaly that

2745
02:40:22,260 --> 02:40:28,140
is baffling, like the procession of Mercury in Einstein, and Newton's theories couldn't

2746
02:40:28,140 --> 02:40:29,140
explain that.

2747
02:40:29,140 --> 02:40:30,140
It's this weird outlier.

2748
02:40:30,140 --> 02:40:34,700
And then he came along with general relativity, perfectly explained it, bingo.

2749
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:39,900
There's some strange anomalies going on here in our atmosphere, worth our attention.

2750
02:40:39,900 --> 02:40:43,220
And yes, we ought to be studying it, and there ought to be a centralized place where this

2751
02:40:43,220 --> 02:40:48,580
stuff comes together, and maybe a federal lab kind of a thing.

2752
02:40:48,580 --> 02:40:53,220
I'm not an advocate of big new organizational structures and throwing billions of dollars

2753
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:54,220
at things.

2754
02:40:54,220 --> 02:40:59,220
I don't think you need to, but I think we could more effectively coordinate space-related

2755
02:40:59,220 --> 02:41:03,800
research, for example, in R&D than we do today.

2756
02:41:03,800 --> 02:41:08,100
So we have DOE labs for nuclear energy and nuclear power.

2757
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:14,380
We don't have something like that that universities and NASA and the military can work with on

2758
02:41:14,380 --> 02:41:16,040
the space side.

2759
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:20,660
So something like that that was flexible, that would give people a chance to partner

2760
02:41:20,660 --> 02:41:28,860
from different backgrounds and academia and so forth with the government is probably something

2761
02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:31,860
that we could benefit from.

2762
02:41:31,860 --> 02:41:33,940
Is this something that's plausible?

2763
02:41:33,980 --> 02:41:40,500
Is there enough interest in the government currently to do something like this, to make

2764
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:41,500
some new department?

2765
02:41:41,500 --> 02:41:43,500
I mean, could it be justified, particularly?

2766
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:44,500
Not a new department.

2767
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:48,580
No, not like the new Department of Energy or Agriculture, not a whole new department.

2768
02:41:48,580 --> 02:41:52,300
No, this would be within existing entities.

2769
02:41:52,300 --> 02:41:54,620
Which entity, you think?

2770
02:41:54,620 --> 02:41:57,280
Probably DOD.

2771
02:41:57,280 --> 02:42:02,680
There's already so much capability and authority and responsibility there, and there are some

2772
02:42:02,680 --> 02:42:07,680
people in the community that are standing up, actually, saying they want to be involved.

2773
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:13,360
There are some people in the military, the Defense Department, that would like to get

2774
02:42:13,360 --> 02:42:15,080
involved in researching this.

2775
02:42:15,080 --> 02:42:17,680
How many people would have to be involved to do it correctly?

2776
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:19,600
How many people do you think would have to be involved?

2777
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:23,480
Say if they put it on you, they said, listen, nobody knows more about this stuff than you

2778
02:42:23,480 --> 02:42:24,480
do.

2779
02:42:24,480 --> 02:42:28,240
How do you go about doing this, and how many people would need to be involved, and where

2780
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:31,120
do you start, and how do you observe these things?

2781
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:35,160
Could we be doing something to maybe observe more of them?

2782
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:36,160
Absolutely.

2783
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:37,160
Yeah.

2784
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:39,240
What could we be doing to observe more of them?

2785
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:43,200
Yeah, there's a lot we could do, and I don't have a precise number for people, but I could

2786
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:47,640
tell you some of the things I'd be thinking about wanting to scope to drive a number.

2787
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:53,060
One of the things we haven't done yet is go into these existing databases from these incredible

2788
02:42:53,060 --> 02:42:58,360
collection systems like the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System.

2789
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:03,860
If they've seen UFOs, they're not reporting it, but their systems are optimized to look

2790
02:43:03,860 --> 02:43:08,160
for very specific kinds of things like an ICBM, and they want to reduce clutter, so

2791
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:11,320
the other stuff is not displayed to the operator.

2792
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:14,520
People in the Ops Center don't even see it, but it's in the database.

2793
02:43:14,520 --> 02:43:19,300
There's a lot of databases like that where if we just pulled the data and had some contractors

2794
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:23,540
run it, we might find some really interesting signatures and patterns, which would then

2795
02:43:23,540 --> 02:43:28,040
help us get a handle on the phenomenon and where we ought to be looking going forward.

2796
02:43:28,040 --> 02:43:32,760
That would take some money to get some contractors to do that under a number of different systems

2797
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:38,160
that I would want to do that on, the Space-Based Infrared System, the Global Acoustic Monitoring

2798
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:40,200
System, some other systems.

2799
02:43:40,200 --> 02:43:44,720
Global Acoustic Monitoring System, that would be, what would that be doing?

2800
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:52,960
So that is listening for low frequency vibrations in the atmosphere, and it was built and designed

2801
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:55,840
to detect nuclear weapons tests.

2802
02:43:55,840 --> 02:44:01,640
And I understand that it also detects meteors and bolides, and I've heard rumors that it

2803
02:44:01,640 --> 02:44:04,840
detects other things that they haven't been able to explain.

2804
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:08,120
I haven't been able to get anybody to take a look at that yet.

2805
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:11,360
I've suggested that to various people in the government.

2806
02:44:11,360 --> 02:44:13,800
You might want to go talk to those guys and look at that database.

2807
02:44:13,800 --> 02:44:19,280
I don't think anybody has, but there's a lot of systems like that that are incredible.

2808
02:44:19,280 --> 02:44:25,080
We have the public, you know, look at the moving X-Band radar, if you could bring that

2809
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:33,400
up, the sea-based X-Band radar, or the DARPA Space Telescope.

2810
02:44:33,400 --> 02:44:37,400
There's the DoD space fence.

2811
02:44:37,400 --> 02:44:39,560
There's amazing capabilities out there.

2812
02:44:39,560 --> 02:44:43,000
We're not even, you know, mining that data.

2813
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:50,080
Do we know, has anybody ever said that these things make a sound?

2814
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:57,240
People have said they've heard humming sounds at close range, that kind of thing, but never

2815
02:44:57,240 --> 02:45:05,040
a sonic boom, and occasionally, sometimes it's like a swooshing sound.

2816
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:09,760
I would say that the sort of hum or vibration, like a transformer, a number of people who

2817
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:13,680
have been close to these things have said it's made a sound like that, like a transformer.

2818
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:15,600
Did Bablazar ever say that it made a sound?

2819
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:16,600
I don't know.

2820
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:17,600
I don't know.

2821
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:21,120
I've not had that discussion with him.

2822
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:26,640
So that would be how you would use...

2823
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:29,440
In this case, actually, it's the movement through the atmosphere.

2824
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:34,360
It's not like the transformer noise, it's just the size and velocity in the air that's

2825
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:39,560
displaced creates this wave in the atmosphere as it ripples through the air.

2826
02:45:40,400 --> 02:45:47,440
Because of this unusual propulsion system that we theorize they have, that they might

2827
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:48,600
not make that kind of wave.

2828
02:45:48,600 --> 02:45:49,600
Yeah.

2829
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:50,600
Might not make any sound at all.

2830
02:45:50,600 --> 02:45:51,600
You're right.

2831
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:52,600
You're right.

2832
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:53,600
They might find nothing there.

2833
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:56,120
It's a good possibility, but my thought is we've paid for this stuff already.

2834
02:45:56,120 --> 02:45:57,120
Why don't we look?

2835
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,120
We've got the data.

2836
02:45:58,120 --> 02:45:59,600
You know, let's take a look.

2837
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:04,560
And these different databases, and then you might find, ah, this system and this system

2838
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:07,000
are showing us some really weird stuff.

2839
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:11,400
We see things in orbit, and they're coming out of orbit, and they're going back to orbit,

2840
02:46:11,400 --> 02:46:12,400
and we don't know what they are.

2841
02:46:12,400 --> 02:46:14,200
We have to focus on that.

2842
02:46:14,200 --> 02:46:16,720
That's really interesting.

2843
02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:23,520
We could probably plausibly spend a reasonable amount of money and make a lot of headway

2844
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:27,480
in trying to identify what are the signatures that these things give off that we can then

2845
02:46:27,480 --> 02:46:34,480
begin to track with this huge system that we have that's global and in outer space.

2846
02:46:34,480 --> 02:46:38,960
Then I would want to spend some money on propulsion, and probably have some money.

2847
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:44,520
You'd need some money for testing some theories.

2848
02:46:44,520 --> 02:46:48,720
The nuclear weapons issue that you mentioned, monitoring our nuclear weapons, if that's

2849
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:56,440
going on, and there are a lot of reports, supposedly in 1973, it's a story I just heard

2850
02:46:56,440 --> 02:47:04,280
the other day from a foreign correspondent, during the 73 war when we went to DEFCON 2,

2851
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:10,840
in Australia, a UFO appeared over a Davy communication system for submarine-launched

2852
02:47:10,840 --> 02:47:17,320
ballistic missiles and just hovered for about a half an hour, again, unverified, but this

2853
02:47:17,320 --> 02:47:18,320
is the story.

2854
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:25,300
Well, if that kind of thing has any plausibility in these reports about interfering with RSABMs,

2855
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:29,120
you might set up a collection event when you know we're going to be moving some things

2856
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:32,080
because it's a pre-planned exercise or something.

2857
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:36,840
Maybe you keep an eye out and set some special collection up just in case something does

2858
02:47:36,840 --> 02:47:39,040
get triggered by that or happens.

2859
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:43,600
That would be pertinent to the Chinese and Russians as well.

2860
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:48,880
That would be nothing that would be higher on their collection list than trying to understand

2861
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:53,240
any kind of new technology we had having to do with nuclear weapons.

2862
02:47:53,240 --> 02:47:59,200
So you might learn something, again, not saying it's aliens, it would be worth doing.

2863
02:47:59,200 --> 02:48:05,360
Do we know anything about the way China or Russia views these things?

2864
02:48:05,360 --> 02:48:07,200
Not much.

2865
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:12,620
Both countries have active UFO groups and the government seems to be connected to both

2866
02:48:12,620 --> 02:48:19,360
of them and allowing them to exist and maybe encouraging them, probably getting some intelligence

2867
02:48:19,360 --> 02:48:20,360
from them.

2868
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:24,800
They read our papers and they may well listen to this podcast, for example.

2869
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:27,320
They've got some people trying to figure out what's going on with the Americas.

2870
02:48:27,320 --> 02:48:30,760
Have they really got this technology or is this from somewhere else?

2871
02:48:30,760 --> 02:48:36,480
At least that's part of what appears to be happening, but they certainly have had their

2872
02:48:36,480 --> 02:48:41,320
own incidents over the years.

2873
02:48:41,320 --> 02:48:45,880
We've been told about that and one of the famous incidents that we had actually during

2874
02:48:45,880 --> 02:48:51,680
Blue Book occurred in Russia and it was a U.S. senator who was visiting Russia and he

2875
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:58,840
some of the staff while they were in Russia, it was one of the senators, it was a majority

2876
02:48:58,840 --> 02:49:05,680
leader or speaker of the House, very prominent U.S. politician who was on a rare Cold War

2877
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:11,360
visit to the Soviet Union and saw this flying saucer from the train he was on and other

2878
02:49:11,360 --> 02:49:13,120
people there saw it.

2879
02:49:13,120 --> 02:49:15,960
That was one that went into the Blue Book files.

2880
02:49:15,960 --> 02:49:19,840
So they certainly have had incidents as well.

2881
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:27,320
So is there another country that has a strong interest in UFOs besides China and Russia

2882
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:28,920
that we're aware of?

2883
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:29,920
Yes.

2884
02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:36,680
France has had an official UFO investigative group for probably decades and small office,

2885
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:41,240
small budget, but they every year take say the top six cases from the police and the

2886
02:49:41,240 --> 02:49:47,200
military and analyze them and bring in some scientists and engineers and see what they

2887
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:49,820
can make of that.

2888
02:49:49,820 --> 02:49:52,740
So they've been doing that for a long time and there have been years where they've had

2889
02:49:52,740 --> 02:49:55,780
more UFO reports at least per capita than we have.

2890
02:49:55,780 --> 02:49:56,780
Really?

2891
02:49:56,780 --> 02:49:57,780
Yeah.

2892
02:49:57,780 --> 02:49:59,760
This is very much a global phenomenon.

2893
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:04,700
So they've been having these experiences for a long time since the 40s or 50s.

2894
02:50:04,700 --> 02:50:06,580
And they have a more open-minded approach to it?

2895
02:50:06,580 --> 02:50:07,580
They do.

2896
02:50:07,580 --> 02:50:12,660
I would say the stigma that we have doesn't exist at least to that degree over there.

2897
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:20,500
Their more objective, scientific, their UFO groups tend to be less fantastical and more

2898
02:50:20,500 --> 02:50:26,800
sort of focused on science, seems to be quite a bit of a different attitude and approach

2899
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:27,800
over there.

2900
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:34,060
So if the president had listened to this podcast and took an interest in this and wanted to

2901
02:50:34,060 --> 02:50:39,060
have a conversation with you, what do you think you would tell him?

2902
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:40,060
I would tell him.

2903
02:50:40,060 --> 02:50:41,060
What could I do?

2904
02:50:41,380 --> 02:50:46,020
How to get the answers to the key questions and get to the bottom line and the truth.

2905
02:50:46,020 --> 02:50:52,460
Who you need to talk to, who you need to get on the carpet and put it to.

2906
02:50:52,460 --> 02:50:55,200
And you can really get to the bottom of this thing.

2907
02:50:55,200 --> 02:51:00,540
And you think that we could make some progress in that direction if we took the right steps?

2908
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:05,980
I think certainly if we did some of the things I was talking about, we'd be better off, we'd

2909
02:51:05,980 --> 02:51:08,600
gain some new knowledge and insight.

2910
02:51:08,600 --> 02:51:14,720
Where that takes us is hard to say, different directions it could go, but we'd be better

2911
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:16,760
off for it.

2912
02:51:16,760 --> 02:51:19,760
Mining these anomalies can be very profitable.

2913
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:26,320
And I've suggested creating an office called the Office of Strategic Anomaly Resolution.

2914
02:51:26,320 --> 02:51:32,360
So when our increasingly technical intelligence community detects things that are really weird

2915
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:36,720
and anomalous, like this business of these beams that are, you know, we're hitting the

2916
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:40,800
people in the Havana embassy and you need some really smart technical people, you've

2917
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:42,960
got something just really weird.

2918
02:51:42,960 --> 02:51:47,200
You have a sort of group of scientists and engineers who are focused, you can take these

2919
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:51,400
kinds of things too, and they can figure out what to do with it or where to take it.

2920
02:51:51,400 --> 02:51:54,240
Did they ever figure out what those beams in the Havana embassy were?

2921
02:51:54,240 --> 02:51:55,960
Nope, not to my knowledge.

2922
02:51:55,960 --> 02:52:00,680
And it's happened now recently in D.C. near the White House, according to some recent

2923
02:52:00,680 --> 02:52:01,680
reports.

2924
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:03,800
So you explain that to people?

2925
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:11,520
So what we're talking about is employees of the U.S. government in Havana, mostly but

2926
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:21,440
elsewhere, in addition to Havana, have started feeling very ill, headaches, a range of symptoms,

2927
02:52:21,440 --> 02:52:30,200
loss of energy, and it seems that they have been targeted with some kind of RF weapon,

2928
02:52:30,200 --> 02:52:34,280
some kind of electromagnetic radiation from a distance.

2929
02:52:34,280 --> 02:52:41,800
And we do know that the Russians in particular have been developing devices like that for

2930
02:52:41,800 --> 02:52:47,440
decades and they used to use them on our embassy in Moscow all the time for different kinds

2931
02:52:47,440 --> 02:52:50,720
of collection purposes, different techniques.

2932
02:52:50,720 --> 02:52:52,760
So that's suspicious.

2933
02:52:52,760 --> 02:52:56,960
Cuba is a country where they could plausibly test something like that and have a degree

2934
02:52:56,960 --> 02:52:59,800
of deniability.

2935
02:52:59,800 --> 02:53:02,040
They've got freedom of action down there.

2936
02:53:02,040 --> 02:53:06,320
They're still one of the few governments that supports the regime there.

2937
02:53:06,320 --> 02:53:11,120
So at some place they might undertake further testing in a real world setting if they wanted

2938
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:12,120
to.

2939
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:17,520
It's something that could be mobile and not clear what the objective is, whether it's

2940
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:22,280
to make people sick or whether it's incidental.

2941
02:53:22,280 --> 02:53:25,240
They're trying to get stuff off the computers and the people just happen to be close to

2942
02:53:25,240 --> 02:53:30,240
the computers and they're trying to put a beam through there that scrapes energy off

2943
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:32,720
the screen or something.

2944
02:53:32,720 --> 02:53:38,280
We don't really know, but there seems to be a pattern to this stuff.

2945
02:53:38,280 --> 02:53:41,480
My friend Mike Swick, shout out to Mike Swick.

2946
02:53:41,480 --> 02:53:48,160
He used to work for the, I think it was the Secret Service, and they had an embassy in

2947
02:53:48,920 --> 02:53:56,400
Moscow and they detected these devices that the Soviet Union had installed inside the

2948
02:53:56,400 --> 02:54:01,680
walls that were listening devices that were powered by the movement of the building in

2949
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:02,680
the wind.

2950
02:54:02,680 --> 02:54:03,680
Interesting.

2951
02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:04,680
I remember-

2952
02:54:04,680 --> 02:54:05,680
I don't know if that's true.

2953
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:06,680
That's what he told me.

2954
02:54:06,680 --> 02:54:07,680
Does that make sense?

2955
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:08,680
It does because-

2956
02:54:08,680 --> 02:54:12,680
He said it was so sophisticated and it was so beyond anything that we had.

2957
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:15,360
When we were building the new U.S. embassy-

2958
02:54:15,360 --> 02:54:17,000
I hope I didn't fuck that story up, Mike.

2959
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:18,880
You told me it a long time ago.

2960
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:24,000
I know that we found antennas embedded in the concrete of the U.S. embassy as it was

2961
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:28,360
being constructed, the new embassy that brought the entire construction to a halt.

2962
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:30,160
The thing listening device, is this it?

2963
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:31,160
Yeah.

2964
02:54:31,160 --> 02:54:32,160
Okay, what does this say?

2965
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:33,160
I've heard of it before.

2966
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:34,160
You've heard of it before?

2967
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:36,080
I think we've maybe talked, maybe that's why because we talked about it on here.

2968
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:37,080
Okay.

2969
02:54:37,080 --> 02:54:38,080
Known as the great seal bug-

2970
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:39,080
Oh, this is the famous, yeah, this is the great-

2971
02:54:39,080 --> 02:54:43,200
On the first covert listening devices or bugs to use passive techniques to transmit an

2972
02:54:43,280 --> 02:54:44,280
audio signal.

2973
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:50,560
It was concealed inside a gift given by the Soviet Union to W. Averill Harriman, United

2974
02:54:50,560 --> 02:54:53,960
States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, August 4th, 1945.

2975
02:54:53,960 --> 02:55:00,560
Because it was passive, needing electromagnetic energy from an outside source to become energized

2976
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:01,740
and activate.

2977
02:55:01,740 --> 02:55:05,240
It's considered a predecessor of radio frequency identification technology.

2978
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:07,240
I don't think that's exact what he was talking about.

2979
02:55:07,240 --> 02:55:11,840
He was talking about these bugs that were, they were actually powered by, you know, and

2980
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:13,880
the wind moves a, you know, like your watch-

2981
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:14,880
Little kinetic energy.

2982
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:15,880
Yeah, you have a watch.

2983
02:55:15,880 --> 02:55:16,880
It's an automatic watch.

2984
02:55:16,880 --> 02:55:19,240
You move your watch and that's what powers the watch.

2985
02:55:19,240 --> 02:55:22,160
They've been exploring all kinds of things like that.

2986
02:55:22,160 --> 02:55:26,640
And we actually, it cost the U.S. taxpayer hundreds of millions because halfway through

2987
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:32,600
the construction of the new U.S. Embassy, they found in the concrete forms, antenna

2988
02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:35,120
shapes that we made no sense to us.

2989
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:40,600
We didn't know what the hell they were and weird designs and shapes that were, they were

2990
02:55:40,680 --> 02:55:47,680
intercepting some of our stuff and modifying it or using construction people outside of

2991
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:50,040
our supervision to do this.

2992
02:55:50,040 --> 02:55:54,200
And they had other things with the pipes and the wires that, you know, they had all kinds

2993
02:55:54,200 --> 02:55:55,200
of attacks on the embassy.

2994
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:56,200
It's pretty wild.

2995
02:55:56,200 --> 02:55:57,200
Yeah.

2996
02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:00,640
And some of it, you know, looked like physics that it was hard for us to understand.

2997
02:56:00,640 --> 02:56:04,160
So I'm not surprised by that story.

2998
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:11,520
One recently claimed that about the pyramid things that were flying over the ship, that

2999
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:13,200
it was Vlad.

3000
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:20,120
There was some Soviet guy said it was Vladimir Putin's creations or, you know, from the Soviet

3001
02:56:20,120 --> 02:56:21,240
Union, of course.

3002
02:56:21,240 --> 02:56:23,680
He has claimed...

3003
02:56:23,680 --> 02:56:29,400
We have validated the fact that he has developed a nuclear missile that is kind of like imagine

3004
02:56:29,400 --> 02:56:36,880
a nuclear cruise missile with incredible range and maneuverability.

3005
02:56:36,880 --> 02:56:37,880
So that's something.

3006
02:56:37,880 --> 02:56:41,480
I don't know how much success they've had with it, but they really do have a project

3007
02:56:41,480 --> 02:56:44,280
like that and they have done some testing.

3008
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:50,280
So there have been some advances under his, under his time there under his tenure.

3009
02:56:50,280 --> 02:56:55,160
But I don't know, I don't think I've not heard anything about triangular objects.

3010
02:56:55,160 --> 02:56:57,840
No, I'm sure it's Vlad.

3011
02:56:57,840 --> 02:57:02,800
The former senator says, no question UFOs buzzing over US warships are from Russia.

3012
02:57:02,800 --> 02:57:08,200
The former senator condemns the Pentagon for admitting it cannot identify the strange object.

3013
02:57:08,200 --> 02:57:09,560
So this is a former US senator.

3014
02:57:09,560 --> 02:57:10,560
Oh, it's Harry Reid.

3015
02:57:10,560 --> 02:57:11,680
Do you know Harry Reid?

3016
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:12,680
I do.

3017
02:57:12,680 --> 02:57:14,340
Not well, but I do know him.

3018
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:15,560
So he believes that.

3019
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:17,640
And he's a big UFO supporter.

3020
02:57:17,640 --> 02:57:18,640
He is.

3021
02:57:18,640 --> 02:57:19,640
A big believer.

3022
02:57:19,640 --> 02:57:20,640
He is.

3023
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:25,280
He's tried to solve this problem from the congressional side of terms of the lack of

3024
02:57:26,280 --> 02:57:32,160
government by putting some money on it, which created this ATIP program, the Advanced Airborne

3025
02:57:32,160 --> 02:57:36,520
Identity Threat Program, Advanced Aerospace Threat Program.

3026
02:57:36,520 --> 02:57:42,360
So he's been involved for a long time, been very curious about this, wanting to see some

3027
02:57:42,360 --> 02:57:43,360
answers.

3028
02:57:43,360 --> 02:57:46,280
But he has been very active, extremely active.

3029
02:57:46,280 --> 02:57:50,700
Well, Chris, this has been a very enlightening and interesting conversation and I really

3030
02:57:50,740 --> 02:57:56,860
appreciate your time and I really appreciate your openness to discussing this stuff.

3031
02:57:56,860 --> 02:58:02,140
Because I know it does for a person that's a, you're a serious person, it does open you

3032
02:58:02,140 --> 02:58:03,140
up to ridicule.

3033
02:58:03,140 --> 02:58:10,740
You know, in my community, I don't think there's any doubt that there are people making jokes

3034
02:58:10,740 --> 02:58:14,720
about me behind my back and that kind of thing, but I knew that was going to happen going

3035
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:15,720
into this.

3036
02:58:15,720 --> 02:58:16,720
Right.

3037
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:21,840
There's a principle here, a very cherished principle, and I think you just have to do

3038
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:24,160
the right thing at the end of the day, which you believe in.

3039
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:28,760
Well, I also think there's enough evidence at this point in time, and thankfully, because

3040
02:58:28,760 --> 02:58:34,560
of the New York Times article from 2017, it's loosened a lot of the stigma attached to it.

3041
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:40,480
And a lot of this, like we showed, the gimbal, the FLIR, the GoFast video, this is wild shit.

3042
02:58:40,480 --> 02:58:44,600
And if we can't explain it, you can't just bury your head in the sand and pretend it

3043
02:58:44,600 --> 02:58:45,800
doesn't exist.

3044
02:58:45,880 --> 02:58:46,880
Amen.

3045
02:58:46,880 --> 02:58:49,280
That's my view as well.

3046
02:58:49,280 --> 02:58:56,160
Do you have any, I know you're no longer with To The Stars Academy, do you have any official

3047
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:58,720
role in this stuff anymore?

3048
02:58:58,720 --> 02:58:59,720
Nothing official.

3049
02:58:59,720 --> 02:59:05,200
I stay in touch with people and try to help when I can, and that's about it.

3050
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:09,040
Alright man, well keep us posted, and if any new information comes out and you want to

3051
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:10,560
break it, you're always welcome.

3052
02:59:10,560 --> 02:59:11,560
Okay, thank you, Joe.

3053
02:59:11,560 --> 02:59:12,560
Thank you, sir.

3054
02:59:12,560 --> 02:59:13,560
Appreciate it.

3055
02:59:13,560 --> 02:59:14,560
Appreciate you very much, man.

3056
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:15,560
Thank you.

3057
02:59:16,320 --> 02:59:17,320
Thank you.

3058
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:18,320
Thank you.

3059
02:59:18,320 --> 02:59:19,320
Thank you.

3060
02:59:19,320 --> 02:59:22,320
Thank you.
