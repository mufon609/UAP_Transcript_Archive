Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Very nice to meet you.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nice to meet you as well.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I really loved your series, the telepathy tapes.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I had long suspected that there was some sort of a way to prove that there's something going on.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But there's no way that that would be a thing for so long that people would talk about certain moments where people could read people's minds

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
or certain moments where there was something that was being exchanged that wasn't verbal, it wasn't facial expressions, it wasn't body language, there was something going on.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And the telepathy tapes, excuse me, the telepathy tapes essentially proved it.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But has there been pushback about this?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I know there's a lot of hardcore skeptics that never want to believe.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah. I think anytime you're pushing the status quo, there's going to be pushback, of course.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But I think the overwhelming amount of emails that we've gotten from families and others that have a non-speaking child have been so excited that this news is finally out there.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Same thing with teachers that have been witnessing, like you said, for witnessing this in classrooms and in their homes for decades.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And when facilitated communication first came to America, it was the 90s.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What does that mean, facilitated communication?

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, maybe we should back up.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I mean, so I wonder, okay, so what the podcast is about are non-speaking individuals who tend to have apraxia, which is a mind-body disconnect.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And those individuals cannot speak with, you know, using their voice.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Speaking is a fine motor skill, whereas pointing to letters is a gross motor skill.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So spelling to communicate is how many of these individuals communicate, right?

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And when the first and well, and with that in mind, I just want to say one quick thing that often people historically have looked at people with apraxia or non-speakers,

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and they think that because they can't speak, they can't think that they're not in there.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
They don't presume competence.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And none of that is true.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
These individuals have a hard time controlling their body, right?

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And so if you can't control your body, people make all sorts of assumptions, you know, and that's been really difficult.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And so I think that the subjects in this project who are non-speakers with autism have been up against all sorts of different battles from people not presuming they're competent,

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
from people doubting their way of communication through spelling to communicate.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And then, of course, it comes out in many cases that these individuals can read minds, have a plethora of other, for lack of better words, spiritual gifts.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And then the parents and teachers often aren't believed about that either.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So it's like there's stigma every which way.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And the podcast is kind of a collision of all these stigmas and really trying to break down those stigmas and be like, here's the truth.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
These people are in there, spelling is a valid form of communication.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And yes, many of them say they have spiritual gifts, which I think we can pretty much validate at this point.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
When you say spiritual gifts, what do you mean by that?

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah. So when I first stumbled into this, which we can talk about later if you want, when I first kind of stumbled into this, I thought this was just about telepathy, right?

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And that there were these individuals and their parents and teachers are claiming they could read minds.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And as I start meeting more and more and more of these families, and again, like I said, teachers is not limited to just families.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
One thing that they started telling me was telepathy is the tip of the iceberg.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I didn't know what that meant. You know, what do you mean, telepathy is the tip of the iceberg?

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And it's true, because I think whether or not its ability to see disease or illness in someone and be able to diagnose it before this person knows that there's something wrong, reading an aura and, you know, saying that they can see a color around not just animals and humans, but plants.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Being able to speak multiple languages, even though you haven't been taught them, or playing instruments and knowing music or being able to access almost any song and having perfect pitch, being able to visit people in dreams.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then, I mean, I think some of the more just like mind-altering, shocking things for me was how many non-speaking individuals have said that they are able to speak with people from the other side.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And yeah, so it didn't just start with telepathy or end with telepathy. It's a plethora of things.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So do you think that this is an emerging aspect of human consciousness, or do you think perhaps this is something maybe we had before we were verbal that we've lost but that lays dormant, like that we don't need it so like a muscle it atrophies?

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, I think that's exactly right. I mean, I think we all have these abilities. I think this is all part of us. And in the telepathy tapes in episode five in particular, we get into animal communication through telepathy.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And a story of elephants that knew when someone who was like in charge of their big game preserve had died, and they'd walk days to his house and did kind of stay there for grieving and then would come back every year on the day of his death.

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I mean, just unbelievably beautiful stuff. Rupert Sheldrake has talked, has written at length, a brilliant Cambridge biologist about dogs, experiments he's done that kind of show the dogs know when their owners are coming home, and sometimes cats.

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So, so this seems to be part and parcel of the animal kingdom right and many of us have had that experience of phone telepathy, where I was just thinking of someone and they call.

52
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:57,000
People like to dismiss that as being just coincidence but just why do people want to dismiss everything. Like that's the problem. It's like, I think, I think they're the real fear is being full.

53
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's the fear, which is why the problem with any sort of telepathy or any sort of psychic ability. The problem is there's so many charlatans, and so many people get duped.

54
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, and it's really common. I mean, it's, it's so common. It's, it's everywhere you see these psychic palm reading signs everywhere you go.

55
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And because of that, it's in the realm forever of nonsense. And if you believe in nonsense, you're not a person to be taken seriously.

56
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So if you're a scientist and you're studying human neurochemistry and you're studying neuroscience, there's no way you're, you're going to support this unless it's just beating you over the head with overwhelming evidence and then perhaps you say maybe there's something here.

57
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I think that's changing, actually. And one of the things that we look at in the telepathy tapes in episode six, which we call our science episode, is this idea of materialism, which I'm sure you've heard of.

58
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You know, this idea that, at least for the past few hundred years, that the reigning philosophy around how we interpret the world is only true if we can measure it and observe it, right?

59
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And that makes you seem foolish if you believe in something that can't be measured or observed, like a siphon on telepathy or precognition or dreams being able to communicate with someone or any of that stuff would be thrown out as being silly.

60
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And I think there's been a massive effort to make that true, right? That if you believe this or you're a scientist and you want to publish this, we're going to dismiss you or ridicule you just for even daring to ask that question.

61
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Research about this type of stuff has been dismissed because it's materialist, you know, scientists who for a long time run the journals.

62
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But there is something interesting here, which is that consciousness, we don't know where it comes from, you know?

63
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And so what a brilliant scientist, Dean Radin, talks about in the telepathy tapes is that if you think of materialism as a pyramid, right, and the base of the pyramid and all the things that have built up our world,

64
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
which are biology and physics and chemistry and all those things, those have rules and properties, and we shouldn't throw those out.

65
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Those are pretty much true. But currently at the top of the pyramid is consciousness, and we can't explain where that comes from and why it's there.

66
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But if you just take consciousness from the top and put it on the bottom so that consciousness is the basis of all reality, right?

67
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That consciousness is fundamental, that all of everything is the product of our thoughts first, then we can account for all this stuff.

68
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Then we can account for precognition or telepathy. And it's not that big of a change.

69
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's just flipping kind of the order of the pyramid. And I think that makes a lot of sense.

70
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And so there's been a lot of scientists who have looked into near-death experience research, who've looked into the research on telepathy, who've looked into the research around precognition and said, we can't dismiss this.

71
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is happening. There's a lot of anecdotal evidence here. There's a lot of things that add up.

72
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So we're going to start the Academy of Post-Materialist Sciences, where we will take this stuff seriously and we will look at the research and we will advance science.

73
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And I tend to believe that there needs to be quite a few funerals.

74
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But I think in like 50 to 100 years, the scientists that we're gripping onto the materialist paradigm, I really believe that that's going to be kind of like the flat earthers in the future.

75
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Like, I think the scientists doing this are on the right side of history because you have to account for it.

76
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Right. You know?

84
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We have to account for it. We don't exactly know where it comes from.

85
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And there's a lot of people that think that the universe is formed through consciousness.

86
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is Thomas Campbell's take on things. He was a mind bender when I had him in here.

87
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I was like, what are you saying exactly? You have to listen to it three or four times.

88
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Then you have to, I told him, listen, let's stop here. We'll do it again because I'm going to have to absorb this.

89
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But the concept is that essentially the universe is formulated through consciousness in some way.

90
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And that we're interacting with it through consciousness and that it's not as real as we want to believe it is.

91
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah. I mean, and even if you just basic it down, right? Like this room, what came first, the room or the thought of the room?

92
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Everything in this room. It was a thought first. Right. Everything. Right. Everything. Everything on our planet was a thought first.

93
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, everything except the planet itself. Right. Yeah. I've always said that that I think that ideas might be a life form that they get into people's heads

94
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and then people manufacture physical objects out of these ideas, whether it's art.

95
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And I think that's one of the reasons why we like art so much. Yeah. I mean, that's how this whole podcast started, I think.

96
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Sure. You know, I was reading that book, Big Magic. I don't know if you've read that book. It's wonderful.

97
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, I guess I should back. You know, I was doing a lot of documentary work that was on social issues. Right.

98
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That was all like fixing broken things in our great country.

99
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then I had a few deaths in my own life. And I thought, my gosh, whatever I do next, I want to fix what's broken in humans

100
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
because I was in a complete topsy turvy thing of how do these great people that are heroes, you know, a police officer going in and saving someone.

101
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
My other friend was taking care of the unhoused in Kansas City and how do they die?

102
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So I was going through my own just like kind of grief process and thinking, whatever I do next, I don't want to look any more.

103
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I was humbled to do that work of broken social systems. I want to fix what's broken in humanity and figure out what that is.

104
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But anyway, I was reading Big Magic and this is a book about how ideas by Elizabeth Gilbert, how ideas are outside of us, the creative process is it comes to you.

105
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And they're you know, it's wonderful. In the book, they talk about songwriters who heard her song.

106
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And if you don't grab it, you'll hear that same song on the radio or or just how a story will come to you fully formed.

107
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And one of the kind of topics that comes up in that book, too, is you don't ask the creative whatever this God muse, either right to to to give this to you.

108
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Tell it I'm going to do this with you. It's going to be great. And so I said that out loud.

109
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I was reading this book. I was in this moment of just major shift in my life.

110
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I said, whatever I do next, I want to solve the question of where we're going and why we're here and what it all means.

111
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And do we have a consciousness and does it survive?

112
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And then and no, I actually didn't ask it. I said, yeah, I said, I'm going to do this next.

113
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And I didn't know what it was going to look like. But then started reading, you know, all the things I got in consciousness, tree communication and about near-death experiences and Ian Stevenson's work and all sorts of things.

114
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And then I heard a podcast with Dr. Diane Hennessy Powell, who was a Harvard, you know, Johns Hopkins educated, you know, taught at Harvard scientist who was saying that non-speakers that she'd tested had demonstrated a remarkable ability.

115
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
For telepathy and reading minds. And that was like, boom, like lightning just kind of hit like this is the thing.

116
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And I really believe if something's intended for you, it won't miss you, you know.

117
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But I think that concept of big magic was a bit of that of asking, telling the muse, you know, to to guide you.

118
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah. Yeah.

119
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Guide you towards something that can illuminate this issue.

120
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So did you have a preconceived notion of telepathy or spiritual gifts or anything before this?

121
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No, I mean, I think like a lot of people like the idea of mediums and psychics.

122
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It felt like people that are often trying to just make money off of people in really vulnerable situations.

123
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I've always believed certainly there's got to be people who have certain gifts like that, you know, but that the vast majority couldn't be trusted or, you know, I didn't think telepathy could be real.

124
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That seems impossible. It just seems impossible.

125
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Even things like plant communication felt impossible.

126
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Or I mean, I mean, none of that was something that was was like my worldview.

127
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You know, I was working on, you know, solving problems around paid family medical leave and making health insurance more affordable and accessible.

128
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Like it was not my cup of tea, really.

129
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And so which was kind of great because as I tumbled into this world, I mean, I was really wide eyed as like, wait a second.

130
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Have I been wrong about everything?

131
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And that's kind of where it ended up was like I had to go revisit everything I ever thought about the world because I started realizing our entire paradigm is wrong.

132
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I mean, or a lot of it is.

133
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That was my experience.

134
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So let's let's talk about what you saw first.

135
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Like, what was the first example where it was like an aha moment for you?

136
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah. So after I heard the interview with Dr. Diane Hennessey Powell, I, you know, I zoomed with her and then I asked if I could go see her and meet her and talk about this a bit, you know, because I thought this could be the next project.

137
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And I just knew it was going to be the next project.

138
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Right.

139
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So one of the first things I had to do was I was like, can you just tell me about some of the emails that come in from parents?

140
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I had to just kind of go through reading some emails from parents.

141
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And it was one after the other.

142
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Like, I didn't believe this and I didn't believe my wife.

143
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I didn't believe my husband that this could be possible.

144
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But we've tested it. We've tested it.

145
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
People were sending tests.

146
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And I thought, OK, whatever is going on here, these parents don't know that any other parents are going through this.

147
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
They think a singular miracle is happening in their home that this child can read their thoughts and that this is where the story is, that there's so many parents who haven't been listened to.

148
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And so I really thought this was about parents at first and then discovered, no, there's been teachers writing about this for 30 years, capturing it, videotaping this phenomenon going on and scared to come out about it.

149
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And I think same with the families. Right.

150
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I mean, what a weird thing to say this child can read my mind or this child seems to be able to do X, Y, Z, things that seem impossible.

151
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And so, you know, my first thought was, OK, I need to see if this is my own eyes.

152
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And so I, Dr. Powell had just been reached out to by a family in Mexico who discovered that their 13 year old daughter was inside.

153
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They didn't think she was. And she was able to communicate.

154
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And the reason they discovered that was during COVID, you know, they were in charge of homeschooling and started being like, OK, let's see what you know.

155
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
She started spelling. She knew an awful lot. And I think they were shocked.

156
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And pretty soon thereafter, she said, I can read your mind.

157
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And they thought, what? And they would do tests. What did I just draw?

158
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And she'd say what they just drew. You know, what are we thinking?

159
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And she would write it. And so do they say what they see or how they see it?

160
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Like if someone writes something down, do they see the word or do they know it?

161
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well, I think that's a really good question.

162
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And, you know, we've done a few experiments that, you know, again, I'm not a scientist.

163
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Like the experiments I was doing for the film, I mean, which is going to be now a film.

164
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But the podcast was kind of me just trying to understand like proof of concept what is going on here.

165
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Right. And I can only say what spellers have told me.

166
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And there's been quite a few spellers who say I can see through someone's eyes or I can hear through their ears.

167
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And others who seem to have a merged consciousness with someone that they're very close to,

168
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
whether it be a father or a teacher or a communication partner, father or whatever,

169
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
where we did some experiments with one mom where we'd show an image to her.

170
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Her son, who was sitting across the room, would all of a sudden start writing what the image was.

171
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But what was so fascinating is sometimes the mom wouldn't even know what the image was.

172
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So at one point, she thought it was paint. No, no, she thought there was a food fight.

173
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It was ketchup and mustard. And he wrote paint. So so at that point, it's like she's not obviously sending a thought.

174
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Right. He seems to be tapping in the second the images in her own mind.

175
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So for us, it was a big question of is this just your telepathy?

176
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Because a few parents have told me, no, this is bigger than that.

177
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It seems like a merging of consciousness of some sort. Yeah.

178
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
In a bizarre way, if the mother doesn't know what it is and the child does, that's strange.

179
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah, it's really fascinating. And you know, but I also one of the stories that I loved goes back.

180
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, the Cambridge biologist who's in this project, he didn't believe in telepathy either.

181
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I mean, I think a lot of scientists don't believe this stuff right away either.

182
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And he had a, you know, a senior professor that he really looked up to, Sir Rudolf Peters.

183
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for being such a brilliant scientific mind.

184
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Right. And the Sir Rudolf Peters was in like the tea room at Cambridge one time and telling young Dr. Sheldrake, young Rupert here,

185
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that he just heard of a blind boy that he tested who obviously is blind and can't read an eye chart.

186
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But if his mother is looking at it, he could read it.

187
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And that's how Rupert Sheldrake fell into this world.

188
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And that boy was diagnosed with, you know, being blind, but also at the time what they called, you know, severe mental retardation,

189
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
which now we don't call it that, you know.

190
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But that's who knows what this young individual have if he had apraxia or what was going on if he had autism.

191
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Well, because autism and blindness, like it's a huge impediment, especially nonverbal autism and being blind.

192
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Like, how do you learn anything?

193
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So you would assume that there's something wrong with the child when there's just a lack of the ability to communicate.

194
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah. I mean, with non-speaking individuals with apraxia, they are in there.

195
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
They're so smart. It's just that mind-body disconnect and not being able to, you know.

196
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What do they think causes that? Do they have an understanding of what it is?

197
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You know, I don't know.

198
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There's so many wonderful experts out there looking into this, and I don't know what causes apraxia.

199
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But I do know that there's a lot of supports to help individuals who have apraxia to communicate.

200
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And the world is just making it really difficult for these individuals.

201
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Have you ever seen this young blind boy that uses echolocation and he can ride a skateboard and move around?

202
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
How bizarre is that?

203
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's cool.

204
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I mean, you know, in some ways you think of echolocation or being able to see through infrared is like a sixth sense,

205
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
like a sense that we don't have, right?

206
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But it's like a sense some other creatures get around with.

207
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So it's like what we're talking about here is almost like a seventh sense, right?

208
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's something beyond that.

209
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But I just I think there's something so beautiful about that, right?

210
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That if you if humans are so creative that we will find our way to get around the world and find our ways to communicate.

211
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Also, when you're missing a sense, your other senses are stronger.

212
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This has always been a suspicion.

213
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I think that's been proven. Is that correct?

214
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah.

215
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That people are better at hearing things if they're blind or seeing things if they're deaf.

216
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah. Yeah, I think that is absolutely true.

217
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And I think, though, as far as, you know, individuals with apraxia go again, like it's mind, body disconnect.

218
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There's so many of the spellers I've met who don't know they had a body at first.

219
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
They can't feel their body.

220
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You know, they want heavy boots to know where their feet are or heavy necklace to know where their chest is.

221
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And and I think not being in your body, not knowing you have your body leaves you to live in this consciousness space more.

222
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Right. This world of thought where where we can't imagine that we're so bound to our body.

223
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
We have these dissociative dissociative boundaries where it's like you're Joe when I'm high.

224
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And yeah.

225
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So I think that's that's what heightens a lot of this for them is just not, you know, feeling is grounded into their bodies.

226
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
In the wackiest of conspiracy theories, when people talk about the government's connection to alien intelligence,

227
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that they recruit these nonverbal autistic kids because they're the ones who can communicate with aliens.

228
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I don't believe that.

229
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
No, I don't believe that you know, wackiest of conspiracy theories.

230
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But the idea being that if you were the government, you would look for someone who is extraordinary in in that they they're more open to this ability to interact.

231
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah.

232
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And we would be they do not have the burden of feeling foolish.

233
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:47,000
They don't have the burden of societal constraints that we've kind of culturally put on the idea of alien life being able to communicate with them.

234
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah.

235
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I mean, this is I have received a question around, you know, could the government utilize these individuals?

236
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You're not discussing the first thing you think about people think extraordinary.

237
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah.

238
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Like the X-Men.

239
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah.

240
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Right.

241
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Like how will the government utilize this and manipulate it for their own gain?

242
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That's what everybody worries.

243
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah.

244
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And it's a fair worry.

245
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I mean, it is a fair worry.

246
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And, you know, like we try to be very protective of of the families and make sure that they're safe and that they're only out there if they want to be out there.

247
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And, you know, that type of thing.

248
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But even they know what that means.

249
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah.

250
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's the problem.

251
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You say you want to be out there.

252
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Do you know what that means?

253
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Right.

254
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Exactly.

255
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Every non-speaking individual with these gifts that I've ever met won't use it for bad or nefarious means that they're they're interested in love.

256
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
They're interested in connection.

257
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Right.

258
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah.

259
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Of course.

260
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah.

261
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Well, the problem is if they were used and didn't know what they were doing, you know, they would know.

262
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
They'll know.

263
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
They can read your thoughts and they know it's up.

264
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
They know it's up better than anyone, I think.

265
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Interesting.

266
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,000
When you first started, was there stages of acceptance for you with these ideas?

267
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah.

268
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What was the first stage?

269
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I mean, the first stage was I think I never I never had the barrier of whether or not they're in there.

270
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You know, I worked I helped start the inclusion program in my high school and worked and cared for people, you know, with varying abilities my whole life.

271
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So that I knew they were in there.

272
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But I think the next thing for me was the telepathy.

273
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And and and when you see it and when you talk to enough parents who are saying all you need to do is go see it.

274
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's not like it's not like does it show up or like will it appear?

275
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's like for the parents and teachers to report this is happening.

276
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
If you go work with a speller, you just see it.

277
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So that was pretty phenomenal.

278
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And then the first person we saw being able to do it was this girl Mia.

279
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And she was still in the early stages of learning to spell to communicate.

280
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So she was being touched.

281
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It often helps first with the wrist and then here and then here and then on the head.

282
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And then often then there's no touch at all.

283
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's like learning that body and learning those supports to control your motor.

284
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So so Dr. Powell was like, no, scientists will take this because she was being touched.

285
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And I think a lot of us in the room are like, wait, people think she's her mom sending Morse code like they're the plan.

286
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I mean, of course, that's ridiculous. It really is.

287
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But then the next individual could do it across the room and wasn't being touched.

288
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And, you know, anyone that we saw thereafter wasn't being touched.

289
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So that was pretty remarkable.

290
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And I don't think touch actually, I think telepathy is really cool if you're being touched.

291
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You know, but so telepathy was the first one.

292
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And then I think the second one was the language stuff.

293
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,000
A lot of parents saying, you know, we have no idea how, but she's speaking Portuguese and no one in the house speaks Portuguese or people talking about.

294
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And this has been documented?

295
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. It's quite common, actually.

296
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And these are nonverbal kids, non-speakers, non-speakers.

297
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So what is the difference between nonverbal and non-speakers?

298
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Well, I think nonverbal is this idea, right?

299
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Like that you're not able to make like language, you know, in a way where like speaking is just like they can be verbal.

300
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
They can communicate. They just can't speak it.

301
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
OK. Just can't speak it.

302
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,000
OK. Without the support of a communication partner like, you know, that is the goal is to type independently.

303
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Do they make noises?

304
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah. I mean, I think especially with apraxia, there's often a lack of body control, voice control.

305
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So there is like a beautiful soundtrack that I've come to love of non-speakers that will often be like some grunting or just lack of body control.

306
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And actually, I think if someone sees a non-speaker out in public, one of the most loving things you can say is like, I know you can't control your body.

307
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I know that's not you. You know what I mean?

308
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Because the person in there might want to be doing X, Y, Z, but just cannot control their body.

309
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And imagine how frustrating that would be.

310
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah. So these people, they're nonverbal.

311
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And when you say that they can speak Portuguese, they understand Portuguese.

312
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Do they write it? Like, how does this manifest itself?

313
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah. So, I mean, there's one young girl I'm thinking of in particular, but there's this again.

314
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
This has come up now with, I don't know, 15 non-speakers that I've met.

315
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But the girl I'm thinking of, her, you know, she will work during the day with a paraprofessional and a spelling coach.

316
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You know, there's a, you know, the education system, there might be two or three people in a room and three people who are in the room this day.

317
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And she started spelling in a language and they didn't know what it is.

318
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So they looked it up and it was Portuguese.

319
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And then she started spelling in Spanish and they were like, this is wild.

320
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And she also said she knew hieroglyphics.

321
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And what? Yeah.

322
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And then they were like, how do we test this?

323
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Because if we know the answer, she'll read our mind and know.

324
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So they had to just, which is wild already.

325
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah. Like you have to worry about this kid reading your mind.

326
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It might be bullshit.

327
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So they had to like look up pictures of hieroglyphics and not know what the pictures were representing to be like, OK,

328
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
OK, here's the feather.

329
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I mean, I don't know what whatever feather on top of a stone or whatever the picture was of.

330
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And here's this picture and this picture.

331
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And then she identified them.

332
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And then they looked them up and they were right.

333
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Wow. All of them.

334
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
One hundred percent accurate.

335
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

336
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So and I'm not saying, of course, not how is going on there?

337
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Not every. What is that?

338
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Well, I mean, that is that's beyond bizarre.

339
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Did you give her cuneiform?

340
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I mean, I wasn't there for this.

341
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I, you know, her mom reported it to me and it has the email that she received from the staff.

342
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And so, you know, the staff is just like, this is what happened today.

343
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And, you know, because these individuals are spelling to communicate, it can take a lot of time.

344
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It can take a whole work and effort to get those that information out.

345
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So anything that comes out usually, I mean, a good spelling coach will ask this child first, right?

346
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Is it OK if I share this with your parents or is this private between us or whatever?

347
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But if they say it's OK to share, they will write a letter home.

348
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And this is what happened. And and that was in a letter home.

349
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
This is what happened today.

350
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000

363
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Your child reads hieroglyphics.

364
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
What the hell?

365
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's like, what does that mean? Is that the Akashic record?

366
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Like, is this child like pulling from all the information that's in the ether?

367
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Like, how would you be able to read a dead language that mean?

368
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
What percentage of the human population can read that without AI, without assistance?

369
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's got to be tiny. It's remarkable.

370
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Tiny, tiny percentage.

371
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I mean, from a scientific perspective, and this is one of the things that there was a professor, Bernie Ridland,

372
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
who first, I think, came up with this idea.

373
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And then I know Dr. Powell kind of expanded on it, which Bernie Rimland first saw this kind of gift in non-speakers,

374
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I think in the 70s, a while back, and was like, ESP should be considered a savant skill.

375
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And Dr. Powell has talked about this as well.

376
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So savant skills, right, are studied or accepted by science.

377
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
This idea that, like, how do you know the language or math or this or that when you haven't been exposed to it

378
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
or haven't been, you know, educated with even maybe the most simplest music skills.

379
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But now you're playing a symphony, right?

380
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So savant skills are being able to really excel at something that you haven't been taught.

381
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And savant, there's people who are born with the savant skills.

382
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And also, sometimes you can be an accidental savant.

383
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So you get hit on the head.

384
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah, I read about a guy who got assaulted and all of a sudden you do complex geometry.

385
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah, complex geometry and stuff like that.

386
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So what's wild is that the materialist scientific point of view accepts savant skills.

387
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
We don't know where they come from. We don't know why.

388
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
We don't know how people can know this stuff.

389
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
They've been taught, but we accept them as these real big question marks as it's real.

390
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So what Bernie Ribblin said and later Dr. Powell was like, ESP should be considered savant skill.

391
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
These people know something and we don't know how they know it, but they do.

392
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
They haven't been taught it. They haven't been exposed to it.

393
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And that could be thoughts. It could be knowledge about the future.

394
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It could be knowledge about language.

395
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And this is what the whole hope is about the telepathy tapes, right, is that people will start to put money behind this research

396
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
because for so long research around this type of stuff wouldn't be funded because it would be just dismissed.

397
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's impossible. It's impossible. It's impossible.

398
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And one of the moms in the telepathy tapes who I love so much, her name is Manisha, she talks about her son.

399
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
She goes, Akhil is the data. You want to look at the data. You want the data.

400
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Look at my son. He's the data.

401
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And some of these parents are wanting, desperate for answers.

402
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
They're not in the question of if it's happening. They're wondering how it's happening.

403
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And I think I'm in that part, too, like when the people that are just, is it possible? Is it possible?

404
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I think for most of us in this world, it's like, yeah, you're like 10 steps behind, man.

405
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Like, it's possible. It's not a matter if. It's why.

406
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And that's my hope is that the chains will be like, you know, let off the scientists.

407
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
These children that can read things, are they typing it out like on an iPad? Are they writing it physically?

408
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
How do they do it?

409
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Usually, so there's different forms of spelling to communicate.

410
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Often there's like a letter board, right?

411
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Sometimes it's a stencil letter board that you poke a pencil through.

412
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So you really know when you get that letter and it's really satisfying to get the pull poke through.

413
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Sometimes there's like just a laminate board where you kind of point to a letter.

414
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Some individuals are typing into a spelling kind of app on an iPad or there's different spelling.

415
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Can they type?

416
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
AAC devices. Yeah.

417
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And then and then there's some individuals who end up going to the QWERTY, you know,

418
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
the typical keyboard that we all type with on a keyboard.

419
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So there's varying levels of ability in terms of using your body.

420
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Yeah, using your body.

421
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And the thing I think why spelling has been so, you know, there's such a stigma on spelling.

422
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And I feel so bad for individuals using spelling because they're in there and they are communicating.

423
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But people have said, oh, but you need the support.

424
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So these can't be your words.

425
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Right. Like like for a spelling partner, let's say you have to kind of learn to be a communication partner.

426
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You have to learn to to really understand like the mind, body disconnect and what's going on with the non speaker in front of you.

427
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And sometimes their hand gets lost in space.

428
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So it's good to pull the board away and put it back in again.

429
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Or sometimes you have to cue them like go for it.

430
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
OK, get that letter because that will help with their motor planning.

431
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Right.

432
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So those supports are critical.

433
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But people look at those supports and say, oh, well, that means they're not typing independently.

434
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But to me, that's as wild as saying, oh, you need reading glasses.

435
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You can't read. No, that's a support to help you read.

436
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You can still read if you're reading classes.

437
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And that's how I think of the communication.

438
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
There's still no influence on the words or letters being chosen.

439
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
No, no, no.

440
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And I think one of the things.

441
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So the stigma, I think, that really started for spelling was facilitated communication.

442
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Actually, this is like the first thing you asked.

443
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
We're going full circle.

444
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So for a long time, there was just no hope of getting people who weren't verbal non speakers out.

445
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
There just wasn't. And then all of a sudden, facilitated communication came along.

446
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And it was developed, I think, in Australia, I think.

447
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But this was ideas of put some pressure on someone's wrist so they can really feel where they're at in space.

448
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
They'll be able to spell.

449
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And it was a miracle. It was all over the news.

450
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
This was great.

451
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And some of the first parents that were using facilitated communication started reporting.

452
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
There's telepathy involved.

453
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And this was at Syracuse University in the 90s.

454
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Syracuse knew about this and started kind of burying that information.

455
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And there was a lot of like kind of you'll be let go if you're teaching this and you're talking about this.

456
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So there was kind of big cover up.

457
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So this was new. This is not new that this was going on.

458
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But then there were some claims of sexual assault.

459
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
There's awful things that happen where what was being claimed didn't happen.

460
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And so people started blaming facilitated communication.

461
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Oh, well, maybe they're pushing their hand or doing this or doing that.

462
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And I think for a lot of people who train in facilitated communication, you're using your hand to put pressure so the individual knows where the body is in space.

463
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
But you're not pushing their hand.

464
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But there probably are some cases where that had happened.

465
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Well, anyway, so then it got kind of just stigmatized, right?

466
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's pseudoscience.

467
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And then so spelling evolved into these forms where it was like no touch, do not touch.

468
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And so many of those spelling groups now are helping individuals.

469
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And the big tenet of this is you cannot touch them.

470
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And and that's that's where spelling's at now is that you learn to communicate and there's no touch involved.

471
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But but I'm I'm one of these people that thinks like whatever the individual needs to help them communicate.

472
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It's OK. If you need a little touch, you know, your arm is right.

473
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Or sometimes it helps you go faster if there's a little push like I think.

474
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Go for it. You know, help these individuals get out there.

475
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Right. This touch is not guiding them toward specific letters.

476
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
This touch is just an affirmation just to help to help them relax, to help them connect.

477
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah. And it was really, you know, on set sometimes because every once in a while some parents like hold the board and hold it there for their child.

478
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And we would use these like dry erase, you know, markers on the screen to be like, is the board moving?

479
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And it wasn't, you know, be really interesting to get them in front of some scripts that are very difficult to read.

480
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
That's why I brought up cuneiform and Sumerian and maybe even that crazy Voynich manuscript.

481
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You know what that is? No. The Voynich manuscript is a book that is of an unknown language.

482
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
OK. And it's highly detailed and they don't know what it is.

483
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
They don't know the language. They don't know if it's a fraud. Oh, look at this.

484
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
This is the Voynich manuscript. They don't know when it emerged.

485
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:44,000
There's a lot of suspicion that someone created it and tried to pass it off and sell it as an ancient language in a book.

486
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:54,000
But then some people disagree with that because they think that the way the words are constructed seems to be in some sort of a uniform way.

487
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It's not gibberish. It's not nonsense. But they do not know what it says.

488
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Obviously, I don't know jack shit about ancient languages.

489
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So I'm not the right person to be determining who's correct and who's who wants it to be correct.

490
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So they're saying that. Wow. I have not never heard of that.

491
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
What is the current state of go? Yeah. Let's see what it says.

492
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Whether they think it's real. Is there like a synopsis on what people think is there's facsimiles.

493
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Interesting. OK. University of Bristol subsequently removed a reference to Cheshire's claims from this website was a website.

494
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Cheshire published its translation in the foldout illustration in twenty twenty three.

495
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
He claims it depicts a volcano theories that it places a manuscripts creator near the island of volcano, which was an active volcano during the 15th century.

496
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
However, experts in medieval documents disputed the interpretation vigorously approached for comment.

497
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Lisa Fagan Davis gave this explanation. As with most would be Voynich interpreters, the logic of this proposal is circular and aspirational.

498
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,000
He starts with a theory about what a particular series of glyphs might mean, usually because the words proximity to an image that he believes can interpret.

499
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
OK, so they don't buy that this interpretation of it is real.

500
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But they're pretty sure it's a language, which is just fucking insane.

501
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Scroll up a little higher. Is there any debunkings of it?

502
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
These are different people that have made interpretations and they seem to know.

503
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
No one figures it out. Various discussions.

504
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah. Wow. Imagine if you can get that in front of a nonverbal kid and he's like, oh, I know what that is.

505
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I mean, that'd be pretty wild. Pretty wild.

506
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah. Jesus wrote this like, oh, he says he's coming back in August, like whatever it is.

507
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I mean, this is the fact that the child can read hieroglyphics is insane.

508
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I would love to see like cuneiform or Sumerian in particular.

509
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We had a an ancient language scholar named Wes Huff on and he was explaining how a lot of these interpretations were of like the Sumerian text,

510
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
which is the oldest version of, you know, a lot of these like biblical stories.

511
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
He was like, I can't read it.

512
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:26,000
He goes, I can read all these different languages, but this one is so different than all the others and it doesn't have anything that's like it.

513
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Like a lot of these other languages, you can find similarities in the way they're structured, the way the sentences are structured.

514
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
There's none of that with Sumerian. It's like, this is a wacky language.

515
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
He's like, I can't read it. And he was brilliant.

516
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So when you talk to a guy like that, who's humble about it, but also like very well read.

517
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And he's like, I don't know what's going on.

518
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
What does it give that to the kid?

519
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So interesting. Yeah.

520
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I mean, it seems like there's a lot of opportunity to really get into that with these nonverbal kids.

521
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
If you find one that is there more than one that has this ability to do this?

522
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I mean, I can only comment on the people I've met.

523
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,000
But I think of all the people that we're talking to a lot, you know, for the project and now the film.

524
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah, I mean, it's definitely more than one.

525
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I mean, at least I know 15 or 20 who seem to know various languages they haven't been taught.

526
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
15 or 20?

527
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Yeah. Yeah.

528
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And one of the earlier children that Dr. Powell was studying, this boy knew really kind of odd languages like Russian and Japanese.

529
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And I think he was five or six and could just speak in different languages and knew different languages.

530
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's absolutely remarkable.

531
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Wow. Yeah.

532
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And is there like even the most out there theory about what's going on?

533
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I mean, this is the thing, right?

534
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
There hasn't been a lot of research around this phenomena.

535
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And I think I can only go again off of what spellers have said.

536
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I mean, one thing is that they say that there's a neurology behind language, right?

537
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The current, the most baseline language is not with words.

538
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Words are these 3D objects that we attach to these thoughts and feelings.

539
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And that is the thing that they can understand, which makes sense.

540
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
That would be what telepathy is, right?

541
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
If you're not using words.

542
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Well, that is our version of telepathy.

543
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
We make noise with our mouth and then you can read my mind.

544
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Right. Yeah, kind of.

545
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
In a clumsy way.

546
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah. But if you think of prayer, right, that's telepathy.

547
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
People who come back from a near-death experience and they say they have these communications with someone,

548
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
you don't have a body, that's telepathy, right?

549
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Like if a medium is talking to someone or getting messages from someone who's past, like that's telepathy.

550
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So it seems like the baseline, to me, like all of this has proven for me that we have a soul.

551
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Or there's at least, if that word is triggered into someone, that at least there's a conscious body.

552
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
There's a consciousness in each of us that doesn't need a body.

553
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And so I think the language thing is like we've put words over this thing.

554
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But the telepathy, the baseline is there no matter what.

555
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And if you can understand the baseline of what's being communicated, the words don't matter.

556
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Does that make sense?

557
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It does. Yeah, it does.

558
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's hard to grasp, but it makes sense.

559
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Are you aware of the history of research in Ayahuasca?

560
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I mean, I know what it is.

561
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:36,000
One of the more interesting aspects of it is when scientists first discovered it and discovered its properties and they did experiments on it,

562
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
they wanted to call one of the ingredients telepathy.

563
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But due to the rules of scientific nomenclature, they realized that it had already been named harmin.

564
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So this harmin is one of the ingredients.

565
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's in one of the plants that's used to make this brew.

566
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:03,000
But when the scientists explored this and started experimenting with it, it was somewhere in the early 20th century,

567
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
they realized that they could read each other's minds and that they were communicating

568
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
and that they were having a shared experience that seemed to be completely mental.

569
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But independently, they all verified the exact same thing.

570
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And so that's why they wanted to name it telepathy, which is a way more fun word than harmin.

571
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Way more fun.

572
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yeah. But this idea that we need something to access this dormant part of what is human consciousness.

573
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah. And I think that type of stuff can really help.

574
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I think what's cool is that a lot of the research on psychedelics is kind of converging with this stuff right now around telepathy and the non-speakers.

575
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I think a lot of people have had these experiences on psilocybin or on an ayahuasca trip or whatever,

576
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
where there's this realization that we're way more mental.

577
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
There is a non-physical world that is out there.

578
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Yeah. There's something. And this work and Thomas Campbell's work,

579
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
there's a bunch of people who are considering this now, which I always wonder.

580
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If you get an enormous number of people that have a shift in the way they view reality itself,

581
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
what impact does that have on reality?

582
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah. I mean, I think that's a big thing, right?

583
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Yeah.

584
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And I keep thinking you asked about the pushback around this.

585
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And what's interesting is it's not just from skeptics who don't want to believe in telepathy and that the non-visible world is real,

586
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
but also from people in the spelling community who don't want people to mention telepathy

587
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
out of fear that it's going to foil their efforts to make this standard practice in schools.

588
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
In fact, some of the teachers and others who've been involved in our project have been getting letters from the IASC,

589
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
like a spelling group saying, don't talk about telepathy or you're going to have your accreditation taken away.

590
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I don't understand. Why would that mess with spelling?

591
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I think the fear is that if you ... I actually don't know.

592
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I mean, because most of the people I'm working with, almost all of them,

593
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
every single one of the people I'm working with sees this as happening in their homes and their classrooms.

594
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And it's not just teachers and parents and ministers and rabbis and parapsychologists and speech pathologists and occupational therapists.

595
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
These are all the people reporting it, right?

596
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And for them, I think the thing is truth is never harmful.

597
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It might be difficult, but it's not harmful.

598
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And what this truth means is that we have to change our systems, right, of education.

599
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
We have to change how we think about things.

600
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And I think there is a deep fear of people having their darkest, deepest thoughts exposed.

601
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
That's probably not comfortable for the government, for people in control, for people who are controlling games of money.

602
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh, I think that's coming, whether we like it or not.

603
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But why ... I think this truth might be really uncomfortable for some, but it's so important to get out there.

604
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You can't accept and love someone as a whole being unless you can see and know all of them, right?

605
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And the only people I feel really in service to are the non-speakers who haven't had a voice,

606
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
and all the people loving and supporting them or who are saying, this is real, we want this out there.

607
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And so the gatekeeping around this has been massive.

608
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I mean, yes, from the science world, but also from the spelling world.

609
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But why from the spelling world? That's what I don't understand.

610
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I think there's so many challenges of people saying, oh, because they're using these supports, these words aren't their own.

611
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And then I think there's this conflated idea like, oh, if they know they're people with telepathy, they'll think their thoughts aren't their own either.

612
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And it's a weird idea because just because you're talking to me doesn't mean that I don't have my own thoughts or words, right?

613
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Like, I can read a book which thoughts are coming at me. It doesn't mean I don't have my own thoughts.

614
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So you can hear thoughts and that doesn't mean you don't have your own.

615
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I mean, so it's like putting too much together that I think is talking about telepathy is not going to foil spelling.

616
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But some people believe that to be true.

617
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And it just doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah.

618
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Like, why would any I don't understand why spelling would even get involved in this?

619
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I don't know. Like spelling is universally accepted as being important.

620
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Well, it's no. But this is the problem. Spelling is not there are so I just talked to a parent the other day who said I've been trying to get a communication partner with my daughter in school so she can contribute.

621
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And the school system will not pay for that. They're like, nope, you cannot have a spelling communication partner because it is just a funding issue.

622
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Well, no, there's a group called ASHA, the American Speech Language Association, who accredits speech language pathologists.

623
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And they say that spelling is pseudoscience. And I don't know how communication could be called pseudoscience.

624
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And so if you're a speech language pathologist and you want to teach spelling in schools, that's considered like.

625
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Wait a minute. Why would they say I don't understand. What is the argument that spelling is pseudoscience?

626
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
This is such a controversy that it's just maddening.

627
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I think, again, it's because of those supports, like because because you might need a part because you need a partner to spell.

628
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It's considered, oh, well, you're not spelling independently.

629
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So spelling is pseudoscience for nonverbal people or non-speakers, I should say.

630
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Well, it's not. But but ASHA is saying that, which is making it.

631
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And they're only saying this because of the touch, the ability to touch people while they're doing it.

632
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Well, most of these individuals aren't being touched.

633
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I think that the problem is, I mean, the problem is that no one's presuming competence.

634
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So this is why it was confusing. You're saying spelling in regards to nonverbal.

635
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm sorry. Yeah. OK. Spelling. OK. Yes. Yeah.

636
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So when. So spelling is kind of the catchall phrase for pointing to letters to communicate,

637
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
be it on a letter board or iPad or even a keyboard, like what we're used to with a computer.

638
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So they're going by this old concept that it's impossible to have any sort of psychic ability.

639
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So if you're proving psychic ability through spelling, this is obviously bullshit without any examination of it.

640
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah, I think that's a that's a good summary.

641
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Back to what we were talking about before, that they don't want to be foolish.

642
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Right. So this is a compounded issue.

643
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But one thing that's kind of I thought this was fascinating is that any type of like alternative form of communication

644
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
has gone through immense battles to be validated.

645
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Like, oh, my gosh, sign language.

646
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And I think in the 1800s, there was a conference in Milan where everyone's like, we cannot teach sign language.

647
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Like this is people need to try to speak.

648
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:00,000
You know, sign language went through battles for, I mean, over 100 years to try to even get accepted as a real language.

649
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And it wasn't until the 70s or 80s when that happened.

650
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And then Braille, Louis Braille, who invented Braille, the people at the school where he invented it was like, you guys can't use this.

651
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:16,000
We don't accept this and we don't believe you can read by touching dots and we don't believe you can type by poking holes.

652
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
That's impossible. That seems nuts.

653
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So when they did, they would do these tests with Louis and other students to be like, OK, you write one word and you spell, you know, and you read it with your dots.

654
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And they did. And then they'd say it's fake. They planned it.

655
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
They pre-planned the words and it wasn't to multiple, you know, variations that finally Braille was accepted.

656
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And now we're seeing the same thing with spelling to communicate.

657
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
They need a communication partner just like to read, you need glasses.

658
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
It doesn't mean they're not communicating on their own.

659
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
They just need someone to help support their motor control.

660
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Got it. So you're just using the term spelling in a different way.

661
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Yes.

662
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Most people are accustomed. That's why I want to clarify.

663
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yes, yes, yes.

664
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Super confused.

665
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Yes.

666
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So that seems like that's on them.

667
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I mean, if there's evidence that it works, like they should be brought up and people should say, like, what you're doing is a disservice, like a huge disservice for for whatever reason, for your own ego, for your own.

668
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Well, yeah, I mean, you think about it right for now, you know, decades.

669
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:29,000
If you have apraxia and you're a non speaker and you're considered you're not in there, people will will treat them, put them in school systems where they're trying to teach them to like behaviors that are impossible if you can't control your body.

670
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And then often teach them over and over colors and shapes and teach them like they're they're not getting it that they're not smart.

671
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So they've been robbed of their education.

672
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
They've been robbed of an entire livelihood.

673
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So to admit that we've been wrong about this entire population and educating them wrong.

674
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I mean, that's a lot of reckoning.

675
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
That's a lot of wrong.

676
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And ABA therapy, which is now what kids go into is a multibillion dollar industry.

677
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And I think that they profit very much so from having kids go into this type of therapy.

678
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And I think ABA therapy can be helpful for some people.

679
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It can be, you know, but for a lot of non speakers with apraxia, it's it's like traumatic because you're taught.

680
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
ABA therapy.

681
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It's behavior therapy.

682
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And that's like what insurance will cover.

683
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I do think it is.

684
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I think there's a huge financial gain.

685
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
ABA therapy.

686
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And I think it's all in bed together.

687
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And money fucks up.

688
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It does.

689
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
But it's like anyone listening to this.

690
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:27,000
The number one thing is that like if you think of a human rights violation, right, you that non speakers aren't allowed to go spell in schools to communicate, to participate socially.

691
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Right.

692
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
You know, because these are individuals with ideas and thoughts and career holes.

693
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And want to date and want to have friends and want to be involved.

694
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And and yes, they can't control their bodies, but they can do it.

695
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
They can communicate and and to be leaving them out because, oh, we can't afford it.

696
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
We don't believe that you should have a communication partner in school.

697
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It's so it's just mean it's a human rights violation.

698
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I think it's bizarre.

699
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah.

700
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I mean, that's yes.

701
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
It's also very bizarre.

702
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And it's.

703
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,100
It's bizarre.

704
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,560
Yeah, I mean, that's, yes, it's also very bizarre.

705
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:07,080
And it's just, it makes sense when you connect it to insurance and money in an industry.

706
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,360
That's where it gets gross.

707
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,840
They're against the competitors, which is probably truth.

708
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:19,660
Yeah, because if spelling, if you could be, if they'd say, hey, we will approve for spelling

709
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,380
to be covered by insurance, every family could go do this.

710
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,940
Right now you've just spent thousands of dollars, often go to a conference, do an online thing.

711
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,940
It's not cheap.

712
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:27,940
It's not affordable.

713
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,940
It's not easily accessible.

714
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,580
I mean, it can be depending on where you live, right?

715
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:34,180
But like, but it's, it's not easy.

716
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,620
That would be a lot more money to going away from AVA therapy.

717
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,620
Right.

718
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,620
Of course.

719
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,180
God, it's always the root of it all.

720
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:45,540
You get to it, there's someone who's profiting and doesn't want to stop profiting.

721
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,540
Yeah.

722
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,540
Yeah.

723
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:52,460
And the whole industry of a bunch of people working and yuck.

724
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:59,700
So you first recognize that there is some sort of an ability.

725
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:06,380
When do you start expanding your idea of what children can and can't do?

726
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,900
What, what, what they can and can't see?

727
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:14,780
Like when, when does it get to where you're at now?

728
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:19,580
So like spiritual gifts, when you start accepting those kinds of things.

729
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,580
Yeah.

730
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:26,460
I think the corroboration of person after person after person was really helpful.

731
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,460
You know?

732
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,260
Do you remember like the first one that made you reconsider or consider?

733
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,260
Well, okay.

734
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,940
So the telepathy was definitely that, okay, that became pretty quickly.

735
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,600
And it was really funny too, as how like the people working on this, like on my crew and

736
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:43,220
my camera guy and stuff, my GP Michael, like would quickly, we were all kind of like, okay,

737
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,220
this is happening.

738
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,680
Like you'd get almost bored seeing it, like because it became so common and so easy that

739
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:53,240
like the telepathy quickly became unimpressive, which is so wild to say out loud.

740
00:56:53,240 --> 00:57:01,160
But then it would be like, I remember Houston, who's a beloved individual, both in my life

741
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,720
and also in the project and his mom as well.

742
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:10,000
He had this relationship with stones where he could feel like the energy of crystals.

743
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,240
And Katie, his mom is, you know, an evangelical and didn't put much stock into any new age

744
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,240
thing.

745
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,600
And they gave her like a bag of crystals and stuff.

746
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,080
And she was like, come on, and kind of put those in her, you know, bathroom upstairs

747
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:28,200
behind one door and, you know, and Houston came home from school, like ran into the primary

748
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,960
bedroom and then went to the bathroom and found the rocks and like was so excited and

749
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,960
put them in lines next to his bed and wanted to put his head next to them.

750
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,280
And he could feel the energy coming from these stones.

751
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,000
And I always thought, okay, people believe in stones and maybe they matter because people

752
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,360
believe in them. But like, I didn't actually think they had energy of like healing gifts.

753
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,200
And here's Houston going, feeling the stones.

754
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,560
So that made me think, what?

755
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,880
Okay, maybe there's something here.

756
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,480
Enough individuals saying they could see auras around plants and animals and people.

757
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,280
So that was something I started being like, okay, this is happening enough and enough

758
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,880
that I believe that. And then the language was the next thing.

759
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,880
And that was pretty remarkable.

760
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,160
And I'm not saying every non-speaker has these gifts.

761
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,920
I'm just saying the people that I've met that have been a part of this project and there's

762
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,360
an awful lot ado.

763
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,880
And I think by the gifts change per person, too.

764
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,400
How often do you see the language thing?

765
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:28,600
You know, I should send out another like questionnaire, but probably every five individuals.

766
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,400
Wow.

767
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,400
You know, but like that's a rough number, but it would be interesting to like survey.

768
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:41,720
Are there any other data points that would indicate that someone would be more likely

769
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,960
to have these language skills?

770
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:50,480
Is there any factors about these individuals, like the differences in their conditions or

771
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,440
the environment?

772
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,360
Well, this is one thing that has been really remarkable.

773
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,080
I think especially since the Solopathy Apes came out is how much belief and just like

774
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:06,800
acceptance of these type of things matters for them to show themselves.

775
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,400
Right. So so I was talking to a parent the other day who's not in the telepathy tapes

776
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
of someone I've met through this.

777
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,680
And she said, look, my son, after the telepathy tapes came out, you know, he's about 19 said,

778
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,840
I need to come out to you. I can also read your mind, but just never felt comfortable

779
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,480
saying it because didn't think his parents would respond well.

780
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:30,000
Right. And and another teacher was telling me, look, now that this has come out and like

781
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:35,720
I've realized this to be a truth in her clinic or classroom, she will do 10 minutes for thought

782
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,040
sharing in the beginning of the day where they can all talk telepathy and hang out.

783
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,280
And she as she said, it's like the one of the only times when they're all quiet and

784
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,680
they're just thought sharing.

785
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:49,280
And she said that, you know, now that the telepathy is out, more and more parents are

786
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,120
like being told this and, you know, accepting it.

787
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:56,760
Because when I fell into this world before the telepathy tapes was out in the world,

788
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,560
almost every single parent or teacher I met was like thinking this was an individual miracle

789
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,800
happening alone in their house.

790
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,600
They couldn't tell anyone. Even sometimes the spouses were fighting.

791
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,920
I met one parent once not in the telepathy tapes, but I met her in the journey.

792
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,520
And she said, my husband wants to take my child away because he thinks I've lost my

793
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,960
mind by saying that this is happening.

794
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:20,800
Oh, geez. So, you know, so now that it's out there, I think it's a it's just think about

795
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,280
it. If you have kids, right, like if you believe in your kids, I believe you, I believe in

796
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,440
you. It makes a difference.

797
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,880
The placebo effect. Sure.

798
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,640
We know the placebo effect works.

799
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,000
If you believe in something, it makes a difference.

800
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:38,480
So when you say to a non-speaking individual, like I want to know all of you, I'm

801
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,960
excited to know all of you, even if that means that nothing you can tell me is going to

802
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,560
scare me or make you love you less.

803
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,840
So, you know, I think that's a cool way to approach anyone, really.

804
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:54,280
Yeah, certainly. And I think skepticism and cynicism is probably also contagious.

805
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:00,640
You probably feel that that negative doubting energy, which is very suppressing, you

806
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:06,000
know, just like and if you're already nonverbal and you're already like dealing with a

807
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,120
lot of other stuff like that negativity on top of it, you'd probably not want to even

808
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,440
try. Right. Yeah.

809
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,440
Yeah. There's a shame that I think just negative feelings.

810
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,400
Yeah. Yeah.

811
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:24,800
Yeah. Do you think this is something that you have?

812
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,160
I think we all have it.

813
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:32,760
I mean, have you have you tried to encourage it in yourself or have you tried to explore

814
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:41,480
it? Well, because I would imagine if I was doing this work, I'd be like, let me see if

815
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,520
I can do this. Yeah, yeah.

816
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,640
And for sure.

817
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:51,520
And I will, you know, I often pray at night and sometimes I'll also just beam out

818
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,920
thoughts to some of the non-speakers in my life and hope they catch them, you know.

819
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,920
And, you know, they're loving thoughts, usually, of course.

820
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:08,720
And then there's been a few times where I'll see a non-speaker that maybe, you know,

821
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:13,120
I've come to know and love in a dream and they're either communicating something to me

822
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,280
or, you know, write the parent in the morning and say, can you ask so and so if they were

823
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,320
trying to communicate X, Y, Z at all or, you know, were they trying to communicate with

824
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,360
me last night, is usually what I'll say.

825
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,480
And they'll say, oh, yeah, they wanted you to know blank, blank, blank, blank, blank.

826
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,520
And it'll be what happens.

827
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,360
So but that's only happened in dreams, not in real life.

828
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,800
I mean, dreams are real life.

829
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:37,520
But yeah, so I think I think this I think the more people are open to this and practicing

830
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,440
it, it's it's there.

831
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,440
You'll get there. And a lot of teachers are able to get it back to a telepathy where they

832
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,960
can start hearing their students back.

833
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,920
And they said, you know, there's a teacher and I love the story because she I heard her

834
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,840
on a podcast, actually, and it was sent to me.

835
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,440
I was like two years into my journey and this teacher thought no one else in the world was

836
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,480
going through this. And she said there's a student and he's telepathic and he can read

837
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,960
my thoughts. And then all of a sudden I started being able to hear him back and I'd be

838
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,160
cooking dinner and I'd hear him or and he would tell me things.

839
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,120
He'd just pop into my mind and he was younger.

840
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,360
So she had to set parameters that you can't come into my mind all the time.

841
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:18,920
But she said that in the classroom, then they started being able to teach just to do the

842
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,440
whole thing, the whole lesson without talking.

843
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,800
She'd ask him something in his head. He'd start typing it.

844
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,040
She'd ask something else in his head.

845
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:30,040
He'd start typing it. And that was something that like a lot of teachers have expressed

846
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,480
that or speech pathologists.

847
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:37,040
And and I've often wondered, why is it easier for the educator, you know, instead of the

848
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,040
parent? And I think it's because parents put so much stuff on our kids, right?

849
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:45,920
Like if I'm watching my son play basketball and he's not boxing out and he's not doing

850
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,280
this, I'm like, oh, good, oh, good, I can't even watch, you know.

851
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,160
But if it's someone else's kids, I'm like, oh, they're fine.

852
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,120
They're just learning. You know, I have no care if anyone else's kid is doing this.

853
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,520
But so I think with our kids, we put all this baggage on them even if we're not intending

854
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,960
it. Like the energy is so great, where if it's just free and you're just wide open and

855
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,000
you're just ready, I think some cool bond can often happen between me and between anyone.

856
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,280
But certainly, at least my experience has been more educators than parents that goes

857
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,360
into this two way thing.

858
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:21,360
This teacher, did they explain what the sensation was like, like hearing the words in

859
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,000
their head? Like, how did they how did they receive these things?

860
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,360
So at this point, there's a lot of teachers.

861
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,240
So I have like a little bit more data points on this.

862
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,280
And for her, she was hearing like a voice in her head, very clear, you know, very clear.

863
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,600
Was she hearing that she interpreted as the child's voice?

864
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,480
Was it a child's sound?

865
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,480
Yeah. Yeah. And that's what's so cool is for some of the individuals who've kind of gone

866
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,840
through this will say, you just know it's their voice, even though they don't have a voice

867
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,920
in the real world. Like, you just know it's their energy imprint, right?

868
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,000
Like, this is their voice.

869
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,720
And but then I've met some teachers who are like, no, it comes in as like a visual a

870
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,440
visual package, if you will.

871
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:02,440
Right. Like, or one of the most beautiful things I heard from a mom in England.

872
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,600
And I think her story is great because she knew this was going for years, was scared to

873
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,080
put it out there. She finally did.

874
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,360
I'm not getting any younger. I'm putting it out.

875
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,480
And then, of course, there's a lot of parents who are in England that were like, me, me,

876
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,840
too, me, too, me, too. This is happening to me.

877
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,440
And she once explained it to me in the most beautiful way.

878
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,560
She said, like, if you say the word with a word, Thanksgiving, you've just said the word

879
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,400
Thanksgiving. If you send it telepathically, you receive the smells, you receive the

880
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,760
sleeping in your childhood bed again, like your crotchety uncle who's mad about that,

881
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,040
like the game of, you know, the sound of the football game, maybe snow, you're this person

882
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:36,200
walking with the pie, like the prayer you say, whatever it is, all the things that make

883
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,320
your experience that comes to you.

884
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:44,200
And there's no there's no misunderstanding what this means and feels and is.

885
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,640
And it's this whole expansive idea.

886
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,120
So I think she she receives things that way.

887
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,000
Wow. Yeah, it's really cool.

888
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:00,880
It's so cool, but it's also because of the cultural restrictions that we have.

889
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:07,880
Put on the idea of telepathic communication, even while you're saying this, I'm so

890
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,600
fascinated and I believe it for sure.

891
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,400
Part of me is like, shut up, you know what I mean?

892
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,880
It's like that part of you is strong.

893
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,960
Yeah. That and I wonder if that part of us, unfortunately, because of all the

894
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:26,440
charlatans and because of the cultural restrictions on just the concept of

895
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:32,240
telepathy, I wonder how much of that holds us back because there's some things that

896
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,840
you do know and you don't know why you know them.

897
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:40,520
You know, and if you're a person who goes on instincts, you'll follow those instincts

898
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,320
and you go, I have no idea how I knew that was the right thing to do.

899
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,440
But it was. Yeah, yeah.

900
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:50,800
Yeah, I mean, look, I think one thing is experiencing something.

901
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,000
You just believe it, like I said.

902
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:00,760
And I think anyone who has engaged with walks into a room with a non-speaker going to

903
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:06,360
do this, which from my experience has been quite a few, it's not hard to see.

904
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,120
And it's pretty easy to to witness it.

905
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:13,600
And so when you experience something over and over and over again, right, it's like.

906
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,520
Are all these parents and teachers all around the world and speech pathologists and

907
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,720
principals and ministers and rabbis and everyone who's witnessed this lying, did they

908
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,440
all come in this great conspiracy to decide that we're going to trick the world or

909
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,600
they're experiencing something and telling the truth?

910
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,840
And the first one is out there.

911
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,920
That's like the most impossible thing to imagine.

912
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:38,880
The other thing I want to say, too, is like there's a motivation for someone who's a

913
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,600
charlatan, right? You want to make money off of someone or something when especially

914
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,680
when they're the most vulnerable, you're going to exploit this and et cetera, et

915
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,400
cetera. Or it's for your own ego, your gain or career or whatever.

916
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,600
You know, to date, because non-speakers have not been able to have the resources that

917
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,640
they need to spell and engage in society, they've not been able to have a career yet.

918
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:02,640
I mean, some have, but very few or make money on their own or, you know, be in the

919
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,720
popular crowd or have some cool whatever.

920
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,360
And and so what's to gain?

921
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,480
What is to gain?

922
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:13,280
And it's also to take so much energy off and to spell out something, I can't imagine

923
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,560
that you'd spell out a lie.

924
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,840
I mean, there's nothing to gain in this entire population talking about this in silos

925
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,880
all over the world.

926
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,640
Right. And also very few people engage with nonverbal people.

927
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:36,680
So for this to be this very bizarre sort of strange phenomenon that's happening

928
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:42,240
with these people, you would have to be in that experience with those people to even

929
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,440
be able to appreciate what's going on.

930
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:50,280
Yeah, I think most people, you know, we're so accustomed to talking, we're so

931
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:54,920
accustomed to typing things out and communicating the way we do normally that we

932
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,840
don't we don't even think about what the experience is like for both the parents and

933
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,200
the child. And that this is a completely different way of living.

934
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:11,160
So whatever these innate abilities that we may have, of course, they would be the ones who

935
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,160
would have them. It kind of makes sense that they would be the ones that would be so

936
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:20,840
tuned into us, whereas us, we're sort of probably drowning those thoughts, even if they

937
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:26,080
do exist. We're drowning them off with language, with cultural expectations, with social

938
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,400
media, with news and yeah, with thought.

939
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,960
Yeah, with everything, with all this.

940
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,280
We're bombarded. We're never even alone with our thoughts anymore.

941
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,160
We're just bombarded constantly 24 7.

942
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,640
And I mean, this is the number one criticism about social media is shaping your mind in a

943
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,320
way that you're not even asking.

944
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,480
You don't really don't have agency over it.

945
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:49,280
You're just constantly being bombarded with data and that data, whether you like it or

946
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:54,040
not, even if you're objective, it's it's changing the way you interface with the world.

947
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,920
These people aren't experiencing any of that.

948
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,240
I mean, I think they're probably experience like I think they have so much input coming

949
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,240
in, you know, that it can be overwhelming.

950
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,520
But right. It's not informing their.

951
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,000
Yeah, I mean, not engaging.

952
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,280
Yeah, they're not engaging. Yeah.

953
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,280
Yeah. Yeah.

954
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,320
Yeah, it's really it's really remarkable, you know.

955
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:22,160
Well, beyond right now, because it changes the way we think about human beings.

956
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,760
It changes what our potential is.

957
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:29,240
I've always thought that it was an emerging aspect of human consciousness.

958
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:34,200
But then as time has gone on, I think I start to think probably more than that.

959
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,280
It's probably has always been there.

960
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:42,640
Yeah. We, you know, I mean, animals have weird abilities that we don't understand,

961
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,840
like the ability that birds have to to navigate.

962
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,640
We don't understand what that is.

963
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,040
We don't understand how they're doing that.

964
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:57,520
But we know they do it, you know, and they they have also there's some ability that

965
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,520
animals have to read electrical signals, to read magnetic signals.

966
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,240
What is what's going on there? Yeah.

967
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,240
What what are they doing?

968
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:10,200
You know, Rupert Sheldrake, again, who's in the project, he he's the biologist from

969
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,080
Cambridge. He talks about something called the mental field.

970
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,440
And that was like a good handle for me to start to understand how this could be possible.

971
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,960
And so by that, we know that fields can exist beyond something.

972
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,000
And we take it as part of science.

973
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,200
Like we know the earth has a gravitational field.

974
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,080
You can't see it. You know, it's there.

975
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,480
But but you know, it's it's real.

976
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,160
And we know that magnets have a magnetic field that we can you know, you can't see it.

977
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,600
But you know, it's there. And so his theory is that our mind has a mental field that

978
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,840
extends outside of the brain and this mental field can like overlap with someone.

979
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,600
And that a great example of the mental field, if you will, would be when you see like a

980
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,640
murmur of birds or a school of fish and they're all turning exact same time.

981
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,120
They don't bump into each other.

982
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,360
They're not like having concussions left and right.

983
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,520
The bird ones, the wild. It's wild.

984
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,920
It's like they do it. It's almost like they have a school of fish is essentially

985
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,000
the same thing, but in the water, in the water.

986
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,360
And and it's like they have one mind.

987
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,160
Right. It does feel like one mind.

988
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:07,320
And so this this beautiful idea, it's not it's not it's just out there.

989
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:11,680
And one of the things I came across that I absolutely adored as well was that Mark Twain,

990
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,320
he had he coined this term mental telegraphy.

991
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,240
And what he was responding to was kind of what we think of as phone telepathy, but

992
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,760
that someone would write a letter.

993
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,480
Let's say he wrote a letter to make something up, a great aunt Margaret.

994
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:29,120
Right. And he and he hadn't written to her in seven years and he postmarked it on

995
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:33,040
March 2nd. Well, you know, maybe two weeks later, he got a letter from Aunt Margaret

996
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,280
post March, March 2nd.

997
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:38,840
And that would happen a lot in the time of letter swapping that at the same time,

998
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,400
both people thought of each other. They hadn't written to each other a long time.

999
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,400
The letters were postmarked on the same day.

1000
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,520
You know what happened the same day.

1001
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,520
And there was such a concrete evidence there of wow.

1002
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,440
And so he wrote a lot about that.

1003
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,440
He thought that was fascinating, you know, and like,

1004
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:56,160
Upton Sinclair, who wrote The Jungle, you know, wonderful author.

1005
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:01,080
He wrote a book called Mental Radio where he was trying to do telepathy experiments

1006
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,920
with his wife and she would think of something or vice versa.

1007
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,120
And they draw it out.

1008
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:09,320
And he had done this so many times that he talks about this is real.

1009
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,880
I know this to be true because I've experimented it and heard I can thought share.

1010
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,920
And so, you know, it's like we have examples of this throughout recent history.

1011
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,960
But I definitely think if you go back to many native cultures,

1012
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,760
I mean, even the Vikings, the Druids, whoever, like none of this would be shocking.

1013
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,040
Right. It's they're not going to go try to prove this.

1014
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,400
This is part and parcel of being human.

1015
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:31,760
And I think it still is.

1016
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:36,120
But to your point, it's just been buried by the noise that we've filled up our lives with.

1017
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:41,080
Yeah. Like our feet aren't the same shape anymore because we don't walk barefoot.

1018
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,400
You know, our feet are atrophied and gotten withered and twisted and weak.

1019
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,920
And that's one of the reasons why people wear barefoot shoes, right?

1020
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,040
Yeah, because they want to engage their toes.

1021
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,440
And if you don't, your foot atrophies and becomes weird.

1022
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,880
It just makes sense that your mind or these

1023
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,840
abilities of consciousness would also atrophy because they're never used,

1024
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,880
because it's so easy to communicate with words.

1025
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,160
And so and it's the and also you're dealing with other people

1026
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:10,000
manipulating those words and trying to decipher whether or not this is true or not.

1027
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,800
And yeah, yeah.

1028
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,960
And I mean, you know, energy, right?

1029
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,000
You did martial arts and stuff.

1030
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,680
So you understand, like if someone's energy, how it can impact you.

1031
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:22,120
And I think that like most of us have some sense of like you walk into a room

1032
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:26,040
and someone just like, oh, they're killing you or like if you're really,

1033
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,480
you know, I think energy is a real thing.

1034
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,680
Sure. But I think as far as like these gifts go or whatever, like telepathy,

1035
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,560
you know, we've all had that experience where someone's like,

1036
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,040
oh, I just knew the second they died, like I felt it.

1037
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,960
Like I felt the ground in my apartment and I have no idea.

1038
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,720
And then I got the phone call or or my aunt came to me in a dream last night

1039
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,880
and said, I love you and I'm always here and whatever.

1040
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,920
And then like the next day they get the phone call, their aunt died.

1041
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,520
And there's so many stories like that we hear just an everyday life. Right.

1042
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,720
Sure. So, again, like it's just if we sat back and really thought about this,

1043
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,360
this isn't wild. This is part of the human experience. Right.

1044
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,000
And the non-speakers are just the great skies. Yeah.

1045
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,960
Yeah. It's really weird to look at it in reverse, though, for me,

1046
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,200
because like I said, I did think it was an emerging aspect,

1047
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,200
but now I think it's probably not.

1048
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:18,640
It's probably something that's been buried by our technology

1049
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,240
or our progress. Yeah. We think it's progress.

1050
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,400
It's easier to communicate with people with noises and saying that,

1051
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,880
but we're probably missing this thing that used to be a part of us.

1052
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,120
And it comes in these little blips. Yeah. Little weird, you know, waves,

1053
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,400
especially heightened anxiety or heightened, you know,

1054
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,720
anytime you're stimulated in some sort of a way, which makes sense.

1055
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:45,120
Why? With psychedelic drugs, which dissolves the ego,

1056
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,120
you have more of those. Right. Right. This is right.

1057
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:53,440
So if you try to expand your ability

1058
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,800
in any way, have you have you tried to meditate

1059
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:02,120
and try to find where that is inside your consciousness?

1060
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,960
In the beginning, I think when I was starting to go into this,

1061
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,200
I was meditating a lot and doing a lot of stuff.

1062
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:11,200
But but right now, I'm so focused on just getting the story out

1063
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,880
that it's like all my time is put on that.

1064
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,280
And I've kind of put my own like stuff aside for a little bit here.

1065
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,120
But I mean, meditation, I think that's the number one way

1066
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,760
to to help open up anything mental. Right.

1067
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,120
I mean, that's and meditation, like 20, 30, 30 years ago

1068
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,400
was considered kind of fringe and out there and the idea that it could benefit you.

1069
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,080
Scientists looking into that were kind of like, oh, this guy's kind of, you know.

1070
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,000
And and now it's that those people were right.

1071
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,840
Yeah. The response has been insane.

1072
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,120
Like the the telepathy tapes shot to the top of the charts,

1073
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,760
like everybody was talking to me about it and sending it to me

1074
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:53,200
before I ever wound up listening is that it's got to be gratifying

1075
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,000
in some sort of way that like at least people are responding to this

1076
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,920
and they're very excited about it.

1077
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,080
Yeah, I think so.

1078
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,520
And I think, I mean, definitely it's gratifying.

1079
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,400
But, you know, the story behind that is pretty remarkable.

1080
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,600
And that's, I think, one of the things that was most gratifying

1081
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,560
because I never intended to make a podcast.

1082
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,960
You know, I was trying to make a documentary of this.

1083
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,640
And then the documentary became so big that I was like, oh, maybe I have to make it as docu

1084
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,640
series, like pitched it to a bunch of, you know,

1085
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
streamers and stuff.

1086
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,720
And I think people loved it.

1087
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,160
And they were like, oh, this is such a good pitch.

1088
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,680
And oh, my gosh. But like, it doesn't fit our mandate.

1089
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,200
Like, what is it? It's not true crime.

1090
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,680
It's not this. It's not that.

1091
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,880
And so everywhere we pitched said, no, everywhere we pitched.

1092
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,920
And I remember going home and feeling devastated

1093
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,640
because I thought this was the most important news in the world.

1094
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,840
How could anyone like this is this needs to get out there and thinking

1095
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,080
it's the end of the road. I can't afford to go do a documentary of my own.

1096
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,160
I can't do this and can't do that.

1097
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,320
And I was just like, you know, and and I thought this could be a good podcast,

1098
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,800
but I never made one.

1099
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,840
So then it was sort of like this will be my final pitch.

1100
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,120
Like, hopefully someone will notice and then we can get the film funded.

1101
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:59,960
And so I made the podcast as just like a desperate like Hail Mary.

1102
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,360
Like someone listen to this, please, and fun documentary.

1103
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,640
And then it like went crazy.

1104
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,800
And it was what was so funny, too,

1105
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,800
is when I first started telling a lot of families and stuff about the podcast,

1106
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,880
they were like, I don't know if that's a great idea because just feeling

1107
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,080
is so you have to see it to believe it, to know that they're really not touched

1108
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,240
and that they're really communicating and telepathy.

1109
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,880
You have to see to believe like none of this will work as a podcast.

1110
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,960
And it was just that lightning bolt again, you know, like, no, no, no.

1111
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,720
This is it. This is it. You guys like this is it.

1112
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,080
Like, I just know it's going to be great.

1113
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,680
And they were like, you know, and so the fact that it did what it did

1114
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,600
is just humbling and I think so well deserved for the non-speakers.

1115
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,080
And those parents and teachers who are brave enough, right,

1116
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,240
to tell their stories finally.

1117
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,600
Yeah, I'm glad you decided to follow that instinct

1118
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,720
because the podcast is the perfect way to do it because podcasts

1119
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,280
are easily shareable. Yeah.

1120
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,680
So that's how things really get out there.

1121
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,520
Someone tells you about it. You tell other people about it.

1122
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,880
You go on a podcast, tell people about your podcast.

1123
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,400
And that's that's what starts it. Yeah.

1124
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,440
I mean, so and I think the medium, too, is so I never realized

1125
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:04,000
what a special medium it is because you're talking directly into someone's ears.

1126
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:09,160
And you're just in their mind like and just can talk to them for a few hours.

1127
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,040
And this was a story that we needed some real long.

1128
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,280
Yes. You know, exploration.

1129
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,840
Also, it's fascinating.

1130
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,360
And that's what you really want out of a podcast other than humor.

1131
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,160
You want it to be fascinating.

1132
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:25,120
Yeah. You know, you you want it to lock in and excite you.

1133
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,400
Yeah. And that certainly does that.

1134
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:33,160
And I think most people want to believe, you know. Yeah.

1135
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:38,160
Yeah. And I would not have put my time and effort and money into this if it wasn't real.

1136
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,800
I mean, it is it is real.

1137
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,680
And people don't have to take my word for it.

1138
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,960
Like they could just go start working with a speller.

1139
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,800
And again, not all spellers, I think, maybe.

1140
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,840
I don't know. Who knows?

1141
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:53,560
But I think these are gifts are pretty easy to see if you start engaging with.

1142
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:56,080
Yeah. Well, it certainly seems like it.

1143
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:00,280
So what so has the film started?

1144
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,360
Have you where you are right now?

1145
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:07,120
So we our first day of filming was yesterday, which is really exciting.

1146
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:11,920
Yeah. Yeah. And so we yeah, we're off to the races.

1147
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,760
We have five non-speaking members of our production team, which is awesome.

1148
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,200
Oh, wow. So cool.

1149
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:21,040
Like two are specializing in like working on graphics and depicting what

1150
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,960
things that they talk about look like, like the chat on the hill.

1151
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,360
I don't know if you've heard of this telepathic chat room where non-speakers hang out.

1152
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,600
We can come back to that.

1153
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,320
And like the realms where maybe they get information.

1154
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,040
So or just even what it means to see auras or to see stuff like that.

1155
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:40,400
So we have two graphics kind of advisors

1156
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,600
that will be working with the graphics house on that stuff.

1157
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,200
We have a scientific advisor who's going to help us figure out

1158
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,680
how to best do the telepathy tapes with the scientists that we'll be working with.

1159
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,040
And then two story kind of consultants.

1160
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:55,440
So it's really cool to all five of these individuals.

1161
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,200
I believe it's the first paying job they've ever had.

1162
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,520
So that's it's just cool having them on our team.

1163
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,600
So what is this chat on the hill?

1164
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:08,880
OK, so that was one of the harder things to wrap my head around.

1165
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:13,640
When I first met Katie in Houston,

1166
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,360
Katie said, you know, Houston talks about this telepathic chat room

1167
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,960
where he can go hang out with his friends.

1168
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,920
You can kind of tune into the telepathic chat room.

1169
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,840
And and that and he teaches there, too.

1170
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,880
And it's a place where they can commune and talk and encourage you.

1171
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,960
He teaches in the telepathic chat room.

1172
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,480
Yeah. Houston's like really special.

1173
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,640
He really is. And he's and and I think there are different roles

1174
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,880
that this person might talk about plant energy and this person might talk about this.

1175
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,680
And I've heard this down from. Well, let's just back up.

1176
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,480
So how many people are in this telepathic chat room?

1177
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:50,640
Well, I don't know. But but well, I'll get to that answer.

1178
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,040
Let me just so because I think that's an interesting thing.

1179
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,960
So Houston started talking about this,

1180
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,280
what he calls the talk on the hill, which is this telepathic chat room.

1181
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:02,960
And then I met his good friend, John Paul, who's also kind of based in Atlanta.

1182
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,360
And John Paul would go up to his room and put four pillows on his head.

1183
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,080
And his mom was like, he's on the hill.

1184
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,760
And this is what he does to kind of get everything out, all the sounds of the house

1185
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,040
so we can really concentrate and get there.

1186
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,960
And, you know, she said he really has like

1187
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:21,200
developed a beautiful relationship with his girlfriend on the hill.

1188
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,800
And that and I'm like, what?

1189
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,440
So I didn't know what to make of it, only I knew that it felt very real to these parents.

1190
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,680
And and and these individuals and people were talking about it in Atlanta.

1191
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:34,080
So I thought, OK, this might be an Atlanta thing that these individuals are doing this.

1192
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,880
They don't have to be in the same room, the same zip code that they can connect.

1193
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:41,480
And on the day I met John Paul, he was on the hill at one point.

1194
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,480
And I asked that question, I said, how many people are on the hill right now?

1195
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,280
And I think he wrote like 4000 something.

1196
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,960
And I was like, holy cow, it seems like a lot.

1197
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,360
He's like, well, people are really excited about the documentary right now.

1198
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,080
So everyone's tuning in to find out what's happening with this.

1199
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,400
So I was like, whoa.

1200
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:00,560
And then and then I just like buried that in my heart.

1201
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,880
This is something that is real in Atlanta.

1202
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,560
And then I was talking to like the next big woe.

1203
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,480
Again, telepathy tapes was not out yet.

1204
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:12,440
I met a minister in Arizona who had like the largest youth

1205
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,920
like special needs youth ministry or something.

1206
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,840
And I was on Zoom with him because he was like found out about the telepathy

1207
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,800
and found out about these gifts.

1208
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,200
And there was a person in his congregation

1209
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:25,000
who could predict the future and see things happening in other spaces in the world.

1210
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,880
And he was just, you know, I think we were connecting to be like,

1211
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:29,960
OK, yeah, you've seen this.

1212
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,520
OK, let's talk about this.

1213
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,000
And he was kind of going through his list of what he's witnessed

1214
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,120
with the individuals in his ministry.

1215
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:39,040
And one of the things he said to me was I was on Zoom the other day

1216
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,800
with another young individual or another individual from Minnesota

1217
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,120
getting these to connect to connect.

1218
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,960
And they start talking about something called the Hill.

1219
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,160
They go to this place called the Hill.

1220
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,240
Have you ever heard about this?

1221
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,520
And I almost fell out of my chair.

1222
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,640
And then maybe like a few months after that,

1223
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,200
I was talking to a teacher and she goes, you know, some of my students,

1224
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:58,960
have you ever heard about this?

1225
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,000
They talk about going to some place called the Hill.

1226
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,040
And one of them talks as he goes there to learn about time travel.

1227
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,760
And the other one likes to talk about someone from from Norway

1228
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,560
who talks about the bees and beekeeping and beach stuff.

1229
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:14,120
And at that point, I mean, my head is exploding just like,

1230
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,400
wait, it's like real, like, jeez, you know.

1231
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:22,600
And then there's a father in Israel

1232
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:26,160
who I have talked to a lot about this over the years.

1233
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,280
And he's kept a really good track, too, of like how telepathy

1234
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,840
has been buried in the spelling community and in the education community

1235
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,800
and what's been going on and how teachers are being fired.

1236
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,840
So he's fascinating.

1237
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,600
But one of the things he told me, he's like, oh, yeah, we have a separate hill

1238
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:42,280
in Israel where a lot of the orthodox, like Jewish folks go

1239
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,720
and they have their own hill.

1240
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,720
And then I and then I would get some emails and be like, you know,

1241
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,160
there's also a hill in Arizona and Florida, like there's different hills.

1242
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,320
So it's it's a mystery.

1243
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,200
It's a magical mystery.

1244
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,160
But they all call it the same thing.

1245
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,480
Yeah. And I don't.

1246
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,440
And then I've also met like after the telepathy tapes came out,

1247
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:03,480
one family wrote me and said, hey, my son has said he has telepathy.

1248
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,720
No doubt there.

1249
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,080
But he can only do it with people in the room.

1250
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,360
But he's never been to the hill. How does he get to the hill?

1251
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,240
And I thought, I don't know.

1252
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,640
I guess ask another non-speaker who maybe can teach you

1253
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,440
how to like dial into the right frequency.

1254
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,600
You know, I'm not exactly sure how that works.

1255
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,320
But it's really it's it's awesome.

1256
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:25,120
You know, now is there one hill or is there many hills?

1257
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,040
I think there's a few hills.

1258
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:32,560
And have they verified that people who are communicating

1259
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,800
in this hill are actually communicating with these individuals?

1260
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,840
Yeah. And in fact, that's one of the storylines in the film

1261
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,760
that I'm really excited about.

1262
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:46,360
Like one of the subjects is a young girl who's always felt pretty isolated.

1263
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,480
You know, it's hard sometimes to make friends

1264
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,520
if you're not able to communicate school or whatever.

1265
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,040
So but she was bringing up names and has brought up names

1266
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:58,240
that her mom was like, you know, they're not in her school.

1267
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,080
They're not in our periphery.

1268
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,840
They're not in any of our social stuff.

1269
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,920
And then once the telepathy tapes came out, these Facebook groups

1270
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,360
sprang up of families that were kind of going through the stuff.

1271
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:10,040
And in that process, she found, I think, like four of these individuals

1272
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,080
that her daughter was saying she was really good friends with on the hill.

1273
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,560
And they also say they go to the hill.

1274
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1275
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:20,080
And so we've like corroborated all these points in this girl's life.

1276
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:24,960
Have you tried to corroborate actual distribution of information,

1277
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,480
actual communication?

1278
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,080
Mm hmm. Yeah. You've done that?

1279
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,040
Mm hmm. Yeah. It's yeah.

1280
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:33,880
I mean, that's of course, like you have to imagine for everyone

1281
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,360
in this world, all the families that I'm close to and teachers

1282
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,240
and therapists and stuff, it's still remarkable.

1283
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,840
So anytime someone says something, we will try to validate it.

1284
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,640
Like this person just said they saw this person on the hill.

1285
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,400
Can you validate, validate, validate they were there?

1286
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,600
And then, oh, my gosh, yes.

1287
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,080
What did they talk about? This was said and this was said, hey,

1288
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,160
this person says that person is on the hill and talking about blank.

1289
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,200
Oh, yeah, I can verify that that person teaches about that on the hill.

1290
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:03,280
So like it's not like anyone is taking any of this just in stride.

1291
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,440
Like, you know, I think there's still that human nature

1292
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,800
like you're talking about that, like even the parents and teachers

1293
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,800
and me and the people on the front lines of this are still always trying

1294
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,680
to validate it. Like this happened.

1295
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,840
Was that true? Did you get that same thing?

1296
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,560
And then there's that moment of like, oh, my God.

1297
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,520
Like that's happening with all of us all the time, too.

1298
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,920
That mind blowing. Wow.

1299
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,920
That just, you know, bore out.

1300
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,080
It's remarkable when it happens that the hill thing is next level.

1301
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,200
It's next level. And why is it the hill?

1302
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,440
Why do they call it the hill universally?

1303
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,200
Well, Houston named it the chat on the hill. He named it.

1304
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,640
Mm hmm. Now the other kids name it.

1305
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,600
I think they're all saying it as well, though, right?

1306
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,600
They're all saying the same term. Yeah.

1307
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,760
But I mean, just like I, you know, someone named this cup

1308
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,880
and we're all calling a cup, right?

1309
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,000
I think like it just spreads.

1310
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,600
So you think that child Houston, he named it.

1311
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,320
And then everybody else accepted that name.

1312
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,920
Yeah. He didn't hear it from someone else.

1313
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,040
I mean, he might have.

1314
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,320
That's the question. Like, what is the name?

1315
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,760
Like, why on the hill?

1316
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,760
Well, I've asked people that.

1317
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,880
And one one individual is like, it just feels more like a hill of thoughts,

1318
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:09,680
like just this like mound of just like thoughts and energy and being.

1319
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,800
And so I wonder what they're seeing.

1320
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,360
Well, we're working on that for the film.

1321
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,920
That's like why we have these two graphics,

1322
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,760
non-speaker advisors, so they can work to make us understand

1323
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:21,880
what it looks like to them.

1324
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,680
Oh, mm hmm.

1325
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,760
And then once actually once the telepathy tapes was done,

1326
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,120
I started releasing something called the talk tracks, where we like

1327
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,520
keep going with answering some of the questions.

1328
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,600
And one of them was this

1329
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,600
a young man who reached out after episode two.

1330
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,240
And he's like, I want to help or volunteer for you.

1331
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,440
And I was like, go work with some non-speakers.

1332
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,840
That's going to be the best thing in the world.

1333
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,480
And he witnessed the telepathy right away.

1334
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,240
He witnessed a few other things.

1335
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:48,200
And he ends up in the first talk tracks episode getting to the hill.

1336
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:53,000
And his story is really beautiful as to how as a neurotypical man,

1337
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,160
he was able to do that.

1338
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,160
But people need to listen to it because it's really cool.

1339
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,880
So he figured out how to get to the hill.

1340
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,880
Mm hmm. Yeah, yeah.

1341
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,680
And what does he describe it as?

1342
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,920
Well, he said it's divinely protected, that there seems to be divinely.

1343
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:07,800
Mm hmm.

1344
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,680
There seems to be like some sort of guide there that like you can't just go in

1345
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,640
like Halliburton, can't go rip it off.

1346
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:17,160
You know, like there's like like it seems to be guarded

1347
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,320
and that only people with good intentions can go.

1348
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,960
And I think I mean, I hope people don't try to start going there.

1349
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,040
I really, really don't.

1350
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,440
Oh, they're going to non-spinoff.

1351
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,840
I know it's like one of the pains actually for me is that like,

1352
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,720
in putting this out there, like.

1353
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,120
But I do think the non-speakers are in charge there.

1354
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,480
It's their space is a beautiful space.

1355
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,760
And and and I don't think anyone can just get let in.

1356
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:44,240
You have to really be open, open, but not just open, have a good, good intention.

1357
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:46,000
Right. Completely pure.

1358
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,440
Pureness and love are a big part of this.

1359
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:51,640
And this person who's typical, regular person got in there.

1360
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:57,400
Had they had any experience in the past with any form of telepathy before this?

1361
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,960
Well, the reason his story is so beautiful.

1362
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,920
So again, he's an episode one of the talk tracks.

1363
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,560
And what happened is he had he was diagnosed with

1364
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:10,320
a really rare like autoimmune disease and then like stage four cancer.

1365
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,680
And he kind of realized, like, if I need to I need to save my life,

1366
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:18,000
I'm going to die if I don't learn to, like, think, control my thoughts.

1367
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,360
And and he was able to cure himself.

1368
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,520
And he sent me scans and the cancer was almost all gone.

1369
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:27,840
But I think that that attention to thought and how thought

1370
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,640
can change your world and dictate what happens in your world

1371
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:35,760
really did something in his brain that allowed him to live in that mental space.

1372
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,800
And I think that helped him.

1373
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,440
I think that really helped him get to the hill.

1374
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,160
I mean, he he talks about more of how he got there.

1375
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,240
And it took a few times.

1376
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,720
And for him, it was all audible.

1377
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,960
It felt like static and certain voices.

1378
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,440
But then he said he did a few tests like there was a

1379
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,680
one of the students he works with.

1380
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:59,280
He's like, I knew exactly who it was and I could hear their voice.

1381
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,040
I just knew it was her voice, even though I've never heard their voice.

1382
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,360
But I just knew it was their energy.

1383
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,960
I just knew it was them.

1384
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,520
And he's like, so I gave a test and I said, I'm going to tell you

1385
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,120
this person's name and this person's name and this person's name.

1386
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,160
And, you know, gave them kind of a bunch of information.

1387
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:14,280
And so when I see you next, you need to tell me this stuff.

1388
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:17,920
And then when he saw that person next, they they wrote it.

1389
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,520
They spelled it out for him.

1390
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,640
Whoa. Yeah, yeah.

1391
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:25,040
So I do think the people experimenting experimenting with this

1392
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:29,200
have their own deep desire to get it right and try to validate stuff.

1393
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,960
You know, it's hard just to take on face value.

1394
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,160
How do you know if it's real or if it's in your own mind? Right.

1395
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:38,600
But the weird thing is like, if this does, I mean,

1396
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:42,680
I'm sure you've opened up a lot of people's minds to this.

1397
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:48,520
And again, if this expands and then we all agree

1398
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,240
that this is a thing and this is a possible thing

1399
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:59,040
and then people start trying to figure out what it is and develop methods

1400
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,440
to try to tap into that.

1401
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,760
This could be a profound change in just society as a whole.

1402
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,720
Yeah. Yeah.

1403
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:11,400
And I think the thing I hear the most, right,

1404
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,400
is people are afraid of their thoughts being out there.

1405
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,720
But what's kind of cool on your head that you're so worried about.

1406
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:19,200
Exactly. Well, that's how about clean your brain out.

1407
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,760
Exactly. Clean your brain out.

1408
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:21,960
You're not going to be afraid of that. Right.

1409
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:24,720
Yeah. What's going on in your head that you don't want anybody to know?

1410
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:27,000
Totally. What are your terrible thoughts?

1411
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,600
It's interesting because when people say that, I do because

1412
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,640
I mean, we all have certain stuff that like who cares

1413
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,800
if someone knows that way all happens to us, right?

1414
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,800
Like you're worried about having something in your teeth or something

1415
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:41,080
or like, you know, accidentally pass gas and whatever.

1416
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,080
I mean, that type of stuff, I think, who cares?

1417
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,200
So that like that's just being human. Right.

1418
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,680
But when people are like that terrified, it's like,

1419
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,320
what the hell is going on with you?

1420
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,480
Yeah, I think it's the concept of it too.

1421
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,280
And also the concept.

1422
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,680
I think there's the thought that if someone can read your mind,

1423
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,640
that you're more vulnerable, that you can't protect yourself.

1424
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,880
Like, you know, like if you like, oh, this person's creepy.

1425
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,920
Let me get away from them. Oh, you think I'm creepy?

1426
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,200
You know, like that kind of thing.

1427
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:10,200
Like that you won't you won't be able to just like avoid people.

1428
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,120
I do think you have some control over it, though.

1429
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,800
And again, I can only go off of what I've heard from others. But like

1430
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,040
one of the teachers who's been just she's been such an advocate

1431
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,800
and fighter in this world for years trying to point to this.

1432
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,960
And she said the first experience she ever had

1433
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:29,600
around maybe not the first, but one of the most cementing experiences

1434
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,800
was she was going to go visit a former student class.

1435
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,760
And the night before, this is wild.

1436
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,400
The night before, she went out and picked like Swedish fish and,

1437
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,480
you know, some donuts and, you know, I forgot what else.

1438
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,600
Pretzels or something.

1439
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:43,080
And so she comes in to give him his favorite snacks

1440
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,400
and forgot them in the car.

1441
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,120
But she went and she sat with him and talked with him.

1442
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:50,040
And right before she was leaving the classroom, he took out a pen

1443
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:54,680
and drew like a donut, a fish, you know, and kind of drew the things that she

1444
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,880
and it like rattles her to her core.

1445
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,440
Like she he knew what she was thinking that night before.

1446
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,480
And and now that he's, you know, graduated,

1447
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,280
she still works with him just as an volunteer basis

1448
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,400
for the sheer joy of just being with him.

1449
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:13,040
And she asked him years later, how did you do that?

1450
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,240
And and and he like, were you remote viewing through me?

1451
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,640
And how did you know at that moment?

1452
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,480
He's like, well, once you were thinking of me, that was like my invitation

1453
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,160
to come in, like I won't just crash into someone's thoughts.

1454
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:28,880
It's like I have to be kind of invited in by like, you know, like the thought.

1455
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:33,320
So so I do think that there's a way to kind of control it.

1456
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,320
And I know that the teacher that was having the student

1457
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,520
jump into her brain a lot, the younger man, she said, like,

1458
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:43,280
you need to stop that, like if I will invite you in when I want you.

1459
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,320
But you can't just come into my mind whenever that's not appropriate.

1460
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,440
You know, right.

1461
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,440
And and so I think every individual is an individual. Right.

1462
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:56,120
I mean, how this stuff works and is probably different for each person.

1463
01:34:56,120 --> 01:35:00,960
But I don't necessarily think, you know, what many spellers have told me

1464
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:04,080
is like, good, good energy allows them to swap thoughts.

1465
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,440
Like, good juju allows them to do that.

1466
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,480
Being invited in, being open to it.

1467
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,200
It doesn't feel like they can just go into like, you know,

1468
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,760
the person running for sentence thoughts and be like,

1469
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,560
haha, actually, you didn't fund them, you know. Right.

1470
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,920
The problem is, like, what if people get really good at that?

1471
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:25,760
Like, what if it expands and then people are just entering

1472
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,200
into your thoughts all the time?

1473
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:30,240
I think technologically, that's going to happen anyway.

1474
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,960
Yeah. You know, it's one of the things that Elon has said about this

1475
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,760
Neuralink device that they're enabling.

1476
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,320
You're going to be able to talk without words. Yeah.

1477
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,760
Yeah. But here's the thing, too, right.

1478
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:46,400
It's like, again, I think most almost every non-speaker I've met,

1479
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,440
their concern is love, unity. Right.

1480
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,120
And so if your thoughts are other people and your thoughts are loving

1481
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,320
and about unity, it's not scary then for other people

1482
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,680
to be reading your thoughts.

1483
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,680
You're going to be caring about other people, hopefully.

1484
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:00,960
And the real thought, the real scary thing is that there are a lot of people

1485
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,560
out there in this world that do not have thoughts of love and unity. Right.

1486
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,480
They're damaged, hurtful, evil people.

1487
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,800
And they want to destroy everything around them.

1488
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:13,080
Yeah. And that those people could acquire this ability.

1489
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,240
But would they be able to?

1490
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,400
I don't. This is the thing.

1491
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,000
It's like, has there been any evidence that evil people have been able

1492
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,840
to acquire this ability?

1493
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,760
I I would say what I have found, and even talking to scientists about this,

1494
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,760
that the baseline for this is love.

1495
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,480
There's a wonderful neuroscientist named Julia Mossbridge,

1496
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,000
and she has studied precognition.

1497
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,680
And one of the things she does in these precognition tests is be like,

1498
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:39,080
how much unconditional love do you feel for yourself, for other people,

1499
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,680
for the device you're taking this test on? Yeah.

1500
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,000
And the more people feel love, the better they do.

1501
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,880
And one of the things that I've heard from so many non-speakers

1502
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:51,360
with disabilities that the baseline is love, that love, love, love

1503
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,200
is like the thing that unlocks this stuff.

1504
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,600
What do they describe love as? Anything that unifies.

1505
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,360
Yeah, I've heard that over and over again.

1506
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,280
What's love? It's anything that unifies.

1507
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:06,440
Ah, wow. Huh.

1508
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,440
Isn't that the best description of love ever? It is.

1509
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,960
It's a really good description.

1510
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,520
So and and that was, yeah, very specific. Anything that unifies.

1511
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:21,600
So it's almost like they're tapping into some laws of the universe

1512
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:25,000
or laws of reality.

1513
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:30,520
That we kind of know by trial and error.

1514
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:34,160
Yeah. But we don't we don't.

1515
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:37,520
I mean, all you need is love.

1516
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:42,280
You know, this is always the love is a ubiquitous concept.

1517
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:46,520
It's like something that everybody always agrees is very important

1518
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,520
to life and happiness. Yeah.

1519
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:52,120
But we don't necessarily practice that culturally.

1520
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,640
Yeah. Or as a society. Yeah.

1521
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,760
I mean, but you go back to like the all the ancient religious teachers

1522
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,640
and thoughts, right?

1523
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,960
And so much of it's about love and unity, and we're all one.

1524
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,720
And you might not realize this, but we're all one.

1525
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,400
And, you know, it's been interesting.

1526
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:09,400
Like, there's a big question mark right now on how how to do these tests

1527
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,120
and how to prove it.

1528
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:12,760
And and when I brought that up to a few non-speakers,

1529
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,080
one of the questions is, like, why do you need to prove this with instruments?

1530
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,160
Like the biggest spiritual gift, the most fascinating one is love

1531
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,920
that will cause someone to jump into choppy waters and save someone

1532
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:22,680
and risk their own life.

1533
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,400
It's had mothers like have so much adrenaline.

1534
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,280
They could lift up a car and save their baby.

1535
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:28,920
Like love is the superpower. Right.

1536
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,600
And it's like that's it's just it's true.

1537
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,080
And they're like, why aren't you trying to measure love?

1538
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,200
And it's like, OK, good point.

1539
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,120
But still, people want to measure telepathy.

1540
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,600
And then that brings up the question is like of

1541
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,640
OK, well, is it best to do it

1542
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,920
like in a lab situation that can be really stressful,

1543
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,920
that can be filled with a lot of skeptical people and throwing that energy at you?

1544
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:51,520
Or is it better just to go into your environment, take off the lab coat,

1545
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,920
learn to spell, go check this out.

1546
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:56,520
And you think of like really good scientists like Jane Goodall, who

1547
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,360
who when she wanted to understand like a culture of, you know,

1548
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,560
how the chimps were working, she didn't bring them into her lab.

1549
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:08,040
She went and like lived in the jungle for months, you know,

1550
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:12,320
or you want to go look at the lightning bugs that light up in unison in Vietnam.

1551
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,720
I don't know if that's going to work out for you.

1552
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,320
If you bring them back to Berkeley and put them in a building,

1553
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:19,160
you probably have to go to the jungle and wait for them to light up in unison.

1554
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:26,240
So it's like, is it smart to be trying to test the stuff in our way, in our labs?

1555
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:28,960
Or is it better to be like, I'm going to go chill out with you in your living room

1556
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:30,600
and see how this works?

1557
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:34,320
Well, the reason why to test it with instruments is for skeptics.

1558
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:39,440
Right. So once we've all agreed that this is an actual phenomenon,

1559
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:42,320
this is a real thing, whatever this is, this is real.

1560
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:47,360
The best way to test it is really with consciousness. Yeah.

1561
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:51,120
Yeah. And, you know, I think about this a lot, like the skeptics, because again,

1562
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:53,800
like I've said, the families and teachers, the people who they people are like,

1563
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,320
let's just move the signs forward. We know what's happening.

1564
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:57,320
We know now we need to know how, not why. Right.

1565
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:01,640
And I've thought about like how skeptics can hold back that research in science

1566
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:05,720
and like how much time do you give to them versus like just move on without them.

1567
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:09,680
And I was thinking about in the term of like in the olden days, right,

1568
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:13,040
like if a voyager was going out to discover new worlds and people,

1569
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,840
you can't go find something that worth this flat and you're going to fall off of it

1570
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,120
or out there is a blah, blah, blah, blah.

1571
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,400
And someone comes back and it's like discovered Iceland, let's say.

1572
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,920
And it's like, oh, my gosh, you would not believe it.

1573
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:25,640
Like geysers are coming out of the earth and there's black stone beaches

1574
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:29,880
and black sand beaches and northern light, you know, whatever they're explaining.

1575
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:33,280
And they come back and some people will be like, wow, let's go explore it

1576
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,600
and find out more and, you know, draw things of it.

1577
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,840
And some people might be like, don't go with them. Don't go.

1578
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,960
Don't even try it. They're making it up. It's not real. That couldn't exist.

1579
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,280
You're going to die if you go.

1580
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,800
And I feel like the scientists there are the skeptics now are those people

1581
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,360
on the shore being like, there is no Iceland.

1582
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:49,600
Don't go look and you're going to blah, blah, blah.

1583
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:55,040
And it's like that's such a it's such a weight to forwarding thought.

1584
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,600
And research and this is such a cool, exciting new frontier.

1585
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:03,280
Yes. And well, the thing is, is like there's levels of skeptics.

1586
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,440
There's people that are just objective and they're like, I need data.

1587
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,040
I need to see something.

1588
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,440
And then there's people that it doesn't matter what they see.

1589
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,840
They're never going to believe.

1590
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,320
And those are the weird ones, because there's a lot of people out there

1591
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:17,640
that are self professed skeptics.

1592
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,520
Yeah, those are the ones that are the problem.

1593
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,760
Yeah, like they call themselves skeptics. Right. OK. Right.

1594
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,360
Well, how about just be objective? Right.

1595
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,480
Well, don't just be skeptical. Right.

1596
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:32,120
Because if you're completely skeptical and you're always looking for a negative,

1597
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:37,160
you're you're, you know, you're going to be biased by your own preconceived notions.

1598
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:42,080
Right. I mean, if you're if you're only skeptical, you're a closed minded believer.

1599
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:44,200
So you are you're not open minded.

1600
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:48,200
You're as dogmatic as like, right, as the next person

1601
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,520
who just believes their beliefs and won't look any further.

1602
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,560
This is it. Like, right. That's not skeptical.

1603
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,560
Well, that's atheists. Right. And a lot of for a lot of.

1604
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,280
Yeah. Well, I mean, there's different kinds of atheists, too.

1605
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:03,920
There's some that I would just I'd say they they're self professed atheists,

1606
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,480
but they're really more agnostic than anything. Yeah. Yeah.

1607
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,960
Yeah. But I would say I mean, I would say I'm skeptical.

1608
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:12,120
Every time I hear something new, I'm like, can it be that's right?

1609
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,520
Like, we got to go test this. I don't know.

1610
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,560
We got to find out. OK, we got to test it four or five more times.

1611
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,880
But like, be an open minded skeptic.

1612
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,600
Like, I don't even think that's skeptical. That's just objective. Right.

1613
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,880
Because you hear about something completely novel and you're like, OK,

1614
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,960
what is it? What is that?

1615
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:28,080
Is this bullshit? Because you know bullshit.

1616
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,560
The bullshit's real. It's a real thing.

1617
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,040
Like, that's why skeptics are important.

1618
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:35,360
Or at least being skeptical is important because there are people that tell you,

1619
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:39,000
if you join my cult, you will you will experience bliss and happiness.

1620
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,200
Totally true.

1621
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:43,520
We all give up our money to the guru and he has sex with all of us.

1622
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,600
But it's great. Like, what? Right. Totally.

1623
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,920
So skepticism is important.

1624
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:51,240
It is important. It keeps you from getting hoodwinked.

1625
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:54,280
It does. I mean, yes. Open minded skeptical. Right.

1626
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:57,280
But this is the problem with not having the ability to read minds. Right.

1627
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:01,080
Is that people can deceive you and you can't really tell.

1628
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,480
And some people are terrible at it for some reason.

1629
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:07,240
Like, some people just fall in line with the wrong crowd over and over

1630
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,240
and over again, and they never get it right. Yeah.

1631
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:12,440
Yeah, that's so true. You have to be skeptical.

1632
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,120
Yeah. Or you have to be able to read people. Yeah.

1633
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,560
And what is reading people though? Right.

1634
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,640
There's people that I've met that like right away.

1635
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,000
I'm like, this person's broken. I got to get the fuck away from them.

1636
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:26,000
There's a famous story that with my friend Brian,

1637
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:30,680
Brian Callan, who's a hilarious comedian who always has the worst friends.

1638
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:35,960
Always. And one time he showed up at this show that we were doing together

1639
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,080
with this gal that he was dating.

1640
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,920
And I met her for five seconds and I and he'd always had the worst girlfriends.

1641
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,280
They're always just disasters.

1642
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:45,400
I get I go get rid of this one, please.

1643
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,960
I go, trust me, you got to move.

1644
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,320
He's like, what are you talking about?

1645
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,880
I go, dude, she's crazy. This one's broken.

1646
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,880
And he's like, no, no, no. I go, dude, I am telling you right now.

1647
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,960
Turn out she's a meth head.

1648
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,920
He didn't know she wind up being a prostitute.

1649
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:02,480
Like it was off the charts, but she was pretty.

1650
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,120
And he just thought she was friendly to him.

1651
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:06,240
And so she was fine. And I read her right away.

1652
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,640
I'm like, oh, everything's wrong here. Yeah.

1653
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:09,760
And he's like, how did you do that?

1654
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,000
I'm like, I don't know. I just knew right away.

1655
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,640
You got to get away from her. Yeah.

1656
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:16,320
And he eventually one day

1657
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,880
ran into her after they had broken up.

1658
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,760
She was street walking. What?

1659
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:23,280
Yeah. Like that crazy. Yeah.

1660
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,000
Poor thing. Poor thing.

1661
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,480
Yeah. But it was like I was like, that one's going to drag you down.

1662
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,080
Like, get out of there. Yeah.

1663
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,440
But I knew I don't know how I knew. Yeah.

1664
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:35,080
I mean, it was a simple exchange.

1665
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,840
Like, hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too.

1666
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,120
Like, what the fuck's going on here?

1667
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:43,360
It's like all my spidey senses. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1668
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:46,400
And it's not normal. That's not normal.

1669
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,320
That's not every day. It's not like everybody I meet,

1670
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,880
like some people I meet, I'm like, something's off. Right.

1671
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:51,960
Something. Yeah.

1672
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:56,400
Just you have to be able to go on some kind of instinct.

1673
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,640
We all know.

1674
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:01,080
And a lot of it is sort of pattern recognition.

1675
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,720
A lot of it is prior experiences with similar

1676
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,080
the way similar people engage with you. Right.

1677
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:10,280
And you're like, oh, I've seen this before. Yes.

1678
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:12,920
Like, this is a con man. Oh, I've seen this before.

1679
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,520
This is a this and this is that. Yes.

1680
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,680
But sometimes, sometimes it's just like, this is a bad person.

1681
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,120
Yes. This one's broken. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

1682
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:27,000
So, yes, I think having some degree of skepticism can be good.

1683
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,520
Yeah. But emotional intelligence can be good.

1684
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:32,600
I think it's objectivity. Yeah. Objectivity to recognize

1685
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:36,000
that people that are deceptive are real, you know,

1686
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,120
and there's people that have ulterior motives

1687
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:41,800
and these ulterior ulterior motives you might not understand.

1688
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:44,720
And you've got to be able to

1689
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,400
you got to be able to throw everything through a filter.

1690
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:49,400
And unfortunately, until we can read minds,

1691
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,120
you're kind of going on these like, did you hear that?

1692
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,160
I think I heard something.

1693
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:56,160
You know, that's really what it's like when you meet a person.

1694
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,560
It's like there's something.

1695
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,360
I don't know. You're being paranoid.

1696
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,880
I don't know. You know. Right.

1697
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,320
And then you can convince yourself that you are being paranoid

1698
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:07,000
when you actually you're not. You're actually accurate.

1699
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,640
Yeah. And you're like, oh, you're being silly. Yeah.

1700
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,280
You're not being silly. Right.

1701
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:14,320
Followed your initial instincts. Right. Exactly.

1702
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:17,440
And I think that's what has happened with like materialism

1703
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:21,320
being such a for years is that anyone who believed in anything

1704
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:23,320
like would be made to feel silly. Right.

1705
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:25,480
Oh, you're so gullible or you're not smart.

1706
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:32,040
Like intellectual people certainly don't believe in ghosts or God or whatever.

1707
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,600
And, you know, put anything in there that you can't measure.

1708
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,800
Right. Yeah, exactly. The secret.

1709
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:39,680
And so that's been effective.

1710
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:42,640
No one wants to be ridiculed and dismissed and made to feel silly.

1711
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,200
I mean, even editing the podcast, like I was so certain.

1712
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:47,200
I'm like, OK, well, episodes one through four, there's a lot of science.

1713
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:48,080
This is great.

1714
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,520
The one that took me weeks, like I was in turmoil over,

1715
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,440
was having to like put out into the world that like the teachers were hearing

1716
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:57,320
telepathy back because I'm like, no one's going to believe this.

1717
01:46:57,320 --> 01:47:00,120
It's just so hard. But it's like you can't censor it.

1718
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:01,640
This is what people's experience is.

1719
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:04,280
And the whole point was to like put out the voices of people

1720
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:06,080
who have been completely dismissing and ignored.

1721
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:12,000
Also, if love is unifying, the love of a teacher and a student is absolutely real.

1722
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,880
Yeah. Again, it's a special bond, especially really good teachers.

1723
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:19,240
Oh, my gosh. Really good educators have like this because they really

1724
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,520
genuinely just want to help. Yeah.

1725
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:25,080
And when someone did genuine and you're a child that's vulnerable

1726
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:28,920
and confused by the world around you and you're nonverbal

1727
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:31,680
and there's someone with genuine love for you.

1728
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,760
Yeah. Like it kind of makes sense that those would be the people that bridge the gap.

1729
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:38,720
It was interesting because I saw my best friend for college this morning

1730
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,840
and her husband was there and he was like, why is it so many women

1731
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:43,560
in the podcast that have telepathy? Like, can dads do it and whatever?

1732
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:46,160
And I was like, in fact, the first person Dr.

1733
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:50,720
Powell tested the telepathy test with, this girl was adopted

1734
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:53,600
and she had the best telepathic bond with her father, you know,

1735
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:58,120
and I know a young man in Israel whose best telepathic bond is with his father.

1736
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:00,920
And another, you know, so, yes, it does happen with dads,

1737
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:04,280
but I think there's more women who go into teaching and more women that do caregiving.

1738
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,840
And so that's probably why it looks like more women,

1739
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:12,160
but I don't think it's like a gender gendered thing that mostly women have this.

1740
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:15,840
You know, I think it's whoever is in that like loving open.

1741
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:20,280
Yeah, I think men are generally more inclined towards brutish thinking,

1742
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:26,720
you know, and an ego and like silly ways of viewing the world.

1743
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:30,800
And then also preoccupied by their status in life

1744
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:36,040
and what that means to, you know, them and their worth as an individual.

1745
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:40,520
And all that stuff is a massive impediment to any sort of like real love.

1746
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,720
Yeah, you're just so self-focused.

1747
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,600
Yeah, that's very. Yeah.

1748
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:49,920
And that's definitely a male trait, especially in this capitalism society

1749
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:53,520
where you're constantly trying to achieve a higher level of status. Yeah.

1750
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:57,160
And no one's satisfied, including billionaires. Yeah, right.

1751
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,800
Yeah, which is just the nuttiest thing of all time. I know.

1752
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,760
It's like, what is the point? You won the game. I know.

1753
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,320
You spread it out over.

1754
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:09,400
You should like you have this crazy opportunity with all this money

1755
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:12,760
to help so many people and lift up like all of America.

1756
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:17,280
Also, why are you still just chasing numbers? Right.

1757
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,920
In a ledger, because that's what you're doing. Yeah.

1758
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,640
You've got lost in this weird game.

1759
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:25,640
I actually cannot comprehend that. I cannot comprehend.

1760
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:28,040
I wonder if you could, if you were super wealthy. Maybe.

1761
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:32,280
Yeah. And if you went down that path, the thing is that the one thing would be

1762
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,800
if you were super wealthy by some divine intervention

1763
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:37,120
or someone just gives you money. Right.

1764
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:41,760
You know, like some crazy billionaire who's like a telepathy tapes fan.

1765
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,280
They're dying. And on their will, they say, listen,

1766
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:47,480
guy, you seem cool. I'm going to give you two billion dollars.

1767
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,440
Like, what are you going to do with it?

1768
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,480
Yeah, it's different.

1769
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:54,440
But if you went and tried to earn it and so your whole life,

1770
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,760
you were focused on these achievements.

1771
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,040
I want to have this and that.

1772
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,960
And I want to have I want to be I want to be important.

1773
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,760
I want to be able to influence political parties.

1774
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,880
And I want to be able to fly in my private jet.

1775
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:10,520
And I want to I want an island. You know, you get crazy. Yeah.

1776
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:14,320
And then you're never you never have enough because you want more and more.

1777
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,920
Yeah. And then you're around people like we were talking the other day.

1778
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:21,720
Also, my friend Brian has a friend who's worth like three billion dollars

1779
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:25,280
and he feels poor because he hangs out with these guys that are worth

1780
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,760
fifty billion dollars.

1781
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,000
I'm like, that's so crazy.

1782
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:32,560
But that's the world that you live in when you're

1783
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,680
only thinking about numbers on a ledger.

1784
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:37,640
You've you've gotten caught playing a game. Right.

1785
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:39,680
You're playing poker. You have chips.

1786
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:43,680
You know, you're you're all just quantifiable numbers.

1787
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,920
Well, none of it matters to who cares.

1788
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,480
So here's the real number.

1789
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:49,960
You got a hundred years. Right. You're lucky. Right.

1790
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:51,200
That's the real number. Yeah.

1791
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:56,400
And if you're 60 and you're right, yeah, you're almost at the end, buddy.

1792
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:58,040
Right. Like, what are you doing?

1793
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:00,600
Well, I just I always think about like the impact you're going to leave behind.

1794
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:01,600
Like, what's your legacy?

1795
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:02,680
Like you had a big boat.

1796
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,600
I mean, who cares about that? Right.

1797
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:05,640
What does that mean?

1798
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:08,280
You know, are you going to be the person when he died?

1799
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:09,800
He had so many things.

1800
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,280
I aspire to be like, will you? Right.

1801
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,360
Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of people that are like that.

1802
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:17,000
And they think about old dead rich people being boy.

1803
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,240
He really nailed it. He killed the game.

1804
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,080
You know, and that's, you know,

1805
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:24,280
that's the thing that they have focused on, unfortunately.

1806
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,560
This is the problem with financial institutions, because they're like,

1807
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:32,320
if all you're doing is trying to acquire more money, well, that's your game.

1808
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,160
And your game is just do that.

1809
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:38,720
And then as you get bigger, you eventually reach a point like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1810
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:40,720
You kind of control everything.

1811
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:43,200
Like, you control natural resources.

1812
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:44,480
You control land.

1813
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:47,240
You control building, housing, transportation.

1814
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:48,640
You have everything.

1815
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:50,760
This is not good for everybody else.

1816
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:54,640
It's not good for everybody else for one entity to have so much power

1817
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:57,800
and only be concentrating on numbers. Right.

1818
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:59,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1819
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,000
I don't know where that comes from.

1820
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,640
I mean, I guess if you grow up really rich, maybe that's it.

1821
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,400
Or maybe if you grew up without anything, it's a competition.

1822
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:09,480
It's a subversion of what it's initially supposed to be.

1823
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,000
It's like when you put mandates on officers

1824
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:18,080
achieving a certain amount of arrests in a month.

1825
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,800
Or even arrests in general. Right.

1826
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,480
Or prosecutors. Right.

1827
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:25,440
What's what is a prosecutor's goal to win? Right.

1828
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,480
They have there's the competition.

1829
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:31,640
The competition is I provide evidence that this person is guilty.

1830
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:34,480
The defense provides evidence that he is, in fact, innocent.

1831
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:36,080
And we sort it out.

1832
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:39,560
And if you're just trying to win the game, well, then you're a corrupt prosecutor

1833
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:43,640
because then you withhold evidence that might exonerate that person.

1834
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:46,440
Or you don't allow DNA or you don't.

1835
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:49,080
There's. Yeah. And there's a lot of that.

1836
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:51,680
I mean, I work with a guy named Josh Dubin, who's a friend of mine,

1837
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:57,120
who's his whole thing is freeing people that are unjustly accused.

1838
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:01,960
And he's just because this podcast, a bunch of people are free right now.

1839
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:07,240
And the shocking stories that you hear about corrupt prosecutors

1840
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:08,440
where these guys get caught.

1841
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:12,560
And it turns out there's hundreds of people rotting away in a cage

1842
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,200
that are innocent because of this one corrupt person.

1843
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,800
And because they played this game of just trying to win.

1844
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:23,240
Yeah. You know, and this is the same game.

1845
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:27,520
It's the same game of acquiring numbers, whatever you're trying to do.

1846
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:30,680
If that is what your game is, your game is just numbers.

1847
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:36,840
I mean, it just makes me wonder if like people believe there was more.

1848
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,120
Right. Like if it wasn't just like, you've got this one shot

1849
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:41,800
and you're just going to hear and like tackle the numbers and be super rich

1850
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:44,520
and whatever, like would making a difference and make it

1851
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,080
because it does feel like, yeah, oh, Pollyanna, like we're going to just,

1852
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,080
you know, yeah, love each other.

1853
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:51,400
But like, but if you really believe that there was something more, right?

1854
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:54,600
That like you had a higher purpose here, that you were more than just your body.

1855
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:58,120
I think I mean, I think if you believe that to some degree,

1856
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,560
you're going to act differently.

1857
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:02,880
Yeah. You're more focused on difference than acquiring numbers of money.

1858
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:07,280
Yeah. It's just hard to get through people that are completely lost and obsessed.

1859
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:11,920
Yeah. You know, when someone is completely like, say, a gambling addict, for instance,

1860
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,200
they're very hard to get to.

1861
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:17,680
Because they're completely lost and obsessed with this thing

1862
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:20,160
that they become addicted to, which is all numbers.

1863
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:25,560
Gambling is just all thrills and wins and losses and numbers.

1864
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,320
It's all just I bet 100,000 on the game.

1865
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:31,000
And I'm like, I think I got five points on the spread.

1866
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,440
Yeah. They cover the spread.

1867
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:34,480
Then I went and like that amount of the hole.

1868
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:36,640
And then it's this roller coaster ride.

1869
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:40,920
And so it's very difficult to get to those people that are lost

1870
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:44,520
in whatever the game they're playing is, whether the game is gambling addiction

1871
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:47,040
or financial addiction, whatever it is.

1872
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:50,640
If you're lost in a game, it's very hard to get to those people,

1873
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:53,160
especially if they don't have love in their life.

1874
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:59,000
And so if all their status is acquired by numbers, by achieving this

1875
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,800
and pulling up in the brand new Mercedes and wearing the fine suit

1876
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:05,960
and having the expensive watch or whatever it is that your thing is

1877
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:07,520
that you want to show up with.

1878
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:11,560
And there's in this world, this this, especially today,

1879
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:17,040
there's all the lures and trappings to pull you into that.

1880
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,040
And you can never get enough.

1881
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,680
You know, you can get hand purchase.

1882
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:27,120
I mean, hand created this and, you know, rare that and a limited edition that.

1883
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:30,240
Oh, did you get the new one? Oh, and then, you know, you're lost.

1884
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,080
It's just yeah, it just doesn't fill you up.

1885
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:34,240
I think it empties you out more, really, in the end.

1886
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:37,400
So right. But what it does do, oddly,

1887
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:39,840
is it promotes technological innovation.

1888
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,880
So keeping up with the Joneses and materialism,

1889
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:48,120
one purpose that it does serve, oddly, is this constant push

1890
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:52,960
towards newer and better things, which I think is also part of the purpose

1891
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:57,040
of human life in some sort of a strange way, is that we are

1892
01:55:57,040 --> 01:56:02,400
we are pursuing technological innovation above and beyond everything.

1893
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:06,520
If you could see us objectively, if like you could see us outside of culture,

1894
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:09,000
outside of language, if you were an alien race

1895
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,400
and you're observing this weird species, like what does it do?

1896
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,760
Well, it keeps making better stuff.

1897
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:15,960
Yeah, that's what it does.

1898
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,200
It keeps making better stuff.

1899
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:19,880
It puts all of its resources into making better stuff.

1900
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:23,200
And it's obsessed with acquiring better stuff,

1901
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:25,480
even though it has a finite lifespan.

1902
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:28,280
It never recognizes or rarely.

1903
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:32,720
It's an odd and beautiful thing when someone recognizes they have a finite life.

1904
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,680
Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking about that, what you're saying.

1905
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:37,680
And I was thinking, God, then every four years,

1906
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:41,520
the aliens would be like, oh, but then they pass a torture on the world

1907
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:44,120
and they go and they compete in games and the whole.

1908
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:48,240
And for like one small two week period, they're all playing

1909
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,560
these games against each other.

1910
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:52,080
And then they like put the torch out and go home and right.

1911
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:56,960
And that's subverted by numbers, because the people that are playing the game

1912
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,320
who everybody wants to see them, they don't get any of the money.

1913
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:04,720
The money is all by the commercials and advertising and networks,

1914
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:09,480
networks in the organization where they profit in a tune of billions of dollars

1915
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:12,440
and literally pay zero to the athletes,

1916
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:17,600
which is so gross, another disgusting subversion of this whole thing.

1917
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:20,280
So the purity is in the athletes,

1918
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:24,560
or especially if you're competing in a game that has no financial future.

1919
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:27,880
Now, if you're the world curling champion or whatever, whatever it is,

1920
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:30,280
you know, whatever some goofy ass fucking Olympics. Right.

1921
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:35,360
There's no there's no you're just trying to be the best at this thing.

1922
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:38,160
And I think like if you can

1923
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:41,240
achieve something that makes you feel really good about yourself, right?

1924
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:42,360
I think there is a worth in that.

1925
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:44,040
This is beautiful. Oh, yeah.

1926
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:46,480
But and that's like where sports can come in, right?

1927
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:49,640
That like the underdog can win and you can work together and blah, blah, blah.

1928
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:50,800
Like that's where stuff is.

1929
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,000
I think that's like really beautiful.

1930
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,640
You create something that's beautiful.

1931
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:57,320
But yeah, just buying something is not cool.

1932
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:58,720
I mean, that's right.

1933
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:00,120
I mean, just what does it do?

1934
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:00,840
That's not cool.

1935
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:04,040
Like creating something is cool. Achieving something is cool.

1936
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,880
It's also one of the weirdest attractions.

1937
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:10,200
Yeah. Attractance about social media is what the stuff that people are showing

1938
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:13,600
you they have, you know, which is like you can get a lot of followers

1939
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:16,600
by having great stuff and like, look at my stuff, look at my house,

1940
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,520
look at my car, look at my jet.

1941
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,080
And it's like people go, wow.

1942
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:22,200
And you see like millions and millions of likes.

1943
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:25,440
Yeah, it's really because kids like they love the YouTube videos.

1944
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:29,200
Now, like my son will watch like Hot Wheels, like people being like,

1945
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:32,400
this new Hot Wheels, it goes, and he want to make these Hot Wheels things.

1946
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,600
And I'm like, what is happening right now that you're like basically

1947
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:36,520
doing an ad for Hot Wheels?

1948
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:40,080
You know, it's just like I would have never wanted to watch kids

1949
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:43,160
unbox Hot Wheels, I mean, or Barbies or whatever.

1950
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:45,480
Like none of it, you know, unboxing things are strange.

1951
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:47,600
Yeah, it's like techno porn.

1952
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:49,960
Yeah, you know, you're you're watching someone do something

1953
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:51,800
you wish you were doing. Oh, I wish I had that on.

1954
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:54,120
Yeah, that's it's so weird.

1955
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:58,080
Yeah, but it's, you know, it's also very strange when you think about

1956
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:01,720
how many people are tuned into that,

1957
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:03,840
where you never would have expected that in the past.

1958
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:07,760
Like there would never be a television show on NBC where someone unboxes stuff.

1959
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:09,560
You'd be like, no one's going to watch that.

1960
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:13,400
But meanwhile, put it on YouTube and millions of people will watch that stuff.

1961
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:16,040
So there's there's a part of it that we didn't anticipate.

1962
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:17,240
Yeah, I don't know.

1963
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:19,920
I hope it'll be a pendulum because when you brought up television,

1964
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,480
I thought, well, that replaced the dance hall.

1965
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:23,880
Right. People used to go dance and hang out before those television.

1966
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:27,240
Like you'd be out doing something. And right. How cool. Right.

1967
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:29,680
You know, or they also thought the world was flat. Right.

1968
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:33,800
It's like this benefits to all this ability to communicate as well.

1969
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:35,880
The problem is when it's centralized. Right.

1970
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:39,360
The real problem with television is that television has advertising,

1971
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:41,320
advertising limits, which you can say.

1972
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:45,800
And because of that, you know, we censored language. Right. Right.

1973
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:48,440
Advertisers didn't want you swearing on television.

1974
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:52,360
So the way people talked in real life, they never talked on television. Right.

1975
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:55,240
Yeah. And you know, and so that got subverted.

1976
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:59,200
True free expression got subverted by advertisement.

1977
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:01,800
Well, and that is what is cool about that world we're living in right now. Right.

1978
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:05,520
Because like YouTube and Twitter, X or, you know, whatever, Blue Sky,

1979
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,600
all the things, podcasts.

1980
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:10,280
I mean, people are free to kind of speak and talk and share.

1981
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:16,280
I bet I can get bad pretty quick, which is some simple scientific facts.

1982
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:21,120
But, you know, I mean, there is a democracy to information now where,

1983
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:25,760
I think like stuff that could never have gotten out there 20,

1984
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:28,000
30 years ago when the gatekeeping of like you were saying,

1985
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,360
advertising and all that was so extreme.

1986
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:34,080
It's just changed. And that's awesome. Profoundly. Yeah.

1987
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:37,800
And in a way that I don't think we even appreciate because we're a part of it.

1988
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:41,080
Right. I think it's one of those things we've become accustomed to checking

1989
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:44,680
the news on your phone when you wake up in the morning and having and friends

1990
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:47,920
sending you things. Oh, my God, you see this. Right. And cool things, too.

1991
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:52,520
Great music. And so many things get they get shared.

1992
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:55,000
Like your show got shared to me.

1993
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,440
I don't remember who shared it to me because so many people did.

1994
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,880
Because I don't remember who the first person was.

1995
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:01,720
Well, and I think that's the thing that is cool.

1996
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:05,480
Right. We actually have like evidence of what this democratization

1997
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:06,920
of information looks like.

1998
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:10,400
Like the U.I.P. phenomenon has become so much more mainstream.

1999
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,800
People are talking about it, like things that could not have been shared

2000
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,000
or spoken are now out there.

2001
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,120
Same with psychedelics and psilocybin.

2002
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:20,080
And, you know, going on ketamine trips or whatever, like all that now

2003
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:23,240
is just common knowledge that this can be great for healing PTSD

2004
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:25,120
or, you know, depression or whatever.

2005
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:28,800
The stuff with telepathy, you know, I mean, channeling, whatever it is,

2006
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,560
like all these things, especially tick tock.

2007
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:31,960
You're like, holy cow.

2008
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:34,280
So I'm glad you brought the U.I.P. thing up.

2009
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:37,480
I hate to interrupt you, but because I think a lot of the

2010
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:39,880
what we're hearing is nonsense. Yeah.

2011
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:45,640
I mean, I think a lot of what is being shared, especially publicly, like

2012
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:53,440
there's too too many voices that I think are either intelligence assets

2013
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:58,560
or are disinformation experts that are doing it on purpose.

2014
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:05,480
And there's too much of, you know, the same feeling that I get,

2015
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:08,040
you know, like when I said to I met my friend's ex-girlfriend,

2016
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:10,120
I was like, oh, get out now. Yeah.

2017
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:14,160
There's a I have that feeling about the U.I.P. thing when I hear people talk.

2018
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:16,920
Nothing seems real to me. Yeah.

2019
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:19,200
When I talk to people about it, there's not one.

2020
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:22,680
I mean, even when people tell me their own personal experiences, I believe them.

2021
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:26,000
It does not register as real. That's so interesting.

2022
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,240
Something registers as being nonsense.

2023
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:32,400
There's something maybe not nonsense, but maybe way weirder

2024
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:39,000
than what they're explaining it like, like nonphysical interaction

2025
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:44,200
that they are reinterpreting as like physical interaction.

2026
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:48,520
Yeah. That there's some there's some disconnect between their work.

2027
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:52,200
Like if someone tells me an experience that they had, like here's a good example.

2028
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:57,120
My friend Steve told me a harrowing experience

2029
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:01,280
of them being attacked by a brown bear in Alaska.

2030
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:07,120
And when he tells you this story, first of all, I know it's real

2031
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:09,240
because I know multiple people who are there.

2032
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:11,720
They were all there. It was no one got hurt.

2033
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:12,960
It was very fortunate.

2034
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:16,720
But they got charged by a grizzly who ran through their tent.

2035
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:19,200
One of my friends was on its back. Oh, my God.

2036
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:22,840
For like 10 yards. Oh, like it literally plowed through the people.

2037
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:28,040
And he wound up like riding its back for like 10 yards before he fell off. Wow.

2038
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:31,360
Yeah. It was just like, I mean, it can cover 10 yards in a second. Yeah.

2039
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:34,800
And the whole thing was just insane chaos.

2040
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:39,840
And the way he describes how your reptilian brain

2041
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:44,280
completely takes the fear is so overwhelming

2042
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:46,400
and different than anything you've ever experienced before.

2043
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:50,600
I know it happened. Yeah. He's telling me this. I know it happened. Yeah.

2044
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:54,080
When these people are telling me about talking to aliens and all that,

2045
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,400
I'm not getting nothing out of them. I'm not getting nothing.

2046
02:03:57,400 --> 02:04:00,400
I'm getting a flat piece of paper. Yeah, there's no fear.

2047
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:03,440
There's no there's no charge. What it is. I don't know what it is.

2048
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:07,360
I just don't get anything from their story. I hear it. It's interesting.

2049
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:10,760
But I don't get anything that lights any bells.

2050
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,400
There's no bulbs go off with me.

2051
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:16,240
I just sit there and go, wow. OK, so what were you thinking?

2052
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:19,560
You know, and I'm asking them questions, but I'm not getting nothing. Yeah.

2053
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:23,520
So that leaves me because I know that.

2054
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:28,800
For sure, the government has technology

2055
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:32,080
that they do not want the general public to be aware of

2056
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:34,920
for reasons of national security or whatever it is.

2057
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:40,960
Or, you know, money has been pushed through to finance things

2058
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:44,280
and they lie to Congress and they have to keep lying, whatever the reason is.

2059
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:48,920
That's real. There's most certainly black ops programs

2060
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:50,760
that the general public is not aware of.

2061
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,160
That's always going to be the case.

2062
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:56,720
If you have those, what better way to hide them than in plain sight

2063
02:04:57,120 --> 02:05:00,200
and with a bunch of people that are air quote whistleblowers

2064
02:05:00,440 --> 02:05:03,680
that go out and tell everybody about all these experiences.

2065
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:04,680
They're not of this earth.

2066
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:06,400
And that's what I would do.

2067
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:08,480
If I was the government and I wanted to be super sneaky,

2068
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:12,800
I would have a bunch of my like really clever agents

2069
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:17,040
go and whistle blow, tell some stories, talk, talk about people

2070
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:19,160
that have been abducted, talk about all these different things. Yeah.

2071
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:22,840
And then on top of that, there's real experiences.

2072
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:28,600
So I think I think there is something because it exists throughout history,

2073
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:31,880
just like telepathy exists throughout history and ghosts exist throughout history

2074
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:33,520
and and religion exists.

2075
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:35,520
There's something there. Yeah.

2076
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:43,120
There's some thing there that's distorted by our very slippery grasp on truth.

2077
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:46,120
Yes. Yeah. I think that's a very true assessment.

2078
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:47,800
Yeah. Yeah.

2079
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:51,400
There's also just too many stories from hundreds of years ago

2080
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:55,400
that are incredibly similar to the things that people are talking about today.

2081
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:57,280
Yeah. That's the stuff that's interesting.

2082
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:59,360
Like Jacques Fillet. Exactly.

2083
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:01,280
I just finished his third book. Yeah.

2084
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:03,360
I mean, that's the mind.

2085
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:06,960
Yeah. But he's great because he's not a believer.

2086
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:12,320
He's very skeptical about a lot and highlights a lot of the bullshit

2087
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:14,320
to the point where like, OK, what's true? Yeah.

2088
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:16,360
I mean, those are the people you have to trust, though.

2089
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:17,320
The only ones. Yeah.

2090
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:19,000
The only ones you can trust. Yeah.

2091
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,400
Because there's too many people that are out there telling you,

2092
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,320
I know what's happening.

2093
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:26,440
We are about to experience a contact.

2094
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:31,280
Yeah. The all the people, the joint chiefs of staff have been notified.

2095
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:34,120
And like those people I don't want to talk to.

2096
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,640
Well, you shut the fuck up.

2097
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:37,480
You don't know anything. There's no way you know.

2098
02:06:37,480 --> 02:06:40,800
You're you're just taking advantage of this very weird moment

2099
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:43,000
in time where people aren't sure.

2100
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,360
But there's all this discussion, this phenomenon, and you've grifted yourself.

2101
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:47,880
Right. Exactly. There's a lot of those people.

2102
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:49,560
There are. Yeah. And it's click bait.

2103
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:50,920
And it's their profit. Yeah.

2104
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:52,800
Because they're they're gross.

2105
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:56,200
No. But the true intellectual people is looking at the consciousness side of this.

2106
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:57,040
I think that's fascinating.

2107
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,800
That's what's like what's going on.

2108
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:00,000
I think that's where it is. Yeah.

2109
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,160
It's a conscious. I mean, that's why.

2110
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:05,960
You know, I wasn't into the UAP stuff until people started saying to me,

2111
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:08,840
like, you should at least start looking at some of these great thinkers,

2112
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:11,320
because a lot of this has to do with consciousness.

2113
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:13,360
And what what are we and why are we here?

2114
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,680
And like, what's a hyper object, right?

2115
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,920
Like like a lot of stuff that I'm like, what is going on?

2116
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:20,240
So you start reading about it and understanding, OK, like

2117
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:25,040
where things might converge is an exploration of consciousness. Yeah.

2118
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:29,000
And our consciousness is confined by identity.

2119
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,840
It's confined by so many different things.

2120
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:37,800
So many so many walls that we put up and we go and blinders and self-delusion.

2121
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:41,360
There's always just weird things that we have in our mind

2122
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:43,960
because we don't necessarily have a very good.

2123
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:49,280
Direction book of how to be a human, right?

2124
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,920
You know, or what we're just limited to by our vision, right?

2125
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:54,160
Like if you were to talk to a dog and be like, hey, there's

2126
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:56,480
does this dog know about calculus?

2127
02:07:56,480 --> 02:08:00,480
And does it know about like the, you know, whatever electoral college?

2128
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:02,600
Of course not. Like, there's no way there's no universe

2129
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:03,840
in which a dog would know about that stuff.

2130
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:06,400
But it could smell a cat four blocks away.

2131
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:10,080
You ever see a cat dog just like, you know, in the air, you know,

2132
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:11,600
they have insane noses.

2133
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:15,640
They can smell individual ingredients in a hamburger.

2134
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:17,880
That's so fascinating.

2135
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:22,120
And a bear is like 10 times stronger than that, which is bananas.

2136
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:25,880
They can smell human beings hundreds of yards away.

2137
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:27,520
Just a whiff of the wind.

2138
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:29,600
And then all people get the fuck out of here.

2139
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:32,160
Well, and that's like we don't have that.

2140
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:34,200
But like a dog doesn't have X, Y, Z.

2141
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:34,960
What are we living in?

2142
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:38,600
We might not be able to see half of what's there or sure conceive of it.

2143
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:40,760
So wave your hand above an earthworm.

2144
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:42,520
There's no idea. There's no idea.

2145
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:44,120
Yeah. Like it doesn't need to.

2146
02:08:44,120 --> 02:08:45,400
Lives its life underground.

2147
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:47,200
Those senses are not necessary. Right.

2148
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,480
So that's the mystery.

2149
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:51,560
Yeah. And our senses most likely have atrophied.

2150
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,200
You know, that's the real thing is that, you know,

2151
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:57,880
there's a lot of talk from, you know, ancient,

2152
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:03,200
whether it's ancient religious texts or of contact,

2153
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:07,320
of something communicating with you that's not physically there.

2154
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:12,440
And you got to wonder, like, was this really common for people like there's

2155
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:19,160
there's so many descriptions of being contacted by something that's not there.

2156
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:24,160
Like, what was that before language normal?

2157
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:29,280
Yeah. And and was it physically someone contacted you or was it in a mental space?

2158
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:30,960
Right. Like, were you in this thought world?

2159
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:33,240
Like almost you were astral traveling or whatever.

2160
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:36,720
Right. Like, I mean, that's the question, too, is can you be experiencing

2161
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:40,400
something in your mind that's not happening physically? Right.

2162
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:43,280
And I think that question is pervasive in the U.A.P.

2163
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:46,200
world as well as in this telepathy world. Right.

2164
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:50,280
It's the birds flying around in unison somehow or another.

2165
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:56,760
They're tuned in to some some pattern that they never collide.

2166
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:58,560
How do they not collide?

2167
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:01,440
I mean, that's like so spectacular that you're literally

2168
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:03,280
hundreds of feet above the earth.

2169
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:04,760
If you collide, you get knocked unconscious.

2170
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:07,200
You're both dead. And no one collides ever.

2171
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:09,800
And they're going fast. I mean, imagine, like, why would you do that?

2172
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:14,200
Like, what what benefit evolutionary benefit?

2173
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:17,920
What natural survival benefit would there be in a bunch of you

2174
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:20,960
flying around in weird patterns in the sky?

2175
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:22,640
Like, look at that. Here we go.

2176
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:25,000
That is so beautiful.

2177
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,760
I've heard is they just look like a bigger thing.

2178
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:29,800
So that's going to be it. Right. You look like a big monster.

2179
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:31,360
That doesn't scare off fish.

2180
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:34,160
They go right to the big thing. Well, that's the problem.

2181
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:37,920
You know, when tuned to see that big thing, they're like, fuck. Yeah.

2182
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:41,320
Look how crazy that is.

2183
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:42,480
I mean, it's.

2184
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:45,840
But why would that be a benefit to like being a bigger thing?

2185
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:48,160
That would make you a bigger target.

2186
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:51,080
I don't. I mean, it's just so weird.

2187
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:53,680
It's so weird. Like, no one's fallen.

2188
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:56,320
No, no one's colliding.

2189
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:58,400
How come they're not falling and doesn't look like art?

2190
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:01,040
I mean, it really is like an elaborate dance.

2191
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:02,840
Have you ever seen wolves hunt?

2192
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:05,000
No, they communicate.

2193
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,800
And we don't we don't know what they're doing.

2194
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:09,160
We don't we don't know how they do it, but they decide.

2195
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:13,280
Yeah. Yeah, there's something because they flank animals.

2196
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:14,880
They know how to do it.

2197
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:17,600
Like they know to chase animals into canyons.

2198
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:19,640
And then they get on the other side of it

2199
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:21,520
and they capture them when they're trying to escape.

2200
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:22,080
It's still up.

2201
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:25,280
I mean, one of the teachers that I've come to love so much

2202
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:27,480
and she was also in England, she said that the first time

2203
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:29,240
she realized something like this was going on.

2204
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:32,480
She's working at a school where the individuals weren't speaking.

2205
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:36,760
And she saw people of like a bunch of her class playing at recess.

2206
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:38,680
And she's like, it was a fully orchestrated game.

2207
02:11:38,680 --> 02:11:40,480
Like this one need to go here and this one need to go here.

2208
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:40,960
And they were doing this.

2209
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:42,400
And she's like, but they weren't speaking.

2210
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:44,440
And I was watching this through the classroom window.

2211
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:46,880
And I thought they are communicating through telepathy

2212
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:49,800
because how else do this is a huge organized game.

2213
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:51,680
And she watched over and over again.

2214
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:54,000
And then she thought in her head, like, I want to be in on this.

2215
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:55,600
I want you all to teach me.

2216
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:57,120
I want to get in on this.

2217
02:11:57,120 --> 02:12:01,920
And then one of the boys started, she'd start hearing him in her head,

2218
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:05,440
like if he had fallen down outside or couldn't find his lunch money or,

2219
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:08,360
you know, something happened, skinned his knee.

2220
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:11,080
And she would hear him and like would know where to go find him.

2221
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:14,120
And she was like, oh, my gosh, like he's this is starting to work.

2222
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:15,440
And then, yeah.

2223
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:18,800
And then like one of the students' mothers died.

2224
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:21,480
And she became and the mother said to this teacher,

2225
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:24,520
I want you to really take care of my son as he ages.

2226
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:26,520
He loves you like he really respects you.

2227
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,440
And she's done that his whole life.

2228
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:33,000
And now, you know, he's a grown adult and they still communicate.

2229
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,840
But she's like, now he communicates with me telepathically.

2230
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:38,320
I'll get these huge visual packages.

2231
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:42,120
And she's like, and sometimes I think first, did this come from me

2232
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:43,640
and my making this up?

2233
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:47,080
But it will be like an update on someone from, you know,

2234
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:48,560
that they knew both 20 years ago.

2235
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,720
And she'll be like, that can't be that this guy is suddenly a priest.

2236
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:52,160
He was so unreligious or whatever it was.

2237
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:53,280
There'll be something that makes no sense.

2238
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:55,440
And she'll go look it up on Facebook and it proves to be true.

2239
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:58,160
So, you know, she'll constantly have to double check things.

2240
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:03,440
And she yeah, I mean, so it's it's remarkable.

2241
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:06,160
But I do not doubt that the wolves are probably using telepathy.

2242
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:08,680
Yeah, I think chimpanzees do it, too.

2243
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:11,840
I think they all have roles and they know what role to play.

2244
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:15,240
And they just sort of like lock in on this task together

2245
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:18,560
and somehow or another communicate like they lay in wait.

2246
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:22,360
They know when to wait. So weird. It's so cool.

2247
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:25,800
Yeah, it's so cool. I mean.

2248
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:30,040
Imagine if one day we can figure out through technology

2249
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:34,920
to access minds of animals and see how an owl thinks,

2250
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:40,360
like, see, like, what is what is the what's the process in their mind

2251
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:42,240
when they lock on to what is a predator thing?

2252
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:43,360
What is it? What is it?

2253
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:45,840
Does a prey animal know when it's being watched?

2254
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:47,640
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

2255
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:50,160
I mean, there's been that trust me.

2256
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:52,440
I'm a hunter.

2257
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:54,760
They don't always know.

2258
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:55,960
They don't know at all.

2259
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:57,880
No, sometimes they don't know at all.

2260
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:01,400
That's so how far away are you when you're sometimes like 50, 60 yards

2261
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:03,720
and they have no idea you're there. Wow.

2262
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:06,440
And they're, you know, but a lot of times they're distracted

2263
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:08,400
because they're in the rut.

2264
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:12,680
So they're mating and they're distracted, which is a rude way to hunt them.

2265
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,160
Yeah, that's that's how that's how people hunt.

2266
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:18,120
Yeah, the worst way to hunt someone.

2267
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:20,120
I mean, not always a lot of animals.

2268
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:22,160
You got the music that are not in the rut.

2269
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:26,120
But, you know, like white teal deer elk, primarily,

2270
02:14:26,120 --> 02:14:28,120
you hunt them when they're in the rut. Yeah.

2271
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:31,960
There's some animals, though, that are very, very difficult to hunt.

2272
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:34,800
And one of the reasons why is you don't hunt them when they're in the rut.

2273
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:39,480
Like mule deer, mule deer are the most clever

2274
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:41,960
and the most aware of all deer species

2275
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:44,120
because they're constantly being pursued by mountain lions.

2276
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,680
So they're always like, what the fuck is that?

2277
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:52,480
They're like always on on edge and they have an uncanny ability

2278
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:54,240
to get out of the way.

2279
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:57,640
They just they they know something's there and they're like, fuck this.

2280
02:14:57,640 --> 02:14:59,160
And they just bounce out. Yeah.

2281
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:01,720
Yeah, you got to sneak up on them when the wind's blowing.

2282
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:05,040
You got to like like people take their shoes off to creep up on them.

2283
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:06,200
So tactical. Yeah.

2284
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:07,160
Well, you have to be. Yeah.

2285
02:15:07,160 --> 02:15:08,920
Because you have to especially bow hunting.

2286
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:12,560
Yeah. So you have to get ideally you want to get within inside of 60 yards.

2287
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:13,840
Yeah. That's really what you want.

2288
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,800
Especially a mule deer is not that big.

2289
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:17,920
An elk is a much larger target.

2290
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:20,520
But a mule deer is, you know, a big one's like 300 pounds.

2291
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,640
You've got to get pretty close.

2292
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:25,320
And they fucking know something's up.

2293
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:27,320
Yeah. You know, something's up. Yeah.

2294
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:29,360
You know, sometimes you're staring at them and they're just like,

2295
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:33,120
you know, they're just tuned in.

2296
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:36,040
Yeah. There's also I don't know if this is real or not,

2297
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:40,080
but there's a company called Hex and they make these

2298
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:44,880
they make clothes that block out your electrical signal.

2299
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:47,720
And one of the things like it's very hard to discern

2300
02:15:47,720 --> 02:15:50,160
whether or not it works with right with mammals.

2301
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:53,560
But it seems to work really well with fish.

2302
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:57,640
So there's a lot of video evidence of these people putting these

2303
02:15:57,640 --> 02:16:02,640
Hex suits on underneath their their wet gear or their scuba gear

2304
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:07,680
and then going in the water and being able to get like right up close to fish.

2305
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:09,280
They don't even know what the fuck is going on.

2306
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:10,880
And they couldn't if they didn't have the suit on.

2307
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:13,160
This is their assertion. OK.

2308
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:15,240
Now, obviously, they're selling a product.

2309
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:19,320
Yeah. Very controversial in the the hunting world,

2310
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:20,560
whether or not these things are real.

2311
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,520
Some people 100 percent believe in them.

2312
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:25,520
And there's a bunch of evidence that people wear them.

2313
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:28,640
And then they sit in a field and turkeys like get right next to them.

2314
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,560
And turkeys have incredible vision.

2315
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:32,040
Turkeys have better vision than humans.

2316
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:34,200
Yeah. Huh. I'd like to know more about that.

2317
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:38,400
Yeah. But the the really compelling stuff to me is the water stuff

2318
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:39,480
because they do it in the water.

2319
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:45,200
And the idea is that prey animals have this electrical

2320
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:50,360
some sort of signal that they're giving off.

2321
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:52,280
Yeah. These animals can pick up.

2322
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,000
That's really interesting. I'd like to learn more about that.

2323
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,600
That's fast. Well, fish have a thing called the lateral line.

2324
02:16:57,960 --> 02:16:59,520
You ever seen that line on the fish?

2325
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:03,560
So that lateral line is interpreting movement in the water.

2326
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:06,680
It's interpreting. So, yeah, a filmographer.

2327
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:09,800
He says it lets them get closer to anything. Really? Yeah.

2328
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:12,160
Well, it's just showing different.

2329
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:16,320
So this is the problem is obviously this is a commercial. Right. Right.

2330
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:20,080
And the problem is, you know, these people believe it.

2331
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:22,080
And I don't know if they've done like,

2332
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:24,640
how would you do a double blind study with this?

2333
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:27,720
You know, would you you're you're dealing with?

2334
02:17:27,720 --> 02:17:29,400
Yeah. Completely different fish.

2335
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:31,440
Completely different time. Yeah.

2336
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:33,280
You know, there's a what did that fish experience?

2337
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:35,960
Did that fish just experience a shark 30 minutes ago? Right.

2338
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:37,480
What do you know what's going on?

2339
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:39,120
Are they on edge? You have to do a bunch of them, I think.

2340
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:40,360
You have to do it a lot. Yeah.

2341
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:42,480
And I don't know if they've done that, because I think they're just trying

2342
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:45,160
to sell this thing that may or may not work.

2343
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:47,360
And it's because it blocks out your magnetic field.

2344
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:48,480
Is that what they're saying? Supposedly.

2345
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:52,120
What is what is their explanation for what it does?

2346
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:55,160
Has something to do with measuring that?

2347
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:58,560
Well, the human body is essentially an electrical system, right?

2348
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:02,640
So it kind of makes sense that we would give off some sort of a

2349
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:08,160
a visual representation or some senses that we don't understand.

2350
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:10,520
This is electromagnetic patterns or OK.

2351
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:12,160
So about that. Huh?

2352
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:14,200
All right. What is it?

2353
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:16,160
Google HEC suit debunked.

2354
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:21,920
Oh, Google that HEC suit, HEC suit debunked.

2355
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:25,440
I wonder if anybody's ever tried to debunk it and say that's nonsense.

2356
02:18:25,440 --> 02:18:27,600
Because I know a lot of people that don't think it's that works.

2357
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:28,880
Yeah. They don't wear them.

2358
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:32,000
But I know my friend John Dudley, who's one of the best hunters in the world.

2359
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,560
He wears it every time he goes hunting. Really? Yeah. Fascinating.

2360
02:18:34,560 --> 02:18:37,160
He thinks animals can't see him as well when he wears it.

2361
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:39,960
So interesting. I mean, if he believes it works and that's like, you know,

2362
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:43,840
sometimes the the act of faith is more important than the fact of it.

2363
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:46,160
All right. Sometimes. Maybe.

2364
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:49,240
I don't know. No, I think the fact is more important,

2365
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:51,600
because if you're doing both things, if you're doing

2366
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:54,200
if you're you're doing everything correctly,

2367
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:57,120
but one thing does give you like camouflage works.

2368
02:18:57,520 --> 02:19:00,600
We know it works because there's something about the way animals see.

2369
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:04,600
They they essentially see movement and line detection.

2370
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:08,160
So to see the frame of a human being clearly, if you're wearing black

2371
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:11,800
and you're standing there and you're a bipedal thing, they're like, oh, fuck that.

2372
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:13,760
That's person. Yeah. Let's get out of here.

2373
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:17,600
But if your lines are completely broken up by camouflage

2374
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:20,160
and you stand still, they don't see you.

2375
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:22,000
They see nonsense.

2376
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,360
They see the woods. Yeah. See, you know, you blend in. Yeah. Yeah.

2377
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:28,720
And that's why camouflage doesn't have to look like leaves and sticks.

2378
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:32,840
It can just look like patches of black and stripes and tiger stripes.

2379
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:36,080
Right. It makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, it does. It does make sense.

2380
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:39,040
I mean, that's why animals in nature have that. Yeah.

2381
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:42,160
You know, I was watching this thing where they were explaining

2382
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:48,240
what animals see versus what we see, why tigers would be so beautifully colored

2383
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:51,200
because the animals don't see that color for whatever reason,

2384
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:55,800
but they do see the lines and the lines completely blur in with the grass

2385
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:58,480
because animals see in black and white. Right.

2386
02:19:58,480 --> 02:20:01,200
Or in a weird shade. Interesting.

2387
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:03,440
Have you found anything about Hexsuit debunked?

2388
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:06,040
Tons of anecdotal evidence.

2389
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:07,600
Few videos, people, though.

2390
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:10,360
A good point is like, how did Fred Bear do it?

2391
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:12,440
How did he get so close to stuff?

2392
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:13,800
That's just their example.

2393
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:16,240
The old, you know, the original hunter. Right.

2394
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:18,600
Those guys all wore like final shirts.

2395
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:20,480
And they weren't doing odor blocking.

2396
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:22,480
Yeah, that odor blocking shit doesn't work.

2397
02:20:22,480 --> 02:20:25,080
Yeah. And I have no real no one did like a study.

2398
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:28,320
And by the way, if you have odor blocking, the animals smell the odor blocking.

2399
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:29,280
And they're like, what the right?

2400
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:33,720
Yes. Yeah, that was that was that stinky fucking weird smell.

2401
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:35,520
There's no way we smell so bad.

2402
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:38,480
Animals, there's no way they smell us like we smell skunk.

2403
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,320
Yeah, that's so interesting.

2404
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:43,960
Yeah. You know, you could smell skunk that gets killed like five blocks away.

2405
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:45,960
That's how they smell us.

2406
02:20:45,960 --> 02:20:48,800
They know we're in the neighborhood. Yeah.

2407
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:51,200
Yeah. So I don't think that scent stuff does anything.

2408
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:53,320
I mean, maybe it blocks a little bit.

2409
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:55,240
So maybe it helps a little bit.

2410
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:58,720
Maybe. I mean, you're looking for every little edge

2411
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:03,080
because you're essentially competing with the survival instincts

2412
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:05,960
of something that has existed in that form for a thousand years or,

2413
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:08,320
excuse me, a million years or more. Right.

2414
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:09,920
You're walking into an environment you're supposed to lose.

2415
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:11,080
And you're hunting an animal.

2416
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:13,880
Yeah. The only reason why you win is because you have a bow and arrow. Right.

2417
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:18,200
Or you have a rifle and you know which way the wind's blowing.

2418
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:19,320
Yes. The big thing.

2419
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:23,000
Yeah. It's like if you get winded, if they smell you, it's over.

2420
02:21:23,440 --> 02:21:26,120
Like the whole thing is the wind has to be in your face.

2421
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:29,080
So if you're looking at the animal, the wind has to be coming in your direction.

2422
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:31,480
If the wind hits the back of your neck, it's over.

2423
02:21:31,480 --> 02:21:33,400
You feel it. You're like, oh, shit.

2424
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:34,440
Because they'll smell you instantly.

2425
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:36,880
Oh, 100. They're like, what the fuck this?

2426
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:39,040
And they're gone. Really? Instantaneously. Wow.

2427
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:40,720
Yeah. That's 100 yards away.

2428
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:43,360
They just start running. Really? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2429
02:21:43,720 --> 02:21:45,560
What if the wind was going like perpendicular?

2430
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:47,720
No, it has to go to them. OK. Right.

2431
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:49,880
That's why they always find themselves.

2432
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:55,320
They always bed down in a position where the wind is coming straight to them

2433
02:21:55,560 --> 02:21:56,960
towards any threats. Yeah.

2434
02:21:56,960 --> 02:22:01,080
And then the the females will line up and look in the other way.

2435
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:06,240
So they'll look towards the way where the wind is going. Yeah.

2436
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:08,440
And then everyone will line out.

2437
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:12,320
So the wind comes to them and then some will look in the opposite direction.

2438
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:14,960
Wow. Yeah. And try to keep their eyes open.

2439
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:17,200
But again, it's because they're dealing with cats.

2440
02:22:17,560 --> 02:22:18,920
It's a fascinating sport, though.

2441
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:22,120
Yeah. It's just because it's so it's so I mean, it is so tactical,

2442
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:25,280
not just like the physicality of it and the wind and the environment,

2443
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:31,160
but just like the mental, you know, it's also bizarrely psychedelic

2444
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:32,840
in this weird way.

2445
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:36,720
When when you're there, the world doesn't exist.

2446
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:40,960
And when you see these animals, you connect with them in some sort of a strange way.

2447
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:45,640
And you're you're trying to, like, almost not exist.

2448
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:49,320
You're trying to, like, give off nothing, which is what cats do

2449
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:51,040
when you see them creeping up on things.

2450
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:53,000
They're not like, oh, yeah, right.

2451
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,080
Not rolling. Yeah. Like locked in.

2452
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:59,080
Yeah. It's locked in almost like non-existent until they go.

2453
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:02,080
And then the whole thing is like, I got to be able to move quicker

2454
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:04,400
than you can run away. Right. Yeah.

2455
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:07,280
That's such a weird sport. Yeah. It's a weird.

2456
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:11,240
But it's whatever these animals are experiencing with each other

2457
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:13,760
is probably some form of telepathy as well.

2458
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:17,040
You know, how do they know, like how do wolves know to work together?

2459
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:19,720
Is it just trial and error? Like, hmm.

2460
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:22,880
It seems like they have roles that they like predetermined roles.

2461
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:24,560
Like one of them will chase them down.

2462
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:26,440
The other one will be laying in wait.

2463
02:23:26,440 --> 02:23:28,720
They do stuff together. They coordinate.

2464
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:30,440
Yeah. Some strange way.

2465
02:23:30,440 --> 02:23:32,360
You had that wolf woman on your show, right?

2466
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:34,000
And boy. Yeah. Fascinating.

2467
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,480
Yeah. Yeah. So interesting. Yeah.

2468
02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:38,840
But she was most afraid of people.

2469
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:41,200
Yeah. Yeah. Rightly so. Yeah.

2470
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:44,320
How many people get killed by wolves every year versus people? Yeah.

2471
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:46,960
Yeah. People are way creepier. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2472
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:47,960
Wolves are just real.

2473
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:51,120
I mean, clear, not simple, complex, obviously,

2474
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:52,640
but clear in what they're trying to do.

2475
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:54,720
They're trying to eat and survive.

2476
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:57,160
And that's that's their job. Yeah. Yeah.

2477
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:01,400
Well, this was a tangent, wasn't it? Yeah.

2478
02:24:01,400 --> 02:24:04,040
Yeah, we got a lot of tangents,

2479
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:06,280
but that's the beauty of the human mind.

2480
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:08,800
It is. I love that. It does go on tangents. Yes.

2481
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:14,280
I think that we're we're all sort of trying to understand

2482
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:18,040
why we view the world the way we do

2483
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:23,920
and how much of that has been projected upon us by culture and society.

2484
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:27,160
And how much of it is things we understand innately?

2485
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:31,000
How much how many things we can't prove,

2486
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,520
but that are a part of this world that we live in.

2487
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:40,160
Right. And I think what your show has done with the telepathy tapes

2488
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:44,080
and I'm sure what the documentary has done is I think more important

2489
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:47,400
than anything, open up this possibility to be explored,

2490
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:52,920
you know, and recognizing that it's real and that these preconceived notions

2491
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:56,040
that we've held on to for so long are probably erroneous.

2492
02:24:56,200 --> 02:25:02,280
We probably have screwed ourselves by latching on to the idea that this is it.

2493
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:04,440
Yeah. This is all that we have.

2494
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:05,920
And this is the way to live life.

2495
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:08,200
And, you know, put your suit on and go to work. Right.

2496
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:11,520
Yeah. But a boring way to live life. Yeah. Gosh.

2497
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:14,560
I can't imagine working in an office.

2498
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:16,280
Yeah. I mean, I think it's a pendulum's shift.

2499
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:18,320
I mean, the whole world is opening up right now. Right.

2500
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:20,480
I mean, there's just like so much is happening, I think,

2501
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:23,440
that people are challenging these preconceived old fat.

2502
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:26,000
Oh, I might have some coffee now. Please do. Sorry.

2503
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:30,360
No, I said no earlier. Now I'm now I'm into it. Cheers.

2504
02:25:30,360 --> 02:25:31,840
Cheers. Thanks for being here. Yeah.

2505
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:34,560
I like your mug with a third eye. You can have it.

2506
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:37,520
Really? OK, I'll bring it home. That's cool.

2507
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:41,160
So I can't wait to taste your coffee. See how strong it is.

2508
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:42,720
It's pretty good.

2509
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:45,520
That's great. Shout out to Black. It's perfect.

2510
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:48,360
Yeah, it's good. It's great.

2511
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:52,960
So what is your hope for this stuff?

2512
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:56,160
Like in your most ideal scenario?

2513
02:25:56,480 --> 02:26:00,360
How you're you're obviously your show has been received

2514
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:05,120
in a tremendously positive way and people are super intrigued

2515
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:07,680
and really popular. So that's great.

2516
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:10,040
So so more more discussion.

2517
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:13,520
But what would like in an ideal scenario, what would you like to happen?

2518
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:16,240
OK, I think there's three things, right?

2519
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:19,240
I think for one, like baseline for people to presume competence

2520
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:21,560
and non-speaking individuals or someone who can't control their body

2521
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:25,120
don't think just because they can't speak doesn't mean they can't think.

2522
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:27,280
You know, yeah, they're in there. Right.

2523
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:31,920
And then I think the second one is certainly to try to get spelling

2524
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:33,840
validated and in schools, right?

2525
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:37,640
Like it's almost like telepathy in a way operated as a Trojan horse

2526
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:41,640
to get people to acknowledge and notice these incredible individuals

2527
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:43,160
and just take note and help them.

2528
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:47,120
So I think getting spelling validated and affirmed

2529
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:50,000
and make it accessible in schools, that would be the next thing.

2530
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,040
And then I think the third thing is, I mean, truly a paradigm shift.

2531
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:55,720
I mean, I want people to know,

2532
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:58,800
because I've come to what I feel like is believe this, right?

2533
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:01,800
That there is a non-physical world that's real.

2534
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:04,520
Our idea that consciousness is at the tippy top.

2535
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:06,960
That's the result of this physical world, I think, is incorrect.

2536
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:09,640
I think consciousness is at the bottom of it and started everything.

2537
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:13,760
And with that in mind, consciousness, then we're so much more possible.

2538
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:15,560
It can survive our body.

2539
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:18,200
We can communicate without our bodies.

2540
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:20,800
We can see into the future, maybe into the past.

2541
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:23,280
I mean, whatever it is, anything mental we're capable of.

2542
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,240
And that helps us explain a lot more.

2543
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:28,080
So the paradigm shift, I think, is really cool

2544
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:30,360
if it can happen.

2545
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:32,400
And a lot of people have been working toward that, you know?

2546
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:35,760
I mean, so I'm just like a tiny bit in a large puzzle of huge giants

2547
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:37,280
have come before me. But I think that

2548
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:42,920
that if this is going to help more people like just be aware of the system

2549
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:46,080
of what is called, again, like this materialism,

2550
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:49,920
which is the idea that it's only what's real can be observed and measured.

2551
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:52,880
If we can get people to realize they're living in that system,

2552
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:55,920
that system was constructed and it's not necessarily the truth.

2553
02:27:56,120 --> 02:27:59,840
So don't be embarrassed to talk about stuff, to research stuff, to ask a question.

2554
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:02,040
You shouldn't be ridiculed and dismissed just because the system

2555
02:28:02,040 --> 02:28:03,160
tells you you should be.

2556
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:05,240
That concept is just so hard to grasp.

2557
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:09,400
If you've not if you haven't read any of Tom Campbell's stuff

2558
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:13,200
or haven't considered this or listen to Rupert Sheldrake talk or your show,

2559
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:15,800
it's like it's so hard for people to grasp that.

2560
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:17,720
Yeah. Tom Campbell blew my mind.

2561
02:28:17,720 --> 02:28:22,240
I mean, he is like, yeah, I got a lot of text messages from buddies after that.

2562
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:25,360
What the fuck, dude? Yeah, I'm so confused. Yeah.

2563
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:28,480
But this is what I will say, because I actually had a friend

2564
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:31,600
that when I was sort of like going through my own thing,

2565
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:35,200
she was just like, just if you just start reading about some of the stuff,

2566
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:38,440
just reading it, you'll find what you're looking for.

2567
02:28:38,440 --> 02:28:41,240
Like there's so much there, whether if you start reading about near

2568
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:45,320
death experiences or Ian Stevenson or Tom Campbell and any of this stuff,

2569
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:49,680
it's just like and the people are researching this. Right.

2570
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:51,920
Yeah. It's not like this just happened.

2571
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:54,360
This has been going on for a long time. These questions.

2572
02:28:54,600 --> 02:28:59,600
So once the documentary is out, what do you hope to do next?

2573
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:03,160
Do you have a game plan?

2574
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:04,880
So we just started working on the doc.

2575
02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:07,960
I'm hoping that will be done and wrapped up early next year.

2576
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:10,840
Maybe we'll premiere at South by we'll be back, hopefully.

2577
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:11,800
I mean, who knows?

2578
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:14,720
And so so after that, then we're going to do an impact campaign

2579
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:18,360
where you take a documentary around and you screen it with a panel.

2580
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:19,960
So that'd be cool. It'd be non-speakers.

2581
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:22,480
And, you know, we can get people from the Department of Education there

2582
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:23,640
or whatever in different cities.

2583
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:26,280
And then hopefully that will make an impact at people into the rooms

2584
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:28,160
talking to whatever.

2585
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:30,280
And then after that, we have a really long term goal

2586
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:32,600
where we want to try to work with like a few foundations

2587
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:35,560
or maybe start a foundation to open centers that can.

2588
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:39,160
If you can imagine something

2589
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:42,080
maybe like kind of like the size of an REI in every city

2590
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:45,040
where non-speakers can go and get like physical and mental

2591
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:49,680
and spiritual supports and spelling help and education or whatever.

2592
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:51,520
You know, there's physical therapy that can help.

2593
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:54,240
And for respite care for these parents who are working 24 seven

2594
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:55,560
to take care of these individuals.

2595
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:57,200
And it could just be a beautiful thing.

2596
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:00,080
But then there's so many academics to what you kind of noted earlier,

2597
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:02,520
like that might want to work with non-speakers who might want to.

2598
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:06,760
Can can you help me decode whale language

2599
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:10,600
or figure out how to stop blanching the coral reefs or whatever?

2600
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:13,080
So if there's, you know, I know non-speakers

2601
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:15,000
who want to work in plant medicine, who want to work in this,

2602
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:16,840
who want to work in X, Y, Z.

2603
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:18,760
But I think the most important thing is these centers

2604
02:30:18,760 --> 02:30:21,280
maybe could vet those individuals, make sure these academics

2605
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:25,160
learn to become a spelling, to communicate partner and and be

2606
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:28,120
background check to make sure they don't have some nefarious goal.

2607
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:32,160
And then this could maybe create opportunities for spellers to make money,

2608
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:35,640
to have a career, to really contribute in these meaningful ways.

2609
02:30:35,640 --> 02:30:39,000
So that's our goal is to create these like centers that can both nourish

2610
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,960
and support non-speakers and their families, but also allow non-speakers

2611
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:47,080
to engage and use their intellect and abilities to have like meaningful careers.

2612
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:50,960
That and more.

2613
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:57,040
Right. More, more people coming out, more people understanding it,

2614
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:01,160
more people grasping it, more people accepting.

2615
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:04,800
And then this sort of changes.

2616
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:08,320
The level of cynicism, so it changes the level of negativity

2617
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:10,400
and it opens up the acceptance of this stuff.

2618
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:11,680
And then maybe we learn more.

2619
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:12,960
Yeah. Yeah.

2620
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:16,400
And it's just in history, too, people would look at deaf people

2621
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:19,160
or blind people before and think they're not in there, especially deaf people.

2622
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:20,640
It was just like, oh, they must not be in there.

2623
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:23,280
No one thinks that anymore. It's ridiculous to think that. Right. Right.

2624
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:25,360
You know, but we're doing the same thing to this population.

2625
02:31:25,360 --> 02:31:28,040
So, yeah, I mean,

2626
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:30,520
there are some of the most brilliant individuals that I've ever met.

2627
02:31:30,520 --> 02:31:33,520
And actually, I talked to a teacher right before I left here today.

2628
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:35,440
And I said she was talking about her student.

2629
02:31:35,440 --> 02:31:40,960
She just had a conversation with who she said in middle school or whatever,

2630
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:43,600
high school, what did you learn that whole time?

2631
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:44,760
What did you learn in school?

2632
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:46,720
Well, he was being taught like he was little.

2633
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:48,840
And what he answered was patience.

2634
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:51,520
I mean, just so beautiful, so wise. Right.

2635
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:53,560
He wasn't crapping on it like I learned nothing.

2636
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:56,000
They kept telling me animal colors and this and whatever.

2637
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,720
Like it wasn't anger. It was I learned patience.

2638
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:04,320
Because us, you know, our stupid system that has made these individuals out

2639
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:06,280
to be like they're not smart. Right.

2640
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:09,120
Has taught them, has failed them when it comes to education.

2641
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:10,760
So I just thought that was a beautiful answer.

2642
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:15,640
And so so in line with how wise and kind and thoughtful so many non-speakers

2643
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:18,240
I've met are. Yeah, it's a beautiful answer.

2644
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:19,680
That's a good way to wrap this up.

2645
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:21,320
Thank you very much for being here.

2646
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:23,120
And thank you very much for your series.

2647
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,200
It's really incredible.

2648
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:26,800
And I can't wait to watch the documentary.

2649
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:30,600
And I'd love to have you back on when whenever it releases.

2650
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:32,640
Yeah, wonderful. I'll bring some parents with me.

2651
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:35,240
I'll bring a non-speaker with so you can see it.

2652
02:32:35,240 --> 02:32:37,200
OK, I'm going to bring Katie in Houston and your mind.

2653
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:39,720
OK, OK, let's do it. Let's do it.

2654
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:41,840
All right. Telepathy tapes.

2655
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:43,840
It's available basically everywhere.

2656
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:46,600
Spotify, Apple, whatever. Right.

2657
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:48,960
Wherever you get your podcast, you get your podcast.
