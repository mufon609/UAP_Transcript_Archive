1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And here we go. First of all, gentlemen, thanks for being here. Jeremy, thanks for coming back again.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Thanks, Joe.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And thanks to you, sir. It's very exciting to be here. Very exciting for me to be here to be able to talk to you about your story.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Thank you. I'm glad to be here.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
David, tell everybody who you are and tell everybody your background, please.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay. My name is David Fravor. I served 24 years in the military, enlisted Marine for a couple of years.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
They sent me to the Naval Academy. Then I flew for 18 years for the Navy, had literally flew A6s, Hornets, and then Super Hornets.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Had every qualification you could get in the airplane, everything, even the stuff they're not doing anymore.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So I had NVG, high, low, went to Top Gun. And at the time of the incident, we're going to talk about I was a commanding officer of VFA 41, the Black Aces.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I've gone through a journey with this whole UFO stuff, from being a full-on true believer to being incredibly skeptical,

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to trying to be open-minded, to being more of a believer now than I think I've ever been before.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And one of the things that I've always said is the people that I believe, there's a lot of loony people out there,

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but the people that I put my trust in are high-level military people like yourself.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So when I hear someone like you who has a story that defies logic or defies conventional understanding of how aircrafts work,

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that's when I sit back and I go, okay, this is a different thing.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Because there's always people that are telling you they're psychic, or they sense things, or they're in communication with Bigfoot.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There's always loony people out there. But when someone is in the military, someone is trained to defy these, I mean, how expensive are those jets?

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When we had them, they were about $70 million a piece.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, they don't give those to morons.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Typically not.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Some people in my family would probably argue that point, but hey, better lucky than good.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It just seems to me that this is, for rational people that want to look at this whole UFO phenomenon objectively,

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
you're the type of person that I want to talk to. So I was very excited to have you in here.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So what year was your incident, and you have a very, very famous incident that's corroborated by actual evidence, which is one of the rare ones.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What year was it, and where did it take place?

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So it was 2004, November 14th. It's really, if you draw San Diego to Ensenada, Mexico, we're about 60 miles off the coast in between the two.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We're doing workups, so when we get ready to deploy, this was for the 2005 deployment.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We were going at sea for November and December of 2004.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So we had been out, I had just taken over the squadron mid-October, so I had been the CO for a month.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So we go out and we're putting the battle group pieces together, so it's not just the air wing, but we're on the carrier, we've got the cruiser,

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
we've got all the support ships out there, and we're going to integrate all the defenses and train as one unit.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So the exercise that we're going to do is an air defense exercise where there's good guys, bad guys. They're all from internal, from the air wing.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So the bad guys today are going to be the Marines, VMFA-232, the Red Devils.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So they're going to launch and they're going to go about 100 miles south of the ship, and we're the good guys, and we call it a 2v2, so it's two of us against two of them.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And we're going to work with the USS Princeton, which is going to be the controller, and they're going to control the Blue Forces,

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and then the Red guys are going to give us a presentation that they're going to try and intercept so we can stop them from getting up towards the carrier.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So that's kind of the training set that we're all good.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So the Marines take off first, and they start heading to the south.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Now, we have no idea that for two weeks, the two weeks we've been at sea, they've been tracking these things coming out of the sky.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And when I talk to the Princeton controller, he's like up to about a dozen of them.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They would come down from above 80,000 feet, they'd drop down to about 20,000 feet, they'd hang out, and then they'd go straight back up after about three or four hours.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now, when you say they've been tracking them, who specifically?

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is the USS, the Princeton is tracking them, they saw them on the Nimitz radar, and the E2 could see them.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So because they're out there, you know, that radar is on all the time, and the SPY-1 system on an Aegis cruiser is probably one of the most sophisticated systems in the world.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So typically when something like this happens and there is some unexplained phenomenon, what do they do?

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
In this case, if we were in a threat environment, they would tell us, but we're off the coast of San Diego, it doesn't come to the airwings.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We have no idea that these things are out there at all.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So they observe these things, and they never bother telling any of you guys.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's correct.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So they just knew that these things had been visiting this area, but they just allowed this training exercise to take place anyway.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, talking to them, the previous, for the two weeks, they would show up, but it was when we weren't flying.

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So the typical carrier schedule is, you know, for us, it was about noon to midnight.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a 12-hour day. There's reasons for that. It can go a lot longer, but for training, we just do the 12-hour day thing.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And it's cyclic up, so you got guys taking off and landing periodically.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So we were on one of the first goes, you know, it's noon, one o'clock, somewhere around there, and we take off.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The Marines take off first, and my buddy Cheeks, who's the CEO of the Marine Squadron, he was leading the Red Air.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
When he launched off the carrier first, they called him up and said, hey, what have you got on board?

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, the small, the original legacy F-18s don't have as much gas as the Super Hornets.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The Super Hornet is about 30% bigger.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So they start talking to him about fuel, and based on how long we're going to be airborne and everything else,

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
they go, hey, why don't you just go ahead and proceed to your cap point?

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because we had just taken off.

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And that's when the controller had come up and said, hey, yeah, I forget our cost.

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's probably like dealer is usually what we went. So it'd be like dealer one-one.

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is Prince of Control. What do you got?

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You know, say your loadout, and I kind of chuckled. He said, I said, well, I got a Catam-9, which is a,

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
it's basically just a blue metal tube with a seeker head for an A-9 IR missile.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a training. It doesn't come off the airplane. You can beat it with a sledgehammer.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's the only way you're going to get it off, or you got to unlock the lugs with a key.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So I'm like kind of chuckling. He goes, well, hey, we're going to cancel the training.

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So we're like, OK. He says, we got real world vector, and they're going to send us out to the West.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So picture if it's, you know, if you've got a clock, the Nimitz is in the middle.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We're a little bit south of that, about 40 miles south.

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And then the Marines are about 100 miles south of the ship, about 60 miles between the two of us.

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So as this is all happening, my wingman is joining up.

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All right. And these are F-18F. So there's two people in each jet.

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So it's me and my whizzo, which is weapon systems operator.

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And I've got the other pilot and the weapon systems operator in the other jet.

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So they tell us all this. Hey, we're going to real world vector.

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And they send us out 270 about 60 miles away from where we're going.

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So now we're going out even further out to sea.

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We have no idea what we're intercepting.

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And this is when the controller starts talking to us.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He says, hey, sir, we've seen these objects.

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They've been for two weeks. They've been coming down.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And he's given us the whole story. He says, we need you to go investigate.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We want to know what these are.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But they're asking you to investigate in a jet that's unarmed.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's correct. Yeah, we have no.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And there's reasons for that, that we don't fly.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We typically don't fly with live ordnance unless we're actually going into like a combat zone

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
or we're on a training range and we're going to shoot something.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And the reason is you can go through history of the Navy or Air Force.

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you put live missiles on airplanes and then you start doing training where you're squeezing the trigger,

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
someone always messes the switchology up and someone gets shot down.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's happened multiple times. So we don't do it.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You know, there's times that we do, but it's rare.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So we start flying out to the West.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now, I want you to think because the other pilot has a, you know, when you talk to it, it's good.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's out there. It was a female.

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
When you talk to her, it's here's the kind of goes through the mindset of hey, we're off the coast of Mexico.

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Real world vector. We have no idea what we're going to look at.

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Probably drug runner because you get the drug runners coming up the coast.

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So we're like, OK, so we drive out and they're calling down ranges.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So they're telling us, hey, it's 270 at 30 miles at 20,000 feet.

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And it's, you know, and then you just count down the ranges and we're talking back and forth the whole time.

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So they got to a point where they say, hey, merge plot, which means radars have resolution cells, you know, range and azimuth of what the radar can actually see.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Once you're inside that box, you can't tell the difference between me and the object I'm going at.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We're just become one big blob.

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So they call merge plot. And so the other jet is on my left hand side and we're going to go to a clock code to make it simple.

111
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So the object we're going to end up looking for is right in the middle of the clock.

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And we are at the six o'clock position and my wingman is off to my left side.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So it's she's further down with her.

114
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So as we're looking around, we we look to the right and there's a yesterday was a perfect example out here.

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The water is perfectly calm.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No white caps. I mean, it's literally a perfect San Diego, California day.

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And we see white water, something like if you see a seamount, you know, rock underwater when you're standing on the shore and the waves are breaking over and you're like, what is that?

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's usually because there's a rock under the water.

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So it looks like that, but it's about the size of a seven thirty seven.

120
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It actually kind of has a shape of like a cross and it's pointing to the east.

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So you've got the long part going east west and you got a couple of things going north and south.

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So as we're looking at it, because that kind of draws our eyes, we're like, oh, that's kind of odd.

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We look down and the whizzo in the other airplane comes up and says, hey, skipper, do you?

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And that's about what he gets out of his mouth.

125
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I'm kind of looking at the same thing. I go, dude, do you see that?

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What is that thing? And what we see is this white tic tac looking object just above the surface of the water pointing north south.

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And it's going north, south, east, west. It's just radically moving forward, back, left, right at will.

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And it's moving around the disturbance, the white water that we see.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
How big is this thing?

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Over time, it's about 40 feet long.

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And the way I estimate that is, I mean, I got a lot of time fighting other airplanes, so it's about the size of a hornet fuselage.

132
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So that's why you say 40 feet.

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This thing's just going left. So the first thing you see when you look down, you go, and this is with our eyes.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's not sensors, right? So we're looking down at this thing.

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And first thing you think is helicopter, right?

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The helicopters typically stay below 200 feet when we're out there and they're just driving around.

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We're pretty far away from the ship for a helicopter, for one of ours.

138
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So what is it? So the first thing you look for is rotor wash.

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't know if you've watched any TV show that starts kicking the water up, and you can see that.

140
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's really easy to see from the air. So we're like, no rotor wash.

141
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Matter of fact, don't see any rotors, don't see any tail rotor, don't see any, you know, the main rotors.

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They're like, that's kind of weird. So as we're driving around, we're looking at this thing.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We get to about the nine o'clock position.

144
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
How far away are you from this thing?

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm at 20,000 feet, and it's right down on the surface, right off our right side.

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So I'm probably maybe a couple miles lateral and 20,000 feet.

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm just watching it move around.

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So it's very small in your eyes?

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Not overly small. I mean, an airplane down that low, it's 40 feet.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can see pretty well. It was pretty clear.

151
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So I'm like, OK. So I said, I'm going to go check it out.

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's what we're trained to do. The other pilot says, hey, I'm going to stay up here.

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And I'm like, that's perfect. So now we'll get some separation.

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We'll get it from different views.

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And the other airplane, well, I kind of have a God's eye view of everything that's going on as I go down and check this thing out.

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So I start driving around, and it's still doing its forward, back, left, right.

157
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's still pointing north-south.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We get to about the 12 o'clock position.

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm just in a nice, easy descent for a reason, because I've been asked, could you go more aggressive?

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You can. But when you're out over water, the water looks the same at 20,000 feet as it does at 2,000 feet.

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So you can easily put yourself in a non-recoverable position if you're not paying attention and you go into the water.

162
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So I got this nice, easy descent. I get to about 12 o'clock.

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And as I'm coming down, I could guess probably about 18,000 feet now, a couple thousand feet below the other airplane.

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The tic-tac just kind of rapidly goes boop and turns.

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So now it's kind of pointing east-west, and now it mirrors us.

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So it's above the surface. We're up high. We're coming down. It starts coming up.

167
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm like, well, this is getting interesting.

168
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So we kind of drive all the way around a circle. I'm descending. It's coming up.

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And I get over to about the 8 o'clock position on the clock.

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And it's over at about the 2 o'clock position.

171
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, the quickest way, as we know as kids, to get someone, you know, you can keep going around the circle.

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Nothing's going to happen. You cut across the circle.

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So I'm about, I don't know, probably 2,000 to 3,000 feet above it.

174
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I just kind of drop my nose aggressively, and I cut across the circle.

175
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And it's coming this way.

176
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's because I'm trying to fly to where it's going to be because I want to join on it.

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I want to see how close I can get to it.

178
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And as I'm pulling up, it's kind of starting to cross my nose, and it starts to accelerate.

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And within about less than a second, as I start to pull nose onto it, and it crosses right in front of me, it just goes poof, and it's gone.

180
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So I call the other airplane, and I said, hey, do you guys see that thing?

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And they're like, sir, it's gone. We don't see it at all.

182
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So I'm like, okay, that's kind of weird.

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So we don't see it. We're looking.

184
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
At the same time, I say, hey, let's turn around and let's go back to see what was in the water.

185
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You know, was there something there?

186
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So we turn around. We're right there. We haven't gone anywhere. It's gone.

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Water's perfect. There's no white water, nothing. It's just blue.

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We're like, okay.

189
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So we turn back around. Now we're heading back out towards the east.

190
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And I tell the controller, I said, well, I said, you know, I first said, I'm kind of weirded out.

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And I told my back seater that.

192
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And we start heading back, and the controller on the Princeton comes up and he says, sir, you're not going to believe this, but that thing is back at your cap point.

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That was our original point where we were going to hold 40 miles south of the ship.

194
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So this thing has went from wherever we were at to about 60 miles in, you know, maybe 30, 40 seconds.

195
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's already over there. And it just and they didn't track it.

196
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It just appeared. He just shows back up on the radar and they go, it's here.

197
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So we're like, okay. So we fly back. We don't see it.

198
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We don't see it on our radar. We don't see it on any of our sensors.

199
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We do like two runs and we come back to the ship and land.

200
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So as we're in our it's we call it the PR shop, we're taking off our flight gear.

201
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
One of my crews is getting ready to go out.

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And I think they were going to be on a tanker mission, but they had a targeting pod on board.

203
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So they launch off and we're telling them about this before.

204
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And I in the back seater, Chad says he's really determined he's going to find this thing.

205
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So he tells a pilot, hey, we're going to find this thing.

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So there's out driving around and in the back seat of a Super Hornet, there's no stick.

207
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But they're side stick controllers and they're to control the sensors because that's what the weapon systems guys do.

208
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And they can change displays really fast by just hitting a button and it'll flip from the radar to the targeting pod.

209
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And the way the system actually works is when you see something on the radar and you designate it as your primary target,

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
all the other sensors will look at that point. So it's everything is kind of synced together.

211
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So he picks up a hit on his radar and he goes to lock it up because I watched all the tapes.

212
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
He goes to lock it up and immediately the radar can tell it gets signals back that it's being jammed.

213
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So and technically jamming is an act of war.

214
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It starts jamming the radar, goes into a jam extrapolate.

215
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
A bunch of stuff happens on the scope.

216
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Well, he's smart enough to castle to his targeting pod.

217
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And he takes a passive track.

218
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And that's the video that you see of the tic tac where it's just sitting in the middle of the screen real quiet.

219
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So he does that and he and he goes through if you watch the video, if we had it, I'd go through it with you.

220
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But they go through all the different modes.

221
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So he goes, it's an IR and an EO. EO is TV. It's black and white TV camera.

222
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We do. We can get the video right online.

223
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's get the video, Jamie.

224
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Where would you can't show it to anybody.

225
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
We can't we can't show it on YouTube, but you can see it and people will be able to go to it.

226
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You know what we'll do?

227
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Go to the video and we'll tell people when we're starting and we'll tell people what the title of the video that you get to is

228
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and they can sync it up themselves if they're watching it.

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's publicly owned. It's, you know, American government.

230
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Right. So it is actually something in the public domain.

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So you think we could play it on YouTube and not get polled? Yeah, 100 percent.

232
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You think so, Jamie? It's a government.

233
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Those things I would say, yes, we should be able to.

234
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But sometimes those things get messy.

235
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So let's take a chance. Let's take a chance with this one.

236
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I know if you go if you're on a New York Times article, there's a link to it.

237
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's a Pentagon release.

238
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
YouTube is crazy with copyright stuff.

239
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And we've always been like two steps away from getting pulled off YouTube completely.

240
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's a real disaster.

241
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I understand from their perspective, there's a lot of legal issues they have to deal with.

242
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But I have it on a private server.

243
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I could maybe send Jamie.

244
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The issue, I believe, though, is the actual copyright of the video itself.

245
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, it's just it's a Pentagon release.

246
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And the Pentagon is going to come after us.

247
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't think so.

248
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So either you find it.

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I want to find a good version of the video that doesn't have somebody.

250
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Jeremy, do you know?

251
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I've got an unwatermarked version.

252
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let me just look it up.

253
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Jeremy will get it to us.

254
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I have to figure out how to send it to you right here.

255
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Give me a second.

256
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Do you have AirDrop?

257
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Could you AirDrop?

258
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah, but I got it on a page.

259
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I got it on a page, a private page.

260
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I can send Jamie.

261
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, yeah. OK.

262
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
OK. Do you have Jamie's info?

263
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
No.

264
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Send.

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
OK.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll figure it out.

267
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Send it to me and I'll send it to him.

268
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
OK.

269
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's pretty easy.

270
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Sorry to disrupt the momentum.

271
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No, you're good.

272
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But I think this it's probably important to be able to have this the video itself so you could just talk about it.

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And we're about to yank it up here.

274
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
OK, Jamie wrote it down for you.

275
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Thanks.

276
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Give me a second to get it out.

277
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
OK.

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And for people who don't know, Jeremy also produced Bob Lazar, Area 51, and Flying Saucers.

279
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And he was in here when we had Bob Lazar in, talk about Bob's experience.

280
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And, Jesus, if that wasn't a game changer for me and for a lot of other people.

281
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This is a subject that it's so easy to mock.

282
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You know, this is why I think it's so important that we talk to people like you.

283
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Because, like I said, just your average every day UFO crackpot.

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
They believe everything in anything.

285
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Have you had you ever had any UFO experiences before this?

286
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No, the irony.

287
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And I tell this story.

288
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
My mother-in-law, she'll be listening.

289
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
She literally every time I would go home, she would ask me, hey, did you see UFO?

290
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Did you see a few?

291
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And I'd be like, no.

292
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
When I first started dating my wife, she was a big like National Enquirer.

293
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
She had all the, you know, supermarket tabloids.

294
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And I would always just feed her crap for it.

295
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So this happens and, you know, and I never say a word.

296
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So my friends all knew it was a great story over beers.

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Because they'd go, hey, what's the coolest thing you ever saw flying?

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I go, I chased a UFO.

299
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And they go, get out of here.

300
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I go, no, seriously.

301
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And I tell them the story.

302
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And they're like, dude.

303
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I go, yeah.

304
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So I go home and I got asked by Lou Elizondo to do the New York Times article.

305
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Which as like anything else, I always say no.

306
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Like it took a bunch of times to get me on your show.

307
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Jeremy kept asking, asking, asking.

308
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Thank you, Jeremy.

309
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You got to thank my contractor's wife, Angel, who we were at a party drinking.

310
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And she goes, you got to do Rogan.

311
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I go, what?

312
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
She goes, it's the biggest podcast on the planet.

313
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
She goes, you got to do it.

314
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And I go, all right.

315
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm going to do it just for you.

316
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm going to do this show.

317
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Shout out to Angel.

318
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah.

319
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
From New Hampshire.

320
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So my mother-in-law, we're sitting there and I know the New York Times article is going

321
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
to come out.

322
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And so it was at Thanksgiving in 20, when the article came out, 17.

323
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So it was Thanksgiving in 2017.

324
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And everyone had kind of left the house.

325
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So it's just my wife and my in-laws, a couple of us sitting in the kitchen.

326
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And I said, hey, I got to tell you guys this.

327
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They said what?

328
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I said, there's going to be this article that comes out in the New York Times and I'm in

329
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
it.

330
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And they're like, yeah.

331
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I go, well, I chased a UFO.

332
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
My mother-in-law's like, ha ha.

333
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
She looks at my father-in-law.

334
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
He's rolling his eyes looking at me like, are you serious?

335
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And I go, yeah, yeah.

336
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And then she's like, you never told us.

337
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I go, I never really told anyone.

338
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I mean, my wife and kids knew the event happened, but they didn't have all the details because

339
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
it was just one of those things I just didn't get into.

340
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Is it classified?

341
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No.

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Was it at any point in time?

343
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No, there's a lot of rumors out there that it was classified and the ship got locked

344
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
down.

345
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No, it wasn't.

346
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Men in suits did not show up.

347
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No one told us not to talk about it.

348
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And this is because there's a lot of other people saying other things.

349
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And I said, here's the context.

350
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So in the battle group, you've got the admiral, you got the captain of the ship, the captain

351
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
of the Princeton, and then you've got the other COs.

352
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So in position-wise, I'm probably, as a CO of a squadron, in the top 20 out of 6,000.

353
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And no one came to talk to me.

354
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No one came to take my tapes.

355
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No one showed up in a suit.

356
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No one told me not to talk.

357
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No one talked to any of my air crew that were involved in this.

358
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
There were six people total involved, the two that shot the video and the four of us

359
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that looked at it for five minutes with our eyes.

360
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No one, nothing.

361
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And I can get into how there's a report that George Knapp got released.

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I call it the unofficial official report.

363
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And I had met someone, and I'm like, hey, can you find anything out?

364
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I had this incident.

365
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Normally, when you tell people this, they look at you like, dude, what are you smoking?

366
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And I'm like, no, no, I'm good.

367
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm tested.

368
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And they go, and they said, well, let me see what I can do.

369
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And I had got a call.

370
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I was working, I was doing some aerospace work, and I had gotten a call on my cell phone

371
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
from a guy, and he said, hey, I want to investigate your incident.

372
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And I go, okay.

373
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So he did.

374
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
He investigated the incident, and it was very, very thorough.

375
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I mean, if you've read the, it's about 10 pages long.

376
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And he, I mean, he tracked down everybody.

377
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
He tracked down all the people that were, the air crew that were involved.

378
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He talked to, he tracked down the admiral.

379
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
He talked, I mean, it was a pretty thorough report.

380
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And I didn't think anything of it, you know, because, you know, the people were worried

381
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that it's out there, so they want to do FOIA, but it was never released in a FOIA request.

382
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I actually had the Navy call me.

383
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'd been out of the Navy for like six years.

384
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And let's explain to people, that means freedom of information.

385
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So I got called by a public affairs person from the Navy and said, hey, is this Commander Frayer?

386
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And I said, yeah.

387
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And they said, hey, do you know of any documentation on your UFO incident off the Nimitz?

388
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And I said, official.

389
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And she said, yeah.

390
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I said, no, because I knew the report existed.

391
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But to me, it was an unofficial because I didn't know who, where it went.

392
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And I had a copy of it, but because it wasn't official.

393
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Well, then years later, I find out that the guy who actually did the report was part of the ATIP team.

394
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And I was talking to Lou Elizondo, who runs that program.

395
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And Lou showed me the documentation of the original.

396
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I think it's like 13 people that were part of ATIP and they were FOIA exempt.

397
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And I'm like, well, that's kind of, well, hey, I know that guy.

398
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
He's the guy that did the report, which is why it never ever came out until George got his hands on it.

399
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
How is something, Freedom of Information Act, exempt?

400
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Obviously, DOD has the ability, because I'm not a conspiracy theory person at all.

401
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I mean, I'll just tell you that.

402
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You know, I think there's reasons that the government doesn't tell the public everything.

403
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And I don't speak for the government.

404
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But I think there's a good reason for that, that not everything needs to go out to the public.

405
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But most of it does.

406
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And they just, what they do is they put a clause on, hey, for this program or whatever we're doing, which would have been an ATIP program,

407
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
the work that they do and what they find is not, it's not releasable through Freedom of Information Act.

408
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
There's probably other avenues to get that.

409
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You know, and then you go, well, what really is Freedom of Information?

410
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Because I got into this on, I was talking to someone who's a conspiracy theorist.

411
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And they said, well, so-and-so wrote and they're not getting any information on your event.

412
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I said, so what are they going to do?

413
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
They're going to call up, you're going to put in your request for Freedom of Information.

414
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You go, here's what I want.

415
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It goes to some poor guy at the Pentagon who's like, I have no idea what this is.

416
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And he searches around.

417
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He doesn't find anything.

418
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
He looks at his bud.

419
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And I go, hey, Joe, you got anything on the Nimitz incident?

420
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And you go, nope.

421
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And I go, OK, well, I didn't find anything.

422
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I looked.

423
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I did my due diligence.

424
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But I'm not going to spend the next six months of my life doing your research project for you.

425
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Right.

426
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So you get nothing.

427
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And then you assume the government's covering up when the government really isn't.

428
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They just, you know, the guys doing the research doesn't know where it's at or doesn't have access to it.

429
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Makes sense.

430
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Jamie, we have the video.

431
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
OK.

432
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Here we go.

433
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Now, explain what are we seeing and why are we seeing it in this particular shade?

434
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
OK.

435
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So we'll just kind of go around.

436
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So if you look at the, OPRs operate on the top left corner.

437
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
NAR is narrow field of view, which is zoomed in.

438
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
IR at the top middle, it means it's in infrared mode.

439
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So instead of seeing color, you're seeing temperature variations.

440
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And these things are extremely sensitive to in like tenths of degrees.

441
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
They will tell you the difference to color.

442
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So it'll go from black to white.

443
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So in this case, white is hot.

444
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So if you look down on the bottom left corner, it says WHT.

445
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That's white.

446
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It means white is hot.

447
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So the object that you're looking at is hotter than the sky around it.

448
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But what you also notice is there's no plumes.

449
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Now, if you're looking at an airplane, when you get closer, you'll actually see the exhaust coming out and there will be a really glowing plume.

450
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That's important as we look at the video.

451
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And then the most of the stuff on here, you really don't need to know.

452
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What you can look at is the bottom right corner, it says 19,990 and a B.

453
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That's the altitude.

454
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And if you look up in the little words where it says HDG and then BALT, it's autopilot.

455
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So it's on altitude hold.

456
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's just flying for that.

457
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So you can go ahead and play the video.

458
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And so those two bars next to the white object, that's a passive track.

459
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So what he's done is he's commanded the FLIR to track that.

460
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So what the system does is it uses, it's actually tracking.

461
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It can track pixels and it's just basically block those hot pixels, those white pixels from the black ones.

462
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And you're going to see now, pause it real quick.

463
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So over the top, see it went to white screen with the black object.

464
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This is a black and white TV mode.

465
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And if you look at the top, it says TV.

466
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So narrow in TV mode is actually, you can get closer than narrow in IR.

467
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's literally narrow in IR is about medium in TV mode.

468
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So you can get closer with the TV mode.

469
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So as you look at it now, in this case, you would actually start to see stuff going on.

470
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And even in TV mode, because you get exhaust, you know, the black exhaust that comes out,

471
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
you'll usually be able to see kind of some of that coming out of the back and you don't see anything.

472
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
This thing's just sitting there.

473
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And if you look at the top where it says three right, that's the pod is looking three degrees right at the nose of the airplane.

474
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So he's just flying along the bottom numbers.

475
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Don't worry, those are time.

476
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So it's 4156.

477
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So go ahead and hit play.

478
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And what he's doing is he's going, Chad's going through all the different modes because he's like, oh, I got it.

479
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And he's going to try and see the best video they can get.

480
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Now there's rumors that this video is like 10 minutes long.

481
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
No, what you're looking at is the entire video.

482
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Now notice where it says 99.9.

483
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So hit pause real quick.

484
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What that means is why he's got the pod, the targeting pod, because that's his primary sensor right now.

485
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The radar is still trying to look at this object and trying to arrange it.

486
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And the radar can't get ranging on it.

487
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So the object is doing something to say, I'm not giving you back because it's just a Doppler radar, just like a police radar is a Doppler.

488
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's trying to get arranging on you and it can't do it.

489
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So when it says 99.9, the radar cannot see this object right now.

490
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's not allowing it to get ranging.

491
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And I think that's super important, Dave, the way he explained it to me, active jamming compared to passive jamming.

492
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,000
This is a technology that is actively jamming this system rather than something like stealth aircraft, which is the shape and texture.

493
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yeah, it's because everyone thinks stealth is invisible.

494
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's not. It's just it's a technology to to basically make it harder for radars to see you.

495
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You know, and that's the whole thing.

496
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You know, if you look at, you know, airplanes that are nose on are harder to see than airplanes at the sides.

497
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Kind of like think of a barn door.

498
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
If you're looking at the whole barn door, it's really easy.

499
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
See, if I turn the barn door sideways where it's really thin, it's going to be a lot harder for you to see it.

500
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So that's it. That's the easiest, most basic way to look at this.

501
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So keep going. You can play again and you can look.

502
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
The airplane is still sitting at twenty thousand feet.

503
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's doing two hundred and fifty knots.

504
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
He's going to go through different modes and try and lock it.

505
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And it's just kind of sitting in all of a sudden as the video goes on.

506
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I think it's a minute and a half long.

507
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
See, it's going to try and require it re centers the pod.

508
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So it's it's slowly drifting to the left.

509
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The the hornet is still going the same heading, just kind of hanging out.

510
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And they're just filming this thing.

511
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And then when they get close, it's going to zing off the left hand side.

512
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
When you see it on a full because this, you know, you think digital, you'd be able to get a one for one copy.

513
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Unlike, you know, when you copy your album to a cassette, you know, you lose a little quality.

514
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, you still do in digital world and there off it goes to the left.

515
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And that's pretty fast to leave that field of view on the when we have big monitors that we look at these when they come back.

516
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So we're looking at the original tapes.

517
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Play the end of that again, please, Jimmy.

518
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So when it's taking off, how fat when it just sort of like leaves the field of view and takes off to the left, how fast is that going?

519
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I would say pretty fast. It's an estimate.

520
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
If we had ranging, you know, you could obviously do the triangle and go, hey, because we know how big the field of view is.

521
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But for something to leave the field of view that fast with the pod just staring is pretty fast.

522
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I mean, it just it's like out of here.

523
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Like nothing that we have.

524
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
No, because we can't I don't care what airplane is.

525
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So let's just use the F-22 Raptor.

526
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
That's probably one of the it's probably the best airplane in the world right now, performance wise.

527
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It can't take off like that, especially if it's a hover.

528
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I mean, you're talking something that's just sitting in space in the wind and then it just all of a sudden accelerates.

529
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Airplanes don't work that way.

530
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And it's not leaving any exhaust plume.

531
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
No, notice there's none.

532
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And when you go back to the end, even in the IR, you don't see there's IR zoomed in and there's no you would see a plume if that was an airplane.

533
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's creepy how it takes off.

534
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah.

535
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
With active jamming, it's intelligently controlled.

536
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
There's no rotors.

537
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
There's no plumes.

538
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
There's no exhaust.

539
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
There's no tail fin.

540
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
There's no tail number.

541
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This thing goes from a standstill, takes off.

542
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's a propulsion system we don't have in our inventory and no other nation does.

543
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That's how it's understood by the government.

544
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Now, if the fastest plane on Earth was trying to do that same maneuver, this system would be able to track it?

545
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah.

546
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Oh, yeah.

547
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It would stay with it until it got to the limits of the pod as far as looking to the left.

548
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And the radar would see it.

549
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I mean, when you get close enough, everything becomes visible because you get burned through with radar and how radars actually work.

550
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This one is, you know, you tell me, but this was performance beyond.

551
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I mean, it's like when we saw it disappear when it flew in front of my nose.

552
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm talking something.

553
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm within a half mile of it looking at it.

554
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And it gets in front of me and just disappears.

555
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So we'll just go to something that everyone knows is fast.

556
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Let's just say SR-71 that's doing Mach 3.

557
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You know, the visibility is 50 miles.

558
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So even at 35 miles a minute, I'm going to be able to see this thing turn into a little dot as it goes off into the horizon for probably a minute.

559
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The thing that we saw disappeared in a second.

560
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Just gone.

561
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And that's from two different angles.

562
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Remember, the other airplanes 8,000 feet above me because we get close to it at about 12,000 feet.

563
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So the other airplanes above me looking down and when it disappeared, I said, do you guys see it?

564
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And they said, no, it's gone.

565
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It just literally was poof.

566
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Now, when you came back and what do you do with this information?

567
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Do you report it?

568
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Do you talk to people about it?

569
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So the typical process, anytime we fly, everything gets debriefed.

570
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So because it was a two seat airplane, usually the junior person in the jet goes down.

571
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So I was the boss.

572
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So I wasn't going down there.

573
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So we have a thing called Civic CVIC, which is the Carrier Intel Center.

574
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So they go down.

575
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
They go down.

576
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We always take our tapes because we record stuff when we're fighting.

577
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
They take it down.

578
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And it's really to exercise the system when we're in training so that when we actually get over to,

579
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
in this case, we are going over to the Persian Gulf.

580
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Anything that we do comes in and gets debriefed and then it all gets sent off.

581
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
That's how you get the CNN video and all that.

582
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So they go down and they debrief and they have to tell, hey, we chase this object.

583
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We don't know what it is.

584
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And of course, everyone now is going to make jokes because we know we're going to catch shit because that's how the Navy works.

585
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So I told him, I said, I remember telling the guy in my backseat, I said, dude, you know, we're going to catch maximum shit for this.

586
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And he goes, yes, sir.

587
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'll show you the comics.

588
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I have them on my phone.

589
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
We do.

590
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The airplane comes out.

591
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So we know it's going to come down.

592
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So he goes in.

593
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
They debrief this.

594
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Both crews go in.

595
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And of course, everyone at Intel thinks this is hilarious.

596
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So the flight that, you know, Chad comes in with his tapes, you know, when he lands and here's the thing.

597
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Everyone I see any UFOs out there and he pulls out that tape and drops it on the counter.

598
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
He goes, yeah, it's on here.

599
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So they're like, oh, shit.

600
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So they copy it.

601
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
They play it.

602
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And there's a big it looks like a rack system.

603
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
They put the eight million.

604
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It gets copied to a hard drive.

605
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And then they archive it.

606
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So you go, OK, so I got this video.

607
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And then, you know, the ship, the spreads, you know, if you have a rumor on the ship, five thousand people are going to know about it within probably 30 minutes.

608
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It spreads that it's like a virus.

609
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So the whole ship now knows that we chase this.

610
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I guarantee the whole Princeton knew this stuff was going on and it goes all the way up.

611
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
The admiral knows about it.

612
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
The captain of the ship knew about it.

613
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And and then all the movies because we have they play movies for us on the ship and they run like a 12 hour loop.

614
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So, of course, the movie selection is Men in Black, Men in Black 2, Signs, Independence Day.

615
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And and we know we're going to be on the airplane comic because there's always a comic.

616
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
If you do something stupid or like this, then you're going to be on the comic.

617
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I'll show you the comics here a little bit.

618
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
They're pretty funny.

619
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But, you know, so that went on for two days.

620
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But, you know, we're in the middle of workups and I got a squadron to run.

621
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So it's like, you know, there was after about the first day and a half, it really died down.

622
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And then it was the there's always that closet people that you don't think that are really like UFO buffs.

623
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And, you know, like we had one of one of one of the Marines would always come and eat sit down.

624
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Hey, hey, Skipper, can I sit with you?

625
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I go, you want to talk about the UFO?

626
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Yeah, I just I can't get it out of my mind.

627
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And then we would just sit there and talk about it.

628
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You know, and to me, it was like, you know, we're just saying, you know, my entire now flying career is defined by five minutes of chasing this white tic tac vice almost 4000 hours, you know, flying.

629
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So now, did you encounter anyone else that had a similar experience?

630
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I've talked to the guys, a couple of guys from the East Coast event, the gimbal video.

631
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
One of them I talked to daily.

632
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
He's a pretty good friend of mine.

633
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Totally different now.

634
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Keep in mind, ours is 2004.

635
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The gimbal video is 2015.

636
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
The funny part about the gimbal video and the East Coast stuff that was going on, because that's off the vacate.

637
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So off the coast of the United States, they're called warning areas.

638
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And all they are is if you look on an aviation map, they're these big areas that are blocked off by blue and they say like whiskey 291 or whiskey 243.

639
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And is the gimbal video available in the same way that that video is available?

640
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yes. Yeah.

641
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Okay.

642
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Find that.

643
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So and I was talking to him about it because I actually have a buddy of mine who just retired.

644
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:14,000
He was the he led the fighter wing on the East Coast and I had called him up because we start finding out that these things were so prevalent out off the East Coast, the United States.

645
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And there's a couple of them.

646
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So there's the we're going to talk.

647
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
What they started seeing originally was these things and one of them almost hit airplane almost hit one of these things.

648
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But it looks like a cube inside of a clear beach ball.

649
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So they don't know if it's actually like a surrounding or it's you don't know if it's a force field.

650
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And you see kind of in the gimbal video, it's got like an aura around it where ours didn't.

651
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I always laugh.

652
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I go ours was a tic tac.

653
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
These are not.

654
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That means there's different stuff out there that we don't know.

655
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But they had two airplanes flying and we fly when we go out to the train.

656
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We're usually we have a distance.

657
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You know, we'll just say we're a mile apart as we're flying out.

658
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So they're flying out and they're airplanes are deployed.

659
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
We call it combat spread.

660
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And one of the airplanes almost hits one of these goes close down like 50 feet down the side and almost hits one of these floating cubes inside of the beach ball.

661
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And someone goes out.

662
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's a it's a balloon.

663
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It's not a balloon.

664
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
These things are literally sitting still.

665
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
They're they're no effect from the wind.

666
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So if you got 90 knots of wind and they talk about it, these things are just sitting there.

667
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So 60 or 70 people would see it because the radars, the newer radar in the Super Hornets is extremely, extremely capable.

668
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
OK.

669
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And at first, when they started seeing stuff, they were like, it's just like maybe it's the radar.

670
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Just give me a false target.

671
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And that radar really doesn't give false targets.

672
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And then someone did exactly what Chad did is they threw their targeting flare out there.

673
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And all of a sudden, when you see a heat signature, there's a return.

674
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
There's obviously something out where that blip is at.

675
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
What is a targeting flare?

676
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That's a we call it the AT flare.

677
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's an advanced targeting flare.

678
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It sits on the left side of the airplane and it's a launch it like a flare.

679
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
No, no, it's a it's a flare forward looking infrared receiver.

680
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Oh, so it's when you see the bombs blowing up on TV and it's that looks like a black and white and you see it.

681
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
That's the targeting pod.

682
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
OK.

683
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It's got a laser in it.

684
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's got an IR marker in it.

685
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's it's a very capable system that syncs up to this to the hornet.

686
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So everything kind of marries up.

687
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So this is the go fast.

688
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
No, this is go fast.

689
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That's not it.

690
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
No, it's the other one.

691
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's the one that looks like the.

692
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
What is that?

693
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That's called the go fast.

694
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That looks like a tic tac.

695
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And that was another one taken off the East Coast.

696
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But they grab it and it's marked that one.

697
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's going it's screaming across the ocean at a very high rate of speed.

698
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And there's been some debunkers that say, well, it's really not going that fast.

699
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It's just the way the airplane is and how the mechanics of the pod are working.

700
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
When you talk to the crew, because it's actually I could ask my bud,

701
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm pretty sure it's the same backseater took both of these videos,

702
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
took the go fast video and took the gimbal video.

703
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And my buddy was on the flight with the gimbal video.

704
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But they these things.

705
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So I called my bud because I'm like, hey, how many people are seeing these things?

706
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I got like 60 or 70.

707
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
60 or 70.

708
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
60 or 70 people had seen these things on radar.

709
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And I said, well, what do you do?

710
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And they said, well, we put out a notam, which is a notice to airmen that just says,

711
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
hey, these things are out there.

712
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So just be careful because we don't want you to hit one.

713
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah.

714
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And it's kind of like ours.

715
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You go because you would ask, you know, who do you tell?

716
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Well, everyone knows.

717
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Well, what do you do?

718
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And I said, well, because it was all white and it didn't have any markings on it

719
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
and it didn't have any wings and it didn't have any rotors.

720
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And it was just outperformed anything that we have.

721
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah, I think if I would have painted China or Russia on the side.

722
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Is this the gimbal video?

723
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yes.

724
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
OK, so it's the same pod.

725
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
What we're looking at.

726
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And when the crew finds it now, what you're not seeing, you're seeing the targeting.

727
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
When you hear him start talking, when you listen to the video, you'll hear the guy go,

728
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
dude, look, they're all over.

729
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Look at the SA page.

730
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So we have a situational awareness page.

731
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And whatever the radar is getting returns on, it'll show up.

732
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It's kind of like our God's eye view in the airplane.

733
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So the pod can only look at one thing.

734
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So he designates that as his primary target.

735
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So that's where the pod is there.

736
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
The radar is still seeing everything else.

737
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So what they're actually seeing in this video is when you see the object that he's tracking.

738
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
When I was talking to one of the other pilots, he said there's actually when you see the radar video,

739
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
there's like a almost looks like a formation in front of them,

740
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
like five smaller ones that are moving in front of it.

741
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And then they turn.

742
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So like a formation, these things turns and starts going the other way.

743
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And then while they're filming the gimbal video.

744
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And that's kind of the comms when you hear, dude, holy cow, look, they're all over.

745
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
This is unreported new information that he's actually saying right now.

746
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Everybody knows this video.

747
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
This is the one that they say turns like the Lazar craft, like belly first.

748
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
However, what he's telling you right now is something that is not public yet.

749
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
He's telling you that there was a V formation of other objects that the public has yet to see.

750
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You're not going to. You're not going to.

751
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's a radar tape.

752
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But there were more objects surrounding this is what he's telling you right now,

753
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
which is fascinating because the world doesn't know that yet.

754
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Just so you know, I mean, that's brand new.

755
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That's never been reported by New York Times, anybody.

756
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
OK, so you go ahead and play.

757
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So the cool thing with this is, you know, when he goes into so he's in our our our mode right now,

758
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
you're still seeing no plume.

759
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
He's looking forty seven. So they're actually turning into it.

760
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So it's starting to pull it back towards the nose.

761
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
See how the number at the top is decreasing and it's against the wind.

762
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Now he's in TV mode and this thing's going to just start to roll.

763
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And you can kind of see it's got that or around it.

764
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
He said they were saying that the the ones with the squares inside that look like the beach ball are the same.

765
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And this thing is just hanging out.

766
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So it's on the airplanes in a left hand turn and it's.

767
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So now it's right in front. Yeah, it's it's just rotating.

768
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Now, this is how Lazar described.

769
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yes, put that up.

770
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Lazar described that that these things would lay flat.

771
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And then when they would travel, they would turn up on their side.

772
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And that's that's how they maneuvered.

773
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So this is very similar, eerily similar to the propulsion system that Lazar talked about.

774
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And that's why this video we're seeing it very differently now,

775
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
especially with what we know about Lazar, but the idea is that it would fly belly first in high speed mode.

776
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So if they have these are gravity propelled.

777
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
This is something that's known within the government.

778
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
They're trying to back engineer it. They're trying to understand it.

779
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
We know there's a program currently that they said is is gone.

780
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
However, it is currently active to study this.

781
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
These things will turn belly first, the saucer type looking ones.

782
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And then that's the high speed mode because they focus allegedly, you know, these gravity wave amplifiers.

783
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Look, this thing turns mechanically.

784
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
They're again, no typical form of propulsion.

785
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
As an expert is telling you, this is not a glitch.

786
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
This is seen by multiple radars, multiple people.

787
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Commander Fravor was so close to it.

788
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
This is something that is not aerodynamic and it could move in ways and fashions when he's underplaying it.

789
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
When we first talked, the idea of this thing going up, up, up, up, up, up.

790
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's instantaneous acceleration back and forth.

791
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
There's no slowing down, no turning like a ping pong ball.

792
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You said me our first talk, ping pong ball in a glass.

793
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Nothing moves like that with traditional reactionary propulsion.

794
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Somebody has technology that we don't have in our inventory at all.

795
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So this is counterintuitive, the way it goes from being aerodynamic to being un-aerodynamic when it goes sideways and flies belly forward.

796
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That's correct.

797
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's well, it's not it's you know, if you talk because I was just talking to the guy the other day

798
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
the irony with this is these things would be out there for hours.

799
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
We don't have, you know, a high performance airplane does not have hours worth of gas.

800
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I mean, you know, Hornets, if we don't have aerial refueling, you know, and we're actually out doing a mission and fighting and going fast,

801
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
you know, you're talking hour and a half and you're coming back to land.

802
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Some airplanes are even less, you know, based on their size.

803
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You know, so like an F-16 doesn't have external fuel tanks, it doesn't have a lot of gas.

804
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And the Soviet airplanes are the same way.

805
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
The MiG-29 does not have a lot of gas.

806
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
The Su-27, Su-30s have a lot of gas.

807
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Because of weight?

808
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It's weight, performance, size of the airplane.

809
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So, you know, even even our intercontinental bombers like B-2, they still take off in the air or fuel.

810
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
They keep topped off so they can get to range.

811
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That's how we extend things.

812
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You got something like this that's coming down.

813
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You know, just think of the physics.

814
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So just I'll use my instinct because that's the one I really know the best is you've got an object coming from above 80,000 feet.

815
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So I'll just tell you that 80,000, it's somewhere around 70, 80,000 feet is where you can actually start to see the curvature of the Earth.

816
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You know, so that's considered space.

817
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So they're coming from above that.

818
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
They're coming straight down.

819
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
They stop at around 20,000 feet.

820
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
They hang out for three hours and then they go straight back up.

821
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So and I know you had Elon on the show.

822
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So SpaceX is really excited because they can launch a rocket and then they can have the booster come back to Earth and actually land on a pad.

823
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Very impressive engineering feat.

824
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Next to this technology, that's like a Model T next to a Porsche.

825
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I mean, it's like, wow, really?

826
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That's it.

827
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You know, and you got something that can just at will move around.

828
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Now take it to the next level.

829
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And I know this is there's a lot of talk about this.

830
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So things going to go into speculation mode.

831
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But when you take a shape like that, so just take the tic tac shape, which is shaped like a submarine.

832
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,000
If you're if you're using a propulsion, it's nonreactive where you're just manipulating the median that you're in air, whatever.

833
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You can go into the water.

834
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So when you hear the all the reports of, hey, we've seen these things since World War Two that would come out of the water and fly.

835
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,000
If you have a technology like this, as long as the object is sealed, where you're not going to get water inside of it, there's nothing that says you can't do that.

836
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Because all you're doing is you're not, you know, where a jet engine sucks in air and blows it out the back or a propeller actually pushes the water.

837
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's a force. Now you've got something that's actually manipulating the gravity field and it's just moving through a void.

838
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Then it doesn't then air.

839
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You could literally, in theory, fly, go into the ocean, cruise around, pop back up, fly around, go to space.

840
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Nothing you you remove the barriers of the normal propulsion that we have today.

841
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:24,000
There's been many instances of sightings off the coast of California of things that plunge into the water or or escape from the water and take off into space.

842
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:34,000
So, yeah, with the field propulsion system, as Commander Fravor is describing, as Lazar described, it doesn't matter the medium of space, air or water.

843
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
There's no resistance, no splash.

844
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And this goes back to, you know, Christopher Columbus reported a UFO sighting.

845
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
He did?

846
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Oh, yeah.

847
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
This idea.

848
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So this has been around.

849
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Anyway, this idea, boom, that you can go through these different mediums.

850
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Hold pause for a second.

851
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Christopher Columbus had a UFO sighting?

852
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah, it's it's a written account.

853
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So it's like, find that.

854
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
No JDO.

855
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It's not video.

856
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
No video.

857
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm shocked.

858
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It's bullshit.

859
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But that's what's so cool.

860
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So Commander Fravor's encounter, it's not the most documented.

861
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's not the most dramatic.

862
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:22,000
However, it has had the most impact out of any sighting because of his credibility and the mere fact that the New York Times picked it up with video footage, radar evidence and somebody who is as credible as Commander Fravor.

863
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It has changed the dynamic of the way people, the government responds, new Navy protocols because of Commander Fravor coming forward.

864
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
There are closed door congressional and Senate briefings.

865
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
He's been part of them.

866
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
He's admitted that before.

867
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
There's a new study about UFOs because of this encounter.

868
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It's so much evidence has so much power to it compared to other ones.

869
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Christopher Columbus.

870
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Great. Cool story.

871
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Somebody wrote it down.

872
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Who knows if he even wrote it down.

873
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
We have highly documented cases.

874
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
This one has changed our culture.

875
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And that's what's so cool.

876
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
People are talking about it differently.

877
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So here's a good story.

878
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
This is true.

879
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So I was sitting at home and usually when people try and find me, they get my wife's cell phone because it's the first one on the cell phone.

880
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Bill.

881
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And it's all in my name.

882
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So I see this call from California.

883
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I'm like, and normally I don't answer them.

884
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And it's her phone.

885
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Like, who's calling my wife?

886
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Because that is me.

887
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
So I answer it.

888
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And this lady says, hey, is Commander Fravor there?

889
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And I go, who's calling?

890
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And she goes, well, I'd like to talk to Commander Fravor.

891
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I go, who's calling?

892
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And she says, hi, I'm a 79 year old woman.

893
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And I would just like to tell him my story.

894
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I go, you're talking to him.

895
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And she goes, I've never in my life told anyone this.

896
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
She goes, I grew up, my dad was in the Navy.

897
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
She goes, he was stationed in Rhode Island at first when she was a child.

898
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
She said we were walking, her and her mom were walking on the beach and they saw these weird lights.

899
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So that kind of got her into that, oh, UFOs.

900
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
She goes, a few years later they had moved to San Francisco.

901
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So I imagine Treasure Island, because at her age that would have been, you know, probably in the 50s.

902
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Her dad was, she said her dad is working as a Navy liaison to the agency.

903
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And he came home one day and he had a telegram in his hand.

904
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And she goes, for some reason he let me read it.

905
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
She's telling me this story.

906
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And I said, well, what did it say?

907
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
She says it was, it basically said, hey, unidentified objects going in and out of the water and it had a latitude and longitude in it.

908
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And he looked at her.

909
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
She goes, and I'm a child.

910
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I always remember this.

911
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
She says, he looked at me and said, we get these all the time and it's always in the same area.

912
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And I go, of course, I go, well, you got the telegram?

913
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
She goes, of course not.

914
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
He had to take it back to work.

915
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I said, you don't have to remember that latitude and longitude.

916
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
She said, no.

917
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
She goes, but you seem to be so credible and believable.

918
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
She goes, I wanted to tell someone the story that I've never told anyone in my life.

919
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So that's what you're starting to see is people that, you know, very credible.

920
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You know, they're not, they're not crazy.

921
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
They're not making stuff up, but they're coming out and going, hey, I've had these experiences.

922
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And I've got a lot of that from over the last two years where people just find my email and send me stuff saying, hey, this happened to me or I saw this.

923
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And there's some things that are explainable because I got asked to tell this.

924
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So because we're kind of I have a sick sense of humor at times.

925
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So like I said, I had all these quals.

926
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
So we used to fly.

927
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
They don't do it right now because it's a little bit dangerous, but we used to fly night vision goggles low altitude in Hornets.

928
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
All right.

929
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So when you put on night vision goggles, they amplify light like a lot.

930
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So you can see a campfire like 50 miles away.

931
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
So we used to do it.

932
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
The good spots were down in like El Centro, California.

933
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
There's a range that there's some bombing ranges.

934
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But people go camping in the Superstition Mountains, which is kind of north and west of Imperial by I forget what it is.

935
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
The Springs.

936
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It's real prison, the desert.

937
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It'll come to me in a minute.

938
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So we would go out at night flying around on goggles and you'd see a campfire and you go, oh, UFO time.

939
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And then you get the airplane going about 600 knots and then you pull the power back to idle so you can't hear it.

940
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And you get zinging towards the fire.

941
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Well, you turn the lights are all down because we're in a restricted area.

942
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So we can do that.

943
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And there's lights on it that you can only see if you're on night vision goggles.

944
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So the other airplanes can see us, but no one else can see us.

945
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Then you go zinging at it.

946
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And then right when you get to the campfire, you pull the airplane into the vertical, you stroke the afterburners, you let them light off.

947
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You count to three, you pull them off and then you just go away.

948
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Instant UFO reporting.

949
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm sitting out in the desert.

950
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It's all quiet.

951
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And then all of a sudden there's a lure, there's lights in the sky and they go away and it's gone.

952
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
The campfire's out.

953
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So you would do that just to fuck with campers?

954
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Yes.

955
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
How rude.

956
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yes.

957
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yes, I did.

958
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm not the only one that did it, but like I said, we have a sick sense of humor.

959
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes, I'm sure.

960
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So some things are explainable because I guarantee there were phone calls made on some of the stuff that we did.

961
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And I guarantee you're not the only one who's ever done that.

962
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Oh, I know I'm not.

963
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah, I'm not that creative, but it's just, you know, you think about it.

964
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And you go, because people go, I saw this or I saw that because I've got stuff like that.

965
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And I go, yeah, I used to create stuff like that.

966
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Just not tell it was me.

967
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Do you, are you, Jeremy, I'm sure you're aware of this, the footage from the Mexican Air Force?

968
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

969
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Very aware of that.

970
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
What do you think about that?

971
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Well, again, it's IR footage, which is really interesting.

972
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
They actually got the cameras for drug runners, right?

973
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So you can see in the infrared, so it's beyond the observable, you know, eye.

974
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I myself have not detailed looked at the footage.

975
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
However, FLIR experts and people that work with NSA have looked at it for me.

976
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And they, these are not lights in the distance.

977
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
These are craft very similar to what Commander Fravor talks about without plumes,

978
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
without heat signatures, you know, non-traditional field propulsion systems.

979
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
We don't have that.

980
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I thought they tried to, is this it right here?

981
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Is this the Mexican Air Force footage?

982
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah.

983
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So they tried to say these were lights on, on like an oil rig out in the water.

984
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
That's been debunked.

985
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
This is a fire and an oil rig, right?

986
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
The 2004 Comcast video of the year was the Mexican Air Force tracking like six.

987
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So literally right after our incident, I come, we come back and I think we were getting ready to go to Fallon.

988
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And I'm, I had Comcast and the homepage comes up and there's this video and I go,

989
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
holy cow, that looks like what we chased.

990
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And it was like six of these things and they were tracking them in the same area too, right off the coast of Ensenada.

991
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And it's not as rare.

992
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
There's now admitted an increased frequency that a Pentagon spokeswoman finally went off script.

993
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I was tracking the scripts for the last two years of what Pentagon spokespeople say about Commander Fravor's experience.

994
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Someone went off script last week in the New York Times and she admitted there's an increased frequency of near misses because of these AAVs,

995
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
anomalous aerospace vehicles.

996
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
So it's pretty astounding.

997
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
We're getting all these kind of revelatory moments in these little seeds that these are not ours.

998
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
We don't have this.

999
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Even Elon doesn't have this.

1000
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I mean, this is a propulsion system, unlike anything we have.

1001
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It's amazing.

1002
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It's gravity propelled.

1003
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Now that gimbal footage, when it said that there's a fleet of them, how far away are those guys where you're seeing, you don't see the individual objects.

1004
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You only see a singular spot.

1005
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Well, the pod is, you know, when you get pretty narrow, it'd be like, you know, if I put three people around you, I can look at you and not see the other people.

1006
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So that's what the pod is doing.

1007
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But the radar is seeing everything because it has an ESA radar in it, which is an active electronically scanned array.

1008
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So instead of like the radars we had, which did the mechanical, you know, doing this like old school, this thing is just a panel that sits in the front of the airplane.

1009
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And through beam sharing or beam shaping, it can move and it can look all over.

1010
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
So we used to have what was called track while scan.

1011
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So we would be able to track a target while we're still scanning.

1012
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
This thing has scan while it scans while tracks.

1013
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So it literally, if it sees you, if the radar sees you, it has basically a weapons quality solution, then it can do that on multiple targets.

1014
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
That's the same way the SPY radar, the Aegis system works on the cruisers.

1015
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It can track multiple targets and have weapons quality on all these different targets while it's still scanning a volume.

1016
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So in that image, you're seeing one individual object, but there's other objects?

1017
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Yes, the radar is seeing the object that the pod is looking at where they're talking.

1018
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And when you hear the video, you hear the pilot say, dude, look at the SA page.

1019
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
There's there's a whole fleet of them.

1020
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So what they're seeing is the pod is looking at the main.

1021
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
That's the bigger object that the gimbal, the thing that's roll tight on the screen.

1022
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And there's five smaller things in front.

1023
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So this thing's just sitting there.

1024
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And then they kind of he said they turn around on this on the radar and start going the other way while the pods looking at this guy just kind of rotating.

1025
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So like a mothership and smaller aircraft could be something along those lines.

1026
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Is there video of those smaller aircrafts or just the video of the one large one?

1027
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
The only thing they have is the targeting pod.

1028
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I would highly doubt even if they had the video that they're going to release the radar video because of classification levels.

1029
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Are you able to tell the story you told me about what was underwater with your your other buddy?

1030
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Because is that OK? Yeah, yeah.

1031
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So it's a man, you know, people come out of the woodwork when they figure out you've had this because now they don't feel alone.

1032
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So I was working. I worked.

1033
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I still do it, but I was doing oil and gas at the time on a contract.

1034
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And one of the guys, the story came out and he was a Navy helicopter pilot.

1035
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And he comes in, he comes in, he goes, can I talk to you, man?

1036
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I go, what about you? I got I got to talk to you.

1037
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I said, what do you want to talk to me about? He says, dude, do you know your UFO?

1038
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
He said, yeah, because I had a similar experience.

1039
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I said, what's that? He said he was flying CH-53, which is a big lift, heavy lift that the Marine Corps uses.

1040
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
The Navy uses it for certain things.

1041
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And when they go off of for the East Coast, they do a lot of shooting off of at the time it was off of Puerto Rico.

1042
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
We had Roosevelt Roads that they ended up closing, but he was flying out of there.

1043
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And, you know, you got super clear Caribbean water and they have these things called BQMs.

1044
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
They fly around and then when they're all done, because they'll fly towards the ships and the ship can.

1045
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Sorry about that. They can track with the radar.

1046
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And then they also do like the ships or submarine shoot torpedoes.

1047
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
They're they're called telemetry rounds. So they have they gather all the data on what the torpedo is doing underwater.

1048
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And then they blow ballast and this thing will come to the surface and float.

1049
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And then they go pick them up and then they can extract all the data out of them.

1050
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So they do it for both. So he said the first time they're out and they're going to pick up this BQM.

1051
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And those things, when they're flying, they're done. A parachute comes out and they got to go.

1052
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
They hook it up. The Hilo drops the swimmer in the water.

1053
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
He goes and hooks this whole thing up and then they hoist the whole thing up and fly back and then they extract the data.

1054
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So he says he's sitting in the front, you know, in helicopters, there's, you know, CH-53.

1055
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
You can actually see down by your feet, you know, just like typical, like you go to Hawaii and ride because you can see when you're touching down.

1056
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
So you got really good visibility out of those things.

1057
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You can stick your head out the window, too, because you're just kind of hanging out.

1058
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
He says he's going on there and they're getting this thing hooked up.

1059
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And as he's looking down, you know, because they're, I don't know what, 50 feet above the water, he sees kind of this dark mass coming up from the depths.

1060
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And they start to hoist the diver up and he's got they've got the BQM.

1061
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And as they hoisted up, he says, and he's looking at the thing going, what the hell is that?

1062
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And then it just goes back down underwater.

1063
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It's just like once they pull the kid and the BQM out of the water, this object descends back into the depths.

1064
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So he thinks, well, that was pretty weird.

1065
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So he goes out, he says, not too long later, you know, a few months later, he's out and he's picking up a torpedo.

1066
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
So he says they got the they hooked the diver up on the winch and they're lowering him in.

1067
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And as he's looking down, he sees this big massive because it's not a submarine.

1068
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
He's seen submarines before.

1069
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Once you see a submarine, you can't confuse it with something else.

1070
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
This big object, you know, kind of circularly says it's coming up from the depths.

1071
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And he starts screaming to through the intercom system to tell him to pull the diver up.

1072
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And the divers like a few feet from the water.

1073
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So they reversed the winch and the divers thinking, what the hell is going on?

1074
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And he's getting pulled up.

1075
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And all of a sudden, he said the torpedo just got sucked down underwater and the object just descended back down into the depths.

1076
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And they never recovered the torpedo.

1077
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And this happened in the late 90s, late mid to late 90s.

1078
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I think it is.

1079
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I can probably get in touch with him and ask him.

1080
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And he told me this story and I'm like, how do you report that?

1081
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You come in and go, well, where did the torpedo go?

1082
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It just got sucked down.

1083
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It just went down, you know, and then you get to people that attributed as something happened when it blew ballast and it just took on water and sank.

1084
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And he's like, it didn't sink.

1085
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
He goes, it literally looked like it got sucked down.

1086
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,000
The only reason they didn't, they talked to him when they did the New York Times stuff, they talked to him because the incident was from the 90s.

1087
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
They didn't want to.

1088
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
They wanted something newer.

1089
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So they did not include it.

1090
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
But I know they talked to him about it.

1091
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Now, what was the other footage that we were looking at?

1092
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
There was the first footage that Jamie pulled up that wasn't the gimbal footage that was the go fast.

1093
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Go fast.

1094
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
What is that?

1095
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
That's a it actually looks more like a tic tac, but it's they saw it going across the water and they're just grabbing a lock.

1096
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So they're seeing this with their eyes and he gets the Fleer to lock on it.

1097
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And that's when you hear the kid go, oh, I got it because he gets the auto track.

1098
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
And it's just something screaming across the surface of the water.

1099
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So and this is in the same area?

1100
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
This is East Coast.

1101
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah, this is the same time frame as the gimbal video.

1102
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:56,000
So the idea that these are birds or the idea that this is a radar glitch or somebody said pilot error, like on a clear blue day, Commander Fravor has nerves.

1103
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I mean, that kind of thing that people have said on your show to you that, you know, this these are explanations that make sense.

1104
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Who said that?

1105
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I don't want to say their names.

1106
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh, Mick West?

1107
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Yeah, sure.

1108
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Mick believes everything.

1109
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Like every single thing that's ever happened has a rational explanation.

1110
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Yeah, it's so so that, you know, the probability that, you know, all the radars went off at the wrong time.

1111
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Commander Fravor, you know, had nerves and all the other pilots up there with him that, you know, this thing shot off like a like a can like a gun instantly like that.

1112
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
That was somehow perfectly coordinated.

1113
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
That's a conspiracy.

1114
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That's a fabrication.

1115
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Probably, Occam's Razors, the events happened exactly like we're being told.

1116
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah, for us, it was, you know, and I'll go back to the beginning of the story of, you know, the other pilot who was brand new.

1117
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
She had been in the squadron for four months, five months.

1118
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
So she's pretty junior.

1119
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
She's still working on her initial quality airplane.

1120
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And, you know, so she gets the, you know, we get the real world vector and it's like, OK, real world vector.

1121
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Cool.

1122
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I'm going to get to do something real exciting.

1123
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Then you see the water and you think, oh, something's sinking because it's kind of that shape of an airplane, you know, that cross type.

1124
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So now it's oh crap.

1125
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Now it's search and rescue.

1126
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
We got to go down and see, you know, because there's people, you know, and we are sympathetic.

1127
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And to the Tic Tac and as soon as the Tic Tac, it's like, you know, holy shit, what is that?

1128
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:26,000
You know, and when you get, you know, some people get very emotional when you talk about it because for me it was like, you know,

1129
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:35,000
for her, when you talk to her, she has a disdain for some of the leadership that didn't tell us that these things were out there.

1130
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
You know, they're here.

1131
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Now we're getting vectored because we were the first time the manned airplanes had been airborne when one of these things showed up

1132
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
that no one even gave us a brief that, hey, we're seeing these object out here for the last two weeks.

1133
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
They're just kind of you might want to know they're out there.

1134
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And they never told us.

1135
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
No one knew these things existed besides the radar operators.

1136
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And the radar operators didn't know what they were.

1137
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
They just knew they were seeing blips, you know.

1138
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,000
So there's a lot of stuff that, you know, that it flew around and it came around me and it didn't do any of that stuff.

1139
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It's the story that I gave you is just relatively benign.

1140
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
But it was, you know, it's it's an interesting experience.

1141
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So these incidents that they reported were taking place before you saw your that Tic Tac encounter.

1142
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
They were taking place over a period of how many weeks?

1143
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Two weeks.

1144
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
We went out the beginning of the month for this two week at sea period.

1145
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
We pulled in for Thanksgiving.

1146
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But other than that, we were out till I think December 21st is when we pulled the ship back in besides pulling in for the three days at Thanksgiving.

1147
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So, yeah, for the two weeks prior.

1148
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So this was on the 14th and we went out the beginning of the month.

1149
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
So about two weeks, they'd been watching these things come down, go up, come down, go up.

1150
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:51,000
But it was always when we were not flying, which is really probably like the midnight time frame until early in the morning, the next, you know, till noon the next day.

1151
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And then we just happened to go.

1152
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And if you think about it, you know, I laugh, you know, if if there was some little green man flying around in that Tic Tac, he probably got back to the mothership and got yelled at for being seen.

1153
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
But you're like, oh, my God, you let him see you.

1154
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:26,000
So have you communicated with anybody that has any thoughts on what what these things are doing or whether or not there's any consistency to the size of them or whether or not they think they're coming out of a larger object or anything along these lines?

1155
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
No, you know, you can ask.

1156
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Well, because I was asked, you know, what do you think they were doing?

1157
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
You know, and I said, you can look.

1158
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Well, they were observing, you know, because they're coming down and watching.

1159
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Number two is they were communicating because I think, you know, in my heart, I think there was something under the water.

1160
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I don't know what it was doing there.

1161
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,000
But because when you saw the X, the cross looking thing, explain that again.

1162
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So the disturbance seemed to be in the shape of a cross.

1163
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Like I describe it as it's about the size of a 737.

1164
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:05,000
So just think if you submerge the 737 pointing it to the east underwater by like, you know, 10, 15 feet.

1165
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So as these waves are coming across, when they, you know, they hit that object, they're going to break on top, just like you would with a submerged like a seamount.

1166
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
So and it's it's they're breaking. And that's where the tic tac was at.

1167
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
That's the only reason we saw the tic tac.

1168
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,000
That's what drew our eyes down there is we see this white water when it's a perfectly clear day with no white caps.

1169
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And you go, oh, what's that? And then you see the tic tac.

1170
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And then we, you know, we do all the chasing the tic tac and we turn we're right there and we turn around and there's no white water.

1171
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It's just blue as far as you can see.

1172
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
So at that point, you go, OK, what was it doing?

1173
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Because there was obviously something there that's not there now.

1174
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So that's where I say, well, it was observing us.

1175
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It was could have been communicating with whatever was there.

1176
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
You know, and then someone else looked at me and said, you know, I was talking to Lou and he goes, what about prepping the battlefield?

1177
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I go, OK, you know, so if you go, you know, where are these things from?

1178
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
We don't know. You know, are they from China, Russia, someplace else?

1179
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I don't know. But it's a it's a capability that we do not possess, to my knowledge.

1180
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And if you ask me in 2004, because there's a lot of guys go out and meet some secret government program, I go.

1181
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
All right. Well, let's let's let's be honest.

1182
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:23,000
One, if you have a propulsion system that made it gave the capabilities that we observed visually.

1183
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
That's a huge leap for mankind, period.

1184
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So you would say. Yeah, it was, you know, think about it.

1185
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
It's going to be 15 years next month that we saw this.

1186
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I would like to think that, OK, maybe let's just say in 2004, it was something somebody had this.

1187
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Some government had this, ours, whatever.

1188
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
If you come to now, you go 15 years later, you don't think that technology would have emerged because it literally would change everything we do.

1189
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I mean, we're happy about, you know, hybrid and electric cars and all this other stuff.

1190
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But if you've got something that works like that air travel, it would change air travel forever.

1191
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
No visible system of propulsion. No plumes.

1192
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
No, it's just a sweet joke.

1193
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Think of a 40 foot long tic tac that can move at will through the air at speeds well beyond what we've ever witnessed.

1194
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I mean, even when you watch a rocket go off, you know, one of Elon's or one of the NASA, whatever.

1195
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
You know, you sit there and while I grew up during the Apollo ages and where you just look at the thing, go up, up, up, up, up.

1196
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I've seen him shot out of Vandenberg where you go, you know, I'd sit in my house in central California and you watch it go up and go.

1197
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I can watch that thing for a while.

1198
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
This is something that just like poof in a matter of seconds is gone.

1199
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Now, are other pilots or other people that have cited these things, have they also reported something larger that's in the water near it?

1200
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
No, no, not the ones I've talked to.

1201
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I mean, I think, you know, you can get on History Channel.

1202
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
There's all kinds of stuff on there about people talking about stuff.

1203
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
But, you know, what here's the question is, what do you believe?

1204
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
What do you not believe?

1205
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And, you know, my biggest frustration is, you know, our incident and even the folks on the East Coast, it is what it is to us.

1206
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
There's no reason to embellish.

1207
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
There's no reason to make stuff up.

1208
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
But yet there's still groups of people that are making stuff up.

1209
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Like someone came out on ours was talking about and he's like, I saw the whole the whole video is 10 minutes long and it was doing all this.

1210
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
It's bullshit.

1211
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
What you see is that's literally the entire video.

1212
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
It's a minute and a half long.

1213
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I think it's about a minute and a half long.

1214
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
What people haven't seen that I saw, I mean, I've seen the radar tapes because I had them as my squadron.

1215
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:35,000
You know, I've heard, you know, the men in black, you know, I just I'm afraid, you know, maybe the OK, I'll give you the credit if they did.

1216
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:42,000
But why wouldn't they show up and talk to the guys who actually witnessed it, chased it and is one of the senior guys in the metal group?

1217
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Right. It's also possible that that men in black stuff was something that they used to do back in the day and that that program is no longer continued.

1218
01:06:49,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And, you know, from Jeremy, you would know this, the older sightings when they go back into the day to historical sightings and I'm not not Columbus, but, you know, 50s and 60s.

1219
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Did they have similar things that they talked about or something moved in this manner?

1220
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah, it's absolutely incredible.

1221
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And I want to dumb this down because that's how I had to understand it.

1222
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:17,000
When I was talking with Commander Fravor years before I kept his secret, years before New York Times blew it up, I told them it was probably going to happen.

1223
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
It wasn't by me. We were talking about it.

1224
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,000
This system that we have seen for over 70 years just documented by our military.

1225
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
This is so important. This is a non reactionary field propulsion system.

1226
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Everything we know is a reactionary propulsion system. We push something out the back, it goes forward.

1227
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
This is not like a MAG system.

1228
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
This is a gravitational field propulsion system.

1229
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And throughout history, our military has documented them and there has been ridicule.

1230
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And I'll tell you exactly why.

1231
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
1952, there was a huge flyover of Washington, D.C.

1232
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Jets were scrambled.

1233
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
All the papers covered it.

1234
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It's a very famous case.

1235
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Everybody can look up.

1236
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It's an important case because at that time a policy was started and that policy started because it crashed our communications.

1237
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
The teletypes went down.

1238
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:16,000
The panic of the UFOs that were being seen by people with fighter pilots trying to capture and trying to engage them.

1239
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And it crashed the teletypes.

1240
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So our government was like, oh, that's not happening again because Russia could use that as a scare tactic.

1241
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So this policy of denial, don't look here, nothing to see, move on, UFOs are fake.

1242
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
That's what Project Blue Book was tasked to do specifically.

1243
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,000
The guy who ran it admitted that, that it was tasked to debunk this and demystify the UFO thing.

1244
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
That's J. Alan Hynek, correct?

1245
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Right.

1246
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I also, yeah, J. Alan Hynek.

1247
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
He was once asked by a friend of mine, do you have the smoking gun?

1248
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I'll give you this document.

1249
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
It's pretty amazing.

1250
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
It's an Air Force manual where they explain what they know about UFOs at that time in 1967.

1251
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
But here's the point.

1252
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yes, this has been going on since the beginning of recorded human history.

1253
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:09,000
These propulsion systems that are captured on footage, you know, that is confirmed now by the Pentagon,

1254
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,000
like Commander Fravor's experience, this technology is not ours.

1255
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It was here 70 years ago.

1256
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
You still have about 15 years ago.

1257
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
We would see it now.

1258
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,000
These exact things at 20,000 miles an hour going on 70 years ago documented.

1259
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Somebody has a non-reactionary fuel propulsion system.

1260
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Now, are they aliens or some subsect of humans?

1261
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
You know, somebody has them.

1262
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And they're flying through our airspace with impunity and pilots like Commander Fravor,

1263
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
who, by the way, defended Los Angeles after 9-11.

1264
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I mean, this is a guy we put all of our trust in.

1265
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
He was defending Los Angeles right after 9-11.

1266
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So we got people like him coming forward saying, I saw this.

1267
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And you get Internet warriors being like, it's a bird, it's a glitch, it's Superman.

1268
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Let's not concentrate on them.

1269
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
What about the Columbus thing?

1270
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Did you find that?

1271
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Yeah.

1272
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
It's just a written...

1273
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Yeah, it's listed as like light, 1492 light signature event that they saw light in the

1274
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
distance.

1275
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
It could have been biological.

1276
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Is the actual text available?

1277
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
No, there's no...

1278
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Just like Wikipedia stuff.

1279
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It's just one of the oldest accounts I was trying to throw out that this is something

1280
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
that...

1281
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Do you know of...

1282
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,000
There's a very famous painting that shows what appears to be men in crafts flying through

1283
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
the sky in the background of an ancient painting.

1284
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1285
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I do.

1286
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I actually have a page.

1287
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,000
One of the first pages I ever put on my website is a bunch of these because throughout history,

1288
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
there are these indications of ships, of craft.

1289
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
But do you know what I'm talking about?

1290
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Yes.

1291
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It's like...

1292
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Yes.

1293
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
That's the shape of it.

1294
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,000
It's also like a plate turned on its side and then there's a person inside of it.

1295
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Yeah.

1296
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Yeah, man.

1297
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Flying through in that same...

1298
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, that's it.

1299
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Yeah.

1300
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Like look.

1301
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Yeah, it's incredible.

1302
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Look how it's flying.

1303
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
But the thing is is that everybody can say...

1304
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
The one above that's pretty cool because that was a hidden thing.

1305
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,880
I've studied that one where it says discovery 15th century.

1306
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,800
Above her left shoulder, there is an object and if you really zoom in, look at the dude

1307
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,660
staring up at it as a painter.

1308
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,660
My wife is a painter.

1309
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:15,660
Everything is intentional.

1310
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,660
Where's the guy?

1311
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,660
The guy on the...

1312
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:18,660
Yeah, right over there.

1313
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:19,660
It's pretty cool.

1314
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:20,660
Right.

1315
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:21,660
Looking up.

1316
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,320
The problem with this, Joe, is that...

1317
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,320
Go to the original one.

1318
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,320
The one that we just looked at, Jamie.

1319
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,660
The one right before that.

1320
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:27,660
Yeah.

1321
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,660
See, get a big picture.

1322
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,660
Yeah.

1323
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,660
That is so strange.

1324
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:37,720
Here you got Christ being crucified and then above him, UFOs.

1325
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,580
Is that supposed to be aliens or is that supposed to be angels?

1326
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:46,660
What is that supposed to be in these things that they have...

1327
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:49,220
It's real, similar to what we're talking about here.

1328
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,220
That's the argument of Miracle of Fatima, let's say.

1329
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,820
Again, this is so speculative.

1330
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:57,620
We have a witness here, a pilot, but when you see something like the Miracle of Fatima,

1331
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:58,620
if you look at that...

1332
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:59,620
What is the Miracle of Fatima?

1333
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:04,480
God, that's that one that was considered a real miracle by the church and the three

1334
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,180
kids were getting messages, I'll get this all wrong, but for months that they're going

1335
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:11,500
to be visited and to bring people in bigger and bigger groups gathered to where there

1336
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,820
was over 100,000 people.

1337
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:13,820
What year is this?

1338
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:14,820
1917.

1339
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:15,820
1917.

1340
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:16,820
1917.

1341
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:25,920
So dozens of thousands, if not hundreds, but dozens for sure, see an event, a mass sighting

1342
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,240
of something that happened.

1343
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:31,140
We're talking people that were religious, people that weren't religious, doctors at

1344
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,140
the time.

1345
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,140
That's not a real image, is it, Jamie?

1346
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:36,380
No, that one was doctored a little bit so you could see they're all looking at something.

1347
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,380
But that's not real.

1348
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,380
Yeah.

1349
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,660
But that's the crowd, right?

1350
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,540
The crowd is real.

1351
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,540
Is that right?

1352
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,540
Yeah, yeah.

1353
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:44,540
So here's the thing.

1354
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:47,480
Something happened that was so intense.

1355
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:51,220
Some people thought it was religious, that it was a visitation, but other people saw

1356
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:55,180
it as technological, like something descended.

1357
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,180
You know, look into it.

1358
01:12:56,180 --> 01:13:00,100
I'm just saying art pictures, like paintings we're talking about, man, you can interpret

1359
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,100
them all day.

1360
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,340
I can't hold on to that.

1361
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:08,420
I can't hold on to an eyewitness with other eyewitnesses, with radar systems, and with

1362
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,420
video.

1363
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,420
We're in a different era now.

1364
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,580
We don't have to paint it, man.

1365
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,100
We get to see it.

1366
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,100
It's fascinating, man.

1367
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,500
It is fascinating.

1368
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:20,700
But it's way more fascinating when someone like you talks about it versus some fucking

1369
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,700
random kook.

1370
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:28,720
You know, that's what makes me incredibly interested, is the, just your credibility

1371
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:32,260
and the fact that this is not, you don't have a history of seeing wacky shit that other

1372
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:33,260
people don't see.

1373
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:34,780
No, just this once.

1374
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:37,900
But it's on video and that there's other ones as well.

1375
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:38,900
It's really strange.

1376
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:43,180
I've seen people try to explain it away, and what I don't like about when they explain

1377
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:47,140
it away or attempt to explain it away is that they're trying really hard.

1378
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,620
They're not going, who knows what this fucking thing is?

1379
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,940
They're not looking at it like cleanly.

1380
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:55,780
They're looking at it like a quote unquote skeptic.

1381
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:58,900
I don't like the idea of being a skeptic.

1382
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,060
Not that I don't think you should be skeptical of certain things.

1383
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:05,700
I certainly think you should be, but there's a lot of people that brand themselves as skeptics.

1384
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,180
And I think it's a lazy way to look at things.

1385
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:09,540
I really do.

1386
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:13,900
Because I think you're just looking for the holes in things without looking at it objectively.

1387
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:19,660
If you wanted to be a scientist, if you wanted to be someone who is a fan of science, then

1388
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:22,540
you have to look at it as a thing.

1389
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:27,580
Look at this information and let's study this without any bias, any preconceived notions.

1390
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,180
I don't think they're doing that.

1391
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:33,860
They're looking at it and they're trying to find a way where they can justify that it's

1392
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,340
fake.

1393
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:39,980
And they're just doing all sorts of mental gymnastics to try to make it fake.

1394
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,900
That video that you show where that thing slips off to the left and takes off at incredible

1395
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:47,820
rates of speed, that alone should freak people the fuck out.

1396
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:51,820
Yeah, well, I think because people confuse all the time, like we took the video, no,

1397
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,820
it was another crew that took the video.

1398
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:58,500
We watched it for five minutes with our eyeballs and there was four of us and we all have the

1399
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,500
same story.

1400
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,180
We all saw the same stuff.

1401
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:04,620
We all came back and looked at each other and scratched our head and said, WTF, you

1402
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:08,260
know, I mean, serious, what was that?

1403
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,980
You know, and then what do you do?

1404
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,140
You move on.

1405
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,420
We never saw it again.

1406
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:18,020
I imagine they probably saw them on radar after that, but I think...

1407
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,940
They're probably seeing them on radar all the time.

1408
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:23,020
They just don't bring it to the attention of the general public.

1409
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:27,020
Oh yeah, because if you don't, you know, for a ship when they see something, you know,

1410
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,020
what is that?

1411
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,580
Well, you don't have any way to go out there and look at it.

1412
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,820
When you're talking about how they were informing you that they were seeing these things previous

1413
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:41,820
to your mission, when you're doing this exercise and they let you know that they're seeing

1414
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:45,260
these things, did you say, hey, how frequent is this?

1415
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,100
Is this something that happens all the time?

1416
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,780
I didn't get into that.

1417
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:52,060
Ours was more of the moment of, you know, when he's telling us, hey, for the last two

1418
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:55,660
weeks we've been tracking these things and we don't know what they are.

1419
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:59,620
But you don't know whether or not it was just those two weeks or maybe it was a year ago,

1420
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,900
there was other similar situations or?

1421
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:05,860
There's other situations that have happened out there, but I would say, you know, for

1422
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:09,540
this, I don't even know, one, you got to take it serious.

1423
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:14,020
We have a tendency, if we don't know what it is, if we just ignore it, it'll go away.

1424
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:18,260
You know, and I joke, you know, there was an incident years, it's probably not too far

1425
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:22,580
off the same timeframe, but I think it was like the Constellation was doing her workups

1426
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:28,980
before she got decommissioned and an Oscar class, a Soviet Oscar class submarine surfaced

1427
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,060
behind her, right?

1428
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:36,620
And then now it's like, you know, go to battle stations, World War III, how did this foreign

1429
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:39,740
submarine get in our area and has been monitoring our workups?

1430
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:40,740
That's a big deal.

1431
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,740
Right.

1432
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:45,340
I said, but now we go out and we have these things that are coming at will and there's

1433
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,880
nothing we can do about it.

1434
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,480
We don't know what they are.

1435
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:54,620
We have confirmed sighting by two aircrew, four of us, two planes, that said, look, this

1436
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:59,860
is not an airplane, this is not a weather balloon, this is not a blip, it has performance

1437
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,700
well beyond, you know, and the airplanes that we were flying at the time were literally

1438
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:06,260
brand new Super Hornets right out of the Boeing factory.

1439
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:11,500
I mean, these were brand new, first Block II series that came out.

1440
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,780
And you go, why wasn't something done?

1441
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:17,060
You know, it's like, ah, we don't know what it is.

1442
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:20,580
I think it's good now, you know, the moves that have happened over the last, you know,

1443
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:26,300
article came out that, you know, now there's a new reporting for the pilots.

1444
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:29,420
The Navy's acknowledged, hey, these things, we don't know what they were.

1445
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:33,200
You know, they're starting to take it serious because, you know, I know there are other

1446
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,900
events that are not out, recent events where people have been called in to go, hey, I've

1447
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,340
seen this thing.

1448
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,820
So the investigation process is still going on.

1449
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:45,260
You know, we don't, we don't stop and the military doesn't stop.

1450
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,780
Even if you take funding away, we don't stop.

1451
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:50,400
You know, we don't stop until we're told to stop.

1452
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,840
So, you know, what's, what's going on?

1453
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,320
I, you know, you go, well, ATIP ended, you know, they spent four and a half million dollars

1454
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,320
a year on it.

1455
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,720
I think it was four, it was 22 million over the five years.

1456
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,720
So you go, what are they doing since then?

1457
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,160
Well, I mean, I'm pretty sure there's still people looking at this and there's still people

1458
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,920
that are taking this serious.

1459
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,340
I will tell you that I won't get into specifics, but there are people inside the United States

1460
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:14,500
government that are taking this serious.

1461
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:19,440
And I've been, I've been down to DC twice to talk to folks, you know, behind closed

1462
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,840
doors to go because they want to hear the story.

1463
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,800
And I've got a lot of you got to be joking.

1464
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,880
I mean, this this seriously happened.

1465
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,240
And I'm like, yeah, it did happen.

1466
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,520
And it is real.

1467
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,120
What are you doing about it?

1468
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,120
So what kind of people are you talking to?

1469
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,600
High level government officials is what I'll say.

1470
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,720
And most of that is because that conversation is between me and them.

1471
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:44,320
And I don't want people speculating, but you can say high level government officials

1472
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,000
I have talked to.

1473
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:51,040
Well, that was always the speculation about like, what would someone do if they became

1474
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:51,560
president?

1475
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:55,880
Well, the first thing I would do is I would tell everybody about the UFOs.

1476
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,160
I would ask immediately what's going on.

1477
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,280
And I always thought about it.

1478
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:04,200
I said, how many people actually know what's going on and how much of the information?

1479
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:09,800
I mean, it's not like if they're dealing with something like this, like your experience,

1480
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,800
it seems like what you described is what is known.

1481
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:22,440
So it's this anomalous event where this thing defies our current understanding of

1482
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,720
technology and then it's gone.

1483
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,720
And so what do you have?

1484
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,360
You don't have anything else other than that.

1485
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,280
Like, what other information does anybody have?

1486
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,960
Well, I would say I would say this because I've talked to Bob.

1487
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,440
We were we did a Bob Lazar.

1488
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,600
Yeah, we did an event together.

1489
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:43,120
And I'll leave it to everyone to if it's up to you to believe Bob, I'll say this.

1490
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,440
Bob's a normal guy.

1491
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:45,600
Bob's not crazy.

1492
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:46,800
He's not crazy at all.

1493
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,120
Not at all.

1494
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,120
That was the weirdest thing about talking to him.

1495
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:54,560
But when you when you look at it and go, because I had asked Bob, I said what he

1496
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,800
describes in the technology when he talks about his his story, I said, well, do you

1497
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,320
honestly think we could, you know, reverse engineer it?

1498
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,520
I said, how long do you think it would take us?

1499
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,960
And his response to me was another hundred years.

1500
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,880
He goes, Dave, it was so far beyond.

1501
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,000
He goes, the stuff that he says he worked on, he's like, you know, he was on your

1502
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,560
podcast because I watched it, you know, hey, there was no wires.

1503
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,160
And because I had asked him when he said you first described the ship that he got to

1504
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:24,680
see, he said, I used to say, you know, they built it and then it was like wax and

1505
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,240
you'd heat it up.

1506
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,400
He goes, now I would say it was built with 3D printing, because now with 3D

1507
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,520
printing, we can build things literally from the ground up.

1508
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,960
And it's basically built as one, not panels, no rivets.

1509
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,720
It's just made.

1510
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:39,680
And so when you talk about that and you go, well, it's still another hundred years.

1511
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,520
So you go, well, what if you had the technology?

1512
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:46,680
We still, if, if, if what Bob says is correct, we still don't understand it.

1513
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,560
And how fast would it take us to understand that?

1514
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,320
I mean, if it's, if it's driven by something that we don't even have on earth,

1515
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,800
which is when he talks about that element, we can't create it.

1516
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,600
You know, we can create it for a microsecond and then it, you know, it decays

1517
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,000
and we go, yeah.

1518
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:09,400
So, you know, I think we're, we're still a long ways off, you know, I'll argue

1519
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,240
with the people that go, you know, are we really alone?

1520
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:16,000
I was telling Jeremy, we used to go out on, on goggles, you know, out in the

1521
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,600
middle of Pacific, there's no light pollution, night vision goggles.

1522
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,120
So we can see, well, you go out at night and I'd be on like a tanker hopper,

1523
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:25,040
something just hanging out, not doing anything, driving around in circles

1524
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,200
with the autopilot on, you just turn all the lights down in the cockpit.

1525
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:30,080
So you have no night light pollution and you just roll your head back and look up.

1526
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:34,640
There's billions and billions and billions of stars out there.

1527
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,120
And, you know, I always look up cause I'm like, you know, are we alone?

1528
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,880
And I go, I look up and go, well, if we're the only ones around and that's, and I'm

1529
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:46,720
looking, everything I'm looking at, it's a, it's a pretty sad place.

1530
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,080
It's a pretty lonely universe.

1531
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,320
I asked my astrophysics prof that once I said, you believe in

1532
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,760
extraterrestrial life?

1533
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,320
And she's like, of course not.

1534
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,880
And I said, well, there's billions and billions of planets.

1535
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:56,600
You think we're it?

1536
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:03,080
I mean, just the probability of it is you'd go, oh, there's probably something else out

1537
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:03,760
there and I'm not crazy.

1538
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,040
I'm just opening up the possibility that we are not the only planet that has life on it.

1539
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,800
I think people don't like to seem silly.

1540
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,040
They don't like to be foolish.

1541
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,680
And I think when people start talking about anything, it's not proven or anything

1542
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:21,160
that's connected to a bunch of loony people that are making up stories, which UFOs

1543
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:25,480
certainly are, UFOs are connected to so many people that have made up so many

1544
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,160
stories.

1545
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,240
What was that gentleman's name from?

1546
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,960
You would know that guy who's from another country, Billy something or another.

1547
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:32,680
Billy Meyer.

1548
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,160
Billy Meyer seems a hundred percent full of shit.

1549
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:35,520
Yeah.

1550
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:35,720
Yeah.

1551
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:39,880
He's proven to have done tons of hoaxes with this, but here's the deal.

1552
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:43,520
Sometimes I think people have a real experience and they're always like chasing

1553
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,400
that dragon and they get UFO disease and the brain goes fucking berserk, right?

1554
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,520
I know that there are people that have had profound experiences and then they

1555
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,920
can't ever replicate them.

1556
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,720
So then they just start going crazy.

1557
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,960
And I don't blame them for it, but you got someone like Commander Fravor.

1558
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:04,160
When he saw that AAV anomalous aerospace vehicle, his reaction was I want to fly

1559
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:04,280
it.

1560
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,280
That's a pretty cool reaction.

1561
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,120
I'd like to fly it.

1562
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:07,360
Yeah.

1563
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,560
Imagine flying that thing.

1564
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,680
Well, that's what I told my buddy, he was my XO at the time, Dell.

1565
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:15,120
I'd got back after all this happening, he looks at me and we're just standing

1566
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,640
right here when he goes, Hey dude.

1567
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,920
I go in and he goes, what do you think it is?

1568
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,280
I go, I have no idea.

1569
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,400
But it was pretty fricking impressive and I'd like to fly it.

1570
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:23,600
Of course.

1571
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:28,000
And he goes, yeah, I go, I mean, it was, it was, you know, it's just like any

1572
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,400
pilot, you always want to fly the coolest thing.

1573
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:29,880
Of course.

1574
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,640
Yeah, of course.

1575
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:33,000
You race car driver, you want to drive the fastest car.

1576
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:33,560
That's it.

1577
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,000
And now you look at it and go, well, that's something we don't have.

1578
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:36,440
Yeah.

1579
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,080
This idea that, you know, maybe we're not alone, that some of these other

1580
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,640
stars have planets that are maybe technologically advanced.

1581
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,520
So the next thing people say, and you know, new eras are going to say, well,

1582
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,080
they're not coming here because the distance is so vast.

1583
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,480
Hold the fuck up.

1584
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:54,280
From the very beginning, when Babasar came forward and talked about field

1585
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,840
propulsion, gravity, propulsion, distance becomes completely irrelevant.

1586
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,520
So if we believe the, and the radars are right.

1587
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,880
And commander favor saw this thing moving like a ping pong ball in a

1588
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,400
glass of water, it's gravity propelled.

1589
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,400
That's why you can make those maneuvers without exploding.

1590
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:08,920
Okay.

1591
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,960
Then distance becomes completely irrelevant for travel.

1592
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,320
You're literally warping time and space.

1593
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,960
You're falling into place.

1594
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,840
Well, it's like the idea of showing someone a video on your phone long

1595
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,400
before video was ever invented.

1596
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,840
People would be like, what are you talking about?

1597
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,560
Like before photography was invented, which is shockingly recent, right?

1598
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,720
You ought to draw pictures of things you saw, just like those people that drew

1599
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:38,080
or painted that those images of those men and whatever those things were with

1600
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:43,800
Christ in the background, the idea that we could understand what some insanely

1601
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:50,080
impressive technology from a planet that is nowhere near us could, could manifest.

1602
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,040
That's it's nuts.

1603
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:51,360
Yeah.

1604
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,320
But Babasar talks a lot about this.

1605
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,880
Remember he's a young guy, right?

1606
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:59,600
In 1989, he gets shown something and all of a sudden he's trying to

1607
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,760
interpret it through 1989 technology.

1608
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,120
So he said, it looks like it was injection molded because that's what he had.

1609
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,920
And then I sent him this thing about nanotechnology and, you know, working

1610
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,760
towards an atomic printer, he's like, dude, that makes a lot more sense.

1611
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,800
So he has to view it through where he saw it in 1989.

1612
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,960
However, I will say this.

1613
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,680
It is my knowledge that we understand exactly how these craft work.

1614
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,160
Our one limiting factor is our material science.

1615
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,360
We can't replicate, not the fuel source itself is another.

1616
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,320
When you say we know exactly how they work.

1617
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,480
Yeah, it doesn't break our laws of physics.

1618
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:36,600
This concept of amplification of gravity, this concept of gravity propulsion.

1619
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,680
We understand how things can move from point A to point B almost instantaneously.

1620
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:47,640
Our physics doesn't disallow it, but our material science and the fuel to create

1621
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:51,360
that machine that we, we have machines from other places.

1622
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:58,400
So we have, well, Bob Lazar, whether you believe him or not, um, there was a program.

1623
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,640
I have other witnesses that I will be bringing forward about S four where he

1624
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:06,920
worked, we have crap other witnesses that worked with a long side, people that

1625
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:13,760
corroborate Bob's account in that they saw him get on and off the red and whites,

1626
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,080
the Janet flights that come on somebody that went to Papoose Lake and was stopped

1627
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:23,640
by, by, uh, non-military guards at that time, people that were aware of site four

1628
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:27,000
and ET exploitation projects.

1629
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,640
Uh, one is an SR 71 pilot that I've been talking with for a couple of years.

1630
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:34,880
So these people are coming forward now with, and it's like, I'm sick and tired

1631
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:35,240
of doing it.

1632
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,360
These little nitpicky things about Bob.

1633
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:37,720
Okay.

1634
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,880
Th there was a program, there, there was a back engineering program.

1635
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,960
They've admitted there are materials.

1636
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,600
So this is like the meta materials you heard about in the New York Times.

1637
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:51,240
All that we have materials associated with UFOs that are interesting.

1638
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,360
What is that?

1639
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,080
What are you talking about?

1640
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,120
So, uh, this was something that was launched in the first New York Times

1641
01:26:56,120 --> 01:27:00,040
article, I believe in December of 2017, that there is studies being done right

1642
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:03,640
now on materials associated with UFOs, right?

1643
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,400
So actual metals that have come off of, you could say crashes or

1644
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:12,200
who is that that explained that there was something that they were with Eric Weinstein

1645
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:17,600
that was explaining that there was someone who reportedly has something along those

1646
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,360
lines has 17 samples, 17 samples.

1647
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,680
How does one guy get 17?

1648
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,720
Well, he's Jacques fucking ballet, right?

1649
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,920
So he is the guy first ever for the United States military created a

1650
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:31,640
computer program for, you know, for the study of UFOs for project blue books.

1651
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,600
He's an old school guy.

1652
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:36,600
They modeled him after in the close encounters movie, it's modeled after

1653
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,600
Jacques Valle, the French guy.

1654
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,880
So he's kind of like been involved with this.

1655
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,520
He's had more access to government databases than any of us.

1656
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:49,040
He went around collected samples from known, you know, crashes or like

1657
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,120
when things will come off and what's the conclusion?

1658
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,480
Well, they're studying them right now.

1659
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,600
There was just something on Fox about their studying some of these

1660
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,000
materials and what they will find.

1661
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,800
Because I actually, the ones they're talking about, I actually took to New

1662
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:04,040
Mexico and had five scientists study it, um, about five years ago.

1663
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,080
I got my hands on it, got to study it.

1664
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:10,560
The, the famous parts they're talking about now it's layered and the way it's

1665
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,920
layered is what they're trying to see if it's anomalous elementally or the way

1666
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:19,080
that they're, the elements are bound together and also the, the atomic level

1667
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,360
of, of layering is what's interesting.

1668
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,160
We'll find out if we'll explain what you're talking about.

1669
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,520
What is this thing that you saw?

1670
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:26,320
Okay.

1671
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,640
Well, there is, there are a lot of different samples, but when you get a

1672
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:34,120
sample of something and you can see these samples, uh, the ones that, that I

1673
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:39,720
looked at, um, they ranged from about this size down, uh, you know, they

1674
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,520
range from the size of an orange.

1675
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:42,120
Yeah.

1676
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,320
Size of an orange to the size of a quarter.

1677
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,760
These are materials, right?

1678
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,400
Are they materials from a crash?

1679
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,360
So that's allegedly, or there's a known crash.

1680
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:53,720
This is in the public domain rather than, you know, government control.

1681
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,760
So what we were, what I was looking at or having the scientists look at is

1682
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:02,160
isotopically and elementally, what are the elements that are in this?

1683
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,360
Are they engineered?

1684
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,480
And what's the conclusion?

1685
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:08,200
Well, I, I'm not, uh, I'm going to leave it to the people that are doing it now

1686
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,640
who have much better machines than I had.

1687
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,320
Do you know any cliff notes?

1688
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:17,240
Yeah, they, from what I understand, there's, um, atomic layering.

1689
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,440
There, there are levels of like we do with graphene.

1690
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:23,920
We lay down these layers that are, uh, basically oriented at a certain degree.

1691
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,160
That's how you get a superconductor or something like that.

1692
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:30,240
If you take a piece of graphene and you, and it's highly machined.

1693
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,120
So it's not, doesn't deviate from that atomic layering.

1694
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,280
You can push it right through ice, like a hot knife through butter.

1695
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,760
It's the weirdest feeling in the world.

1696
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,440
Cause you just take this piece of what feels like graphene and it

1697
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,000
goes right through butter because it's a superconductor and the

1698
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,280
heat from your hand melts the ice.

1699
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,760
So that, that is a meta material.

1700
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,040
It doesn't occur naturally.

1701
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:51,400
Humans created it and it has special properties because of

1702
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,680
the way it's atomically layered.

1703
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:58,320
So if these materials are from somewhere else, then we suspect that they're

1704
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,920
going to be highly machined, that they're going to be created for special use.

1705
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,720
So my whole point is our material science has not caught up with the

1706
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,640
physics that we understand for these field propulsion systems.

1707
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:12,320
I'm just telling you, believe me or not, but you'll hear more about it.

1708
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:19,160
That, that our material science in 1989 and today is our limiting factor.

1709
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:24,200
And as our material science gets better as humans, we know how these things work.

1710
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:29,200
Now the fuel source, that's a whole nother conversation, but as far

1711
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:32,360
as creating these machines, um, that's what we're trying to do.

1712
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,480
That's why there is secrecy.

1713
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,720
We're trying to exploit the technology because whoever exploits it first wins.

1714
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:38,720
It's a game changer.

1715
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,920
We don't want Russia to do it.

1716
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,360
We don't want China to do it.

1717
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,280
If we had a non reactionary propulsion system, the world

1718
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,800
would look different instantaneously.

1719
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:53,880
What, what is your perspective after the incident versus before the incident?

1720
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:58,040
Like how much did it change the way you view the world and our place in the world?

1721
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,040
For me?

1722
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,840
Um, I, I mean, I always, I never believed that we were alone.

1723
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:03,480
It's just me.

1724
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,800
I just look up and go, there's way too many stars up there for us to be on

1725
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:12,000
play, um, after it, you know, it makes it a little more clear to go, you know,

1726
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,560
one, my questions are where'd it come from?

1727
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:17,760
That's, that's the biggest one of where'd it come from?

1728
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,240
What was it doing?

1729
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,160
Um, you know, and then I've asked why me?

1730
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,320
I mean, why, why did I happen to be?

1731
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,680
Cause you can say wrong place, wrong time.

1732
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,880
Right on right place, right place, right time.

1733
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:35,520
Um, for me, it was, I think there's more out there.

1734
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:39,560
And if, if I could get word out to anyone, it's like, you know, especially

1735
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:43,160
the, the debunkers of one quit trying to debunk it because it is what it is.

1736
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,120
It wasn't a, there wasn't a system glitch.

1737
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,160
This is, I mean, this was a real incident that happened.

1738
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,960
And number two is let's open our aperture a little bit and start

1739
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,160
thinking outside of the box.

1740
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,760
You know, if you go, you know, you look at it and go, Hey, it's

1741
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,200
this non-reactive propulsion.

1742
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:00,160
Well, it's because when we came up with propulsion, we, we, you know, the

1743
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:03,560
people long before us came up with a reactionary propulsion system, and

1744
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:07,920
that became our standard had we done something different or we developed

1745
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:11,800
non-reaction, we might look at something like a gasoline engine, go holy cow.

1746
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,640
How's that thing work?

1747
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,280
We wouldn't have that idea.

1748
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:19,600
So, you know, I think there's, you know, if you look at it and go, people

1749
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,480
thought Einstein was kind of nuts and we're still proving his theories today.

1750
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,480
And what we're learning is that he was right.

1751
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:26,640
And he was right.

1752
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,200
There was a time when the earth was flat, except for some people in

1753
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,240
California, the earth isn't flat, it's round.

1754
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,280
It's not just people in California.

1755
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:33,840
They're all over the place.

1756
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,800
There's not an ice wall.

1757
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:40,320
Um, so, so when you look at that and you go, you know, a lot of the stuff that

1758
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,920
we thought was true, isn't true.

1759
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,440
It's totally been changed.

1760
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:49,880
So for me, I just say, I think let's get outside of the box and go, if we can

1761
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:52,760
develop a technology that would, and I don't look at it from a military

1762
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,840
standpoint, because it would be a game changer from a military standpoint.

1763
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:01,080
Technology like that would be a game changer for mankind completely.

1764
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:05,320
I mean, it would literally, uh, everything that we do, you know, and

1765
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:07,680
we don't know exactly, you know, you, you could, you know, do you want

1766
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,480
that system in a car, you know?

1767
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,280
People have trouble driving in two dimensions, let alone three.

1768
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:12,720
Right.

1769
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,360
You know, they, you know, it's kind of like your joke last night.

1770
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,480
I mean, I mean, you can't even handle the vaping thing, let alone

1771
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,880
driving a car that goes up, down, works in three dimensions.

1772
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,800
Well, that was what they originally wanted helicopters to be.

1773
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,600
They wanted to be flying cars.

1774
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:27,000
Yeah.

1775
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,040
You get out on the road, you see how people drive.

1776
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,480
And I always laugh because people think, well, we're three dimensional.

1777
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,640
Like we know that this table is not the floor, but really humans are two

1778
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:38,920
dimensional people and you learn that, especially when we would fight.

1779
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:43,080
Um, if you can really work in the third dimension, which is up and you go,

1780
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,760
well, we are three dimensional.

1781
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,760
I go, nah, if you look at like a tall building is, you know,

1782
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:48,520
1700 feet high, the big ones.

1783
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:53,200
And you go, no, you know, for an F18 to do a split S which is go from up here

1784
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,640
and just do a vertical 180 degree turn.

1785
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,200
So you're going this way and you go down here.

1786
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:01,480
Um, it's, it's like 2,500 feet and that's tight.

1787
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,160
That's a tight turn for a jet, you know, unless you're running like

1788
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,640
vectored thrust stuff, but there's everything has a cost.

1789
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:09,400
So you do some big Hayaka, you bleed off energy.

1790
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,480
There's a cost associated with that.

1791
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:14,480
That to a pilot, that's three dimensions to most people on earth.

1792
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:18,280
You go, no, I'm, you know, I look at a hill and I don't want to walk up that thing.

1793
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:18,880
Right.

1794
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,720
You know, and in an airplane, it's a, it's a totally different thing.

1795
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,880
So just, if we just open up that expanse, you know, for what we're trying to do

1796
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:29,240
for technology and go, is there another way, because we still build, we still

1797
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:33,160
build suckers and blowers, which is a jet engine, we just refine the internals,

1798
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,360
the turbines to get them to be more efficient.

1799
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,960
Where I go, why don't you just put your efforts someplace else?

1800
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:43,600
Like I was talking to, um, there's a whole realm of physics that really

1801
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:47,000
doesn't get explained and it's, uh, I was talking to Steve Justice about it.

1802
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
It's more into the magnetics type side.

1803
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:54,080
Um, that we don't, we don't spend a lot of time on it.

1804
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:57,440
I know when he said when he was working at skunk works, he did, it's

1805
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:01,040
sort of called, I read internal research and development money that he would

1806
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,800
fun to try and look at some of these other technologies for propulsion.

1807
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:09,320
And, uh, you know, he's, he's now since retired, but, uh, really impressive

1808
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,880
to talk to him at the level that you can, which is, you know, for us

1809
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,000
would be an unclassified level.

1810
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Um, but you know, the stuff that goes on behind closed doors, there's reasons

1811
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,360
for it, you know, because if a technology like that got out where someone could

1812
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:26,480
rapidly reproduce it after all you've done, you know, or they got it first.

1813
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,360
You think of the atomic bomb, you know, Germans almost had it.

1814
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,040
We got it.

1815
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:31,040
Russians were working on it.

1816
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:36,400
We got it first, changed the world, literally changed the world when we

1817
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,480
detonated the first one and you go, I'm not going to get into the politics

1818
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:43,600
behind it, but now we had it and now it was the race, everyone else, because

1819
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,160
they had to get on equal par, because it's a destabilizing thing.

1820
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:49,520
And obviously, if you develop a technology like this and you keep it to

1821
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,880
yourself, you've got something that no one else has and it's a huge leap.

1822
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,360
I mean, it's a quantum leap.

1823
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,120
Do you, do you share it?

1824
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:04,040
Because it's a, it's a mankind thing or do you keep it for yourself?

1825
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,680
You know, and that's right now, it's not for me to decide.

1826
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,400
I'm just Dave.

1827
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:14,080
Well, it's fascinating that some other method of propulsion could have been

1828
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:19,040
established in some other place and that we're experiencing or that you've

1829
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:22,640
experienced it and some other folks have experienced it in action.

1830
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:31,960
And I just think for us as people, as human beings in 2019, it's really easy

1831
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:37,760
to think that what we have now is so amazing and that what we have now is

1832
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:42,040
the pinnacle of discovery and then what we have now is, you know, with our

1833
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:47,600
electricity and with our LED screens and that we are experiencing like the

1834
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:53,880
height of technology when if you're some creature from some other planet that

1835
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:58,960
has got easy access to element one 15 and some gravity propulsion system,

1836
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:02,360
you're looking at us like we're digging holes in the side of a mountain to

1837
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:03,720
protect ourselves from the rain.

1838
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:04,840
We're cave people.

1839
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:05,760
Yes.

1840
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:06,520
Yeah.

1841
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,880
Well, we do that here on earth.

1842
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:08,240
Yeah.

1843
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:11,040
I mean, you look at like a first world, you know, like a United States or,

1844
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,960
you know, these, the kind of developed nations and then you go to some of these

1845
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,760
other and go, you know, people are still getting their water out of a hole in

1846
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:17,560
the ground with a bucket.

1847
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:18,120
Right.

1848
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:22,080
Or people in the rainforests are living these indigenous lifestyles.

1849
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:22,480
Yeah.

1850
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,920
So, you know, take them some, I mean, take them to one of these flat screens down

1851
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,280
to one of these tribes that no one's ever seen and go, Hey, look, and start

1852
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:33,040
showing them pictures of themselves that you're shooting real time or video

1853
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,280
that's feeding directly into it.

1854
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,280
They'll freak out.

1855
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,040
They'll think it's magic.

1856
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,120
Would you capture my soul?

1857
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:37,640
Right.

1858
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:42,080
Um, so it's, it's where are we at and what are we going to do and what can we do?

1859
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,200
Did it change the way you look at life?

1860
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:48,880
I mean, even though you knew that, or you had this feeling that we were not alone

1861
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,960
just from looking at the stars and, but when you actually see the thing, like

1862
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:58,520
how, I mean, I would imagine that that has got to really shift your perspective.

1863
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:03,960
I don't know if it shifted my perspective, but it was more of a, it's a validation.

1864
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:05,000
A confirmation.

1865
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,840
To go, you go, yeah, you know, I've always like, yeah, there's a lot of stars.

1866
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,120
And then you see something like this and go, well, maybe we're not.

1867
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:16,120
Cause that, that pushes you to the next point to go, you know, you know, one

1868
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:20,000
lands in my front yard, then I'll be 100% sure that we are not alone.

1869
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,080
Cause it's sitting in my front yard.

1870
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:23,720
But I mean, I got within a half mile of this thing.

1871
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,360
Um, which is people go a half mile is pretty far away again.

1872
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,400
Not when you're flying an airplane.

1873
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,800
Half mile is like really tight.

1874
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,280
When they bring you in to have these conversations with high

1875
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:35,440
level government officials, how long are these conversations?

1876
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:41,400
So I went to the, I've been down, I've talked to three different groups of people.

1877
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,760
This is post the New York times article.

1878
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,440
So the New York time article comes out in 2017.

1879
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,200
And then our, our government,

1880
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:55,360
the other pilot that was involved had been to DC multiple times.

1881
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,240
This is how kind of I got in touch with Lou.

1882
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,680
She had called me and said, Hey, I need to talk to you.

1883
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,920
So I called her and I said, what's going on?

1884
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,600
She says, Hey, have you been, has anyone called you about the Tic Tac?

1885
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,120
And I said, no.

1886
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:10,800
She goes, you know, I've been to the Pentagon like a half dozen times and

1887
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,560
they'll take me in and anywhere from Starbucks to, you know, inside of a vault.

1888
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,720
And she goes, and they'll talk to me about the story.

1889
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:17,560
And then they'll show me a picture.

1890
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,720
Something goes to look like this.

1891
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:21,200
And then she gets pretty frustrated and goes, we call it the Tic Tac.

1892
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,200
Cause it looked like a Tic Tac.

1893
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,160
What part don't you get?

1894
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,080
I mean, go get a thing of Tic Tacs and look at it.

1895
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,360
When they're saying, did it look like this?

1896
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:29,960
They showing actual crafts that they have?

1897
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,920
No, not pictures that they have, but like a video from someone else.

1898
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:34,160
Like they'd show the gimbal video.

1899
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:35,160
Hey, it looked like this.

1900
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:35,440
Okay.

1901
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,000
And, and it was no.

1902
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,080
So, and that's when I told her, I said, well, just, just tell this guy that

1903
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,600
you're talking to, just give him my name and number.

1904
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:43,600
I go, I'll talk to him.

1905
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:44,560
It's not a big deal to me.

1906
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,040
You know, and that started.

1907
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:51,000
So when we, I got asked, you know, multiple times to go down and talk to, to people.

1908
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,720
One of them was supposed to be 20 minutes.

1909
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:55,280
And these, you know, these are important people getting 20 minutes of some of

1910
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,880
these folks time is like, that's a huge deal.

1911
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,920
So we went in thinking, okay, we're going to do the thing in 20 minutes.

1912
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,720
And then we're in, in an hour and a half later, we came out.

1913
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:09,520
I mean, that's the interest of, you know, and there were some, you know, you get

1914
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:13,480
the group, you know, the folks that come in and out, but there's a few that just

1915
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:16,920
sat there and were enamored by what we were saying, like you're joking.

1916
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,680
We're like, no, this is, this is all real.

1917
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:24,600
I mean, these are, these are three senior officials that are taking the time out

1918
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:28,280
of their day to take this serious, to go, you know, maybe we do need to put

1919
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,200
a little emphasis on this.

1920
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:34,080
I mean, if, if literally, if something can just show up at will and do whatever

1921
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,840
it wants, and I'd probably at least pay attention.

1922
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:37,280
Yeah.

1923
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,680
Pay attention, but what could be done?

1924
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:42,520
I mean, what could they do if you put yourself in a position of one of these

1925
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:45,800
high level government officials, what do you do just spend more money on looking

1926
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:46,160
at them?

1927
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,600
Well, if you look at money though, I mean, I know when the article came out and

1928
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:52,240
they talked about the ATIP program that Harry Reid got funded $22 million over

1929
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,800
five years, so it's $4.4 million a year.

1930
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:56,440
And you go, everyone's freaking out.

1931
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,280
Oh, it's $22 million.

1932
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,880
I said, no, it wasn't $22 million a year.

1933
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,080
It was $4.4 million.

1934
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,120
That's not even in the rounding air for the United States.

1935
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,520
We just got approved.

1936
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:09,920
What it was $750 billion for a defense budget, $750 billion.

1937
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:14,040
If you took a hundred million out of that, it's not even going to put a dent.

1938
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,040
And I go, why can't you, you know, if you're, if you're only spending four,

1939
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,040
$4.4 million a year and you can actually get some good work done, cause you don't

1940
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:24,360
need a huge team because you figure if you look at, I think, I think what's the

1941
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:27,720
number like 10, 15% of all these UFOs.

1942
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:31,680
Like if you look at project blue book really remained unexplained and you go,

1943
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:34,720
okay, so you can weed out, you know, you can read out me flying over someone

1944
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,360
in a campfire and lighten my afterburners.

1945
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,760
So you can go, no, that was Dave being Dave.

1946
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,040
Um, so you can weed that stuff out.

1947
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:44,280
Now you go, now I'm really kind of concentrating the funds.

1948
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:45,480
The most important thing.

1949
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:48,160
And I talked to the folks when we were talking, cause we talked about funding

1950
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,680
and I said, let me leave you with this.

1951
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,640
Um, and I had got some pretty good stuff.

1952
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:55,160
I was talking to Chris Mellon, who's a former undersecretary and

1953
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,440
understands how the government works.

1954
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,880
So it was where he gave me some really good feedback.

1955
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:59,400
And I said, I talked to him.

1956
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,800
I said, look, I'm all for you guys funding a program, but what you

1957
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,520
need to do is fund a program that there's going to be oversight over.

1958
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,920
And when I say oversight, I mean, because what happens is you go, here's money,

1959
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,280
but we're going to distribute in the government.

1960
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:12,680
So we're going to distribute it to these three different agencies

1961
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:13,960
across the United States government.

1962
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,400
You know, I don't just call them agency, A, B and C.

1963
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:21,040
So you give it to them, you know, and I'll go back to like the 9 11

1964
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:24,360
stuff where we really had the answer, but all the agencies weren't talking

1965
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:26,000
to each other to put all the pieces together.

1966
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,520
And that's my fear that you go, Hey, we're going to take a hundred

1967
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,760
million dollars of taxpayer money.

1968
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:32,400
We're going to fund a program to actually seriously investigate this

1969
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,760
stuff and look at the technology.

1970
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,200
But there are three different entities working on their own

1971
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:37,200
and not talking to each other.

1972
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:39,080
So there's gotta be a joint collaboration.

1973
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,280
So we go, we're going to do it.

1974
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:46,280
But you know, Joe's going to be in charge and you guys are all going

1975
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:49,040
to play nice in the sandbox together because we want to get our money's

1976
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:53,640
worth because people will raise the fraud, waste and abuse flag that we're

1977
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,000
wasting money on something stupid.

1978
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:59,600
Now the gimbal video shows a different kind of thing.

1979
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:00,200
Yes.

1980
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:03,320
How many different kinds of things are you aware of?

1981
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:06,480
Well, those are ours too.

1982
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,360
If you, if you look at the go fast, it kind of looks like a tick tack.

1983
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,480
Um, so you could say those two are the same.

1984
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:16,640
And I, I think there's other stuff out there, um, you know, and sometimes

1985
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:20,840
it's not that the, you gotta look at where, where do you obtain the video?

1986
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:23,480
It's just like intelligence, you know, and I'll use, cause I know you got

1987
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:24,800
that picture of Pablo out there.

1988
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,720
You know, and there was the guy, Tom Cruise made the movie about him.

1989
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,680
Uh, what's his name?

1990
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:31,360
Louisiana dude who was flying the drugs for Pablo in and out.

1991
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,720
Barry Seale, Barry Seale.

1992
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:37,320
You know, Hey, it was all great until Reagan posted that picture that they

1993
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,240
had the cameras inside the cargo plane.

1994
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,720
And then Pablo puts the guy, the only place that picture came

1995
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,920
from is Barry Seale's airplane.

1996
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,480
You know, and then now Barry Seale's a dead man.

1997
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,800
So you gotta watch when you release, cause you go, Hey, we got this

1998
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,600
video, but it was taken someplace.

1999
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:53,800
We probably weren't supposed to be, or how did they get that video?

2000
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:54,240
Right.

2001
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:58,280
Like I'll look, the video of our, the Tic Tac video, that thing

2002
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:00,400
first came out, it's kind of funny.

2003
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:04,600
Um, the guy that was in my back seat had sent me an email and this is about

2004
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:08,080
probably 2008, so I was retired.

2005
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,320
Um, and he sent me this video.

2006
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:11,640
You guys say skippers that look familiar?

2007
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
And it was on strangeland.com and not suitable for work.

2008
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:18,400
I'll just say that, but I look, and then next thing you know, it's on YouTube.

2009
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:22,040
So when I would tell this story to my friends, I would go, I'd send them

2010
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,120
a link to the YouTube video.

2011
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,120
And this is years before the New York Times article.

2012
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:28,760
And then when they did the unofficial official report, the video

2013
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,360
was taken down off of YouTube.

2014
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,320
And, you know, it kind of puzzled me like, why'd you take the video down?

2015
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:35,520
And I told the guys when they did the unofficial official report, I said,

2016
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,160
well, you really need to look at how did this thing come off of a classified

2017
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:42,200
drive system on an aircraft carrier and end up on strangeland.com and YouTube.

2018
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:46,080
Because at the time the videos were classified secret and that's

2019
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,560
not because it was a UFO.

2020
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:49,640
It's the AT FLIR video.

2021
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:50,680
They did not want that release.

2022
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:51,560
So you'd see it on CNN.

2023
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:54,040
And they blocked out all the performance stuff, what the airplane was actually

2024
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:57,080
doing in this case, you know, the one you see it's 250 knots of the autopilot on.

2025
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,560
So it's not that big of a deal, but, you know.

2026
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:04,920
Jeremy, how many different types of vehicles are you aware of that

2027
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:05,720
have been reported?

2028
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:11,080
Credible reports for decades, hundreds of different shapes.

2029
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:14,960
Even Lazar himself said he saw, you know, nine different styles all

2030
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,400
working off the same propulsion system.

2031
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:21,240
The tic-tac shape, you know, vehicle that goes back in history.

2032
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:25,320
Some people say cigar shaped, you know, big ships, small ships.

2033
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,880
We, you know, they're all different kinds.

2034
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,920
I think it's important to state though, there are other funded government

2035
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:32,080
funded UFO programs.

2036
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:37,040
It's a misnomer actually that a tip was the recipient of the $22 million.

2037
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:40,080
It was actually Harry Reid created a program called OSAP.

2038
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:44,560
OSAP was the sole beneficiary of that 22 million New York Times got it wrong.

2039
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,400
And then what happened is a tip was a different funded program to study

2040
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,840
military encounters with UFOs.

2041
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:57,040
OSAP was created because of skinwalker ranch, a government program to study

2042
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:02,200
UFOs and associated phenomenon, a tip and also communicated and shared

2043
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,720
information, but they were independently funded.

2044
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:10,360
So the $22 million was for all SAP and then a tip had its own sources.

2045
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,360
And then they did collaborate to UFO programs.

2046
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:16,000
There are more that I think we're going to learn about.

2047
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:22,800
So the different shapes that Bob Lazar saw, um, there was nine different

2048
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,560
shapes that he saw only one up close.

2049
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:26,720
Yeah.

2050
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:30,280
And none of them were like the Tic Tac.

2051
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:31,800
Uh, not specifically.

2052
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:33,200
However, that's not an uncommon.

2053
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,640
If you go back in history of like military sightings of craft going maybe

2054
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:40,760
over 20,000 miles an hour, the Tic Tac is a shape they have triangles.

2055
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,280
They have ones that look like rectangles.

2056
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:46,960
The thing that is common with all of them is the non-reactionary propulsion system.

2057
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,600
I think even commander Fravor said the thing noticed him was words he first said

2058
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:55,640
to me and, and kind of went towards him with its nose, but it could move in

2059
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:56,600
any direction, right?

2060
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,760
I mean, it could just move at will.

2061
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,680
However, when we first saw it, it was just basically, it never turned.

2062
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:01,560
It was just going left, right.

2063
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:03,880
You know, kind of doing this shape probably doesn't matter.

2064
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,560
And then it became aware because it turned and it actually mirrored what I was

2065
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:11,040
doing when I was coming down, it came up and, you know, so it was obviously new.

2066
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,480
We were there and I don't know if it was picking up, you know, energy

2067
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:16,640
coming off the airplane or what, you know, I do know that when they tried to

2068
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:20,880
lock it, it actively, you know, it jammed a radar, made it pretty much useless.

2069
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,720
And, you know, Chad was pretty good about kicking it over and grabbing that video.

2070
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:28,920
So it's pretty wild.

2071
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:30,120
It's a big deal.

2072
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:32,080
They actively jam a radar of ours, you know?

2073
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:33,400
Yeah.

2074
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:39,840
It's, um, you know, whenever someone tells you an awesome story, it's great to hear,

2075
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,320
but God, I wish I saw it myself.

2076
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:46,640
You know, it's like this thing that's like, you're like, you're telling me.

2077
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,680
And I'm like, wow, I'm listening.

2078
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,000
I'm trying to imagine.

2079
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I'm putting it in my head.

2080
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,560
I'm, I'm, I'm visualizing it, but damn, I wish I could see it.

2081
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:55,040
Yeah.

2082
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:59,320
I said this to a guy where he's, he's pretty, I don't say who it was or what

2083
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:01,640
his position was, he's pretty prominent in the UFO community.

2084
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:02,840
I'm not really a UFO guy.

2085
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:06,520
And he starts quoting like Jeremy Kenny quote events.

2086
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:08,760
So this was this, this event, that event, that event.

2087
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:09,520
He keeps looking at me.

2088
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,680
He goes, well, do you know about this event?

2089
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:11,680
I go, Nope.

2090
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:13,080
And he goes, what about this event?

2091
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:14,320
I go, Nope.

2092
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,000
He gets like three of them.

2093
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,240
And I look at him and he goes, well, you're not a UFO guy.

2094
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:21,400
I go, no, but I chased one.

2095
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:21,800
Have you?

2096
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,160
And he goes, no, I go, I'm an expert.

2097
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,240
You're an actual.

2098
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:31,040
He kind of got deflated a little bit because he looked at me like you suck.

2099
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:35,200
Well, it's like people that are into baseball stats, but they've never played.

2100
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:35,880
Yeah.

2101
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:36,160
Yeah.

2102
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:38,120
You know, you gotta get, you gotta get your hands dirty.

2103
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:38,960
Yeah.

2104
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,920
I'm with you, Joe.

2105
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:40,960
Like I wish I had seen it.

2106
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:43,800
I've been so curious about the propulsion system since Lazar.

2107
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,560
And I wish I could see something too.

2108
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:46,280
Oh my God.

2109
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:46,640
Yeah.

2110
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,560
I would give so much.

2111
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:52,600
I'd almost think about running for president just to win, just so I could

2112
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,960
get in and find out about UFOs and then go, I quit bitch.

2113
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:57,680
Everybody tried though, man.

2114
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,200
Clinton tried.

2115
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:00,880
He tried to get big time.

2116
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,240
That was his, he came in.

2117
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:05,760
He said, first thing he, Webster Hubble, he said, I want to know two things.

2118
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:08,720
Who killed JFK and I want to know all about UFOs.

2119
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,440
And they, he was denied access.

2120
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:13,840
And he later said, it's not the first time I've been lied to or denied

2121
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,480
information after asking for it.

2122
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:18,760
Bill Clinton said that additionally, Jimmy Carter, he said before he

2123
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:20,320
was president, I'm going to find out.

2124
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:22,160
Well, Jimmy Carter supposedly saw you.

2125
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:22,560
He did.

2126
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,600
And he said, I'm going to find out.

2127
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:27,600
I'm going to tell you never talked about it again afterwards after he became

2128
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:31,240
president, wonder what his briefing looked like, you know, and then so many

2129
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:34,120
presidents have tried because they're like us, man, they're curious.

2130
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:37,800
However, this information from my understanding, which is an informed

2131
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,560
understanding is so compartmentalized.

2132
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:41,000
Yeah.

2133
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:42,960
That makes sense.

2134
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,800
Well, listen, um, is there anything else?

2135
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:49,200
Just one thing I want to make sure to brief you on storm because I still

2136
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,480
blame you for it a little bit tonight.

2137
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:51,000
Can I do that?

2138
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:51,880
It's not my idea.

2139
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:52,840
No, not my idea.

2140
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,480
Can I just give you a quick, quick break now?

2141
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:54,640
Okay.

2142
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:55,320
So check this out.

2143
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:58,200
I made a movie, Bob Lazar, Air 51 and Flying Saucers.

2144
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,520
Joe blows it up.

2145
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,960
I go on a show with Bob Lazar, which was awesome.

2146
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,960
Thanks for letting Bob tell everybody what happened.

2147
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:04,440
Pleasure.

2148
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:10,560
And then the world lit on fire from a sociological, uh, pop culture

2149
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:14,000
standpoint, what happened on that day is huge and I don't want it to be missed

2150
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,560
on anybody, so a kid watches your podcast, watches the movie, puts up this

2151
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:20,280
Facebook page storm air 51.

2152
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,040
Oh my God.

2153
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,280
That's a big problem, right?

2154
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:26,240
So ended up talking to the kid and all this and helping trying to help him

2155
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:30,360
navigate kid went left, he should have gone straight anyway, vent went down.

2156
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:35,360
Rachel, Nevada, where area 51 is where the access points go up.

2157
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:37,080
We all went out there, right?

2158
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:40,480
Um, but really Rachel, nobody wanted people to come.

2159
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:44,400
It's a town of 52 people, one business, the residents.

2160
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,560
I live in pioneer town California is tiny.

2161
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:50,280
You don't want your whole town taken over by potentially dangerous

2162
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:52,920
millions of people that are signing up for this on Facebook.

2163
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:53,160
Right?

2164
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:56,640
So it's this huge phenomenon that happened because of going on.

2165
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:57,280
What happened?

2166
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:01,200
So here's what actually happened because the media has completely lied to you.

2167
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,640
They said 150 people show that.

2168
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:02,800
Yeah.

2169
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:05,240
It's a total fabrication out of the footage to prove it.

2170
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:11,720
We had an event in we, I participated in an event in HICO, Nevada, which is safely

2171
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:16,120
50 miles away from, you know, Rachel, where they didn't want us and on the

2172
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:23,800
fly 3000 plus it's me, it's a huge win 3000 plus people, even though they

2173
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:26,920
were scared to come because they were told to be scared to come out there.

2174
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:27,880
That it's going to be a riot.

2175
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:28,240
Okay.

2176
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:31,960
And they peacefully assembled and enjoyed this thing.

2177
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:32,720
I had, um,

2178
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,360
but what, what happened?

2179
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:35,280
There's nothing.

2180
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,040
They just got together 3000 people.

2181
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:37,520
Yeah.

2182
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,840
But everybody came with the idea that they're curious about this.

2183
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:42,760
It engaged a whole new audience of people.

2184
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,720
We had Dave Foley talked.

2185
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:47,920
We had Paul Oakenfold some famous people talked.

2186
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:49,200
Do you have a microphone set up?

2187
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,000
Yeah, we had, um, I set it up.

2188
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,680
I brought in speakers, right?

2189
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:53,560
I brought in speakers.

2190
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:54,640
Did you avoid this?

2191
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:56,880
Yeah, I'm not, you know,

2192
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:57,760
I'm a military guy.

2193
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,080
I'm not storming a government.

2194
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:00,440
That's about the stupidest thing.

2195
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:02,280
Let's go.

2196
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:04,400
That's like, let's all jump the white house fence.

2197
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:05,360
I'm like, are you wacky?

2198
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,320
That's the dumbest idea on the planet.

2199
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:07,480
Yeah.

2200
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:10,640
I didn't understand the benefit of getting all those people together.

2201
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,040
No, no people were going.

2202
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:16,400
And so my point was, well, let's at least bring people who can talk about it and

2203
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:19,320
have a civilized fun time and see what people want to do.

2204
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:21,240
So my point is it's amazing.

2205
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:23,520
Anybody came out to begin with and nobody went crazy.

2206
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,160
So what is the 150 people that were reported?

2207
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:26,840
Where'd they go?

2208
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,440
The gate itself to go see.

2209
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:30,880
So that's probably what would have happened if someone like you didn't come

2210
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,400
along and organize something else.

2211
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,800
Yeah, I didn't organize it, but I definitely advocated for safety and it

2212
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,280
worked and it was a success.

2213
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:38,760
So they just got together and talk.

2214
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,280
3000 people got together and talk.

2215
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:41,640
It was spread out all throughout.

2216
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:43,760
Like people didn't, Rachel, the community didn't want people.

2217
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:44,920
There was an event there though.

2218
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:47,480
And the, in Heiko where I was, was the event with the stage and

2219
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:48,640
the fun stuff we all did.

2220
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,400
George Knapp was, was there as well.

2221
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:51,400
How'd you promote this?

2222
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,920
Well, they did the event.

2223
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:54,800
They promote it because people are already coming.

2224
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,320
Did you promote it on social media?

2225
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:57,080
Sure.

2226
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:59,640
I said, if you're going to go somewhere, that's where I'm going to be.

2227
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:00,800
And it's going to be safe and sane.

2228
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:06,120
My point is this, um, you have so many people that are curious now and don't

2229
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:09,360
underestimate what happened when someone watched your podcast and that happened.

2230
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:12,360
Boom, you've got all these new people who are interested in it.

2231
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:16,560
And I think that's important because this UFO phenomenon is real.

2232
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:19,160
You've got fighter pilots that engage them.

2233
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,640
It represents a non-reactionary propulsion system, and that's a

2234
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:24,080
physics that would change the world.

2235
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,840
So the more people that come together and say, we're interested,

2236
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,200
the louder the voice we got.

2237
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:29,120
I think it's cool.

2238
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:30,320
And I had some alien Budweiser.

2239
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:30,800
Great.

2240
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,920
Well, I don't know if there's really any benefit to people

2241
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,600
physically getting together, but I do think that there's a lot of benefit.

2242
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,040
I'm glad you had a good time, but I do think there's a lot of

2243
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:43,000
benefit to this discussion.

2244
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:46,920
And, uh, and I really think there's a lot of benefit to hearing the

2245
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:48,240
stories from people like you.

2246
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,760
Cause, uh, that's the only thing that matters to me when it's like, I need

2247
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:56,000
to know the person who's telling me the story isn't full of shit.

2248
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,920
So when I get it from someone like you, I really, really appreciate it.

2249
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:01,200
So, um, that's it.

2250
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:02,160
Thanks for being here.

2251
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:03,680
Thanks for telling your story.

2252
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:04,280
Thanks for having me.

2253
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:05,040
Thanks for being you.

2254
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:08,280
Thank you, Jeremy, for setting this up and thanks for your documentary on

2255
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:10,960
Bob's eye, which really like fucking turned me around.

2256
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:12,280
That was the one.

2257
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:12,760
All right.

2258
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:13,320
That's it.

2259
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:14,240
Bye everybody.
