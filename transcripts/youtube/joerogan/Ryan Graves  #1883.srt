00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Joe Rogan Experience.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Nice to meet you, Brian.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nice to meet you, Joe.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Pleasure to be here.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're one of four or five people that I've talked to that have seen something that might

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
be from somewhere else.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's always weird when you talk to someone that may have seen something that...

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's just...

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
First, before we even get started, please tell people your credentials, what your background

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
is.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Sure.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, you know, my name is Ryan Graves.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I have an engineering degree, mechanical and aerospace engineering.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I promptly left doing that to go fly F-18s for the Navy as soon as I graduated college.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Did that for about a decade, both operationally in combat as well as an instructor role, teaching

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the new students.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And, you know, we did witness something while we were flying in our jets, but, you know,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
we were doing it under...

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We witnessed it in the context of our just everyday flying in our missions.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And what year was it that you witnessed this?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So, we started seeing these in 2014 was the earliest that I know.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
2013, late 2013, early 2014.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And could you describe what was the very first experience?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, so for me personally, the experience was simply just flying out to the area like

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I would any other day.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And instead of seeing an empty airspace with just my wing person or another squadron doing

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
something, a different block, there were all of a sudden a lot of different radar contacts,

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
which is immediately a problem because, you know, we could be hitting one of those or

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
someone working in our area.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And this was happening because we upgraded our radar the best we could tell.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We were in a earlier radar called the APG-73 and we had come back from deployment.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We entered a maintenance phase, it's called.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We kind of do a little bit less flying, upgrade the jets if we need to, do any long lasting

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
maintenance, and we upgraded to the APG-79, which was a much better radar.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And what is the difference in the capabilities of the upgraded radar system versus the original system?

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So, you know, kind of frankly speaking, it's like going from an analog TV essentially to

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
like an OLED.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's, you know, a digital modern tool compared to more of like an analog classical radar

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
that has more limited range and has less ability to track multiple targets and things of

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that nature.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So just generally speaking, we would expect to see, you know, more objects if there were

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
any out there or smaller objects, but there shouldn't have been any objects out there.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And so how far offshore are you when this is all going down?

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Our working areas start about 10 miles off the coast and then it goes out, you know,

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
over 250 miles or so that we don't usually use those far eastern areas.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But we would only see them over the water.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So they would really only be in our working areas, maybe slightly, you know, in between the

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
working areas and land, but never over the land, sometimes over the bays that are in the area

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that are quite large, but never just kind of zooming west over land or anything like that.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And is this restricted airspace?

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's not.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So that's a tricky question.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you're just operating in a military operating area, it is not restricted in the sense that

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
you have to be, there's only one person allowed in there.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You could have these little Cessnas kind of bumbling in there, but they would get called

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
out pretty quick, both from the kind of air traffic control agency that's working out

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
there, as well as F-18s and the other aircraft that may be working out there.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But in a broader sense, when we look at it in relation to our air defense identification

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
zone, which is essentially a band of airspace that surrounds our entire country, if you are,

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
if your flight path originates out over the water outside of the ATIS and you proceed into

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that ATIS, into our controlled airspace, then you do have to essentially have permission to

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
enter that airspace.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's not a restricted airspace like a traditional bombing range, but it is protected airspace.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's our coastal air.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So you have this upgraded radar system.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And what are you detecting?

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So on the radar, really what we can learn from that is essentially the kinematics of the

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
object.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So where is it essentially?

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And what direction is it going?

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How fast is it going?

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Things of that nature.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We can't necessarily make up the shape or things of that nature.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So it's a representation.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's like a block on our screen to show that information.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And so when we see that on our radar, we can tell, you know, where it's located, you know,

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
perhaps what's located around it, if there's other objects we're detecting, how fast it's

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
going, what direction it's pointed in, what direction it's traveling in.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So we call that velocity vector.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So if we see this essentially little circle, we'll have a tail coming off of it.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And that tail kind of represents the nose of the vehicle, at least as its flight path is

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
going.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And so with that, you know, we would typically see an aircraft just kind of trudging along with a

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
straight line, taking occasional turns.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But these objects had a little bit more of a, I don't want to say random, but more less controlled

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
flight path.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That velocity vector would kind of jump around a bit more.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They would not proceed in like a perfectly straight line, as you would imagine like a flight

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
navigation computer would take you, right?

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It takes you from A to B in the straightest line possible.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
These objects seem to kind of be moving in a direction that was not a straight line, but

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
generally proceeding in that direction.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And so they would kind of be meandering slightly, but moving in that general direction, both

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
three-dimensionally and horizontally.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So winding around, going up, going down.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So they're not on a flat plane, and they're not going in a straight line.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So I don't want to draw too many firm statements like that, because we would see them being flat,

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
too.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We would see them perfectly stationary up there, regardless of the wind.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Really?

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mm-hmm.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yep.

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wow.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So what kind of wind are you talking about?

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh, gosh.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I mean, at altitude, you can have anywhere up to 120 knots of airspeed.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Which is, what is that in miles per hour?

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's about 130, 140 miles per hour.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So they're completely stationary with 140 mile an hour wind.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Correct.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How would something do that?

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's confusing to me as well.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If we had something that could just burn that much energy, if you had a sphere surrounded

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
by little rockets, just imagining something right now, and if you wanted to keep that

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
perfectly stationary against gravity, you could just fire all the rockets at the bottom

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
really fast and hopefully keep it flat.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's going to have tiny little variations.

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And then if you have wind hitting it and all this, you could potentially have those rockets

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
try to counter it, but it would never be perfectly still in winds like that.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because the wind's not perfectly still either, right?

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Exactly.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It changes and varies.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It does.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So it's almost like it's the wind.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's not even really fighting the wind, it seems.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It just seems like it's just there in a way.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Wow.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So the first time you see these things, what are your thoughts?

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah.

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The first time really was, well, what is this?

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's not a UFO or something mysterious at this point.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
At what we're thinking at this point, we see on the radar, it's just, well, our radar is

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
broken, right?

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
These perhaps don't represent physical objects yet, because we hadn't visually seen these

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
or seen them on our camera yet.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And so we're kind of like, hey, what's going on here?

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Is anyone else seeing this kind of thing?

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But not really investigating it, right?

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's just kind of like, all right, there was stuff out there, but maybe next time we'll

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
take a look.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But the way our systems work, when we have all these contacts on our radar, and if we

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
kind of just select one out with our little cursor there, all our sensors go to it.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Our FLIR goes to it, which is our camera system, all our weapons.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They have their own little eyes in some sense, and they all look in that direction.

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And so eventually, someone had one of these selected and flew close enough so that as

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
they look at their FLIR system, their camera, they could see something that was at the spot

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
represented on the radar, right?

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So there was something there.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So they were seeing it visually with their own eyes?

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Not at this point, just on the FLIR system.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The FLIR system.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And so it's a regular camera and also an infrared camera.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And so typically, we'll roll around in infrared just because it returns a better image typically.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So yeah, it didn't look like an object they were seeing on the FLIR.

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It just looked like a source of IR energy in a sense, almost as if someone was shining

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
a flashlight.

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But something had to be there to be reflecting that energy or creating it.

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So at this point, to answer your question, now we're like, OK, this isn't just an error

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
on our radar.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is perhaps, you know, we're thinking this is real.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We have to really respect this as like a safety hazard now, even if it's just a small, you

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
know, however small ribbon of tin foil, right?

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Like that sucked down the engine to still take out an aircraft, right?

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So we have to be very respectful of that.

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Like a Mylar balloon type thing?

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Potentially, yeah.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But how fast are these things going?

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So sometimes stationary, right?

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Sometimes they would be going around 0.6 to 0.8 Mach, which is at altitude about, you

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
know, 240 to maybe 330 knots, you know, around there.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So somewhere in the range of an airplane.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah, fighter aircraft would be kind of flying around at those air speeds, except sometimes

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
they would be perfectly stationary as well.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Right.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So it's not exhibiting any sort of patterns that you've recognized in the past?

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No, they have, actually.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But with the stationary, no, right?

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Correct.

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
With the stationary, no.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
With the meandering kind of flight path, no.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But I would also see them essentially fly what we call a racetrack pattern.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And essentially what that means is they fly in a straight path and then they do like a

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
180-degree turn in a certain direction, then they fly a straight path, then turn again,

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
you know.

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So that's what we call a racetrack pattern as opposed to a circular holding pattern.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We did witness racetrack patterns.

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
In fact, I think there's been some cases off the West Coast just the past couple weeks

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
where people have also been observing objects flying in racetrack patterns high at altitude

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
with lights.

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So I do recognize that behavior, but I don't necessarily think that means we have to attribute

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
it to normal behavior necessarily.

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That type of flight path is important because it's a very efficient way to fly, right?

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If you have to maintain the position in a certain area, you want to minimize how much

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
you're turning.

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because any time you're turning in an aircraft, you're using more energy than if you were

198
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
just flying straight and level.

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And so by having a racetrack pattern, it's an efficient way of holding in a position

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
by maximizing straight and level time and minimizing your turn time.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And how long would these things stay up there for?

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So from my experience, from our experience, and again, we weren't studying these, but

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
they were always out there.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Always.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You know, they were out there when we took off, we'd see them, and then we'd go to land

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and they would still be out there.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Like every day?

208
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Every day.

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Every day.

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Every day.

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So you guys go from not having any idea that these things are out there to an upgraded

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
radar system to seeing them every day.

213
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah.

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What is the thought?

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Like how are you feeling when these, like is there an evolution of the thought pattern

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
of how you're addressing these things and thinking about them?

217
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Initially, you're thinking they're errors.

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
When do you start getting a thought that like, what the fuck is this thing?

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah.

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So that happened when we visually saw one.

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And the first time we visually saw one, the object was directly at what we call the entry

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
point of the area.

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So, you know, that box that I told you about in the sky that starts 10 miles off the coast,

224
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
there's a particular GPS, you know, location and altitude where incoming traffic will fly

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and outbound traffic will fly in the exact same spot but will fly out a thousand feet

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
lower.

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There were two aircraft from my squadron, VFA 11, and we flew, or excuse me, they flew,

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
took off as a flight of two.

229
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That means they're essentially flying in a formation like this.

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And as they hit the area, one of these objects went right between the aircraft.

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The lead aircrew saw the object.

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The Dash 2 aircraft crew did not, which is not surprising because they're usually, you

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
know, you're very focused on flying formation.

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're just staring right at that aircraft.

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The lead really has actual leeway to look around.

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So he saw it.

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And, you know, he immediately came back.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I have to assume he didn't have it on his radar because he wouldn't have flown through this

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
object at the working, at the entrance point.

240
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He flew, he turned around, flew back, landed.

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And I was in the ready room when he had come back and, you know, he had all his gear on,

242
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
which typically is not a good thing because you want to get that stuff off as fast as

243
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
possible.

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So it usually means, you know, there's a problem of some nature.

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And, you know, he was just sitting there saying, hey, you know, I almost hit one of those damn

246
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
things.

247
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And we all knew what he was referring to even though we didn't actually have a name for

248
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
it just because we were seeing these so much.

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And he described it.

250
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You know, he described it just as a black or dark gray cube.

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And that cube was inside of a clear translucent sphere.

252
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And essentially the apex or the corners of that cube, best he could tell, were touching

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
inside of that sphere.

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And that description mirrors many of the descriptions that people have had of these,

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
whatever you want to call them.

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They're calling them UAPs now for some strange reason.

257
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
UFOs, I don't know, does it have a dirty connotation to it?

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is it tainted because of so many crazy people talk about UFOs?

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Is that what it is?

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It does come with a lot of assumptions baked in.

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It baked in.

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's yeah.

263
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So that's something.

264
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But whatever it is, that is a design that people have reported seeing before that this

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
translucent sphere and this cube.

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Can you see through the cube?

267
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Not to my understanding, no.

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So it's some sort of solid black cube that's inside this translucent sphere.

269
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And it's just floating around and flying around the sky.

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So, you know, that's a good point.

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Is it floating around?

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Is it flying around?

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's doing both, which is strange, right?

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Because you could think of that description and go, OK, that's kind of some kind of weird

275
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
balloon maybe with stuff in it.

276
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And that's certainly one way.

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If you just view that angle of it, then it seems explainable.

278
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But when that, you know, the balloon-like object starts cruising down at, you know,

279
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
0.8 Mach, you know, that nullifies that particular idea.

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And you'll see that a lot where it's not just like that one picture, that one behavior.

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's really kind of to zoom out a bit and look at everything in relation to each other

282
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and say, OK, why is this weird?

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You know, OK, it was hanging out in a racetrack pattern.

284
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's not exotic.

285
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But when you learn it was doing it for, you know, perhaps 13 hours.

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
13 hours.

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You know, perhaps they were out there all the time, you know.

288
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So, you know, I land and I go back.

289
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And we weren't on a Intel mission to analyze these, right?

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We're going to do our training.

291
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's very expensive.

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
30K an hour to fly these things, right?

293
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So really the only time we can put energy into looking at these things when we're kind

294
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
of transiting back and forth or waiting for a fight to start.

295
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And so, you know, it's never like a dedicated analysis.

296
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
One of the problems I've had is that, you know, people haven't wanted to look into

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and to study this topic.

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And people ask me all the time, OK, you know, what are you seeing on the jet?

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What are you seeing in the radar?

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I want to be able to tell them that there was a great thing that we saw.

301
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But an F-18 is not a scientific tool, right?

302
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We only get presented a certain amount of information when all the sensors essentially

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
filter all the data out so that we can prosecute the targets and do our job.

304
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's not some type of like analog, you know, information we receive.

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So, you know, just because, say, something is showing jamming on my radar from one of

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
these objects doesn't mean the object is executing, you know, electronic warfare to

307
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
jam my jet.

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It just means that, you know, it's doing something to our radar signal.

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And when it comes back, you know, our jet is processing it like it's EW.

310
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So we need to get proper scientific tools to do an analysis on these objects instead

311
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
of basing, you know, a lot of our analysis right now just on tools of war that aren't

312
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
built for that.

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Right.

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Right.

315
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
How long can you guys stay up in an F-18?

316
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If we're dogfighting about an hour, if we're holding at .6 to .8 Mach, you know, like I

317
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
described them as doing, somewhere maybe around like two, two and a half hours maximum.

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And you think that these things are up there for far longer than that.

319
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So how big was this thing when this guy saw it?

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So it's very difficult to tell in the air, but because they were flying in formation,

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
we could make some estimated guesses essentially.

322
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And that's what we did when we talked about it afterwards.

323
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Right.

324
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So the aircraft were about 100 feet apart.

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This thing, you know, they estimate it essentially split the section, which means it went more

326
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
or less right down the middle, but slightly closer to lead, which would put it somewhere

327
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
at less than 50 feet, you know, on average, if they're about 100 feet.

328
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You know, and then he, so he essentially used that, that size reference to say, hey, you

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
know, this might have been somewhere in like the five to 15, you know, foot diameter.

330
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's, you know, not a tight guess, but that's the best we could come up with.

331
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And what is it like?

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Like what, what's the atmosphere like when you go back to the base?

333
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Are you allowed to discuss this?

334
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Is this something that's openly talked about?

335
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Is this something that you get ridiculed for?

336
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's just, you know, like you would expect any group of, you know, dude and dudettes,

337
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
you know, hearing about this, they just kind of, you know, do the normal reaction like

338
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
anyone else and to kind of, you know, make the jokes and then kind of get back to work

339
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
essentially because, you know, we're just so busy at this time, right?

340
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
We're getting ready for war.

341
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Like for a lot of us, this is the apex of our career in a sense to get ready for deployment,

342
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
you know, and it's kind of like the long blade gets cut in a sense in a fighter community

343
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
like that.

344
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's very much a trust-based organization.

345
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So, you know, no one's out there looking to like make a big deal out of something that's

346
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
completely irrelevant, you know, in our eyes to our day-to-day operations other than a safety risk.

347
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's really like as much as we could process it.

348
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So, yeah, there was ridicule, but I don't think it was, I wouldn't say it was like over the top

349
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
or emotionally damaging, but, you know, it made clear it wasn't something to like, you know,

350
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
we were going to like put serious thought and energy into, you know.

351
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It was, hey, yeah, stay away and, you know, let me know how you're doing that next fight essentially.

352
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And when you discuss this, how many other people came forward with similar stories?

353
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It was less about people coming forward because everyone was just like, well, yeah, of course,

354
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
we see them out there.

355
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Like at this point when it was almost a safety issue at this point.

356
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, let me back up.

357
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
At first, you know, as soon as people, you know, the joke subsided when people eventually flew in a jet

358
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
with upgraded radar and saw it themselves, right?

359
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So, you know, it dwindled down where everyone was aware of this and it was just a safety hazard.

360
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But when we almost had the midair, that kind of upped the ante, right?

361
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Because we were kind of getting pissed at this point because, you know,

362
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the high probability answer was that this was some type of classified program of our own making

363
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
that had perhaps just started operating in an area they weren't supposed to for whatever reason.

364
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That was, you know, that was kind of our assumption.

365
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So we submitted a safety report because of that near midair, a hazard report,

366
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
which is essentially a notice that goes out to the whole fleet that says, you know,

367
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
this is a potential hazard that could cause the loss of an aircraft.

368
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And, you know, it was due to us almost hitting an unknown object of unknown origin.

369
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And that's how it continued for a while.

370
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And there was a number of has reps about that, about near misses.

371
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Eventually, they put out what's called a notam or notice to airmen, which is published on a federal website,

372
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
which essentially lists things like, hey, the runway lights are down or, you know,

373
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
they're working on this runway or this area is closed for something.

374
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And we had one in our local area that said, you know,

375
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
caution for the unknown objects working in our operating areas.

376
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We just don't know what they are, essentially.

377
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So that's just kind of where it stagnated at that point as far as, you know, resolution.

378
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's got to be a very bizarre feeling.

379
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You're flying around in these jets preparing for deployment.

380
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And you see things that are, if not unexplainable, haven't been explained yet.

381
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It just didn't fit into our framework, right?

382
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Even if we look at it.

383
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So, you know, when we really kind of were trying to hash it out in the squadron, it's, you know, okay, what could these be?

384
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And even the classified, you know, drone thing.

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And I'm not even going to consider all the things that have happened since then.

386
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But even at this time, you know, the drone thing didn't make sense to us for a number of reasons.

387
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
One of those is, you know, why, right?

388
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Why do we have potentially hundreds or more, you know, small drones that can perform better than anything we've seen just hanging out, you know, for years off the coast?

389
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And is there a visible method of propulsion that's coming from these objects?

390
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
No.

391
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What about a heat signature?

392
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
No.

393
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So, yeah, so there's no plume of heat coming out the back.

394
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There's no propellers.

395
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There's no wing surfaces that we've seen.

396
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And when you're looking at it, are you looking at it through some sort of an infrared that will detect heat?

397
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You don't see anything?

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Usually through infrared, yeah.

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And so, you know, it'll come back as either a white hut or a dark hut, which means, you know, black color represents heat.

400
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hut? What is hut?

401
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What is hut?

402
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Just the, it's essentially if we're looking at like an object against a blue sky, you know, if that thing's producing heat, then it's going to come out white in white hut.

403
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
All right.

404
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So if I see a white object, it's going to be a hot object and the sky is going to look blue.

405
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What's that word hut you're using?

406
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
H-O-T.

407
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
H-O-T? Oh, hot.

408
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, like the temperature.

409
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Like hot. Okay.

410
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah.

411
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay.

412
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
A little New England accent coming out there.

413
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, it's okay.

414
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm from New England, too.

415
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I just thought it was something else.

416
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I thought it was like a technical term.

417
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah.

418
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I say that just to say that, you know, it would just be like either all like completely one temperature essentially, right?

419
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It wasn't like the skin of an aircraft you could see.

420
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It was just kind of like an emission of IR energy, like a flashlight, right?

421
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Sometimes, most of the time it would be cold.

422
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It was like a cold object.

423
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So it didn't appear to actually be emitting heat.

424
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
There were times when they did appear to be emitting as a hot object as well.

425
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So we did see both.

426
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So I don't know what to make of that.

427
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Was there a difference in the way they were moving when it was exhibiting heat?

428
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Not that I know.

429
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You know, I don't want to say no, but we just didn't look at it deep enough to say that at the time.

430
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But whatever it was doing, it wasn't exhibiting any of the characteristics that you would normally expect from a jet or a drone or something that had some sort of a visible method of propulsion.

431
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah.

432
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Wow.

433
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So when these things are happening every day and all these different pilots are experiencing them every day,

434
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
this is essentially just from the moment of 2014-ish when this new radar system gets implemented.

435
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So you had one sense of what was out there, and then all of a sudden you have these new systems, and now you're like, whoa, this is littered with these things.

436
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah.

437
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What is that like?

438
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
For you personally, what does that feel like?

439
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You know, it's just comforting.

440
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
We spend a lot of time and energy on the most basic aspects of flight in a sense, right?

441
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Because if you can't just operate safely, right, you can't come back and land and manage your fuel and not bust through altitudes and all that, you can't do all the other stuff, right?

442
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And so we're very particular on those type of details.

443
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So to have someone operating in that area would be a massive oversight.

444
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So it was, you know, in a sense, we kind of at least I did felt a bit let down, right?

445
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It was like, you know, someone should be willing to look at this and deal with this problem.

446
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You know, if it was going to constantly it was not that it was constantly getting laughed at.

447
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's just it was we always had more bigger fish to fry, essentially, right, which I respect and I understand.

448
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But it doesn't mean we completely ignore that.

449
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Right.

450
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And we have to do more than just, you know, we have responsibility, I think, as aviators when we're up there to report really what we're seeing, because we're on the front line of what we can see up there.

451
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And if we don't have the command or operational support to tell the truth about what we're seeing up there, then things have to change.

452
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And the ramifications of what these things possibly could be, how much does that weigh on you?

453
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Because if these things are from another world or from the ocean or from another dimension or what, you know, fill in the blank, whatever you think it could be.

454
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That alone has got to be very weird to experience because this is not something that's being openly discussed.

455
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So you're just flying around out there.

456
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You get this new equipment and then all of a sudden you're like, hey, there's some stuff out here that we have no knowledge of.

457
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And then it's moving in a way that we really can't explain.

458
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
What is that like?

459
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We never really appreciate it at the time.

460
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Really?

461
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Because you're so mission focused.

462
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
We're so mission focused.

463
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And the point when we kind of left our squadron, we left for deployment in 2015.

464
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And so this was still happening.

465
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It was prior to the point that they started putting that notice out to Airmen, that notam out.

466
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So they still not even got to the point to have that general notice out.

467
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It was just people sending out the occasional hazard reports and left from an individual squadron.

468
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And then we left for deployment.

469
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Well, excuse me, we left for workups first, I should say.

470
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So let me backtrack a little bit.

471
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
As we get ready for deployment, we have our date where we leave.

472
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But then about six months prior to that, we're gone to the aircraft carrier and the different training areas to essentially get ready for that deployment and practice like we play.

473
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So we start going on the boat, we live on the boat, we start doing tactics off the boat.

474
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And we left to go down to the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, on an event where we essentially do exactly that.

475
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:46,000
We fly out on the aircraft carrier and we do a number of tactical missions to simulate that we are in operational theater.

476
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And honestly, it's more dangerous and likely difficult in a lot of cases than the actual combat deployment.

477
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We're preparing for every eventuality, air-to-air combat, rescue missions, everything.

478
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But of course, not everything gets exercised when you get out there.

479
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So it's much more dangerous and pretty intense.

480
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And so that's what we were getting ready to go do.

481
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And then we left and we did that.

482
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And when we got down in that area from Virginia Beach, we noticed that these objects were down there as well.

483
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We didn't know whether they came with us or whether they were already down there.

484
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But once we started flying off the boat about 1,500 miles or so south of Virginia Beach, there they were again.

485
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And it was in my squadron again when the video that's known as the gimbal video now, when that was recorded, we were on that workup cycle out in Jacksonville.

486
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We should play the gimbal video.

487
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Jamie, will you please pull that up?

488
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Because I want you to kind of give us an understanding from your own expertise, like your technical understanding of what we're looking at.

489
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So here it is.

490
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So this is FLIR footage?

491
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yep. So when I say FLIR, this is what I'm referring to.

492
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And right in the middle, the top of the screen, you see IR, infrared.

493
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So that's that infrared mode where we're seeing heat right now.

494
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
We're in Black Hut.

495
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So that means objects that are darker are hotter.

496
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So this object right in the middle is putting heat out.

497
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And right now it appears to be rotating.

498
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Is that what it was doing there?

499
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah, exactly. So we do see this object rotate.

500
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I mean, it looks like a gimbal. That's why it's called that thing. I didn't name it.

501
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But we do. We see the object essentially rotate from what looks like a horizontal position here.

502
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Those lines above it represent the horizon. So it's essentially parallel.

503
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
There it goes.

504
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And it's hard to make out the shape of this thing, but it seems almost like a disk with like a crown on the top and the bottom.

505
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah, kind of like it looks like almost like a little bit of energy coming out from the poles there, if you will.

506
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That's kind of how I describe it. I see like a little bit of the dark, you know, heat emanating from there or the energy, as I call it.

507
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And is there any way from this video from this equipment to detect how large this thing is?

508
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
There is. So the velocity vector in the middle there can be set to a particular size.

509
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And that size correlates to a particular length.

510
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So that in a dogfight, if you have, you know, you're behind a guy and you essentially his wingspan is equal to the length of those two lines on that circle with the lines coming out.

511
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
See that's a velocity vector, then you know how far away he is. Right.

512
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So it's kind of like an analog thing that's not super relevant, like in modern days.

513
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But yes, there is. I don't know, however, what that is set to in this one.

514
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So I can't like make that calculation for you right now.

515
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Now, I know some people who have attempted to debunk this and debunk even the rotation of this object.

516
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
What how do you know that that object is rotating?

517
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Definitively.

518
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Well, so we don't right.

519
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We don't necessarily definitively know it's rotating at the end of the day.

520
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Right. We have evidence that it is.

521
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But I don't have definitive evidence that you're a conscious human being on those other table of me either.

522
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But you know, I mean, like we just don't have that information.

523
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You only have video footage and in the video footage, it appears right now in relation to where it sits on the clouds that it has rotated.

524
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yes. So, you know, we can also we can also see if you if you and I know it's been done.

525
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:44,000
People have created models out there that, you know, essentially look at the clouds and they they draw out a flight path that this could be.

526
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And the only variable is essentially how far away the object is.

527
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And that flight path obeys an equation that can be observed pretty readily when you build the little model.

528
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And essentially, if you're at, you know, six miles or so, the object is proceeding in direction.

529
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And then when it starts to rotate, as as the aircraft described, it climbs and reverses directions.

530
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So you can't quite make that out.

531
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But when you when you when you actually model it out, you can see that at these ranges, it does what was was claimed.

532
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And we're kind of skipping a little bit of storage.

533
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So maybe I should back up. So, you know, when we observed when when this object was observed, the air crew essentially start on what they call a situational awareness page.

534
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And so that is a God's eye view of all the sensor data and everything else that our jets and other jets put out.

535
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And so we can put cursors on and move around, select stuff.

536
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And what the air crew described during this video verbally is a formation of objects and then the gimbal object.

537
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So what happened was, you know, we had all gone out on an air to air training mission during this workup cycle off of the aircraft carrier, the Theodore Roosevelt.

538
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And again, we're off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida.

539
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And, you know, there's like four or five or six, you know, red fighters, which are our own guys or girls acting as the enemy.

540
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And then we go up and act as the blue fighters and go do our tactics.

541
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I was part of the flight. We all flew up there when we kind of run out of gas during the fight.

542
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You kind of just return by yourself.

543
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And if you still have gas, you continue the fight type of thing.

544
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So we don't always fly home together.

545
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,000
In this case, the air crew from the gimbal video, you know, they knocked it off and started flying back to the boat.

546
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
We don't go like directly back to the boat when we run out of gas.

547
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It seems counterintuitive, but we have to wait for our landing time.

548
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We can't just come back and land earlier.

549
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So it doesn't really matter where we are as long as we're nearby.

550
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And we just slow down to what we call our max endurance speed.

551
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Right. So we just kind of cruise around, puddle along out there and just hang out until it's our time to land.

552
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And so, you know, while they were doing this, they noticed that there was a group of contacts on their situational awareness page, again, from their radar.

553
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And they're like, hey, you know, maybe this is like a penetration test because they'll launch aircraft from the coast, you know, like old fighters or, you know, just things that can move relatively quick.

554
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But, you know, not necessarily there to engage us in a dogfight to see if we can detect them and intercept them in time and things of that nature.

555
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Part of the overall training.

556
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And so when they saw these objects, that's what they thought this was.

557
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And so they started flying over to it and they got, you know, they got about, you know, six to seven, eight miles away.

558
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Six to eight is what the air crew told me.

559
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
They didn't want to get any closer because it was nighttime at this point and they couldn't see the object, which is why they were only in the IR mode.

560
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And they essentially, you know, they checked out for a bit and then circled a bit and then flew back essentially as it was time for their recovery.

561
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But what they saw was, you know, you saw the gimbal object that we saw in the film, but there's also there was also a formation of like four to five.

562
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I might say six. I don't remember exact number, but somewhere in the four to six range objects that were flying in a wedge formation.

563
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So essentially like a triangle without a base.

564
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And those objects were kind of proceeding along the same line as the gimbal.

565
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
For my recollection, the gimbal was, you know, slightly behind that formation and offset below it.

566
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And so that formation essentially kind of just turned in, I'll call it left hand turn, in a normal radius of turn to slightly less.

567
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But they got all jumbled up.

568
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So they just started turning instead of like a clean turn where they all kind of stay in the same spot, kind of a big sweeping thing.

569
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Instead of that, it was a lot tighter and they kind of broke down.

570
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
They didn't look like they were in formation anymore in a sense.

571
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You know, they were kind of scattered about.

572
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And I can't tell which one's which really out there on the radar looking at it.

573
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So I don't know if they came back in the same formation, exact same position.

574
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But when they rolled out 180 degrees out, basically reversed their direction, you know, they kind of got back into similar, if not the same formation, proceeding the opposite direction.

575
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And during this time, the gimbal object, you know, again, proceeding, call it left to right, trailing this formation.

576
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,000
While it kind of executed its radius of turn, the gimbal just essentially was continuing in a straight line.

577
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And then as if it like pinged off a wall, just reverse direction to follow that formation, you know, once they had started flowing in the opposite direction.

578
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So just stopped in midair and went backwards.

579
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I wouldn't even say stopped.

580
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It just seemed like it just like never stopped.

581
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It just went ping, you know.

582
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Wow.

583
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And that was that's how we saw her from the situational awareness page from looking down.

584
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Right. And so when you lift that up and look at it from the side, you know, what that ping motion looks like is a U-turn, a vertical U-turn to go in the opposite direction.

585
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
All right. So it climbs to reverse its turn to flow in the opposite direction within about 500 feet, which is very tight turn.

586
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I think an F-18 needs like 6000 feet or 4000 feet to do a turn like that.

587
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Wow. Yeah.

588
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So there's nothing that we have as a drone that's capable of moving like that.

589
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So, yeah, again, if you just look at one particular case, it's like, all right, so something climbed vertically in the opposite direction.

590
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Like, that's not the sexiest thing in the world.

591
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But then let's look back in context and say, OK, we're, you know, 350 miles off the coast in protected airspace around an aircraft carrier, you know, with only fighter jets in the air.

592
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And then all of a sudden, there's a formation of small objects just kind of cruising around, you know, for a period of time that's unknown, performing the least fuel efficient turns possible.

593
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Right. Like, there's no concern for how fuel efficient that turn is.

594
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That's not that's like the least efficient way to do a turn.

595
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And so how is an object hundreds of miles off the coast, you know, with apparently no concern for fuel hanging out next to our carrier?

596
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And without the FLIR footage, you would have never been able to see these things.

597
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Correct. Yeah.

598
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
When you report this, what is what's the reaction?

599
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Like, how how does that go?

600
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You know, because we were practicing like we play at this point, getting ready for war, we were doing like a formal intel debrief after our flights.

601
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Right. And like, hey, we intercept these guys and did that.

602
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Another thing. And so the the air crew who recorded it were going down to that room to debrief it.

603
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And someone told me, like, hey, you know, your friend there got something interesting on the on the FLIR this time.

604
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You know, maybe you should go take a look or something.

605
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Because I had already landed my gears off, you know, and so waiting to debrief, essentially.

606
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And so I'm like, I'll go check it out. So I walked down there.

607
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You know, it's like the other side of the ship go into classified space.

608
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
All the intel folk are in there and they're queuing up the video, the tapes to watch the FLIR footage.

609
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And here's an interesting thing, too. Right.

610
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So the situational awareness page, that screen I told you about with radar data, that's kind of in a screen that's, you know, chest level.

611
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And then there's screen here, screen here, eye level on either side.

612
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And if you record, we put the FLIR here, a standard procedure in the situational awareness page down here.

613
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And then we'll have a radar up here or any of our other systems.

614
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
If you record the screen with the FLIR, you record the essay page automatically.

615
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's part of the same tape. So.

616
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
What's interesting is that is that's what we watched when we were in that Intel space.

617
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You know, I was able to see the FLIR footage and that's what, you know, we just watched.

618
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And then the situational awareness page with the radar data showed that as well, which, you know, showed the fleet and showed that movement I described.

619
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Those are, you know, if that FLIR footage exists, then the radar data for that event exists as well.

620
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Right. Because it's filmed the same time. So someone would have had to specifically split it off to get the gimbal video out without the radar data.

621
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Right. So. So the gimbal video was leaked. Is that what happened?

622
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I don't know the exact mechanics. My understanding it was that's the way it could be described, but it was done within channels that that doesn't make it, you know, an illegal activity.

623
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But I honestly don't know the mechanics of how it was released.

624
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So somehow or another it gets out there and it gets online, but the situational awareness page and the radar data does not.

625
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You only get the FLIR footage.

626
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Correct.

627
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Why do you think that is?

628
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I think there's good reasons for that. You know, I don't think it's overly mysterious.

629
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You know, our radar sensor systems are our primary sensor out there. They're how we employ our weapons. And that's all fine.

630
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I think that's completely reasonable to not have that released like.

631
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Because it's top secret, because it would be some sort of a breach of security.

632
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You know, give away like how well our radar works essentially. Right.

633
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But with that being said, you know, there's still ways you can take that information and declassify it and just put the raw data out there in a sense like the kinematics.

634
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Right. Like, OK, we're detecting objects that move like this. You know, there's no location.

635
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
There's no like specific, you know, there's specifics have been kind of fleshed out.

636
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
There's like mathematical tools that can do that with like, you know, precision and certainty.

637
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So there are ways to declassify that data.

638
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:29,000
One of the efforts that I'm doing at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics with the UAP Community of Interest that I've helped put together is essentially preparing teams to do that, you know, analysis.

639
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:40,000
We have a team of engineers, aerospace and others that have, you know, over 300 years of NASA experience, you know, at least that are working to put together, you know,

640
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:55,000
engineering and scientific UAP sensing manuals that can be updated yearly so that the information that we learn going forward in a productive manner isn't something that we need to necessarily get disclosed from the government in order to move forward on.

641
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So when you are watching the FLIR footage and you're looking at the situation awareness page, you're seeing these objects, you've already had experiences with these things by then?

642
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So the gimbal was new.

643
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
With something.

644
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah, we hadn't seen the gimbal yet though.

645
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So this is different than the other objects that you've seen.

646
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah.

647
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So the gimbal object at this time...

648
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
What is a gimbal, by the way?

649
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
A spinning top, that's what I think of, right?

650
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Oh, okay.

651
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Yeah. And essentially, you know, and that induces a force that wants to keep it upright essentially, right?

652
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So as it's spinning, you poke it and it kind of goes back to the center.

653
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Right.

654
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You know, again, I don't know where the names came from, but...

655
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Okay.

656
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:44,000
But this particular shape of UAP you had not witnessed before, had you heard of something like this before?

657
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
No.

658
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
No.

659
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And let me say, it's not necessarily the shape that, well, one, gives it the name and even is what we were analyzing, right?

660
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Because what we see in that video is IR energy, and that could be anything.

661
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Is there a plasma field there, but the surface is smaller, or is there some type of energy out there or heat that is masking the shape of the object?

662
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
We don't really know the size or the physical shape of the object from that image.

663
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Right, you're just getting the signature.

664
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So when everyone is observing this, how many people are in the room with you when this is going down?

665
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Yeah, there's maybe like 15 or so.

666
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
A lot of intel people, you know, a handful of aviators, and then of course the air crew.

667
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
What's the reaction?

668
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Everyone just kind of looking around at each other, just kind of like, you know, holy shit, like, you know, there was no like, oh, that's prosaic or that's...

669
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Right.

670
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
There was no conclusion to draw on, but everyone just kind of like had no idea what it was.

671
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And the people that were in there, had they also used this upgraded equipment so they were all aware that there was something going on out there, like this is a narrative that's being discussed?

672
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
All the aviators, yeah.

673
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So everyone kind of knows that you're not alone out there?

674
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It's a good question.

675
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I don't even know how many of the intel folks knew at this point.

676
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:08,000
But I mean, at least our squadron intel, you know, guided and I know a handful of others, but I honestly don't know how many of the intel folks were aware at this point.

677
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Is there a discussion about, you know, how much of this can you talk about openly?

678
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Like, is everyone going, huh?

679
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Like, what is it like?

680
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah, pretty much that, huh, right?

681
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And kind of just waiting for someone to provide some, you know, leadership on this.

682
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Like, what the fuck?

683
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
What leadership is available if an alien spacecraft shows up?

684
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Well, apparently they called the admiral, right?

685
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So they're like, let's see what the admiral thinks.

686
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And so I kind of like kind of slowly walked into the shadows and no one kicked me out, you know?

687
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Right.

688
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Because you want to know.

689
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah.

690
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I wanted to see what his reaction at least was, you know?

691
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And he came down a couple minutes and he watched it for like five, six seconds and just turned around and was like, just walked out.

692
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Whoa.

693
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Yeah.

694
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I was like, I think he's clearly seen this before.

695
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah.

696
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah.

697
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That's why I saw it.

698
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
That would immediately be my thought.

699
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If he's just going, huh?

700
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Like, unless he's so fucking jaded, the guy who's seen so much shit.

701
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
That's what might be worse.

702
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Holy shit.

703
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Maybe he needs to retire, buddy.

704
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
He's seen too much shit.

705
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
But I would imagine if that's his reaction, that this is something that he's observed before.

706
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So fast forward a couple of years and we'll come back.

707
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:28,000
But, you know, I, at this point, talked to various people on the Hill and had been involved with some people that had looked into this.

708
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And one of them mentioned to me, you know, hey, your inclination was correct.

709
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:42,000
You know, after he saw that video, he essentially came back and called us to report that these fucking objects were still, you know, in his airspace.

710
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And we're looking for some type of answer of what to do about them.

711
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Wow.

712
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And was there any sort of conclusion?

713
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Is there any sort of protocol that gets established afterwards to what to do when you encounter these things?

714
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So to answer that in the worst way possible, you know, we walk back to our ready room.

715
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And, of course, then we're all like, you know, talking about it and like, well, what's this?

716
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Because we've seen the other objects.

717
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Like, from the best we could tell, the formation represented the objects we were used to seeing off these coasts.

718
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But the gimbal was new.

719
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And, you know, now we're building theories because it's like, well, this is different.

720
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You know, we're starting to get a little more interested.

721
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And, you know, essentially someone just came in and just said that was enough, essentially, you know.

722
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Stop talking about it.

723
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah. And it wasn't like it was, you know, here's an NDA or anything like that.

724
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It wasn't really even anyone in a position to order that if they wanted to.

725
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
But it was still just like, all right, you know, just another weird thing here at this point.

726
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And again, we're in a super stressful time, right?

727
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Right.

728
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Eighteen hour days, you know, it's a stressful time.

729
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But yeah, you know, I look back and I feel like I have to defend that decision because it's like, why weren't you more curious?

730
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Why weren't you more into it?

731
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You know, or why didn't you think to explore this part of it?

732
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But yeah, we were just busy.

733
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
We were just so focused on what we were doing and trying to do the best we could.

734
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:12,000
When you guys are alone, like if you're having dinner or you're just alone having a beer, do these things come up in conversation?

735
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah, absolutely, especially over a beer.

736
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah.

737
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Are there more different shapes and more different types of these objects?

738
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The observations off the East Coast, we talked to other people in other squadrons with similar capabilities and they were describing it the same way.

739
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
The Cuban Sphere, same color, same, you know, everything.

740
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And does that seem indicative of things that you only see on the East Coast?

741
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So far as I know, you know, again, there's no, I wish there was a better place to answer these questions.

742
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But part of the reason I don't have answers is because we've just refused to look at this for so long, right?

743
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
There's just never been data collection so far as, you know, I know.

744
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And so, you know, that would be, these would be questions we could answer that if we had started looking at this 20 years ago, perhaps, that we could be answering now.

745
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But, you know, we have to collect a lot of data.

746
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And, you know, it's interesting because we have really two ways of doing that, right?

747
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
There's leveraging the world's best sensors and things of that nature through the U.S. government.

748
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And, of course, all that is all is going to be classified and it's always going to be difficult.

749
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And then, on the other hand, there's really discovery, right?

750
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I mean, we don't have to just wait for the government to tell us, you know, what's right and what's wrong, what's real on this topic, right?

751
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:37,000
We are in an age now where technology and democratization of tools, essentially, and access to space, you know, is moving it.

752
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So, you know, we can verify and move the topic forward without being hand-fed, perhaps, from the people with the world's greatest sensors.

753
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Does that make sense?

754
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah, it does make sense.

755
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
How many different types of these objects have you heard other people discuss?

756
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
There's the circle that has the cube inside of it.

757
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
There's this gimbal thing, which you don't really necessarily know what the shape is.

758
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But have people witnessed eyewitness accounts?

759
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Other than Commander David Fravor described something that he said looked like a tic-tac.

760
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I believe he said it was somewhere in the neighborhood of like 25 feet wide.

761
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Is that something?

762
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Sounds right.

763
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So there's three, right?

764
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
You don't know what the gimbal, the physical shape of it is.

765
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Then you have the circle with the cube inside of it, and then you have the tic-tac.

766
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Are there more?

767
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Probably, you know.

768
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Have you talked to someone who's seen others?

769
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
On the East Coast, you know, we were typically seeing whatever I described to you, all up and down.

770
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So even up in like the Patuxent River area outside of D.C., you know, people were seeing them up there at the test pilot area.

771
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,000
On the West Coast, like you said, I've heard the tic-tac description, you know, multiple times.

772
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Once kind of the word got out, I'd think about the cube a bit, and people were looking and paying attention.

773
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I started to hear about those being observed in other areas, such as the West Coast and further inland, actually, around other bases.

774
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
But we still know necessarily if we're observing things there because they're there or because we just happen to have the sensors there, right?

775
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
It could be in more places. We're just not necessarily looking there.

776
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
So there's a huge aspect right now to observation bias.

777
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:32,000
In 2017, it was kind of a milestone moment for UFO, just the discussion, because the New York Times printed a story.

778
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And once it was on the front page of the New York Times, it was like, OK, this is a serious magazine or the serious newspaper.

779
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And you have a serious discussion now about this thing that had been, for a long time, been ridiculed.

780
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And then the Pentagon discusses it. You start hearing people. Why do you think that's happening?

781
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Like, what is it about this subject? Like, it must have been, for you, in 2014, very bizarre when you have this new radar system that starts detecting these things.

782
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Now you get this understanding of the fact that these things are there all the time.

783
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You just haven't been able to put eyes on them and you haven't had equipment that measured them accurately.

784
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Now you do. And now there's this discussion of it in the New York Times. What do you think is going on?

785
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
At the end of the day, I wish I had an answer for you. I don't.

786
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But from where I'm sitting, I see a lot of people that seem to be paying attention more so now, especially after that article came out, myself included.

787
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I mean, I was part of it. I was a witness to it. But just like everyone else, I kind of just let it be part of my history until I saw that article pop on the New York Times.

788
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And I don't know why we are moving the conversation forward. I've listened to Chris Mellon talk about it.

789
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I've listened to Lou talk about it. And it's very simple when I talk about it because it's very simple.

790
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
There are objects out there that our aviators are almost hitting.

791
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And for me, whenever I engage this topic, it's always from that perspective of aviation safety.

792
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So it's never really engaging on this crazy, ontological wave.

793
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
It's me just working on a problem that I was trained for by the Navy. I was trained to be an aviation safety officer.

794
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So I see the signs of the safety problem brewing. People don't want to talk about it. It's taboo.

795
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
That's not how aviation safety works. It doesn't live in silence in a cone like that.

796
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You need to share lessons learned. And the government gets it now. The DOD gets it.

797
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That's why the aircrew have a reporting mechanism now. They can come back after their flight, after they've seen one of these objects, and they can report it.

798
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And I understand that reporting mechanism has an area where they can describe the shape of it.

799
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So my hope is we can answer that question of yours once that data gets released. I hope it will at some point. It's classified at the moment.

800
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Do you have any understanding of how often these things get reported?

801
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I don't know how often they're getting reported. My fear is that if aviators don't get feedback from the work you're doing, they're going to stop reporting.

802
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:20,000
If you just keep reporting a safety hazard every day and it's just data collection and nothing solves it, then eventually you're just going to say, what's the point?

803
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I'm going to just do my thing. And I've seen some declassified pilot reports. Some of these were from the UAP Task Force report that came out last year.

804
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And they're fascinating. The pilots are curious. They're seeing things they don't understand. They're seeing these interesting objects, massive winds.

805
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
They're seeing formations of objects flying around, behaving in ways they don't understand. And they're looking for more.

806
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
They're saying, hey, if you have any more questions, please reach back to me on classified if you need to.

807
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And my fear is that if they don't get that information back, that engagement with people collecting that data, it's going to taper off.

808
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So I just wanted to make the plea that we consider that it's a two-way conversation with those aircrew.

809
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Christopher Mellon, when I talked to him, he was saying that there's a lot more data, a lot more evidence out there that hasn't been released.

810
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And his understanding of it is that what you're seeing is just the tip of the iceberg and that there's high-resolution photos and videos and that some of it is, for lack of a better word, disturbing.

811
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Because you're looking at something that doesn't make any sense in terms of what we understand, what's physically possible with the technology that we have access to today.

812
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yeah. You know, I have some volunteers within the AIAA work that have been in a position to do that, right?

813
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Now that, again, there's been a new reporting mechanism. We're kind of moving into a new age with this.

814
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I can't speak to all the data that may be out there for the past X years, right?

815
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Again, it comes with a lot of assumptions and a lot of unanswered questions.

816
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But from the new reports that they've started fresh with the Navy, and I applaud them for standing up and taking the lead on that, the reports that we see is that this has continued to be a problem that is occurring.

817
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:21,000
The number of objects, they seem to be increasing. It seems to be happening everywhere we're looking.

818
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
You know, so Navy bases on the West Coast and other places in the U.S. and on the East Coast are seeing them.

819
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Yeah, I'll just stop there for a minute. Sorry. I do that occasionally.

820
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It's such a squirrely subject, man. And I'm really fascinated by the fact that these sightings seem to occur on a regular basis over the ocean.

821
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And Jeremy Corbell, who has had video leaked to him, I use the air quotes leaked because I don't know exactly how this is happening or why it's happening or why.

822
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I assume they're focusing on him because he's capable of releasing it in a very high profile way. If he releases it, people are going to pay attention.

823
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:21,000
But one of the videos is of a transmedium device, something that is apparently some of the military filmed this, that it was flying above the ocean and then went into the ocean.

824
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:31,000
When you're seeing all these things, they appear around the ocean. Why do you think that is? Do you have any speculation?

825
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Well, you know, we're pretty blind down there at the end of the day, right? We don't have as good an essay, I'll say, or as much presence in the ocean as we do in the air, I would say.

826
00:55:48,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yeah, we do have a lot of sensors and we can likely see certain things, but radiation, electromagnetic radiation, doesn't propagate very well through water like that.

827
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So in a way, it's kind of a good place to hide, I would suggest. There's talks of hydrogen being a useful fuel source and, of course, plenty of hydrogen in the water.

828
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:23,000
But this is all just pure speculation. I really don't know at the end of the day, but the video that you mentioned with that kind of transmedium behavior went directly into the object like that.

829
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I'll just say that that is very unique to see objects like that. People argue about the shape or anything like that.

830
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:46,000
But even if these objects are coming from, call it a near-peer threat, and they're still able to do these types of behaviors, at the end of the day, it really comes down to technological surprise.

831
00:56:47,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Whether that's an adversary on Earth or whether that's something else. It's the same process of understanding what the capabilities are so that come 2024, 2025, we don't have a surprise that we can't counter,

832
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:10,000
whether that's hypersonic objects flying around that happen to be UAP or whether they happen to be missiles. It's essentially the same problem.

833
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:22,000
The problem is, yeah, we don't know if that's coming from an adversary or whether it's coming from an alien. And so we don't know how to react, whether this thing is observing us or whether this thing is an actual physical threat.

834
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I've used the word threat before. And for me as a pilot, when an aircraft is flying around out there and they're not talking to me, like say they came into my area and I'm the only one out there and there's an interloper, that aircraft's a threat to me.

835
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It doesn't mean he has hostile intent necessarily, but my aircraft could be lost if I have a midair. If I start doing some tactics and I forget he's there and now I'm, you know, zorting through his altitude.

836
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:01,000
So he's a threat, very simply. It doesn't mean it's a bad guy or he's got, you know, explosives on his plane. But it's the same way when I talk about these being a threat for aviators out there.

837
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It is a safety hazard. Someone could die. We could lose aircraft. I don't think that these objects are displaying hostile intent out there.

838
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But even just observation and collection of our, you know, electronic warfare, our communications, our radar frequency, all that information, if it was an earthly threat, you know, that would be very useful information that they could look the back engineer.

839
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Has there ever been any sort of design or discussion of some sort of a craft that can operate in a transmedium way that can fly through the air and then go into the ocean?

840
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Nothing that I've seen that's been created, really.

841
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:54,000
How would a propulsion system work that would go from the air into the ocean based on what we understand about the abilities that we have today?

842
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Sure. You know, on the surface, like to go from air to water isn't necessarily a complete challenge, right?

843
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Like you can imagine something that can get dropped in the ocean and perhaps move around or some type of mini submarine that comes up and then launches a UAV, right, and flies away.

844
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
But just to be clear to people listening, that's not necessarily what we're talking about.

845
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:24,000
We're talking about an object that is moving at a relatively, you know, quick pace and enters the water as if it wasn't there.

846
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Is that what you understand? Yeah.

847
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
The way I understand it is it just went right into the water.

848
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And so, you know, that's incredibly interesting for a number of reasons.

849
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
You know, propulsion in the air versus propulsion in the water is, you know, typically pretty different.

850
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And once you start talking about high speeds underwater, that kind of goes out the door.

851
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,000
You know, high speeds underwater, 200 miles an hour or higher, is not like 200 miles in the air.

852
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And so when I think of something that can operate in both, the first thing I think of is that, you know, neither are concerned because of its operating system, whether that's air friction or whether that's the water drag that it would be exposed to.

853
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
That's like the first kind of like out there thought as far as how this could operate.

854
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:17,000
It would somehow be affecting, you know, the air or the water, right, the liquid around it to to move it around the aircraft or to, you know, negate the effect of all that force.

855
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Right. Because moving underwater is just so much pressure, so much friction that it's just so hard to go fast.

856
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Did you watch that Jeremy Corbell documentary, Bablazar Area 51 and Flying Saucers?

857
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I did. I did.

858
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
What did you think of that?

859
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It was interesting, you know, I get a cool story for you here.

860
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
When I was a kid, I was an avid explorer of the Internet.

861
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And I had stumbled upon what I thought at the time was the coolest possible website ever.

862
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
This guy selling all sorts of like radioactive rocks and like cool scientific equipment.

863
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And I was like, this is the coolest website. Like, this is why the Internet was built.

864
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And, you know, fast forward, you know, many years later, I learned that, you know, that was Bob's website.

865
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Oh, United Nuclear.

866
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh, wow. I heard it might have been in that movie, actually, or the documentary.

867
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And I was like, holy smokes. That's that guy.

868
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
But, you know, the story is fascinating.

869
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Here's my only, you know, I don't want to say I believe or disbelieve,

870
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
because this is such a controversial area when people start like drawing these conclusions.

871
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:32,000
So I want to be able to establish the ability to do real science on this topic.

872
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I want to be able to, you know, get a material or to get a bit of information

873
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:46,000
and have a real peer review process that is going to look at that information objectively without the stigma that UAP have had.

874
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Even Bob's story, right, comes with, you know, people either, you know, hate it or love it.

875
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It's very controversial.

876
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
But at the end of the day, you know, data is data.

877
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And if we can, you know, perhaps get element 115 or some other thing that could be used to do an analyst,

878
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
we can write papers, we'll have a process to take that forward and be able to say, hey, you know,

879
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
here's now a flag in the sand that we can kind of move science forward on on this, you know, unique topic.

880
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And if no one, the people that haven't seen the documentary,

881
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
what Ryan's referring to with element 115 is something that Bob talked about in the late 80s.

882
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And what he describes is a reactor that uses this element called 115 that was theoretical in the late 80s.

883
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
But then proven in somewhere in the 2000s, was it 2000?

884
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Was it like 2009 or something like that?

885
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:48,000
But it was it was proven through a particle collider where they they were able to detect it, you know,

886
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,000
when they have these particles and they can detect them for a very short period of time.

887
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But they know now that it's not just theoretical.

888
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:05,000
This element 115 is an actual element in the first discussions that Bob Lazar had about this.

889
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,000
He claimed that there was a stable supply, a stable version of element 115,

890
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:18,000
and that this element 115 was used to make some sort of a gravity field.

891
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And that was the method of propulsion that these crafts were using.

892
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And that they exhibited a method of of flight that is very similar to the gimbal.

893
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
The way he described it, and this is again in the late 80s,

894
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,000
that this thing would be traveling and then it would turn and rotate vertically.

895
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
And that it would then travel in.

896
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And that would be somehow another this element 115 with this reactor would create this

897
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,000
some sort of a field that allows it to bend gravity and bend space and time around it.

898
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And we described it as if the way it uses a propulsion system,

899
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
you say if you had an incredibly heavy bowling ball and you put it in the middle of a mattress

900
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:13,000
and it sort of pushes the mattress down like that's what this thing is doing to space.

901
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Instead of like firing flames out the back,

902
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:25,000
it's doing something with this element that's allowing it to travel in an incredibly fast way.

903
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:32,000
And when you listen to Commander David Fravor's depiction of that Tic Tac object,

904
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:40,000
one of the things that's incredible is that they detected this object at more than 50,000 feet above sea level.

905
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And then it went from above 50,000 feet to 50 feet in less than a second,

906
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:53,000
which is just bonkers like who the fuck knows what could do that with no visual propulsion system,

907
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
no visible, no understanding of like how this thing is moving around.

908
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:05,000
But the fact that Bob Lazar was describing that actual method of propulsion back in the late 80s,

909
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,000
it's trippy. I just I wish I wish to if he's a liar, he's one of the best liars of all time.

910
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And what a great con he's been running because he's been telling the exact same story the exact same way for more than 30 years.

911
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
It's really crazy. And you don't know what to think.

912
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I mean, I talked to the guy had dinner with him and then I talked to him on the podcast.

913
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And, you know, I like to think I have a fairly decent bullshit detector, but I don't know.

914
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I don't know. I mean, he's obviously a brilliant guy, a legitimate scientist, incredibly intelligent.

915
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,000
He would have been called out and he kind of has about his education record.

916
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
But he explained that to me and I'll explain it to you afterwards.

917
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Like what he told me that he doesn't want discussed publicly.

918
01:05:51,000 --> 01:06:01,000
But it's it's so strange that the way this guy was talking about these objects back in the late 80s

919
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,000
is exactly how we're observing them behave today.

920
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And that he was saying that the United States government had these things in their possession and they were attempting to back engineer them.

921
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
And they hired him, a propulsion expert, to try to figure them out.

922
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:26,000
So that's element 115. So when you are watching this documentary and him explaining this

923
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:37,000
and talking about area S4, which is where he was supposedly working on these things, like what what's your sense of that?

924
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I try to stay agnostic in a sense because I think probably like most people, like I want to believe it.

925
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Yeah, that's the problem. It's super interesting.

926
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
A very deep pardon me just is like, man, I want all that to be true.

927
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It's super cool.

928
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And so in a sense, that's what kind of pushes me away from it, you know, because I don't have any tools to to prevent that from taking over.

929
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Right. Like I don't have any data or anything other than just that.

930
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
But that's OK. That's what we've dealt with, I think, in the past.

931
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,000
But, you know, I think and I believe and I hope that as we move forward, we're going to be dealing with this in a new way.

932
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Right. It's going to be it's going to be about planting flags and moving the conversation forward with data and science.

933
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And there's some, you know, another reason again, this could be happening now is that there's just better tools.

934
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Our technology is getting better.

935
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:44,000
We, in a sense, have, you know, another nonhuman intelligence on Earth with us right now, right, with our, you know, our advancement machine learning and artificial intelligence.

936
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:51,000
You know, those those tools might give us information, insight into these behaviors in a way that we wouldn't obviously put together.

937
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Right. That's what ML does best.

938
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And so I see I see great I see great promise for us having a better understanding of some of these mysteries kind of when we bring in that tool to show us things that we just, you know,

939
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
our brains aren't well suited to find those patterns.

940
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So part of the problem with all this stuff is the fact that it's not openly discussed.

941
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Yeah.

942
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And I know that you were brought in for a hearing.

943
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
No, this is in front of Congress.

944
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Is that what it was?

945
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So, you know, way back when when this kind of got kicked off, I had a private meeting with members of the Senate Armed Service Committee and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

946
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And what was that like?

947
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Pretty nerve wracking.

948
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I mean, I was, you know, yeah.

949
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So, you know, it was funny.

950
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I, you know, I volunteered to do this in a sense.

951
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And I was like, Listen, I, I realized that, you know, I'm active duty right now.

952
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
This is definitely not like, you know, I can't represent the Navy here or the military.

953
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Right. I have to just try to speak as a citizen the best I can.

954
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
So I was like, I'm not going to wear my uniform.

955
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I'm just going to go as, you know, as Ryan, not Lieutenant Graves, hopefully.

956
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And I ended up getting a call at like nine thirty ten at night, the night before I was about to leave, essentially saying, get your get your uniform ready because you're now on orders to go up there to have that conversation.

957
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And you'll be in uniform.

958
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
And this was like months before I'm getting out of the Navy.

959
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So like my shoes all packed up, you know, like I'm like calling friends that like and some stuff I ship back home already, you know, like back up to New England.

960
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I'm in Mississippi at this time.

961
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So I'm calling my squadron mates at like, you know, 10, 11 at night trying to like get uniform pieces to pass together.

962
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Oh, shit. Here's the worst part.

963
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Right. So I mean, there's, you know, some very serious people in there.

964
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
One of them is a former admiral and now he's a staffer essentially.

965
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And like all the questions and, you know, having the whole conversation near the end.

966
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And he's like, he's like, so I noticed that you're missing a ribbon on your uniform because I had to have that rack right here.

967
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And there's one you get like every time you kind of leave a squadron.

968
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
They're no, you know, no big deal.

969
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
But I didn't have it. It's just like the stores were closed.

970
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I couldn't get it in time. He's like, did you leave your squadron?

971
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Did you leave your squadron on a bad note?

972
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
You know, because I didn't have that metal. Oh, no.

973
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Oh, shit. No. But he was pretty cool about it.

974
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
But yeah, that was probably the most stressful part.

975
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
You have to explain the whole thing that you didn't know you were coming in uniform.

976
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Yeah, pretty much. I just told the story.

977
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I just told you they loved it.

978
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Well, I'm sure they probably like thought it was funny that you were so nervous about it, too.

979
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm at a table, not unlike this one, but much bigger.

980
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And I'm, you know, at the head of the table here.

981
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
And on your side is like all the DOD folk and like executive branch representation.

982
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And I'm on the other side is all the SAS and intelligence folks.

983
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And I got essentially walked over by a handful of admirals that were in various roles from that point.

984
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
This was this was an unexpected part of my trip. I was supposed to just go talk to them.

985
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
But part of me coming in uniform was that I needed to have a conversation at the Pentagon right prior to that.

986
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
To what to discuss and what not to?

987
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,000
No. At the time, it was just kind of like to get, you know, a pre-brief, essentially, is how they described it.

988
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And that's all it was. There was nothing nefarious.

989
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
They really just wanted to hear it from the horse's mouth, you know, before they escorted me across the hill.

990
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And what were the questions?

991
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
What was the nature of the discussion?

992
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Which one?

993
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
When you sat down in front of everyone?

994
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Yeah, I mean, essentially, you know, what's the story?

995
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,000
You know, what do you see? And not unlike, you know, a lot of the things I told you about here, you know, did people ridicule you?

996
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Did they, you know, people tell you not to talk about it?

997
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:49,000
There was a concern, it seemed like, from those, from the non-DOD folks that they were wondering if there was any influence on me to, you know, either downplay or not talk about it.

998
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And there was none, you know, to be clear. But that was, you know, they questioned me on that.

999
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:01,000
But at the end of the day, it was essentially, you know, they seemed earnestly interested in getting the bottom of what we were seeing out there.

1000
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,000
They seemed to ask a lot of good questions that couldn't be answered in that, at that space, in that classification level.

1001
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So, you know, they were having a follow-up conversation after I left.

1002
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:25,000
But that was really the kickoff of, you know, me speaking about this in an official fashion, right, to like actual decision makers, things of that nature versus media, essentially.

1003
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Is there discussion about media?

1004
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Was there a discussion about how you were allowed to talk about this or how much of this is classified?

1005
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
So, you know, the whole boat situation, right, with Gimble, people were like, all right, we're done, talk about this.

1006
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
But, you know, that's not how classification works, right?

1007
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
There's NDAs and paperwork.

1008
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Like, so, you know, the short answer is no.

1009
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Like, this was never information that was classified.

1010
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Like, I never, you know, I wouldn't have spoke about it if it was unclassified, and yet I thought it was inappropriately unclassified and could cause, you know, natural damage or anything like that, right?

1011
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I understood it was like a new thing, but I was, at least in my mind, doing what I thought was best.

1012
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
But it was not classified information.

1013
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
It was not information at the time, right?

1014
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It just wasn't a thing.

1015
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Now there's a program.

1016
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Now there's a reporting program.

1017
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
The UAP Task Force, you know, collects reports.

1018
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Now it's a classified reporting program.

1019
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So I don't expect people that, you know, to be, quote-unquote, leaking or talking about it publicly anymore due to it being a real operation now, which is a good thing.

1020
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Have you had any conversations with anyone at a high level that gives you an understanding of what they think these things are?

1021
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Yes.

1022
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Yes.

1023
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You know, not to the specificity, I think, that you would like or anyone would like, but, you know, there are efforts standing up within DOD, with the Arrow Office, with, you know, some of the Intelligence Authorization Act language from last year and also this year.

1024
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:06,000
The language and the efforts that are being established to look into this are doing so under the context that there is a large category of other, right, that we just simply don't understand.

1025
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's, you know, we're not, the systems that are being designed and built and organizations aren't there to better understand, you know, the Chinese threat that might be off our shores, right?

1026
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Like if that's identified, then it gets routed to the proper place and then they'll go back to doing their job on the mysterious stuff that's still out there, right?

1027
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
So, you know, that's how the efforts are being organized right now.

1028
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And now what the output of that investigation is going to be, whether it's, you know, Aliens or any of the other million hypothesis is unknown at this point, but it is the mysterious.

1029
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It's not the prosaic that they're establishing these channels for.

1030
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,000
So it really is an unknown and even at the highest levels.

1031
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Other than what Commander Fravor described and what the equipment detected in terms of speed, the movement of that thing.

1032
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And then another disturbing thing was that the object, when it took off at extraordinary rates of speed after they detected it, it went to their cat point, which is very interesting.

1033
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Because they had a predetermined place where they were supposed to meet up and this thing went there.

1034
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Like it could read their plans, their intent.

1035
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Maybe I, you know, I don't have an answer for that.

1036
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
It's mysterious, right?

1037
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:28,000
It's those points aren't like clock, like super classified, but like there's there's no logical reason for that.

1038
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You know, an object like that to know where they're going in the future was.

1039
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Was is there any other instances of something exhibiting that kind of speed that you're aware of?

1040
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I hear lots of stories about that from other aviators.

1041
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I haven't personally like witnessed the gunshot acceleration that you hear about.

1042
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
What have you heard from other aviators?

1043
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
You know, one of them was up by the Pax River, the test pilot area I mentioned.

1044
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:06,000
A friend of mine that was on the East Coast with me who deployed and was used to seeing these objects was then in test pilot school and then stayed there as a test pilot.

1045
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Was out doing a mission, you know, off the Eastern Seaboard.

1046
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:18,000
And they had, you know, he had an object come up about 20 feet from his cockpit, looks similar to what's been described off the East Coast.

1047
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And he stayed there for four to five, six seconds.

1048
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:27,000
He's cruising at, you know, 350 knots, you know, somewhere in the teens, the thousands, you know, 15, 16, 17,000 feet.

1049
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:35,000
An object just stays there for, you know, a handful of seconds and then just like darts off like into the great beyond, you know, very quickly.

1050
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And he's being monitored by a whole testing apparatus, right, like a little mini NASA with all the screens and the test engineers because he's doing a real flight test.

1051
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,000
You know, the ATC, the air traffic control didn't have any knowledge of that air traffic and, you know, the test people didn't see it either.

1052
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
But he ended up reporting that through the UAP Task Force report.

1053
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
He did end up getting debriefed and was likely one of the 144 reports.

1054
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
So I tell that to show that, you know, at least at the time it was working, right, like there was a real process.

1055
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
We know that now because we've seen the evidence of it in the reports.

1056
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,000
But there's, you know, there's other cases of pilots where they just, you know, they see something in the distance and it's there.

1057
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
It's moving around in ways it can't explain.

1058
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
As they get closer, just, you know, shooting off like a cannon.

1059
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And when I was telling you earlier about the UAP off the eastern coast, that's kind of like the new generation.

1060
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:34,000
But although, you know, the the Asian aviators and the Navy, you know, they all had their own stories, you know, whether it was I mean, not 100 percent.

1061
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
But, you know, at least the ones that, you know, there are plenty that we're willing to talk about.

1062
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I'll say about that.

1063
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
You know, I can't say how many weren't.

1064
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
But so this is not a rare occurrence.

1065
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
It would happen for a long time.

1066
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Yeah.

1067
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And this one that you were just describing where it was very close to the cockpit then took off.

1068
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Was it the same thing?

1069
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
The translucent circle with the square inside of it?

1070
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:01,000
What's the earliest known sightings of that particular type of object?

1071
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:08,000
So far as I know, it's that twenty third early or late 2013, early 2014, back when we saw with the radar upgrade.

1072
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Have you seen anything visually?

1073
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I haven't been able to see it.

1074
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So we would fly up to it.

1075
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
People in our squadron would like once, of course, we knew there was something there, we try to fly up to it and see it.

1076
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And, you know, our safety limit is 500 feet, which is very close for us.

1077
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And we train all the time to come to what is called a merge where we fly right by another aircraft really close.

1078
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
500 feet is our safety bubble.

1079
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
And then we execute a fight.

1080
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And we're trained to look at their wings and see if they're they have condensation clouding in the air above their wings to tell if they're pulling a lot of G or if their flaps are auto scheduling down to say they're low energy.

1081
01:18:46,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And so even though we're going by at 1200 essentially miles per hour relative velocity, and it's really only a frame or two of information, we can make a pretty decent assessment of that other fighter and what they're going to do and their weapon loadouts and everything.

1082
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Right.

1083
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
So we have these tools that tell us where to look.

1084
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
So we're not just out there kind of gazing around.

1085
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
All our sensors are pumped into our visor.

1086
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And so as we look around, it shows us the object we have selected in a box where to look right on our visor, no matter where we look.

1087
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,000
So, so as we come to this merge, we have every, you know, expectation of having a successful merge and seeing this object.

1088
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Right.

1089
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
And then, you know, it wasn't there.

1090
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
We'd still see it on the full year.

1091
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
We still see the energy emitting from that area, but nothing visually.

1092
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
So would have.

1093
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Wow.

1094
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:41,000
So do you think that it's some of these things are not visually available.

1095
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I wish we just don't have enough data right like are they moving a little bit out of the way it's tough because again, we can only go so slow, even if we're like, all the way back like maybe 130 knots right still 150 miles an hour.

1096
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
If that thing like was right in front of us and drop down, I mean, I'd like to think that we'd still see it.

1097
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,000
But it's just, you know, it's just not the right tool to be doing that type of analysis.

1098
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You know, I mean, we just couldn't see it.

1099
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,000
So does it mean that somehow they're receiving us or does it mean that not all of them were physical objects?

1100
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
We just don't have enough data to say that.

1101
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Well, I mean, obviously, this is speculation.

1102
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:32,000
But if you guys are using this equipment out there overseas, are you flying or there are many people that are flying these types of aircrafts using this type of equipment over the continental United States?

1103
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
In the jet, you mean?

1104
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Yes.

1105
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Yeah.

1106
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Yes.

1107
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Do they detect them there?

1108
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Initially, we weren't reporting them over the continental United States.

1109
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:47,000
However, I have heard that, you know, essentially anywhere in F-18, you know, that has these radar capabilities, you know, seems to be testing.

1110
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
So we have them further inland in places like that.

1111
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And so far as I know, they've been experiencing them as well inland.

1112
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Jesus.

1113
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So is it possible that these things have some sort of a cloaking mechanism or they're not visually available to like we can't see them because of the way their propulsion system works or whatever?

1114
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Yeah, I think there's a lot of different ways, you know, that you could be visually deceitful.

1115
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Right.

1116
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Like you can.

1117
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
It doesn't have to be like a visibility cloak per se.

1118
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Right.

1119
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
But like I can think of like a lot of like tricky mechanisms that may make it very difficult to see something coming to emerge.

1120
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Right.

1121
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Even if it's just like, you know, something that can change polarity with electrical charge and like, you know, it makes it lighter or darker object or something.

1122
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Right.

1123
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Like those windows, you know, it's a physical object until you change polarity.

1124
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Now you can see through the, you know, the object in a sense.

1125
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Right.

1126
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:51,000
So there's there's trickery there, you know, that could be done and all the way from kind of basic trickery to advance, you know, invisibility science and physics with negative fraction and things of that nature.

1127
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
But but we just don't know.

1128
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
We just don't know.

1129
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:03,000
How much has this changed the way you view our place on Earth in the universe?

1130
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:10,000
You know, it certainly opened me up to all the assumptions that I think I had baked in from from birth in a sense.

1131
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And as I as I grew up that were kind of either baked into me or put into me or, you know, I put into myself that, you know, basically said anything outside of this this median channel here is is rubbish.

1132
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Right.

1133
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
In some sense, it kind of I was I was middle middle of the road, I guess you could say.

1134
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Right.

1135
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:42,000
But this really kind of made me realize that, you know, our place in the universe and in the cosmos and and even here on Earth just might not be as apparent as we think it is.

1136
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Right.

1137
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Like we that doesn't sound very exciting, but like we come in a place of confidence.

1138
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Right.

1139
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
We have this perception that, you know, we're the masters of the universe.

1140
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Right.

1141
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
We haven't seen anything else out there.

1142
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
We imagine that there's other stuff, but we have no evidence of it.

1143
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
In a sense, you know, we are the best thing that has ever been in the universe.

1144
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:17,000
So to think that there's a lot of other stuff out there for me personally, it's it's really I'd say allowed me to to better explore that kind of non-traditional mainstream, you know, thoughts in a sense.

1145
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Right.

1146
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
You know, UAP wasn't something I grew up thinking about.

1147
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:37,000
But after I kind of got over the skepticism and looked at it and, you know, just realized how much information was there, it made me wonder what else, you know, I haven't been paying attention to or what other small assumptions, even if it's not something as exotic as UAP.

1148
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:47,000
But what other scientific assumptions have we made or, you know, economic or sociological scientific assumptions that we've made that just kind of pushed us in the wrong direction.

1149
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,000
But it's right enough that hasn't caused too much of a problem yet.

1150
01:23:52,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Have you entertained the possibility that there are things that are native to Earth that are highly intelligent that we're not aware of?

1151
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Yeah, you know, I've gone I've gone down that rabbit hole a little bit and I'm not I'm not shy of going down these rabbit holes and exploring them.

1152
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:13,000
You know, so like I, you know, I have the ultra terrestrial type theory and, you know, I know you probably know more than I do.

1153
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
But I have I've heard those theories.

1154
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Can I ask you what time frame do you think that that that's that ultra terrestrial theory would come from?

1155
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Do you think that's like something that arose on Earth a long time ago or something that's more recent?

1156
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
It's a great question.

1157
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Because why would it avoid detection?

1158
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Like, what's the reason for it?

1159
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Why would it always have avoided detection?

1160
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:44,000
There's not like a historical record of these things like coming out of the ocean and flying around from a thousand years ago that we're aware of.

1161
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I don't know.

1162
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
How would it evolve?

1163
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
How would it work?

1164
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
You know, what is it doing?

1165
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
You know, how come we're not detecting them with submarines?

1166
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
How come we're not detecting them when we fly over the ocean on a regular basis?

1167
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Like, if this thing is avoiding detection, why?

1168
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Why is it doing that?

1169
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Is it observing us?

1170
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Is this, you know, you want to go really far out?

1171
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Is this what made us?

1172
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
You know, like, what are we?

1173
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:21,000
We are so different from every other life form on Earth in the fact that we wear clothes and the fact that we can communicate.

1174
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And the fact that we are obsessed with technological innovation and it seems to be the number one thing that human beings physically make.

1175
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:35,000
If you looked at us collectively, you have all these people that are working constantly.

1176
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And what's the treat?

1177
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
What's the what's the character in the stick?

1178
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,000
New or better stuff, whether it's a new or better car, a new or better TV or a new or better phone.

1179
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:53,000
One of the main reasons why people work as hard as they do, they're incentivized by technological innovation.

1180
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:02,000
They're incentivized by like if we just looked at us, if you just abandoned the idea of culture and context and what are these weird talking monkeys doing?

1181
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Well, they're making better stuff constantly.

1182
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Well, why are they doing that?

1183
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Like what it seems like that is what they're obsessed with, just like a bee is making a beehive.

1184
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Do they know why they're doing it?

1185
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Do they know why collectively they group up in these cities with millions and millions of people?

1186
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And if you watch the cars come in and out at night, it's much like blood in an artery, you know, in an artery.

1187
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:33,000
You're watching things moving back and forth and backing forth and they're creating objects, better and better objects.

1188
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
And they don't seem to be collectively aware of what they're doing.

1189
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And they distract themselves with these cultural issues and all these, you know,

1190
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:50,000
you have two completely different polarizing political parties that are constantly at odds and fighting against each other.

1191
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And all the while, they're creating artificial intelligence.

1192
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And all the while, they're creating some sort of a symbiotic relationship with intelligent computing and with artificial intelligence

1193
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:10,000
and with technology that seems to be going in a way where they're going to integrate with it.

1194
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:16,000
They're going to physically integrate with these electronic devices and with technology and with the Internet.

1195
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Like, why? Why is it doing that? Why is it not aware of that?

1196
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:29,000
That should be like the number one thing, other than climate change and super volcanoes and giant threats to civilization.

1197
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
They should be really concerned with the direction the shit is going.

1198
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:41,000
But they seem to be blissfully unaware, foot on the gas, all gas, no brakes, moving in that general direction.

1199
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Like, what if that's what we do? What if that's what this species does?

1200
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:54,000
What if this species creates technology and is essentially on its way to giving birth to a new life form?

1201
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And that new life form is a life form that's created completely out of technology that's unhindered, disconnected from emotion,

1202
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:17,000
from instincts, from all of these instincts that we have just developed over thousands of years of survival.

1203
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:30,000
All these human and animal instincts, ego, emotion, fear, lust, sexual desires, desire to accumulate wealth and power,

1204
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:37,000
all these things that have to do with primate biology and animal biology and mating.

1205
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:44,000
What if that's the future? What if the future is that is going to be the past

1206
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:52,000
and the new life forms are going to be completely unhindered by all of these problems that we have?

1207
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:03,000
If you think about war, war and disease and all of these things that we have done in terms of environmental hazards

1208
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:09,000
and all of these problems that we've created for ourselves, why we've pushed all gas, no brakes,

1209
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:16,000
towards this industrial revolution and this technological revolution and all the haphazard things that we've done.

1210
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:33,000
What if all that shit is just a byproduct of this inevitable merging of the biological life into the whatever technological life that we're creating?

1211
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
And what if those things are monitoring it?

1212
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Or encouraging it.

1213
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Or creating it in the first place.

1214
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
We have no idea what happened to the human species.

1215
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
We have no idea how the human brain doubled over a period of two million years.

1216
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
It's the biggest mystery in the history of the fossil record.

1217
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
They don't know. They don't know what the fuck happened.

1218
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
We're so different than every other animal that's on this planet.

1219
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
What if that's by design?

1220
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,000
What if there's some sort of an accelerated evolution where something has come in

1221
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,000
and just manipulated the lower primates and created us?

1222
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,000
So to your point earlier, even just to kind of reinforce what you said,

1223
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,000
our technology has moved ahead so fast and we disregard, in a sense, everything, our climate.

1224
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
But we've seen it.

1225
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Our culture can't even keep up with the technological progression.

1226
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:35,000
So our culture breaks down and fractures and is damaged as a result of the new introduced technology.

1227
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And then, ideally, our society will adapt to it and move forward and grow with it.

1228
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I think in an ideal world, that would probably be switched around.

1229
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Our culture would define what we need and what we define as important.

1230
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And then we would build tools that would help enable those things that we think are important.

1231
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I would even say that perhaps it's even a bit further down.

1232
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I mean, when you think about an artificial intelligence,

1233
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,000
which really at the end of the day is electromagnetic energy in a sense.

1234
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:13,000
So if we were to truly merge with an AI outside of being rid of all our things that ail us and our physical bodies,

1235
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
really it might be a move away from just generally space-time itself,

1236
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
which we're learning is less fundamental than we already thought.

1237
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:27,000
If there is a coherent artificial intelligence contained with a pocket of electromagnetic energy

1238
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:34,000
or some type of organization of electromagnetic energy, much like our brain outside of a skin suit,

1239
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:42,000
then we're going to lose the limitations that space-time and us operating within space-time bring to us.

1240
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:50,000
And if that evolves even further, if that sort of ability continues to accelerate

1241
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:57,000
and goes in a thousand year period or a hundred thousand year period,

1242
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,000
we conceivably would have the power of gods.

1243
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:08,000
We conceivably would have the power to control all the processes that we observe in the known universe.

1244
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Black holes, the birth and death of stars, all that stuff.

1245
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:20,000
If you think of what we can do now based on what amoebas can do,

1246
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,000
and you take that a million years in the future, and as long as we don't blow ourselves up,

1247
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
as long as we don't get hit by an asteroid, you keep going.

1248
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And you have more and more control over the physical nature of the universe and of technology and power,

1249
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
and we can harness dark energy, and who the fuck knows what the future is?

1250
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:53,000
And maybe what we're seeing is creatures or some things that have already made these leaps,

1251
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
or some version of these leaps.

1252
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Maybe they're the British explorers that land on the coast and check out the natives.

1253
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Maybe that's where they are, and maybe they're primitive in terms of what their capabilities are

1254
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:18,000
in comparison to what's possible with a million more years of evolution.

1255
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I mean, it's not going to stop. That's what's fascinating to me,

1256
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:31,000
is that our technological innovation and our lust for constant improvement of our ability to change the world,

1257
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
it's not going to stop. It's going to keep moving. So where does it go?

1258
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I think it's Professor Hanson, who's an economist.

1259
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
He looked at that, and what he calls that is a greedy society,

1260
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
where we just want to keep taking and keep building and keep growing.

1261
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
And one of the great mysteries, of course, is why don't we see alien life out there?

1262
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Because we're greedy, we expand, and we assume that anything else out there

1263
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,000
would also want to expand to gain more resources or to explore, right?

1264
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:08,000
We like to go to different places to explore, which is that a pure economic-driven thing,

1265
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,000
or is it something about our human nature that we like to discover new things?

1266
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,000
And, you know, his big thought is, you know, we don't see anything out there.

1267
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,000
And because we don't, and if we assume that we don't see anything out there,

1268
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,000
and we assume that essentially the UAP do represent other life forms,

1269
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
then the assumption is that they found a way to make themselves not greedy, right?

1270
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,000
So they stop themselves from expanding, in a sense,

1271
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
to control that weird rogue unit from kind of just expanding in a million years,

1272
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:49,000
or however long it takes for that seed of a civilization that might go out in a spaceship

1273
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
to come back and be the greedy thing that takes up the whole universe.

1274
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Well, the way to do that is to eliminate sexual reproduction.

1275
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I mean, that would be one of the big ways, because one of the reasons why people are greedy,

1276
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,000
human, especially males, are greedy because they want to be the alpha.

1277
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
They want to acquire the most resources, so they have the pick of the litter,

1278
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
so they can decide what gets done.

1279
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
They have the most power over the other entities, the other humans.

1280
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,000
If that gets eliminated, if we merge with artificial intelligence,

1281
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
or we become some sort of new version of artificial intelligence,

1282
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
the way I've described it in the past is like that we are the electronic caterpillar

1283
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
that becomes the butterfly, and we don't even know what we're doing.

1284
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
We're just in the middle of making this cocoon.

1285
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
We've just got to make the cocoon. We're busy making the cocoon.

1286
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I need an iPhone 14, making the cocoon. I need a new Tesla, making the cocoon.

1287
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:54,000
And all that innovation, it all leads to exponentially more powerful innovation,

1288
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
exponentially more powerful technology.

1289
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Ultimately, the end game is artificial life and the ability to transcend space and time

1290
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:12,000
and just unimaginable technological power, and I don't think that's possible

1291
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:18,000
unless we get rid of emotions, sexual desire, lust, greed, all those things,

1292
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
which are human things.

1293
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Those are the things that allowed us to survive when we're running away from big cats.

1294
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:33,000
We're trying to stay alive from predators, and that very desire to stay alive

1295
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:40,000
and to breed and to fight off conquering tribes, that's allowed us to innovate

1296
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
and create technology, because that's the thing that separate us from the other animals,

1297
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:52,000
is our ability to develop tools and our ability to innovate and to think and plan out

1298
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,000
how to protect ourselves, how to accumulate resources so that we can be safe,

1299
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,000
and how to develop walls and cities and urbanization and all these different things

1300
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,000
have essentially set the stage for this innovation to become a part of us.

1301
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:14,000
And the only way to separate ourselves from all of the pitfalls, all the things that hold us back,

1302
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:23,000
which are the emotions, the anger, the greed, all the things that we find distasteful about humans.

1303
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
A lot of it is tied to sexual reproduction.

1304
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,000
A lot of it is tied to our biological needs.

1305
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
If we can get past that, that's what those fucking alien things are.

1306
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,000
If you look at the archetypal alien, they have no muscle.

1307
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
They're these thin things with these giant heads.

1308
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
They have no genitals.

1309
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:57,000
What if what we're seeing, maybe it's not even physically a representation of an actual thing that we're seeing.

1310
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Maybe what we're seeing is we're recognizing the pattern, that this is where it goes,

1311
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:09,000
that this is where the upright human animal, the hominid, this is what it becomes.

1312
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,000
You just keep going, and it merges with technology, and then it becomes that thing.

1313
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:19,000
I take a little bit different view on the anatomy side of it,

1314
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:25,000
but I think of it more like maybe that's the best tool they have to interact with us at a peer level,

1315
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:31,000
is to build something that somewhat looks like us, but is different enough so that it doesn't get mistaken.

1316
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,000
It's not sneaky in a sense. They don't want to be sneaky. They want to be apparent.

1317
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Maybe that's the tool they use in a sense.

1318
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Maybe it's being made of light that we don't even recognize as a life form.

1319
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
If I was waving to an ant, it's not going to know what's going on.

1320
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Right. That could be possible, too.

1321
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,000
It could be that those things are drones, that those things are artificial, intelligent creatures,

1322
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:59,000
and that the actual intelligence that created them is disembodied in the future.

1323
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:06,000
We just talked about space-time being one of the things that drops out if we do merge with AI, potentially.

1324
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Right.

1325
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
That would make sense that if they were outside of space-time,

1326
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
they would need to construct something of space-time in order to interact here.

1327
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Brian, if this Bob Lazar story about element 115 is real and they can apply this at scale,

1328
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,000
if you have enough element 115 in a reactor that's sophisticated enough,

1329
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,000
you can travel to anywhere in the universe instantaneously.

1330
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And there's no boundaries, no physical boundaries in terms of what's possible.

1331
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I also want to believe that.

1332
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
I want to believe all of it. That's the problem.

1333
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I know.

1334
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I want to believe all of it, but I also know that there's certain elements of what we're discussing

1335
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:50,000
that are 100% in process of happening, like Elon Musk's Neuralink.

1336
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,000
When I talked to Elon about it, he was saying, you're going to be able to talk without words.

1337
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
What the fuck is that?

1338
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
He's not talking about next week, but he's talking about ultimately and eventually.

1339
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And I feel like that's where all this stuff is going to go.

1340
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
It's not going to get less sophisticated.

1341
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I was having this conversation with my kids last night.

1342
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I was saying, we're having this talk about new phones, because I have an iPhone 14.

1343
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
They're like, is it better?

1344
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
And I'm like, no.

1345
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I mean, yes, but not in any noticeable way that I recognize every day.

1346
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
The camera with the 13 was great, too. It's silly.

1347
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
And I'm like, what's funny about people is that we never are happy.

1348
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
If we just decided, this was the conversation we were having.

1349
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I said, if we just decided right now to stop making new things, we would have a pretty great life.

1350
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
If we decided, okay, planes are fast enough. Let's keep fixing them.

1351
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Phones are great. You can talk.

1352
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:51,000
You could iMessage, and you can use FaceTime. You can see each other.

1353
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
We don't need to fix that. Just maintain it.

1354
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Let's just the Tesla. Jesus, so fast.

1355
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Listen, we don't need a new car. Just like fix that.

1356
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
And just everybody just keep what we have, and let's maintain life.

1357
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
We're never going to do that.

1358
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
It's possible.

1359
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
We're never going to do it.

1360
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
We would self-destruct.

1361
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
They're like, there's just no way we could do it.

1362
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Why? Why, though?

1363
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I don't know. That's a great question.

1364
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Humans, beings need to reproduce.

1365
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
That's a lot of it.

1366
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:21,000
A lot of it is the desire to accumulate resources and power,

1367
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:27,000
and a lot of that is tied to these biological urges that are baked into us

1368
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:33,000
from the time that we really did have to survive from animals trying to eat us.

1369
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I saw a video today of this poor fucking guy who was rock climbing,

1370
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
and a bear tried to attack him.

1371
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I was like, that used to be us all the time.

1372
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
That was us on a daily basis.

1373
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Have you seen that, Jamie?

1374
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Yeah.

1375
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Fucking crazy.

1376
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Did he climb?

1377
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
The guy's got like a GoPro on, and he's climbing up this rock,

1378
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,000
and a bear comes down at him and tries to get him.

1379
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Down?

1380
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Yes!

1381
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
That's even worse.

1382
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
And so he swats it to the side.

1383
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Watch this.

1384
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
So this guy's climbing up, and look at this.

1385
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:08,000
This bear comes right out and he pushes it, and it runs back up at him,

1386
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
and he kicks at him.

1387
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:18,000
The interesting thing about bears is grizzly bears, generally when they attack people,

1388
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,000
they're attacking people because you surprise them, and it's a female with cubs.

1389
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
But black bears are often attacking people for food.

1390
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
They're predatory in the sense that they recognize that people are weak,

1391
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
and they're like, oh, I'll just eat that thing.

1392
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Because they cannibalize each other on a regular basis.

1393
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
So anything that they can eat.

1394
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Black bears, one of my friends was up in Alberta,

1395
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
and he observed a male black bear attack a female and their cubs,

1396
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:55,000
kill one of the cubs, the female scared the male off,

1397
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
and then the female ate her own cub.

1398
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Oh, damn.

1399
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I didn't see that coming.

1400
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Hard world.

1401
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
The dead one or the live one?

1402
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Yeah, the dead one.

1403
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
The dead one that the male had killed.

1404
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Once it was dead, she's like, well, might as well eat it.

1405
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Might as well eat my baby.

1406
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
She just ate it right there in front of him.

1407
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
And he's like, Jesus Christ.

1408
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
That's what a bear is.

1409
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,000
It's not a stuffed animal that sits next to your kid at night when it goes to bed.

1410
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
It's not yogi.

1411
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
That's what a bear is.

1412
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
It's not Winnie the Pooh, that thing, trying to eat that climber.

1413
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
That's a bear.

1414
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Well, here we are, strip mining our planet and killing stuff.

1415
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Oh, yeah.

1416
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
It's not too different, I suppose.

1417
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
We're not innocent.

1418
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
We're certainly not innocent.

1419
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:41,000
But my point is that I think that we have all these instincts because we are a part of the natural world.

1420
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:47,000
And the only way we can transcend that is to eliminate all of those biological urges.

1421
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:58,000
If we have true mastery over the material world and to the point where we no longer need to be hindered by those biological urges,

1422
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:03,000
that seems to me like the best way to transcend space and time.

1423
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Like the best way to eliminate all the things that kind of hold us back when it comes to logical, rational thinking.

1424
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
A lot of it is emotional.

1425
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And I think that that may be the future of the intelligent species in the universe.

1426
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:24,000
They probably don't act like barbarians.

1427
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
They probably have transcended that.

1428
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
And they've recognized that all the problems that we have.

1429
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
What's the number one problem we have in the world?

1430
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
It's probably war.

1431
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Other than the environment and what we're doing to the environment, it's probably war.

1432
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:44,000
It's the most horrific, terrifying thing that human beings will attack other groups of human beings they don't even know and try to steal their resources,

1433
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
which is generally what they're trying to do.

1434
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
They don't go to war for no reason.

1435
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,000
They're generally going to war for there's a benefit there.

1436
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Well, if we could get past that, boy, if there was no war,

1437
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
imagine the cooperation that we could have.

1438
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Imagine how much we could get done.

1439
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:10,000
If we all spoke the same language, we all treated each other as if we were the same thing living other lives.

1440
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:17,000
And we all just shared resources and worked together to make life better for the species.

1441
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Well, how would you do that?

1442
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Well, you'd have to eliminate the lust and greed.

1443
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
What's the best way to eliminate the lust and greed?

1444
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Well, to become something different and more advanced.

1445
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:31,000
And the best way to do that is to no longer have all these urges that human beings have,

1446
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:40,000
the urge to be powerful and to dominate and all of our dominator culture stuff that's just a natural part of being a primate.

1447
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
So what do we lose with that?

1448
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Everything. We lose music and comedy and fun and romance.

1449
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:53,000
We lose the best first date of your life where you lose everything.

1450
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
You lose drinking wine and laughing with friends. You're going to lose everything.

1451
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:02,000
You're going to lose all the things that we love about being the imperfect creatures that we are today.

1452
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:12,000
But what you gain is you become these super powerful, ultra enlightened beings that have different motivation.

1453
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,000
And I think that that's probably going to occur.

1454
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
It's going to probably occur in stages.

1455
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And one of the stages is probably going to be either virtual reality or augmented reality that can provide you with experiences

1456
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:32,000
that are far superior to the physical ones that you have to get on your own.

1457
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I mean, I think we romanticize so many things about our life, like that guy climbing, right?

1458
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:49,000
That guy's climbing because he's trying to get this thrill of like trying to physically take yourself

1459
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:56,000
through a dangerous course up a mountain and you get this thrill that you're doing this because if you fall, you're dead.

1460
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
And along the way, he almost gets fucking eaten, right?

1461
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Which is pretty wild.

1462
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
But we romanticize it.

1463
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:10,000
And it's baked into us in a way that it's like inherent to our physical being.

1464
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Like whenever I go on trips into the woods, one of the things that shocks me is how good I feel.

1465
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Almost like it hits a frequency that I've been needing but that's not accessible to me living in a city.

1466
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:36,000
And when I'm in the woods and when I'm climbing a mountain and I'm out there with nature, when I'm out there, I feel so good.

1467
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I feel so centered and grounded.

1468
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Like I feel better than I feel at any other time.

1469
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And it resets me in a way that's not available in a city.

1470
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
But what if that's available through augmented reality or a virtual reality?

1471
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:57,000
What if that's available through a chip that gets installed in your brain and it's far superior to that feeling that you get?

1472
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
And you recognize the futility of that experience.

1473
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,000
What you're trying to do is you're trying to recreate what it was like when people lived 1,000 years ago or 10,000 years ago.

1474
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
And you had to survive by throwing a spear at a rabbit or whatever.

1475
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
That was the only way you could feed your family.

1476
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:22,000
And you would look at that time at how difficult it was and imagine just being able to go to a grocery store and going, oh my God, that's so much better.

1477
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Grocery store is so much better.

1478
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Nobody wants to go back to hunting for food every day.

1479
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
It's too fucking hard.

1480
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:33,000
But we don't think of it that way because we have the grocery store because it exists.

1481
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Well, what if there's something that's exponentially more significant than a grocery store?

1482
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Like that life experiences itself.

1483
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:55,000
All the things that you love about life, all the things you love about romance and creation and culture and all the wonderful things that we think of when we associate the best.

1484
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Aspects of human life and human interaction and human community.

1485
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:05,000
What if that's what if that pales in comparison to what could be created technologically?

1486
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
We're going to embrace it just like we embrace phones.

1487
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
I mean, we all we all have phones.

1488
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I remember the old days where I don't even have an email.

1489
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
There was a few holdouts.

1490
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Those fucking people are all on board now.

1491
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
It just took a decade.

1492
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
It took a little while.

1493
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Took a little while.

1494
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:26,000
What if that's the future of this symbiotic interaction that we have with technology?

1495
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I think it is.

1496
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I think that's where we're going.

1497
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:37,000
And my my fascination with these UAPs and with this idea that we're being visited by these things.

1498
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I almost feel like they're cultivating us.

1499
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I almost feel like they're watching us like whatever they are that they're just making sure we don't blow ourselves up along the process.

1500
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Because one of the things that has been discussed by many people that have experienced these things on military bases is their ability to shut down bases.

1501
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:07,000
There's their ability to shut down like these nuclear facilities and that you got to think that if they were going to wonder about any one particular thing that we have access to,

1502
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:21,000
it's being in this transitionary period between having these primate instincts and applying them to spectacular technology in a brutish, horrific way.

1503
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Like we're worried about right now with Russia.

1504
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:33,000
We're worried that Putin, because all the horrific things that are happening already in Ukraine, the bombings and the drone strikes and possibly the use of hypersonic missiles.

1505
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
What if that's applied to nuclear weapons?

1506
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
What if what if we're dealing with a nuclear holocaust?

1507
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
I mean, that's that's really what we're worried about.

1508
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And I wonder if that's what they're monitoring.

1509
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
You know, you asked earlier about the why now part, right?

1510
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
But, you know, there's a lot of stuff happening, right?

1511
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
There's there's climate, there's war, there's everything else.

1512
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
It feels like we're accelerating towards something, right?

1513
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:03,000
And technology, not least of all, moving us towards, you know, some people call the singularity.

1514
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
And yeah, you know, maybe they're all here to watch the birth in a sense.

1515
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I think the hope would be that we would be part of that birth, as you described, integrate with the artificial intelligence.

1516
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I know that there's there's efforts to consider that the moral and ethical application of artificial intelligence.

1517
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
But, you know, are we fooling ourselves?

1518
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Is that, you know, are we going to have the options of maintaining an ethical A.I. once it's been created?

1519
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:41,000
You know, is it possible to create safeguards and A.I. that, you know, transition past, you know, or into the singularity and allow it to keep in mind human interest once it's already become sentient?

1520
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:49,000
If that can happen, you know, one thing that you mentioned about artificial intelligence and, you know,

1521
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:55,000
if that is the the output of our craving for advancement, you know, what does that change for the world?

1522
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:05,000
There would only be one general artificial intelligence, I would assume, because anything that would be created afterwards, if it was not a secret, would be subsumed by the primary A.I.

1523
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Right.

1524
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:18,000
You know, so this kind of ties into a thought I've had before about, you know, maybe the way we're interacted with with UAP or, you know, we're going to make the assumption that it coming from another planet right now.

1525
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:27,000
And so with that assumption, you know, perhaps as societies mature, much like you described, they do start to, you know, advance their sociological side.

1526
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
They start to work better as a group.

1527
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
They, you know, remove some of those more animalistic urges that they evolved with.

1528
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Right.

1529
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
And that remained when they got the power of the gods, if you will.

1530
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Right. Once they had technology, but were still, you know, commanded by their primal urges.

1531
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
You know, you may very well be right.

1532
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
There's that transitional period that we live in at this moment.

1533
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Maybe that adds to a lot of the a lot of the the hecticness of our current days.

1534
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:16,000
But what if those other planets, since they have realized that, you know, they interact with us as a planet, as an entity, you know, if that's the way their society has evolved, in a sense, to be more collaborative and less argumentative, then they may approach us as, you know, as a planet, the planet versus a country to country.

1535
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Right. Or individual to individual.

1536
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:24,000
They might assume that since the best things can only happen when the most people work together, right.

1537
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:32,000
In a sense, if we can assume that, you know, if you and I work together, Joe, we can do more than just if either of us worked alone.

1538
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Right. Yeah.

1539
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:41,000
If we make that assumption and we apply that to a planet, it would make sense that, you know, if there are a bunch of species out there that if they survive, they would have worked together, learned how to work together.

1540
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Right.

1541
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Yeah.

1542
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
And they might assume that of us.

1543
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
They're like, oh, wow, look, they have all these cool tools.

1544
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
They must have moved to that point where they know how to work together.

1545
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Do you think that?

1546
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I don't think they would think that.

1547
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I think they'd watch us.

1548
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
They'd go, oh, look at these crazy fucks.

1549
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Well, that's why we're anomaly.

1550
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Right.

1551
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
That's why we're anomaly.

1552
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Because we do have these tools and yet we're not ready.

1553
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Maybe that's just how it normally is when a civilization or when civilization in general advances past a point where we're at now, that there is this chaotic moment where they're sort of a combination of lower primate and higher being.

1554
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:29,000
And the power of nuclear weapons, the power to send video through the sky, and it appears on a device that you keep in your pocket that you literally talk to.

1555
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:36,000
And it gives you answers to things like I was having a conversation with my kids last night and they were talking about they went to see Little Nas X and how great it was.

1556
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
And I'm like, how old is that guy?

1557
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
How old is Little Nas X?

1558
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Bang.

1559
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Twenty three.

1560
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
It just shows you on the phone.

1561
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
How wild is that?

1562
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
You could talk to a device.

1563
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I mean, that's fucking Jetson shit.

1564
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I mean, when I was a kid, that wasn't even in Star Trek.

1565
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Even in Star Trek, they had walkie talkies.

1566
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Remember?

1567
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
It was like Kurt out and you had to like hang up a stupid phone.

1568
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Like, no one imagined the Internet even in science fiction.

1569
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And that's something that we have through the sky that is in incredible speeds.

1570
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,000
It just shows up on your phone and the battery lasts all day long.

1571
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
You watch YouTube videos all day long.

1572
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
It's crazy what we're going through right now.

1573
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,000
And we complain about it.

1574
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Battery doesn't last long enough, you know.

1575
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
We complain about everything.

1576
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
That's always going to be the case.

1577
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
We're always going to be unsatisfied.

1578
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:33,000
And that dissatisfaction is what leads to innovation because it's part of our lust and thirst for constant growth and improvement.

1579
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And which is one of the things that we do.

1580
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
I mean, think about materialism in general.

1581
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Like, what is materialism?

1582
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
What does materialism feel?

1583
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
What purpose would that serve?

1584
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,000
This stupid need for constant acquiring of objects.

1585
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Well, it serves to make sure that people make better and better stuff because that's the best way to fuel materialism.

1586
01:55:54,000 --> 01:56:05,000
If you want people to like continue this sort of fruitless desire to acquire new objects, you've got to have new, better stuff constantly.

1587
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Well, if you have new, better stuff constantly, what does that do?

1588
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Well, it fuels innovation because you have to make the things better.

1589
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,000
It's like our own stupid desire for materialism.

1590
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
It fuels technological innovation.

1591
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
It's like baked in.

1592
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
It's a part of us.

1593
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Our solutions are usually technology based as well.

1594
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Yeah.

1595
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
For everything.

1596
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:33,000
It's never about, you know, it's never about how do we, you know, how do we raise our children better?

1597
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
How do we kind of work on the personal side of things?

1598
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Because it's always what tool can we make that makes that problem go away?

1599
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Yeah.

1600
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Even when we have problems, like we have carbon emission problems.

1601
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Well, I was reading an article, I don't remember what website it's on.

1602
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:53,000
One of the scientific websites about a new concrete that they have that extracts carbon.

1603
01:56:53,000 --> 01:57:02,000
The concrete itself, the construction of concrete apparently, it leads to carbon emissions, right?

1604
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Just, you know, transportation of the raw materials and all the things that are involved in making concrete.

1605
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Well, they've developed a concrete that actually extracts carbon from the atmosphere, which is pretty wild.

1606
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:21,000
So these people that have problems, they see these problems like what's the solution?

1607
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Well, here's a technological solution for a complex problem.

1608
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:31,000
So we don't have to alter our behavior, but we'll have complex technological solutions that mitigate these problems.

1609
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Makes a lot of sense.

1610
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Yeah.

1611
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:39,000
You know, to describe how I got into flying, it was very much to fill that urge that you described.

1612
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,000
You know, when I thought about flying a jet, it wasn't for passion of flying, really.

1613
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
You know, I hadn't had access to that, so I didn't develop it.

1614
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:52,000
But, you know, I thought that was the place that I could really be at the tip of the spear as far as technology

1615
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:58,000
and how I could access it just as a regular guy, you know, with no experience or anything like that.

1616
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
So, I mean, frankly, I was driven by, you know, that same urge just went about a different way.

1617
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Well, that's one of the more fascinating things about classified military intelligence.

1618
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Because of the fact that it's military and because of the fact that there's a great benefit to the country

1619
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:22,000
for it being top secret and, you know, not being available to our enemies, we develop this stuff that we're not even aware of.

1620
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:31,000
So, our tax money goes in a way that's kind of unaccountable, and it's gigantic budget, and it's huge.

1621
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Like, what is it?

1622
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,000
How many trillions of dollars a year did we look at it the other day?

1623
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Yeah, the Defense Department budget, and we don't even know where all that stuff goes, right?

1624
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
But it's trillions, trillions of dollars.

1625
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
I can't even imagine how much money.

1626
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
It's insane how much money it is.

1627
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:53,000
And it's going towards these technologies that we don't even know about until we see them implemented,

1628
01:58:53,000 --> 01:59:00,000
like the stealth bomber, for instance, is one of them, or the Manhattan Project, or, you know, many other things throughout history.

1629
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,000
That's fascinating, too, because there's so much that's being...

1630
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:12,000
So, when I see something like these objects, these UAPs, part of me goes, like, how much of that shit is ours?

1631
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,000
How much of that shit is ours where they don't want to talk about it, they don't want to let us know,

1632
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:21,000
but they're implementing these technologies, and does Russia have something similar?

1633
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Does China have something similar?

1634
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Like, how much of that shit is stuff that's just top-secret drone technology?

1635
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Because why is it all so near military bases?

1636
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Like, that's one of the things that I thought almost immediately about the Tic Tac,

1637
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,000
because that Tic Tac thing is real close to the...

1638
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:45,000
It was real close to the Nimitz, and it's real close to all the bases that are near San Diego.

1639
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I'm like, what if that's ours?

1640
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Like, what if that's, like, some super top-secret, high-level shit that we just don't...

1641
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
We're not privy to that information?

1642
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:01,000
That's always... I don't want to call it a risk, but, you know, I think we're inclined to think like that, too,

1643
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
and we want to, because, again, we want it to be true, right?

1644
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Like, we want our government to be that smart and to have that information.

1645
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
It makes us feel safer, I think.

1646
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Oh, yeah. I want it to be like a Captain America shield that flies at, like, 10 times the speed of light.

1647
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
But, you know, where does that end, right?

1648
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Like, let's just say that's true.

1649
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Like, how much technology that could be beneficial for society via either, you know, energy production

1650
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:32,000
or ways we can't even imagine because it was designed for a particular use case,

1651
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:38,000
but whenever something, like, kind of gets out and it's exposed to kind of that innovation ecosystem, right,

1652
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,000
it's just... there's a flourishing. People use that technology in those ideas in ways that people never thought of before.

1653
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Yeah.

1654
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,000
And so it's not like you hear of something hidden away or technology,

1655
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:52,000
but imagine if all that was just, like, out in the open to be kind of meddled upon by, you know,

1656
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,000
the quantity of minds we have nowadays with the access to the tools we have.

1657
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
The problem with that is war, right?

1658
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:04,000
The problem is that we can't have that kind of technology available to our enemies because then they would use it on us.

1659
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
That's the big fear.

1660
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,000
So if we do have something that's, like, super powerful and just beyond imagination

1661
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:13,000
at this point of our understanding of what's technologically available

1662
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:19,000
and that shit gets in the hands of Russia or gets in the hands of China or gets in the hands of whoever, Iran,

1663
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
and then they use it on us before we could use it on them.

1664
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Like, we want to have the technological military superiority

1665
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:32,000
because we think of ourselves as best-case scenario of human beings on planet Earth in 2022.

1666
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Well, what if, you know, what if we've had it for a while and we've, you know, essentially blown that lead?

1667
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Yeah, that's possible.

1668
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
I mean, why are we talking about it more than because I assume that would still hold true

1669
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
unless there's been work elsewhere that has pushed up, you know, made that less relevant.

1670
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
What do you think?

1671
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I think if we're experiencing it here, it's probably something that, you know,

1672
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,000
our adversaries are dealing with and probably are working on as well.

1673
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Have they discussed it at all?

1674
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I mean, are you aware of any discussion, whether it's the Chinese government or the Russian government?

1675
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Is there any discussion at all about UAPs over there?

1676
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,000
There's a lot in Russia.

1677
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I mean, Russia has a history of UAP, just like we do in the United States, you know, from my amateur research.

1678
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
But China, too, has been taking notice.

1679
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I hear that they have been apparently working on artificial intelligence or machine learning solutions

1680
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
to better understand what these objects are.

1681
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
They've been communicating that they've been seeing a large number of these objects

1682
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
and that the sightings have been increasing.

1683
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Everything that leaves China essentially comes out of state media.

1684
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
So, you know, what are they communicating exactly?

1685
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I don't know.

1686
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,000
But that has been they have been doing looking into it.

1687
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Yeah, I mean, maybe that would be the thing that unites us.

1688
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Remember that Ronald Reagan speech?

1689
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
There's a Ronald Reagan speech.

1690
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Was it from the United Nations?

1691
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I learned about it. Yeah.

1692
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Yeah, it's a it's a wild speech.

1693
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
You've seen the speech, right?

1694
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Oh, would Russia help us or Soviet Union help us if we were attacked from out of space?

1695
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Yeah, well, imagine how quickly we would have banned our differences if we were faced with an alien threat from another world.

1696
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
And then hope.

1697
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Yeah, all the UFO people went bonkers like, oh, my God, he knows something.

1698
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Ronnie's trying to tell us.

1699
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:18,000
And, you know, that's that's I think I mean, if there was something that united us as a human race

1700
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:28,000
instead of thinking ourselves as like these individual communities that live on patches of land, you know, tribal, tribal attitudes, like the one thing that would do that.

1701
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
It's something from another planet.

1702
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Knock on wood.

1703
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:39,000
You know, we have seen mostly bipartisanship in the bills have been passing in the Congress and Senate regarding UAP activities in the United States.

1704
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:56,000
So, you know, to that point, it seems to you know, what's been happening in Congress and Senate has been very rational, you know, strong bipartisan work by both, you know, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Rubio.

1705
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
You know, they've been working together on this problem.

1706
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:02,000
So to your point, you know, I hope that continues.

1707
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I hope that is the thing that can kind of get us over all the back and forth.

1708
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:26,000
What are like what are the big there's I'm sure besides the commander David Fravor situation and some of the what have you ever heard of that's like a big instance like something crazy along those lines that maybe people haven't heard of.

1709
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Oh, I don't know what people haven't heard of.

1710
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:42,000
But, you know, some things, you know, there was a fly over the United States Capitol, it seems, at some point in the 50s, where a group of UAP were just kind of cruising over the White House and the state building.

1711
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:46,000
You can find pictures of it out there, although it hasn't been pictures of it.

1712
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Well, you know, it's like a formation of lights, essentially.

1713
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
So, you know, what is it?

1714
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Who knows?

1715
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
But essentially, is that what?

1716
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Well, that's a drawing.

1717
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Yeah, that's a drawing.

1718
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
But that looks terrible.

1719
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Also, that's the actual thing.

1720
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Wow.

1721
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:06,000
UFO sightings, a peaceful union or battlefield Earth.

1722
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
So is that a real photograph?

1723
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
So it's from the 1950s.

1724
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
This is from the History Channel.

1725
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
So this could be like a recreation.

1726
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Oh, right.

1727
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Probably.

1728
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Yeah.

1729
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
So from the 1950s.

1730
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,000
And that's a drawing for the newspaper.

1731
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Yeah.

1732
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Saucers over Washington, D.C.

1733
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Harry S. Barnes, Senior Air Route Traffic Controller for the Civil Aeronautics Administration,

1734
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:36,000
was in charge of the National Airport Washington, D.C. ART Control Center the night of July 19, 1952.

1735
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Briefly, he states in a newspaper article,

1736
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Our job is to constantly monitor the skies around the nation's capital with the electronic eye of radar.

1737
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Shortly after midnight on that date, seven PIPs.

1738
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,000
What is it?

1739
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
What's a PIPs?

1740
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Do you know what that is?

1741
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
PIPs?

1742
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Seven PIPs?

1743
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I don't know.

1744
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Seven PIPs appeared suddenly on the control center scope.

1745
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Ed Nugent, Jim Copeland, and Jim Ritchie, all experienced radar controllers, checked the observations.

1746
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,000
The airport control tower radar operator verified the same sighting.

1747
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:19,000
They were over the restricted areas of Washington, including the White House and the Capitol.

1748
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Wow.

1749
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:27,000
And there was some concern then that this was that these were Russian, right?

1750
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Because this was during the Cold War, this post-World War II.

1751
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:37,000
You know, we had gotten some of the Nazi scientists and that they went on to work for NASA and through Operation Paperclip.

1752
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,000
And then Russia had gotten some Nazi scientists as well.

1753
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:47,000
And we were concerned like with who's going to develop some sort of spaceship or who's going to get to the moon first.

1754
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:50,000
And all that shit was going on around then, right?

1755
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1756
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
And, you know, a few years, supposedly after Roswell.

1757
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,000
And, you know, people always ask about, you know, it's like, well, why haven't we seen them?

1758
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Why haven't they landed on the White House law and all that?

1759
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,000
But it's interesting.

1760
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,000
It's interesting. If you do look back, there are some interesting examples of, you know,

1761
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:11,000
large groups of objects flying over, you know, very important areas, you know, clearly making themselves known.

1762
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Well, my take on that is like if we find an ant colony, do we make ourselves available to the queen for a meeting?

1763
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:21,000
We don't give a fuck who thinks they're in charge.

1764
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,000
You know, like if they're that advanced, they can come here from another galaxy.

1765
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,000
You know, they probably don't give a shit about Biden.

1766
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Like, come on. That's so silly.

1767
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Oh, that's your king.

1768
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
But we do. We care about him.

1769
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,000
So if they wanted to influence most of our people, they might look to influencing the person we all look to, in a sense.

1770
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Or defy the power of these institutions by hovering over the Pentagon.

1771
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Exactly.

1772
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
And letting them know we control, you know.

1773
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I'm the captain now. Look at me.

1774
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
I'm the captain now.

1775
02:07:53,000 --> 02:08:15,000
This this thing with the The New York Times from 2017 and and having these these meetings with these high level officials that are concerned about these things, is this all is this moving in a general direction of transparency?

1776
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Do you think do you think they're recognizing that this is something that has to be addressed and has to be that people have to be informed about this?

1777
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Because it's so prevalent?

1778
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
I do. Yeah.

1779
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
So, I mean, that's that's what I'm seeing at this point.

1780
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:33,000
You know, I've engaged people, the Hill, and they are taking this very seriously.

1781
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:47,000
And by extension, they have pushed that seriousness back to, you know, DNI, DOD, and the offices that have stood up within their namely Arrow right now, the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.

1782
02:08:48,000 --> 02:09:00,000
From my perspective, they, you know, they have a charter to to engage the community on this, of course, not to not to put any national security at risk.

1783
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
But that's kind of another conversation, the classification problem.

1784
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
But because that's its own entity, right?

1785
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:13,000
People might think like, you know, if someone in the proper place can just declassify whatever they want, you know, it's kind of its own entity that everyone else kind of operates under.

1786
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
So it's not quite that simple.

1787
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Kind of two problems there.

1788
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:25,000
But I have seen it seems to be a real movement in the direction of engaging the public on this topic.

1789
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,000
What do you think their motivation for doing that is?

1790
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I can't say exactly.

1791
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,000
But, you know, when I when I have been pushing people to pay attention to this, you know, it's very simple.

1792
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Again, for me, it's about people are still flying by these things and almost hitting them.

1793
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Right. We can talk all day about the, you know, societal implications of what they are.

1794
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,000
But at the end of the day, the people, the operators that are flying around out there have to not hit these things.

1795
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:58,000
And so, you know, from that sense, it's it's it's hard, I think, for people to ignore that because they understand that, you know, this is a serious safety risk.

1796
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:09,000
And that as we kind of transition that new knowledge of the risk to the commercial markets and the general aviation communities, it's going to probably stir a few feathers.

1797
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:15,000
You know, the commercial markets, I think, don't necessarily want to acknowledge this because they have zero safety plan.

1798
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
They've been ignoring this for a while.

1799
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:26,000
And, you know, they might have to answer some hard questions about, you know, why they are ignoring the potential for midair with hundreds of people on their aircraft.

1800
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Has there ever been an instance where there has been a midair collision or crash that happened because of, you know, trying to avoid one of these things?

1801
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:44,000
So that's actually a better question than what I thought you were going to ask, because I thought, you know, that's a great thing.

1802
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:54,000
If a pilot sees one of these objects, right, and they have zero training on it and have no idea what it is or what to do, they might maneuver that aircraft in a way that could cause the aircraft to depart or to hurt somebody.

1803
02:10:54,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Right. And so the angle you just touched on, which is the kind of training and, you know, the policy side of it, where, you know, because we're actively not teaching pilots to deal with this, they could do something dangerous when they do it.

1804
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I thought you were going to ask, have we ever seen like an airplane crash because of midair with a UFO?

1805
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:18,000
And again, we don't we don't know. Right. Of course, there's been plane crashes, but nothing's been proven or else we wouldn't be having this conversation.

1806
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:30,000
But avoiding something would cause a real issue if you're flying 500 miles an hour and you see something in front of you and have to make an abrupt maneuver that's unplanned.

1807
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Yeah, absolutely. Or the pilot says, oh, that's just something on my windscreen because clearly UFOs don't exist.

1808
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:41,000
And then they barrel into something and it turns out to be a balloon and they lose an engine. Right.

1809
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:47,000
There's all sorts of ways you can go wrong and never like not talking about it is never the solution when it comes to aviation safety.

1810
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:56,000
But how many pilots like when it comes to commercial air pilots, how many pilots report these sort of sightings?

1811
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:02,000
And do these reports get to the Pentagon? Do they get to the White House? Like, how does that happen?

1812
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:13,000
From where? If someone's like flying for American Airlines and they see a circle with a cube inside of it that's like going, you know, the speed of sound like what what happens?

1813
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:21,000
You know, most likely the pilot will call up the air traffic controller they're currently talking with and ask them if they see the object or if, you know, there's other air traffic there.

1814
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:27,000
And the most likely answer, you know, from what I've heard is no, they don't see the object.

1815
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:31,000
And so that just kind of leaves the pilot there at that point.

1816
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
There is something that essentially says within the FAA manuals, if you will.

1817
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I don't know the exact one where it says, hey, if you if you think you've seen a UFO and actually uses that terminology, then you have the option to report it to the FAA and doesn't even like tell you an office.

1818
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,000
It just kind of like if you feel the need to report it, then that's something you can do.

1819
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:57,000
So what that tells me is that this isn't the first time that there's been people poking around trying to report on it.

1820
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:03,000
But that was really the best they could do is just say, you know, hey, if you really feel like this is important, then sure, you can fire a message off.

1821
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Right. That's kind of it. So there's no organization.

1822
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
There's no acknowledgement.

1823
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
What's this, Jamie?

1824
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
A commercial pilot that filmed something he saw.

1825
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
What is that thing you're seeing?

1826
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
It gets closer.

1827
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:20,000
So he's zooming in and there's this like black dot circle.

1828
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:24,000
What kind of looks what does it look like?

1829
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
What the fuck is that?

1830
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Is that a TIE fighter?

1831
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,000
That's a cube.

1832
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
So this was over a media in Colombia.

1833
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Whoa.

1834
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:39,000
And it got the article I found said that this was like labeled as as a UFO is all it was labeled as.

1835
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I'm trying to find the link.

1836
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Look at that.

1837
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000
It's like a cube.

1838
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Go back to that again.

1839
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:50,000
I mean, that looks like a square.

1840
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:58,000
The air crew on this particular incident, if I remember correctly, had seen the object for some time before it came in to the camera's field of view.

1841
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Right.

1842
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,000
So what's likely happening here is that the air crew are flying past that object.

1843
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Right.

1844
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,000
So, like, it's not that the object not flying down their nose.

1845
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
It's the aircraft flying.

1846
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
So they're flying close to it.

1847
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
So it might be a balloon or something that's just floating around.

1848
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Not to say that.

1849
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:19,000
But generally speaking, I think their kind of story, if I remember correctly, is that they had it.

1850
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,000
They were seeing it for a while and it was like doing something that was like strange to them.

1851
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I don't know what if it's moving or changing shape like you saw or what.

1852
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:31,000
But it was something that like completely drew their attention and, you know, pulling their phones out.

1853
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Airline pilots are not supposed to use their phone inside the cockpit like that.

1854
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Right.

1855
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
So he's breaking the rules in order to take a video of that, which I applaud him for.

1856
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:45,000
But, you know, this is exactly the type of thing that we talk about when we talk about needing procedures and things of that nature.

1857
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Right.

1858
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
He's breaking the rules in order to get data on this.

1859
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Right.

1860
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
And that's obviously not conducive to, you know, a proper investigation of this topic.

1861
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Right.

1862
02:14:53,000 --> 02:15:01,000
There was another one that was recent that was being discussed online that was taken from a fighter jet.

1863
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I don't remember what model jet where it was the same sort of a situation where someone was taking a photo.

1864
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Was the same sort of a situation where someone was taking a photo of some sort of a triangle shaped object that was in the sky.

1865
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I'm not sure.

1866
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Do you remember that?

1867
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Do you remember that, Jamie?

1868
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Yeah, I had two.

1869
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:22,000
So there's one that shows that photo like it's an artist's rendition of it.

1870
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
So it shows a real fake triangle.

1871
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I saw another one where it was filmed from a cockpit and there's a very split second.

1872
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,000
You can see something fly by and they've like still framed that.

1873
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I'll try to pull that up again.

1874
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:36,000
I'm trying to figure out which link I had it on.

1875
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:48,000
It's got to be so strange for you to go from not really having any understanding of these things to upgraded radar and then holy shit.

1876
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
You see them every day.

1877
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Yeah.

1878
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I mean, I wish it was people always ask me like, what was it like?

1879
02:15:54,000 --> 02:16:00,000
And it was never this just like come to Jesus moment where I was like, you know, oh my God, there's, you know, UAP here.

1880
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:05,000
It was very we were very, you know, pragmatic and pragmatic about it until that time.

1881
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Yes, was in the hearing, I think.

1882
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Flash by super quick there.

1883
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Right.

1884
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
And then someone took a still of it as it flashes by.

1885
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Right.

1886
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Yeah.

1887
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:22,000
So whatever that thing is just whips by.

1888
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:27,000
So this is what they were shown in a hearing in Congress.

1889
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Those pilots didn't wander up to that object.

1890
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Right.

1891
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Like they had radar on it.

1892
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
They had the FLIR on it.

1893
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
They were carrying a FLIR.

1894
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,000
The only reason they showed that was because they didn't have to declassify it.

1895
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
It was a air cruise phone.

1896
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Right.

1897
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:45,000
So there's this beast of an animal that surrounds us, which is the U.S. classification system.

1898
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
And, you know, the default is that stuff is classified more or less.

1899
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Right.

1900
02:16:50,000 --> 02:17:00,000
And so, you know, that is something that needs to be contended with by, you know, arrow by the groups actively working in this because they have to essentially work against that system.

1901
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Right.

1902
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
It's not intended to release information to the public.

1903
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
It's not why it's designed.

1904
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,000
It's designed to the opposite of that.

1905
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:14,000
What in terms of like the these images that have been released, what what to you is the most compelling?

1906
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Have you seen any of them that have been really fascinating to you?

1907
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:28,000
I have heard that there's some incontrovertibly interesting stuff floating around now.

1908
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,000
So, yes, there's like we said, in the past, there's been stuff.

1909
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:43,000
But now that there's been an actual reporting mechanism since, you know, the UAP task force started that proactive system and since then there has been recordings of things that are now floating around, you know, the general classified network.

1910
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:50,000
That's not like some buried secret that people, you know, that people with the proper access can go and verify themselves, frankly.

1911
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:58,000
And, you know, I've met some of these people that have done their own homework and they're incredibly passionate about volunteering their time to help.

1912
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Some of them are helping me within the AIA because they understand that, you know, we're entering a new realm of understanding our world, I think.

1913
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:10,000
So you've heard that there's some evidence that we're not privy to or that.

1914
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Yeah, that's general public.

1915
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:21,000
I mean, I have no doubt that there's a plethora of classified images that, you know, will give us a lot more to talk about than that frame or two that we just saw.

1916
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Do you have any hope that that stuff will ultimately be released?

1917
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I think that there is a pathway there.

1918
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I do think there is a pathway for the declassification of data so that the scientific community can better understand it.

1919
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:46,000
I have been working with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics with some of the emerging players within this landscape, I'll say.

1920
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:53,000
And we've been working very hard to see how we can, you know, the organization that we put together, how we can help those other institutions.

1921
02:18:53,000 --> 02:19:02,000
In the near future, you know, we'll be able to announce some of those collaborations so that the general public can better understand the type of work that we're going to be doing.

1922
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:08,000
What do you think the benefit for the government to release that information?

1923
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Like, why would they be transparent about it?

1924
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Why wouldn't they just continue to sort of dismiss it?

1925
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:20,000
And look, we had our little hearings and let's just go about our business and whatever we get, we'll keep to ourselves.

1926
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I don't know. You know, I don't know.

1927
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Part of me wants to say, hey, maybe it's kind of a changing of the guard of a bit, right?

1928
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:31,000
I mean, it's been a while if all the stories are to be believed.

1929
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:37,000
And it's kind of a new generation of people that kind of grew up in a more open society in a bit, I feel.

1930
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Maybe less inclined to just bury everything away for the greater good.

1931
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
And that's pure speculation, right?

1932
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:49,000
That's how I feel, perhaps, you know, as a bit of a new guard into this topic, you know.

1933
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:55,000
But at the end of the day, I don't think, you know, I don't know and I hope we find out, right?

1934
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I hope we kind of get the debrief at the end of the day one day, but I don't know if we'll get that.

1935
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Because you've been open about this and I know you did Lex Friedman's podcast.

1936
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:09,000
You've discussed this and I saw some other things about you discussing this online.

1937
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,000
What has been the reaction from other people?

1938
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Have you received more information, have people reached out to you to talk to you about things that they've seen?

1939
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Have you received criticism from discussing this openly?

1940
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:30,000
I have not received criticism for talking about it openly.

1941
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I think there was a period of time where, as to be expected, my former colleagues were treating this like a joke, like it was, you know, in the ready room.

1942
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:42,000
But Echo shut down pretty quickly from what I've heard.

1943
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:50,000
And generally speaking, you know, I've had people reach out, you know, with support, people incredibly passionate about this topic.

1944
02:20:50,000 --> 02:21:02,000
You know, I've I like the word latent demand now because in a sense all the the stories and topics and obscuration on this topic has just hasn't made people's interest go away.

1945
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:09,000
It just kind of bottled it up in a sense, at least what I hear, because I have, you know, every day people mailing me saying, you know, thank you.

1946
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,000
I can feel like I can talk about this now in like a respectful manner.

1947
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:19,000
I can, you know, I'm a professor at a college and we're going to start looking into this with the students because the students are super passionate about this.

1948
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:26,000
And so, you know, I think the younger generation is very easy to accept and integrate, you know, the possibility, I'll say.

1949
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Whereas the older guard is coming around in a sense.

1950
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:40,000
So I do think that it is possible, I would say, for like we talked about as this, you know, this technology change happens with people moving into that technology faster and faster.

1951
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:43,000
And it kind of leaves our society behind in a bit.

1952
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
I think the same thing is going to happen with this topic, right?

1953
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Like there are people that are going to be able to integrate this into their reality faster or sooner than other people.

1954
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:57,000
And, you know, much like technology, there's going to be advantages to people that do integrate that information.

1955
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:01,000
But the hope is that I think we'll get everyone there one day.

1956
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Yeah. And the hope for me is that people release more of this stuff, like the leaks that have that Jeremy Corbell has gotten about like the transmedium device and some of the other things.

1957
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:21,000
There was another one where there was those pyramid shaped objects that were flying over and it was an aircraft carrier.

1958
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Some ship. I don't think it was a carrier. Yeah. I think it was like a destroyer or something like that.

1959
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:28,000
What did you think of those videos?

1960
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,000
There's a lot of like... See if you can find that, Jamie. It's really weird.

1961
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:39,000
They're like pyramids and they're flying around like these things. Yeah.

1962
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Flashing triangular shaped object shown through a night vision camera over the USS Russell and footage leaked to Jeremy Corbell.

1963
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,000
What did you... Did you watch that footage at all?

1964
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Yeah. I don't know. You know, people, I know we're nugget down and kind of arguing about the shape of the object, right?

1965
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Triangle or not. I told people, I don't give a shit what it's shaped like.

1966
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Like these things should not be flying over a US destroyer, like, regardless.

1967
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Like, let's focus on the right things here.

1968
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:20,000
There's a sense that if something can be prosaically explained, then it must be, right?

1969
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:30,000
If there's an unknown object that has a light on it, it's impossible for it to be a UAP because UAV have lights and they need lights.

1970
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
So that's the simplest explanation and therefore everything else is negated, right?

1971
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,000
And you need to have that exceptional evidence for it to even be considered.

1972
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I don't care, right? It's near a naval asset and we don't, you know, that's our airspace.

1973
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:49,000
And whether the shape is interesting or not is irrelevant.

1974
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Like it's a massive security flaw to have objects like that flying near a ship.

1975
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:00,000
It's, you know, it's a travesty if that's what our Navy is allowing foreign adversaries to do.

1976
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
So that needs to get fixed.

1977
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:06,000
And if it's not foreign adversaries, then we need to better understand that as well.

1978
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:20,000
If you had a pile of chips and you were going to push it into like red or black, red is some sort of human based technology.

1979
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Black is aliens.

1980
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Can we say other instead of aliens?

1981
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Just something crazy. Non-human intelligence.

1982
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Non-human intelligence, something from somewhere else, whether it's another dimension, another planet.

1983
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
What do you think?

1984
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
I think there's another actor involved.

1985
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I think there is another.

1986
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:43,000
I think that there is something that is not human that is interacting in some fashion.

1987
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I don't know whether it comes from somewhere else or was here before or comes from something we don't understand.

1988
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:55,000
But there is a segment of the data that is just not explainable at this point.

1989
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:01,000
And from my experience, you know, again, not 100%, not binary.

1990
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:07,000
All right. But on the scale, you know, that's the direction that I've continued to move in based off what I've seen.

1991
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:10,000
And I haven't had any reason to go the other way.

1992
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Do you bounce around possibilities in your head of whether or not this thing is interdimensional from another planet?

1993
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Yeah. Yeah. You know, the dimensional thing is interesting in a lot of different ways.

1994
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:32,000
We obviously, you know, obviously, but, you know, we don't necessarily evolve to see reality, right?

1995
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:37,000
We evolve to survive in our environment, as we talked about before.

1996
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:44,000
And our interaction with, you know, this 3D space-time or 4D, I should say, may not be the complete picture.

1997
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:50,000
You know, we call things other dimensions or X, Y or Z, but, you know, what does that really mean?

1998
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Does that mean a consciousness that's bound in an electromagnetic, you know, pattern, right?

1999
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Is that a higher dimension or is that, you know, a life form occurring in three-dimensional space?

2000
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I don't know the answer to that, right? It's kind of a nuanced discussion.

2001
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I think that at the end of the day, we don't really fully understand our universe well enough to fit it into one of the buckets that we've already defined.

2002
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:14,000
You know, I think there's undefined buckets that could be a participant in this conversation.

2003
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Not that I say to know where they are, right?

2004
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:24,000
But I'm just assuming that there's unknowns, you know, in the makeup of our universe, whether it's the 3D, you know, 4D space-time or whether it's something beyond space-time.

2005
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:29,000
And I don't know what those unknowns are, where they could live.

2006
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:37,000
There's your classic, you know, vision of time travelers or people kind of stepping outside of our space-time into, you know, another land.

2007
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:41,000
There's also another, quote-unquote, you know, dimension.

2008
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:50,000
If we think about, you know, quantum, the quantum regime and, you know, wave functions and, you know, one interpretation has those wave functions not collapsing, right?

2009
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:55,000
And so then there's multiple realities of all possibilities happening at once.

2010
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:59,000
So there's lots of different definitions of multidimensional.

2011
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:05,000
And I think we're just still scraping the surface as it is, and we're going to learn more about where things could come from in the future.

2012
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Well, I certainly hope so.

2013
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:12,000
One of the things that gives me hope is the fact that this is discussed openly now as opposed to when I was younger.

2014
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,000
When I was a kid, if you talked about UFOs, you were kind of a fool.

2015
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:23,000
You were a silly person that was, you know, you were, you know, it's like talking about elves or, you know, leprechauns or something.

2016
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:26,000
It was dumb. Like, why are you concerning yourself with UFOs?

2017
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Those are all silly stories.

2018
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:37,000
The only one that was really compelling was the Roswell story because the Roswell story was actually reported in the newspaper that they recovered a crashed UFO.

2019
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:44,000
And then, you know, they actually flew it to, I think it was Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in two separate jets.

2020
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:52,000
They flew the wreckage to in case one of them goes down, they still have some of the wreckage in one of the one of the jets, which was amazing.

2021
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
It was amazing at the time.

2022
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
You know, but, you know, then the next day they said it was a balloon.

2023
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
It was a mistake.

2024
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
And who knows what that was?

2025
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:04,000
I mean, I don't know how much of you looked into that story.

2026
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I've read Corso's book.

2027
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Yeah.

2028
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:12,000
You know, so I've got that perspective, of course, kind of read the mainstream interpretation of it.

2029
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
But what was Corso's perspective on it?

2030
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
What did he think?

2031
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Well, he kind of broke down this whole this whole, you know, he told the UFO story as much as you could tell it.

2032
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I'm not necessarily vouching for any of it, but he really goes into, you know, details like you just described around moving things around and technologies that could have been, you know, observed things of that nature.

2033
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Again, you know, stuff almost like Bob Lazar where, you know, he's highlighting technologies and describing one way that we now recognize, you know, things like fiber optics and things of that nature.

2034
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
So, you know, I don't know where the truth lays.

2035
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:52,000
But again, it's all being clouded by this classification system, right?

2036
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Like the full story is still classified.

2037
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
What happens when you have information gap like that?

2038
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
People just fill it in.

2039
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:08,000
You know, recently there was, you know, communication about how the one of the I think it was aviation intelligence service of Gosh, was the Navy.

2040
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I forget.

2041
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:12,000
But they released a patch with the UFO on it, like a straight up.

2042
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Yeah, I saw that.

2043
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,000
And they took it down.

2044
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Then they took it down like a week later.

2045
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Did they?

2046
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Yeah.

2047
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,000
They took it down?

2048
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,000
They took it down and said it was an accident.

2049
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,000
What?

2050
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Yeah.

2051
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
How could it be an accident?

2052
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Yeah.

2053
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
That's crazy.

2054
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,000
There was a design.

2055
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Yeah.

2056
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,000
How was a design an accident?

2057
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,000
It's like a federal website.

2058
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Like, you know, just accidentally post like the wrong GIF on a website like that.

2059
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I thought it was pretty cool.

2060
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Jeremy actually made t-shirts out of it.

2061
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Yeah.

2062
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:40,000
But then, you know, kind of some of the talk was, oh, everyone got too excited about that.

2063
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,000
And you made the assumption that there's UFOs and they're doing it there.

2064
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
And it's like, well, one, of course, that's the assumption that was made.

2065
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,000
But two, that's what happens when you just hide information.

2066
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Right.

2067
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Like, don't chastise us for filling in the gaps, right?

2068
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Like, that's not our fault.

2069
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Yeah.

2070
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:03,000
I think there's a real fear of admitting that there's something that we can't control that's technologically superior to us that can visit.

2071
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:20,000
And, you know, if I was running the country, I would like to have the ability to say that we're in control of everything, that there's not some super intelligent beings that we don't understand at all that are using technology that's indescribable.

2072
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,000
And they're visiting us all the time.

2073
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
And some of them we can't even see.

2074
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:31,000
We don't even detect them until we lock on to them with superior radar.

2075
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I mean, that alone, I mean, that puts you in a position of like, well, you're not the boss.

2076
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,000
They're the boss.

2077
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:42,000
You're just like fucking general manager.

2078
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,000
You know what I mean?

2079
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Think that's that's what I would be worried about if I was going to release that information.

2080
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:55,000
If I was in a position of power, if I was an admiral or general president, I would be like, don't tell them.

2081
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
They're just going to freak out.

2082
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:07,000
I feel like our society is more adaptable and flexible now, just with the tools we have and the way we communicate, you know, and the way we can, you know, break down problems and share them digitally.

2083
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:13,000
I think now it'd be easier to integrate problems like that because it's easier for people to do their own homework and integrate it.

2084
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Whereas, you know, fifties and sixties, everyone's just circled up on the TV and just getting pumped with whatever information goes out.

2085
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Right. Yeah, that's true.

2086
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,000
That's true.

2087
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:30,000
But there's a general accepting of access to information that just wasn't the case before the Internet.

2088
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Yeah.

2089
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:35,000
And so, yeah, I think we are more adaptable, you know, society now, for better or worse.

2090
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:38,000
You know, we we have the ability to find our own tribes.

2091
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Right. And to find comfort with others that have the same ideas of us.

2092
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Whereas, you know, in the past, you were on your own island in a sense.

2093
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:49,000
And so it's hard to cultivate those ideas.

2094
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Well, Ryan, thanks for doing this, man.

2095
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Thanks for talking about this openly and thanks for coming here and discussing.

2096
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
It was really fascinating.

2097
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:00,000
And I hope we get to do this again someday.

2098
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Maybe there'll be some new information that comes out and some new revelations.

2099
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I think we will have some new information to talk about next time.

2100
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Do you know something?

2101
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Tell me now.

2102
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Tell me right now.

2103
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Would you maybe tell me off the air?

2104
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

2105
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:18,000
I will tell people.

2106
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
I can't give you a secret about that.

2107
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
It's too it's too important.

2108
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
But it's really fascinating stuff, man.

2109
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,000
And I mean, I don't know what to think of it sometimes.

2110
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Sometimes I think about it too much.

2111
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:37,000
You know, one of the things that I got out of talking to Commander David Fravor was that that I mean, I'm just guessing.

2112
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:45,000
But that instance of the seeing that thing and watching that thing exhibit.

2113
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Capabilities beyond our imagination.

2114
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:53,000
That's got to stay with you every day like that, no matter what you do, whether whatever.

2115
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:54,000
What's on Netflix?

2116
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:55,000
I don't know.

2117
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:58,000
But there's fucking aliens out there.

2118
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Whatever you think is important, that has got to be in your consciousness, like right there next to you all the time, because he's experienced something personally that very, very few human beings will ever be able to comprehend what it feels like to watch.

2119
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:38,000
And to know that that's out there and to know that all of the boundaries that we think of in terms of just propulsion systems, technology and whether or not we are actually in contact on a regular basis with something from somewhere else.

2120
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Imagine having that confidence, that knowledge.

2121
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Dave's story is incredible.

2122
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,000
To see the Tic Tac like that and hear him tell it.

2123
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:51,000
And the thing that was under the water that the Tic Tac was interacting with.

2124
02:33:51,000 --> 02:34:01,000
That's fascinating as well, that there might have been some sort of a mothership or something below the surface of the water because of the way the water was reacting.

2125
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:24,000
The transmedium aspect of this is really fascinating to me because it makes so much sense that if they could fly through space and if they have this ability beyond our imagination or maybe in tune with our imagination about propulsion systems and the ability to just move around instantaneously, why wouldn't they just go in the water?

2126
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:29,000
If they could do that, why would the water be so complicated for them if space isn't complicated?

2127
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:35,000
The difference between space and our atmosphere, it's quite the thickness difference, right?

2128
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:38,000
And so that's why things heat up when they come back from space.

2129
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:49,000
And really it's the same problem, right? If you can just do that without that happening, transition seamlessly from space to air, then it should be the same principles essentially go from air to water.

2130
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:57,000
Especially if they're doing it with some method that's similar to what Bob Lazar described of just completely manipulating space and time around them.

2131
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:04,000
You'd think if you saw that there would be some interesting detection methods you could do or maybe like a redshift.

2132
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:13,000
If you were to beam light at it and then record some of it coming back, you could see perhaps how that light shifted due to the gravitational effects or if you had a sensor on each side.

2133
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:25,000
And just like we bend light around a star or a planet, to see things behind it perhaps we could observe a bending if we had sensors on both sides, which sounds difficult.

2134
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:30,000
But when you have say maybe a bunch of fighter jets flying around, they're all in a data link pumping information together.

2135
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Over a period of time, they're going to be in that position just due to random chance in a sense.

2136
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:37,000
So it's about collecting data over time versus like getting it perfectly.

2137
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Has there ever been any discussion of devising some sort of a plane or some sort of a jet or something that just goes out to try to collect data on these things?

2138
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Yeah, I mean the area is not totally closed off.

2139
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Like you could take an aircraft over there or a ship over there.

2140
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:02,000
But that's also why we don't test equipment out there because it's just international water, right?

2141
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,000
And so that's why it's like, hey, why would we be testing our own equipment here?

2142
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Because anyone can take a boat over here and look up and start sniffing around.

2143
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:17,000
So, yeah, I don't know how to answer that question further.

2144
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Well, listen, the problem with this is I always love to come to a conclusion.

2145
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Oh, well, that's this. And that's that. Now we know. The end.

2146
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
There's no the end here.

2147
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:30,000
You're right. We haven't finished a story yet.

2148
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
But just to kind of give you from some of my perspective, this conversation is still ongoing.

2149
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I think that more resources and more energy and more people are getting involved.

2150
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I see us moving this conversation forward both technologically.

2151
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:50,000
And I think that we're going to be able to better understand not only where the objects are

2152
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:54,000
and how they kind of relate to each other and the locations and some things about that.

2153
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
But I think we'll better understand repulsion.

2154
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:03,000
I think we'll better understand some of the data that has been collected in the recent past

2155
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:08,000
so that we can move the conversation forward technologically as a society, as a people,

2156
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:13,000
and study this from all the different societal angles that it's going to need for us to fully integrate it.

2157
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:18,000
I think that in the next few years, we're going to have the proper institutions,

2158
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:22,000
both in the government and in the commercial and academic world,

2159
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:27,000
in order to fully integrate this without needing to build new stuff,

2160
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:32,000
not exposing the populace to this information and say, OK, wait for your institutions to catch up.

2161
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:35,000
I see that landscape being built.

2162
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:40,000
And I think it's going to be interesting when we have the tools within our society

2163
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
to really flesh out what this information means.

2164
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Well, I, for one, can't wait to meet our alien overlords.

2165
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:51,000
I just want to see.

2166
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:55,000
I mean, I think this is all emerging and it's really fascinating.

2167
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:56,000
I think about it too much.

2168
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Obviously, look at this place. I've got a UFO on the desk. There's one behind me. It's a problem.

2169
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:06,000
I'm working, you know, I've left my employer to start to engage in this full time.

2170
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
So I'm right with you, Joe.

2171
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Wow. So how are you engaging in this full time?

2172
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
More to be revealed next time.

2173
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:16,000
But like I said, there's a landscape spinning up.

2174
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
And, you know, I think this fall and this next winter,

2175
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I think we'll have some more open conversation about what that short term future is going to look like.

2176
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:25,000
Well, come on back and let us know. Please.

2177
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:26,000
It would be my pleasure, Joe.

2178
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.

2179
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Thank you.

2180
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Great conversation. All right. Bye, everybody.

2181
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Thank you.
