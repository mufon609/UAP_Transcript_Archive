00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello, Mr. Bigelow.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hello, good morning, good afternoon.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Pleasure to meet you, pleasure to get to talk to you,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and I really appreciate you coming on here.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
My pleasure.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It means a lot to me.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You and I have some shared interests, clearly, in the world of UFOs,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but I want to talk.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Most people know of you because of Bigelow Aerospace.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They know that you're this billionaire investor,

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and you're a very successful businessman,

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but you have a deep fascination with UFOs.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, sure do.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How did this all get started?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Back when I was about three years old, which would be about 1947,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and actually of May of that year, my grandparents had a very close encounter.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It was dramatic.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And they were taking an afternoon evening drive in the late afternoon

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
up into the mountains and coming on back down to Las Vegas,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and they saw what appeared to be at first an airplane on fire.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And the object became closer and closer to them,

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and they pulled off to the side of the road.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And at one point, then it filled up the windshield,

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and they thought they were going to die.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And at the last second, it shot off and disappeared.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I learned of this story when I was probably 10 years old,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
because I was three at the time, and my mother had told me this story.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So I approached my grandfather, and he wouldn't talk about it.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now, after all these years, like seven years have gone by,

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
because I was intrigued with it.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And so I went to my grandmother, and she only would say a few words,

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
but she wouldn't talk.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So I got the story from my mom,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and my grandfather had to sit on the side of the road there in the car

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
for a while to recompose himself.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And because they thought they were going to die,

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and then he finally was able to drive back to Las Vegas.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So that was the beginning for me.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Did he ever describe what, you said it looked like a plane on fire,

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
but what was the shape of it as it got closer?

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't recall any kind of shape that my mother described.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't recall that.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But they just knew it wasn't a plane.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They knew it was something crazy.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So in the family, the family had an event.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I lived right next door to my grandparents.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And the family had an event that kind of started things at that date.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
For me, other personal things came later.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But for the family, that was a big deal.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So this was, you said, 47?

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
47.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And 47 was the time of the Roswell crash.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
47 was the time there was a lot of UFO activity being observed worldwide.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And the speculation is that this had to do with the nuclear bombs

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and all the tests that the United States had done and Russia had done,

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and that there was a lot of interest in, obviously, in that.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Well, actually, Russia hadn't dropped any bombs by that time, right?

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It was after that.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But there was interest in our species by extraterrestrials,

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
because they were like, oh, these crazy assholes are detonating nukes.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Like, let's go take a look at them.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, you had so-called Foo Fighters during the war,

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
these lights that were following bombers.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And the tail gunners were the ones that saw them most often, of course.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And then that happened through the war.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And then, of course, Roswell.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But before that was Kent Arnold, right?

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
In about June, June-ish.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And then July 8th was Roswell.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And there's a direct uptick, though, from the Trinity experiments, right?

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think, yeah, I gather my feeling simply is that

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
without any kind of other evidence or proof, that that was a huge stimulus.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So this was around that time,

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and you had heard about this as a part of family discussions.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Right.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And so that sort of ignited the fire initially.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And I started asking my friends, as I say, when I was about 10,

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
have you any reports in your family of anything?

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And by golly, a couple of my close friends told me things that they had never told me before.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So that wasn't necessarily an exclusive event, is what I'm saying.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Other people in Las Vegas had seen things at close proximity as well.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now, your relationship to this is obviously something that you've carried for so long.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's been an obsession of yours for so long.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It started with this, but what personal experiences, if any, have you had?

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, when I was probably seven or so, seven or eight,

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I used to have what I chalked up all my life to just being silly dreams.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And I had maybe five or six of these dreams, and I could never make sense of them.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I would be laying in bed on my side, and a typical dream, always the same.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There would be three short somebodies, somethings, in a kind of monk robe.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And so I couldn't see any face, couldn't see any appendages.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And these three whatevers were standing there, and they were not too far from my eye level,

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
as far as the heights and so forth.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So these, like, child-size?

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And so there was nothing in the, I was an avid comic book reader,

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
but there was nothing in the whole genre of comic books that related to that, or movies.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And we didn't have television in Las Vegas until 53 or 54.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And even after that, it was terrible broadcasting, you know, at first.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But so it made no sense to me.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And so over my lifetime, I never mentioned it to anybody, including my wife.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You know, it's funny how you keep things secret and just kind of for no good reason.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Maybe I would be embarrassed to talk about it.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But I finally thought, well, you know, maybe it was just dreams.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Maybe it was something else.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And so that was the first event personally that I had at that time in the subject.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
When did you start to connect the idea of these tiny people

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
or human-like things with extraterrestrials?

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Well, years later, when I began to start my process as a researcher

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and as a student in the subject and began to talk with people

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
who made it their business to be experts in abductions.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And the more I got into the field and sat writing out questions for the researcher,

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
for the therapist who would be asking the questions,

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and I'd be sitting there watching the process,

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and just over time I thought, well, you know, maybe there was something more to it,

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
but I'm better off not knowing anything, so I'll just block it off and forget about it.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, we talked last night about John Mack a little bit, the Harvard...

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The great guy, yeah.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And he did a lot of these sort of hypnotic regression sessions with people

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
where they describe very similar scenarios.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, yeah, a multitude of different situations.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The abduction phenomena was very proliferate in the population, it seemed like.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Even we did a survey called the Roper Pole, and we repeated it three times

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
so that the margin of error was really reduced to like one, one and a half percent.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And abduction researchers came up with the ten questions,

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and so we distributed that, and the conclusion was a fairly relatively sizable percentage

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
of the population had some kind of experiences according to them,

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
according to the researchers, and according to the poll.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I am not qualified to speak to the accuracy of whether the questions were that relevant

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
to the conclusions or not, but that's what they said.

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And I had, in my own research, found people that I put them through a regression,

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
not personally, but I found a hypnotherapist that could do that,

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and I found a number of people just here, there, scattered around, maybe somebody in my own staff,

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and they would come up with these stories and these events.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
One of the criticisms of John Mack and hypnotic regression in general

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
is that the idea that you can put a memory into someone's head,

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
that you could suggest things and you could create false memories.

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And this was something that I've read in the criticism of his work,

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
that this style of hypnotic regression and bringing up these very specific scenarios

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
to a bunch of different people, you can sort of help create,

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
especially in people that are easily influenced or people that are open to suggestion,

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
you could put these false memories in their head.

151
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And so, especially when you're dealing with something as fantastic as a UFO

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
or alien abduction or visitation or something like that.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's definitely possible.

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There's also something called screen memory, but dealing with, first, the power of suggestion.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's absolutely true.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But my experience was with different hypnotherapists, they went out of their way.

157
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
In fact, maybe if they did make a suggestion, it was just the opposite.

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They might say, okay, you're on board this craft.

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You know, where's the lighting coming from?

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Is it coming from the corner of the room that you're in?

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, there were no corners, and they'd be corrected right away

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
by the person being hypnotized.

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And so, they went just the opposite direction on purpose to make suggestions

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
to maybe coax the person to come that direction, and they wouldn't do it.

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The person wouldn't do it.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Now, screen memory is different.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Supposedly, if somebody has a very close encounter with supposedly somebody that's ET,

168
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
you leave that the memory turns out to be entirely different,

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and that's put into you consciously,

170
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and you recall something entirely different than what actually happened.

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Maybe you saw two deer on the road or something of that sort,

172
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
or maybe there were owls or whatever.

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So that's what's purported to be.

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What's crazy to me is if you go back to Betty and Barney Hill,

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
if you go to Travis Walton, if you go a lot of these abduction experiences,

176
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
people that did not know each other,

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and particularly we're talking about before social media, before any of this stuff,

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
they have very similar stories, similar to a disturbing extent.

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, well, Betty and Barney Hill was accidental.

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think somebody had, Betty or Barney had a sleep problem,

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and they went to try to get some therapy for a sleeping disorder.

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I think there was some kind of connection like that,

183
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
but it didn't have to do with, oh, my gosh, we have this recollection.

184
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The story evolved through the therapy,

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and in order to try to fix this other problem,

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
all of a sudden this story starts just to flow out,

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and so I don't know whether it was Betty first and then Barney later,

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and I think Barney resisted going under hypnosis, I believe,

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and then everything just started pouring out.

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There's a woman named Angela Hill.

191
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
She's a top UFC fighter, and she's actually the granddaughter of Betty and Barney.

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No kidding.

193
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's crazy, and I didn't know about it until after we did a conversation.

194
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I was interviewing her, just talking to her about her fighting career,

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and at the end of the conversation, when we were done wrapping up and about to leave,

196
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
she's like, oh, I forgot to tell you,

197
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and then she tells me that her grandparents were Betty and Barney Hill.

198
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What?

199
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's amazing.

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That was her grandfather.

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Did you inquire? Did you ask her?

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, we talked about it, and she didn't have much of a memory of him,

203
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
but her parents recalled the scenes that he described,

204
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and obviously it became this huge national story.

205
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I remember hearing about it when I was a kid.

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Sure.

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It was in the 1950s, right?

208
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes.

209
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
There was no archetype that you would sort of model your memories after.

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I would wonder, if I ever did hypnotic regression today,

211
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I would be very skeptical of my own memories,

212
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
because I've heard so many stories of these spaceship encounters.

213
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I've talked to people like Travis Walton.

214
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I've talked to people like Bob Lazar.

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I've talked to these people that have had these experiences with these things.

216
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I would think that my memory might be tainted by my expectations,

217
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
but you can't say that about Betty and Barney Hill.

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There was no stories like that before then.

219
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This is not some pop culture thing that they were latching onto,

220
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and even the way they described these creatures,

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
the similarities between their descriptions and Travis Walton's descriptions,

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
20 plus years later, it's very eerie.

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Right.

224
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And the same thing with Ken Arnold's sightings.

225
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That was virgin territory back then in 1947.

226
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Can you explain that to people?

227
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, Ken Arnold was a pilot.

228
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's in that movie Phenomenon, right?

229
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Isn't it described in that?

230
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Maybe so.

231
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The Phenomenon?

232
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Maybe so.

233
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And so he was flying over Mount Shasta or somewhere in Washington there,

234
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and saw these objects, nine objects, kind of skipping along in formation.

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And he, being a professional pilot, was able to estimate their speed,

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
calculate that, and they were traveling way too fast for conventional aircraft.

237
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And the shape that he described was, I've always thought of them

238
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
a little bit of a manta ray shape without the tail,

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
kind of a little bit of a curved boomerang kind of shape to the craft.

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And that got an awful lot of attention because he was a very credible fellow,

241
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
as were other people that later revealed their own sightings, military backgrounds,

242
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
people that had major rank or captain rank.

243
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So they had stories you would listen to about their experiences

244
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
because they were professional observers in the military.

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And actually while we were out eating dinner last night,

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Dan Crenshaw sent me a text, and I shared it with everybody at the table,

247
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and it's from American Airlines pilots that saw some spectacular sighting

248
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
over the last couple of days.

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And they're trying to figure out what the hell these people saw,

250
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
but something that sped by them at some insane rates of speed,

251
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and there's a recording of them discussing it.

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Whether it's abnormal or conventional,

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
that should never have happened in that proximity to that aircraft, right?

254
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So if it were an accident, that's a really bad accident to come that close.

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And if it were flying in the line of flight,

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and it sped that fast over its head, it was really moving.

257
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah, well, what does a conventional commercial aircraft go, 400 plus miles an hour?

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
American Airlines pilot reports seeing UFO.

259
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
An American Airlines pilot reported seeing a long cylindrical object

260
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
flying right over the top of the plane as he was flying.

261
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Sunday's American Airlines flight AA2292 was operating from Cincinnati to Phoenix

262
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
using an Airbus A320 aircraft over the northeast portion of New Mexico

263
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
at 37,000 feet during what was otherwise a routine flight.

264
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
One of the pilots contacted air traffic control at Albuquerque Center.

265
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
He said, do you have any targets up here?

266
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We just had something go right over the top of us.

267
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I hate to say this, but it looked like a long cylindrical object

268
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
that almost looked like a cruise missile type of thing

269
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
moving really fast right over the top of us.

270
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So what's missing is propulsion signature, right?

271
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So that should have been evident that it had some kind of propulsion.

272
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Some kind of exhaust was going on, right, you would think.

273
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They could detect that if it were in the line of sight, if they were behind it.

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's a very short description, though.

275
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I mean, maybe it did have some sort of propulsion that they saw.

276
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's all we saw.

277
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I mean, maybe there's a report that'll come out where they describe it in detail.

278
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's just them calling it in, right?

279
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah, if it's not super unique, then it was one hell of a mistake, right?

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, I mean, but it's just, yeah, there's a lot of those.

281
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's the problem.

282
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
There's a lot of these, and there's video of them.

283
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Like the one, what is it, the one that's on the East Coast

284
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
that's moving over the surface of the water at insane rates of speed.

285
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And you see it also, no heat signature, no obvious method of propulsion.

286
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And it doesn't exhibit, because that one was done, I believe it was infrared, the camera.

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So you should have been able to see some exhaust or some heat signature

288
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
that was showing how it was being propelled at that insane rates of speed.

289
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And you hear these pilots who are used to flying, they're flying fighter jets.

290
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And they're like, holy shit, look at this thing.

291
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And they're kind of freaking out.

292
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Well, the good news is there are so many more people with cameras and with cell phones these days.

293
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And so you have a much more aware public than you did, what, 25 years ago in 1997

294
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
was the so-called Phoenix Lights.

295
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah.

296
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And they weren't just lights, because that craft started from northern Arizona,

297
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
some say maybe Clark County, Nevada area,

298
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and proceeded down south toward Phoenix in the twilight of the evening

299
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
where thousands of people saw structure.

300
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It wasn't just lights.

301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It wasn't just, could it be confused with flares, dropping aircraft, dropping flares.

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And no such things had occurred anyway at that time that day.

303
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And so people saw structure.

304
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And the structure was estimated, what, quarter of a mile maybe from tip to tip,

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
boomerang kind of shape, kind of craft.

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And yet that should have been a really big deal news-wise.

307
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Right over a major city, so many observers, but it wasn't.

308
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But it was, though, right, because we all know about it.

309
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Well, but then, of course, the governor at the time was Fife Syrington.

310
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And we know now that he didn't know what to do,

311
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
because he was an actual witness that he admitted to 10 years later

312
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
of actually being a witness.

313
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But he didn't know how to address that at the time.

314
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Well, that was the famous press conference where he had a guy dress up like an alien

315
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and made a mockery of it.

316
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Exactly.

317
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Had just, if he had done just the opposite,

318
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
what might have happened on that with his testimony as being a witness,

319
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
a governor of a state, and then draw that,

320
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and other people then might have come forth more in more volume of folks

321
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
saying, yeah, me too, I saw how I saw it.

322
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
With your understanding of the way the government sort of processes

323
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
this kind of information, that it's not available to everybody,

324
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and the information in terms of what these things are,

325
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
what they aren't, whether or not they're some sort of top secret aircraft

326
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
that the government is working on, or whatever it is,

327
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
they don't, unless they're making press conferences about these things,

328
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
they don't necessarily want to broadcast what it is.

329
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And they certainly don't want to broadcast it if it's not one of ours.

330
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Do you think that they contacted the governor

331
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and informed him that he needed to make a mockery of this?

332
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Or do you think it was his own personal decision?

333
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
My feeling is it was his personal decision.

334
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And my feeling is that the government is not that organized anymore.

335
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Maybe it was back, some quite a while back,

336
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:01,000
but I don't think that, I think that denial is able to be carried forth

337
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
without government encouragement.

338
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So he probably did it just to calm everybody down.

339
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
He probably felt tremendous pressure, right,

340
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
because I remember this was an enormous story.

341
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I mean, it was going all across the United States,

342
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
people were talking about it,

343
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and there was all sorts of sort of semi-reasonable explanations

344
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
about dropping flares.

345
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The thing about the dropping flares, though,

346
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
were that they hovered in the sky for a long time.

347
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Like, it didn't make any sense that flares, like, are they defying gravity?

348
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
How are they just, because there's video footage of it

349
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
from multiple sources, home footage, where people are filming these things,

350
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
where there's these red lights that are just hovering in the sky.

351
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But the red lights coincided with these triangular-shaped vehicles

352
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
or boomerang-shaped vehicles that other people were seeing.

353
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Well, there were people living on Camelback Mountain,

354
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and this is how low this craft was to the surface,

355
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
is that they got an edge-on view coming practically at them,

356
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
just slightly over, it went over the mountain.

357
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But there's no video of that, right?

358
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Not that I, I don't know.

359
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
There could be, I don't, I've never seen that.

360
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And this was 97.

361
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
97.

362
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah.

363
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, see, that's, you know, phones back then,

364
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
not everybody had a phone, and they didn't have good cameras.

365
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Right.

366
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The thing about even today, you know, with cameras,

367
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and most cell phone cameras aren't capable of seeing things at a zoom.

368
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
With the exception of the Samsung Galaxy series, the new ones,

369
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
they actually have a setting where you can take photographs of the moon,

370
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
because they have some pretty spectacular zoom capabilities.

371
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's pretty interesting stuff.

372
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And if you got one of those, and you saw something in the sky,

373
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
maybe you could zoom in on it and get a good shot of it.

374
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But, you know, you're talking about things traveling at insane rates of speed.

375
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's very far away.

376
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah.

377
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You're really not going to get much anyway.

378
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
No, no.

379
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's got to be much closer to really have definition of what it is you're looking at.

380
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Now, there was a story quite recently of a pilot in a fighter jet

381
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
that took a photograph of some similar shaped object,

382
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
some triangular shaped object, and apparently it was a very clear image.

383
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It was a very clear image, and there was some speculation about people releasing this,

384
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and that they were going to release it, and there was hesitation about releasing it.

385
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Do you know about this?

386
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Well, is that the one off the East Coast?

387
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Real recently.

388
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
No, I'm not familiar with that.

389
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Do you know what I'm talking about, Jamie?

390
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I think we discussed it with...

391
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The picture that you can, like, see they zoomed in on it?

392
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The picture apparently is bullshit.

393
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That picture apparently is not real.

394
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But there was one taken by a pilot in a plane a couple, two, three years ago, sometime.

395
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh, a different one?

396
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah.

397
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
See, this is a Pentagon response to release a photo taken from Navy pilots showing unidentified objects.

398
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I had heard that this was nonsense.

399
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I heard from people that are in the know that this is not the image that they're talking about.

400
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The one they have...

401
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
This is according to people that are in the military.

402
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The one they have is much clearer than this.

403
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
There's more than one image, right?

404
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I don't know.

405
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We may be talking about different ones.

406
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Maybe. I don't know.

407
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Okay.

408
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Sorry. Breaking.

410
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Debrief Media has learned the leak of an unclassified photo said to have been widely distributed in the intelligence community,

411
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
which purportedly shows what the DOD has characterized as unidentified aerial phenomenon.

412
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I don't know if that's...

413
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Look, obviously I'm just talking out of my ass.

414
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But what I had heard was that that was not the image in question,

415
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
that there was a much, much clearer image in question that was pretty stunning,

416
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
that they were debating on whether or not to release.

417
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Because once the New York Times in 2017 published that front page article

418
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
that showed some of those images that had been captured from the video cameras

419
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and that fighter jets experiences and talked about Commander David Fravor's experience

420
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
with the Tic Tac UFO off the coast of San Diego,

421
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:01,000
that sort of like released a lot of pressure on the concept of...

422
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If you discuss these things, you're a foolish person, right?

423
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
For a long time, and I'm sure you must have experienced this

424
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
because you've been in the game for a long time, right?

425
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Discussing UFOs in 1970 or in 1980,

426
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
like people would look at you like you're probably crazy or something, right?

427
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I was too busy being in business in those years.

428
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You didn't care?

429
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I had a little plan I was following that I had put together when I was a kid,

430
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and I was on a mission to be in business, to acquire resources,

431
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
so that I could someday have fun chasing this stuff.

432
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, that's one of the more interesting things about you.

433
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You became like a hotel tycoon and a real estate tycoon,

434
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
gathered up all this money so that you could study UFOs.

435
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And do fun things maybe in space.

436
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah, well, you've also been involved in creating shelters and structures

437
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
that people can actually live in in space.

438
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Right.

439
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Does the Genesis and the Genesis...

440
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Well, we call it the B330 is what we have on our plant right now,

441
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
is engineering units, which are flight units,

442
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
as far as hull and bulkheads are concerned, and lingerons.

443
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And so we had to shut down because of the COVID,

444
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
but we have very advanced structures.

445
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah, and these have been implemented too.

446
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Some of them have actually been, you've actually put these things...

447
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
We have a TRL-9 because we have a structure,

448
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
scale structure that's on the ISS now.

449
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah, so your dream in a lot of ways of getting involved in aerospace

450
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and space travel, this is real.

451
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You're a guy who actually has contracts with big government...

452
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Not that I've ever made money back.

453
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's been a bottomless pit.

454
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Has it been?

455
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah, sure.

456
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So you've just done it as a passion.

457
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well, maybe a hope and a prayer kind of thing.

458
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Hail Mary's.

459
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And part of it is because of your obsession with extraterrestrials.

460
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I don't know.

461
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't know.

462
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Probably there's a connection there because you're made aware

463
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
that there's a whole lot more out there than what we know and what people think.

464
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So there probably is a connection.

465
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It always was.

466
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Do you have any images of that?

467
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Let's pull it up so people can see what we're talking about,

468
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
the stuff that you've created.

469
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, so this one...

470
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So that's an older version that we did quite a long time ago.

471
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We have a full scale.

472
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's just a one-third scale.

473
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Basic architectural features and accommodations for living.

474
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Space habitat.

475
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah, I think those are full scale architectural renderings.

476
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Now, down at the bottom...

477
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Okay, so that's full scale.

478
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That one right there?

479
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah, that's an old version, but that's a full scale.

480
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:29,000
That's 330 cubic meters, and it's a more crude mock-up than what we have now.

481
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And the standard volume on a module for the ISS is about 120,

482
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
or the largest is around 120 cubic meters.

483
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So 330 is about almost three times that.

484
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So when you design one of these things or when you go into business

485
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
to create one of these things, what's the steps that you're taking?

486
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Do you contact engineers?

487
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
How do you decide that you want to go into business to make these things?

488
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And how do you go about implementing it?

489
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So it's been a 20-year process.

490
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And first you try to engineer.

491
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
In fact, nothing about the origination was original with me.

492
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Because I became incredulous about what NASA had done in the early 90s

493
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
with something called the Trans Hat.

494
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And it was a vehicle to take people to Mars.

495
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And Congress cut the funding for that.

496
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And oh my God, how could they do such a thing?

497
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Because it was very apparent that that craft was really cool for a lot of reasons.

498
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And so I started the company, started putting money in it, and started going after that.

499
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And then after about three years acquired a license,

500
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
exclusive license to use their patent just for the enclosure.

501
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
No book of instructions came with it.

502
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
There wasn't a manual saying here's how you do this.

503
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And so we started from scratch.

504
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And we had no assistance from NASA whatsoever in arranging architectures and engineering.

505
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And then through a process of trial and error and testing and testing and testing,

506
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
destructive testing, long duration leak tests,

507
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:37,000
destructive because you had to try to quantify the strength of the materials.

508
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And we were using factors much more demanding than the factors for metallics,

509
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
factors of four instead of metallics maybe one and a quarter or something.

510
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And we finally engineered envelopes that were very durable.

511
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Ballistically, we did a lot of what's called hypervelocity impacts tests

512
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
where you shoot a particle at about seven kilometers a second, six to seven,

513
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
depending on the type of gas gun you're using,

514
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and seeing how well the structure can defend against something going that fast.

515
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Actually, the defense on something going fast is easier than a particle going slower,

516
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
like a bullet, for example.

517
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Kind of crazy, but for some reason that...

518
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And when you mean defense, you mean something like micrometeors or space junk?

519
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah, actually smaller than that.

520
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Maybe the size of a centimeter,

521
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:47,000
which is actually a big particle historically to hit something like the station or whatever.

522
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I think maybe some of the solar rays have been hit by something that large.

523
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So you're defending against also radiation.

524
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Aluminum structures are not what you want to be inside,

525
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
especially for deep space missions outside of LEO, low Earth orbit.

526
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And there's something called secondary radiation that propagates.

527
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So background galactic radiation has heavy protons and it's more lethal.

528
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So what did you do to shield your habitats from radiation?

529
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Well, the hull has no aluminum structure.

530
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And the hull is a matrix of many layers of different kinds of materials.

531
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And those materials are like Kevlar or Vectran.

532
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We use Vectran for a couple reasons, but it's like Kevlar.

533
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And so through a series of other materials in addition to that type of material,

534
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
you start to evolve a shield.

535
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And the shield on a B330 overall is about 15 to 18 inches thick.

536
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And there are spaces in between layers.

537
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So it's not as though you compress it and it's going to be a foot and a half thick.

538
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But it's those spaces that make a difference and how debris breaks up

539
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and finally just becomes dust.

540
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Or if it's too fast and too large, it's not dust.

541
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's going to succeed on going through.

542
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And when it does, is there a patch method that you use to...?

543
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
First of all, you have to maybe locate...

544
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
There could be things on the hull that are in the way

545
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
because you use the hull as an attaching surface.

546
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And so that volume is very useful.

547
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And so assuming you've located it now, and it depends on the size of the particle.

548
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
If it actually was significantly large, it'd blow off whatever was attached to the hull.

549
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Maybe just put another hole right through whatever was attached.

550
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So it'd be easier to find the hole.

551
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's the good news.

552
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Bad news, the gas is escaping a lot faster.

553
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So you do have some time, though, in a large volume, for that gas to totally escape.

554
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So then you have to make a judgment as to do you have time to create the patch.

555
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And it's actually a fairly simple process because anything you put there wants to stick to the wall, right?

556
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But depending on a basketball-sized something, there's not an explosion.

557
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It doesn't go, boom, like a balloon.

558
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It just loses gas, your air.

559
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And so you'd probably have time to go to the airlock unless you were on the potty or something.

560
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So you'd have to escape.

561
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You'd have time to escape.

562
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But that would be the move. You really wouldn't be able to make a big hole.

563
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah, you'd want to be able to go someplace else.

564
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Hopefully you're attached to something that can accommodate whoever's on board.

565
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Why did this become your area of specialty when it comes to aerospace?

566
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Why did you invest in this? Why did you invest in habitats?

567
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Well, at first I played around with some other companies.

568
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I invested in two or three other companies in the late 90s.

569
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
One, they were rocket plane type companies.

570
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I came very close to investing in what Burt Rutan was creating before Virgin came along.

571
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And so I was looking for someplace to go, somewhere to put capital, money, and energy and passion into something.

572
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And so I did these investments in these different companies, and then I stumbled on the Transhab.

573
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So your initial idea was maybe some sort of commercial space travel type investment,

574
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
something like Virgin Galactic or something like...

575
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yeah, I really didn't know.

576
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I think the most enticing thing was what Burt was working on.

577
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And the financial model for that was very attractive.

578
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And I think he was, of course, he's an aircraft design genius.

579
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
He has so many awards, you hardly can count them.

580
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
As you walk down the hallway to his office, it's like floor-to-ceiling plaques.

581
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You got a couple extra just for souvenirs or something.

582
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And so he's a total genius.

583
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And he, by the way, had his own UFO sighting that has stayed with him all his life.

584
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
How old was he when he...

585
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't know.

586
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You'll have to get that story from him, but it's worth listening to.

587
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So many people have.

588
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So anyway, that's how I started in that.

589
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And I fell in love with the concept of expandable systems,

590
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
launching something with a finite fairing diameter and length

591
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:13,000
and being able to triple the size of that volume once it's ejected and it's launched.

592
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And the fairing opens up, and now you start to expand and inflate.

593
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And wow, all that you can do with that volume is really cool.

594
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So this allowed you to...

595
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I mean, these contracts, if you're doing it with the ISS, are they with NASA?

596
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Is that who you work with?

597
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Yeah, NASA basically has been the only game in town for us and for most folks.

598
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Most folks in the rocket business, other than for the Air Force who buys launches for satellites,

599
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
NASA is the game still.

600
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And when NASA's financially hurting, everybody hurts.

601
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Depending upon who is providing the leadership, both in Congress and in NASA and in the White House,

602
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
you can do fantastic things.

603
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So it's all a combination of whether or not people can all work together.

604
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
If they're fighting in Congress and going on, you're not going to go places like you could.

605
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So with you being involved in this and creating these habitats

606
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and your longstanding obsession with UFOs and potential alien life,

607
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
getting involved with NASA must have been pretty exciting.

608
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You're like, well, maybe I'm going to learn something now.

609
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Oh, definitely. You're definitely going to learn. Absolutely.

610
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
They have a lot of good people and very expert people.

611
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So you're going to learn a lot.

612
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It's a great place to sponge all that you can.

613
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I mean, learn things about UFOs and alien life.

614
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh, that. Oh, that. Oh, no, I was back.

615
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I was back about, you know, space, conventional space travel.

616
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Well, that too.

617
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Basically, you're not going to learn anything about UFOs and ET from the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of the scientific community.

618
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And that includes NASA and everybody else.

619
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Are they not interested?

620
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I think it's a combination of things.

621
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I think the reason for that is not because they're not not interested.

622
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And a lot of people are because I'm asked things all the time.

623
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
A lot of people are. I think there's always the concern of embarrassment.

624
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I think they're not in a position to be an investigator.

625
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
They might have a passion and want to do that, but it takes time.

626
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It takes time and effort to go do those things.

627
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And usually you want to stick to what your career is. Right.

628
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So then maybe they they've had somebody in their family that has had a tremendous story.

629
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And so they'll carry that with them.

630
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And they might be they might buy the books they keep at home.

631
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,000
They might brown bag it, you know, not bring it to the lunch at commissary where other people can see what you're reading.

632
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Right. You know, so it's all different kinds of things.

633
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So everybody's different. Right.

634
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So there's kind of a maybe a shame or something along that line involved in pursuing extraterrestrial ideas.

635
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Not as much as it used to be. Right.

636
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Now, it was much worse 20, 30 years ago.

637
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What was it like then?

638
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Well, as I could speak to, you know, just the general science population was much more reticent to to talk about UFOs 30 years ago.

639
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I think than today, there's been so much more exposure on the media.

640
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So because you have regular television program now on aliens, ets, ancient aliens, whatever, doesn't matter.

641
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's all over the place compared to 25 years ago.

642
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So it's a it's a different kind of world.

643
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But the thing about the UFO et subject as you continue to do research and and work in that whole community is a kind of a strange frustration about acquiring a little bit of a taste of understanding about the possibilities of locomotion of movement.

644
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And where we are, we're still working with fire engines, you know, and thank God for people like Elon and Jeff Bezos.

645
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I really respect those guys.

646
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And including Elon's secret weapon, Gwen, you know, his president, those are the country is so lucky to have them.

647
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:05,000
But the the dynamicism of UFOs and ets is so overwhelming as to what that world is like.

648
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And if it's all true, or even some of it true, it's more than just a holy cow.

649
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's oh, my God, you know, so it's like night and day comparison.

650
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And and here we are still in 2021 and still waiting to get back to the moon.

651
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Well, I think when we we were talking earlier about the New York Times article, I think that was a real pivotal moment in the culture's acceptance of the concept of these things.

652
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Because when you see something like printed on the front page of the New York Times, you know, when you see like people like Commander Fravor, you know, very well respected, you know, all full respect.

653
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
No one no one thinks that guy's a kook. Oh, no, you read about his experiences and you go, OK, there's something to this.

654
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah. And Leslie Keene, the journalist that did that article, did a terrific job.

655
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Fantastic job. Just fantastic.

656
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And it's a dangerous subject for someone. Yeah, it is.

657
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You're you're open to ridicule. Sure.

658
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:13,000
But the preponderance of evidence had gotten to the point where there was enough out there we could say, listen, this is not something to be mocked anymore.

659
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
There's something to this. Right. That's right.

660
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:24,000
When you have you have like Commander Fravor and we hired Doug, one of the pilots there, we learned about that in 08.

661
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The event happened in 04.

662
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So you have really credible people seeing something that's totally anomalous and has no business doing what it's doing.

663
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Right. So you got to take it really seriously.

664
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Oh, yeah. Things that have been tracked by instrumentation, things that have gone from it's like 80,000 feet above sea level to one foot in less than a second.

665
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And then traveled to the agreed upon destination where the plane is going to go later.

666
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
They knew it knew where they were traveling to.

667
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It was able to travel at an insane rate of speed.

668
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That's not even it doesn't make any sense with any technology that we've ever even theorized.

669
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
No, no.

670
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So these are these are things that were tracked by instrumentation.

671
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So it's not this is the best instrumentation.

672
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
This is instrumentation that's used by the United States military to protect the board.

673
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It's all the real shit.

674
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So when you read things like that in the New York Times, everybody has to kind of go, huh?

675
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah. Okay.

676
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And then you couple that with hundreds of thousands or millions of other events and stories that have happened over the last 50, 60, 70 years.

677
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You think, oh, my God, we're so far behind, you know, of what else is going on.

678
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Right. Because we've been so afraid of ridicule.

679
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
How long is it going to take us to get to that point?

680
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Right. You know, and do we even understand the even the beginnings of the physics of it?

681
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Because what if their consciousness operated?

682
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
You know, that's it. You don't have the right signal.

683
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Middle signature isn't going anywhere.

684
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Nothing is coming on now.

685
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
There's no lights that the dash didn't light up.

686
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Right. So sort of like when you walk up to your car like I have a Ford F-150 when I get near it, it knows I'm there because my key fob.

687
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Sure.

688
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You know, when I touch the handle or like a Tesla is a better example.

689
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If somebody else has your key fob.

690
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yes.

691
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's going to light up.

692
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But instead of it being like a Tesla key fob, when you get to it, the handle opens up so you can open the door.

693
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Right.

694
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Because you get close to it. It's pretty cool.

695
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah, sure.

696
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But instead of that, it's actually your consciousness.

697
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yeah. And what if you're not even close to it?

698
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah.

699
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
What if you're on the other side of the planet and you want it to start?

700
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Like you can with a car with an application.

701
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Like if you have a Tesla, you could roll your windows up with the app.

702
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You could lock it with the app. Right.

703
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It operates through Wi-Fi.

704
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Who's to say they can't do something like that with with consciousness?

705
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yeah, we have no idea.

706
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I mean, it's not even that's not even outside of what makes sense.

707
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:21,000
You know, if you if you looked at like if you followed the technology and the technological improvements over the last 15, 20 years and you explored the possibility of what could be done in the next hundred or a thousand or a hundred thousand years.

708
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah, that's not even crazy.

709
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yeah.

710
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Well, in our physics, physics is incomplete, in my humble opinion, because it doesn't provide answers for all the paranormal basket.

711
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Not not just what we're talking about with ATUFOs, but all the all the other kinds of stuff that has done and has been done in laboratories for many, many years on camera by by people that have performed really strange things.

712
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You mean like quantum mechanics and.

713
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
No, no, like micro macro PK something just take something simple.

714
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
What is that?

715
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Well, just just manipulating material objects, whether they're electrons and and so or or a bottle cap.

716
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And so you're let's say you've got a screen computer and you've got it's hooked up to a random event generator and which is flipping a coin, you know, many, many hundreds of thousands of times a second.

717
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And it's establishing a firm even line this 5050 across your screen.

718
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And then there's another line coming along.

719
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And your challenge is to is to have the two lines deviate.

720
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So you're you're and I don't know.

721
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's been so many years since I was in the para lab with Bob, John and Brenda done.

722
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I forget the exact details on this.

723
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But the point was there was a line that was created a second line that you were to think about and try to deviate that line.

724
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And you should not be able to do that at all.

725
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So they have maybe a one flat line on the screen.

726
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And then you had this random event generator that should be 5050 right alongside that same line.

727
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
But it's not.

728
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
You're causing it to go up or you're causing it to go down.

729
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And they had a lot of people successful on this.

730
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Many, many, many.

731
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And they did just a huge number of trials that were successful.

732
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So that's in the smallest context.

733
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You had one of that Russian woman, Caligna, something like that was her name that worked with objects in a bell jar.

734
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And she would be able to manipulate them, cause them to spin, cause them to lift and objects.

735
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What kind of object?

736
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Small objects, you know, something, something small.

737
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Microscopic.

738
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
No, no, no, no.

739
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Like a bottle cap, you know, something that size.

740
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So some sort of telekinesis.

741
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Macro PK.

742
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So it's some kind of a consciousness connection that is causing the effect, that effect on that object.

743
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
This is something that's been filmed?

744
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

745
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So this woman is doing what?

746
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And she died at a relatively young age.

747
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Her heart, they said, would go up to like 180 beats or 90 beats a minute.

748
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
While she was doing this?

749
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yeah.

750
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And she was just...

751
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So this is this lady?

752
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh, your guy is good.

753
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
He's the best.

754
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
He is the best.

755
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So what is she doing here?

756
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Well, she's...

757
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Oh, this is like really old stuff, huh?

758
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Oh, yeah.

759
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Oh, yeah.

760
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
She's moving...

761
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What are those, matches?

762
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Yeah.

763
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But she's also moving that piece of metal.

764
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Right.

765
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And there's other ones where she would do this and these things would be in a bell jar, I believe.

766
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
So she's not touching it.

767
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
She's making it move.

768
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Yeah.

769
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And I think they literally wore her out.

770
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
What year is this?

771
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Like 60s or before that even?

772
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah.

773
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Here's my problem.

774
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
This is something that's on the table.

775
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Right.

776
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I can't see below the table.

777
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I can't see if there's a magnet.

778
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I can't see what's underneath this deck of cards.

779
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
There's a piece of metal.

780
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And you can move things around with fuckery.

781
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I don't know if this is real.

782
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And those matches were moving because that piece of metal was moving the matches, right?

783
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So the piece of metal was plowing the matches and she's got it moving around.

784
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I'm not buying into this.

785
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But on its face...

786
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah.

787
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It's really intriguing.

788
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It's intriguing, but it's a party trick.

789
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I don't even like the way it's set up.

790
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
The way it's set up on a table and she's doing this with her hand and her lap is right there.

791
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Anything could be happening there.

792
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It's cool if it was real.

793
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Right.

794
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And that looks really old.

795
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
What year is that?

796
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I don't know.

797
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Probably 50s.

798
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah.

799
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I don't know.

800
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So the point really is if you were to make it a job to accumulate this kind of information

801
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
from as many sources as possible, you'd really have a large volume of stuff.

802
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And then you'd have a lot of material to look at and analyze, not just one case.

803
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I think it's easy to look at one case and have doubts because it is just once.

804
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It is one situation.

805
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Do you think that things like psychic powers or an understanding of other people's thoughts

806
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and ideas, these are maybe possibly emerging aspects of human beings?

807
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:27,000
As a human evolves, as we go from being a tree-dwelling primate to being what we are today,

808
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
where people are intuitive and we can sort of read social cues and we understand each other

809
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
and we can talk and communicate using sounds and noises, that as the human animal evolves,

810
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
they'll eventually develop some sort of a psychic power.

811
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So in a way that's connected to supposing that those psychic powers already exist to some degree.

812
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Maybe in some people more than others.

813
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Right.

814
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So that means there are white crows, like we talked about last night.

815
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah.

816
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Okay.

817
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Can you explain that concept to people?

818
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
No.

819
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
There shouldn't be any white crows.

820
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
White crows aren't white.

821
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So there shouldn't be any anomalies like that.

822
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
So if you come up against a white crow, you've really found an anomaly.

823
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So now the question is why?

824
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
How did this happen?

825
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Well, it's an albino, right?

826
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
It's just a genetic aberration.

827
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So it's a metaphor.

828
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Right.

829
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So it's a metaphor saying you've really come across something that shouldn't be.

830
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
A rare thing.

831
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It shouldn't be.

832
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Right.

833
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
There's no way this should happen.

834
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Right.

835
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Right?

836
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And oh my gosh, here's another one.

837
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And it's a cousin.

838
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's different.

839
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's in a different area of the whole side basket.

840
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
What's going on here?

841
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Well, we already know that there are extreme variations in intelligence.

842
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
We know that there's people that are just not that bright.

843
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And then there's people like Elon Musk.

844
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And these people like this have existed forever.

845
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Well, he's not from here.

846
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
We know that.

847
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
He's not from here anyway.

848
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah.

849
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Most likely.

850
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
If there's an alien amongst us, that's him.

851
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Right.

852
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But I mean, if you go back to Nikola Tesla, it's sort of the same sort of situation, right?

853
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
You know, he was clearly of not just superior intelligence, but superior vision.

854
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
He had this ability to look at things that didn't exist and figure out a way to create

855
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
them.

856
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Right.

857
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And that's a very unique thing.

858
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And what is causing that?

859
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
What firing of neurons?

860
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:24,000
What personal experiences combined with education, combined with innate creativity, makes a

861
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
person create something?

862
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But that's not as paranormal.

863
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
No, it's not.

864
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But it's a different aspect of being a human being.

865
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Now, we all know that some people are more intuitive than others.

866
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Some people are more sensitive than others.

867
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Some people are better at understanding.

868
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Some people are really good at picking out liars.

869
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Some people are really good at picking out talent.

870
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
They understand people better, right?

871
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:55,000
As a human, as the human animal evolves, we could only surmise that those types of skills

872
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:02,000
and those types of qualities that a human being can possess could possibly get better.

873
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
If you get two very intuitive people, they have a child, and that child is even more

874
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
intuitive than them.

875
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And that some aspects, unprovable, unmeasurable aspects of psychic power could be something

876
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
that's emerging out of the human animal.

877
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I would never say never.

878
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And I think a lot is possible.

879
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I think what may more likely would happen, because we're shifting now to taking normal

880
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:42,000
human physiology, which is a separate situation from being able to perform things that are

881
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
more unique than just being creative.

882
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So I think that you might have small circuitry and small things that are added to the human

883
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
brain to enhance its capabilities.

884
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Like neurolinked.

885
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah.

886
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And that's much more likely in terms of human evolution than that future generations are

887
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:19,000
going to become enormously psychic and enormously cause and effect using consciousness.

888
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,000
So whether it's clairvoyance or telepathy or psychometry, micro, macro, PK, remote viewing,

889
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
the whole basket, those are all real, and they have all world-class performers in every

890
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
one of those things.

891
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Remote viewing is a great example of this, because we know for 20 years the CIA and the

892
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Army had programs in this, and so did the Russians.

893
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Right.

894
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And we talked about remote viewing last night, too.

895
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I'd done an experiment on a show that I had, and it wasn't effective at all.

896
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
But that could have been that the person that was doing the remote viewing was a fraud,

897
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and that maybe there are people that do have that ability.

898
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Now, has it ever been clearly demonstrated that someone can do that?

899
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Have you seen it personally?

900
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh, yes.

901
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Well, I've hired somebody to do it twice for me, but I've also-

902
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And what do they do?

903
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Have friends that ran the programs.

904
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
What do they do?

905
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
The people that you hired?

906
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I tasked him to describe a longitudinal latitude location and describe it, what was the surface,

907
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
what was underground, those kinds of things.

908
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And they were accurate?

909
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Yeah.

910
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
How accurate?

911
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Very accurate, and gave me information that, to this day, I don't know if it's true or

912
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
not, because it was underground information that I don't even know.

913
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But that came as a, here, here's a bonus, and I'll tell you what's underneath.

914
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So, the government had these programs, these secret programs that they were studying remote

915
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
viewing, but their official conclusion was that it was horseshit, right?

916
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Oh, no.

917
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Wasn't it?

918
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Oh, gosh, gosh, no.

919
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Not in public?

920
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
No, that was never concluded in that way.

921
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
What did they say publicly about remote viewing?

922
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Did they ever say it's 100% effective and real?

923
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I think there would probably be at a point in time it was classified for a long time,

924
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,000
okay, and then it became more public eventually as a program aged and so forth, as things

925
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
usually do.

926
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:31,000
To be 100%, you could acquire, by having more than one viewer have the same target, you

927
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
increases the likelihood of the accuracy of the information.

928
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
100% is a lot to ask for, because you're getting a drawing at the same time you're

929
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
getting conversation, and sometimes the drawings revealed more than the conversations did.

930
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So, the remote viewer would also be in a position as an experiencer.

931
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So, if his or her target was at a certain location that, and the person was eating an

932
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,000
orange, for example, a remote viewer could almost taste it, could almost hear the gravel

933
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
that the person was walking on, feel it under their shoes that they're walking.

934
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
What was the methodology?

935
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
How would they go about doing this?

936
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:23,000
So, first of all, the aspect of this is though you're over the person's head that you're,

937
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
so we have to go back and say there are different kinds of remote viewing, first of all.

938
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So, I'm just taking one type, where maybe your target is a person, and the person is

939
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:39,000
at a location, and maybe the location is a wharf, a boat dock, there are a lot of boats,

940
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
and maybe there are gravel pathways getting there, maybe they're having a fruit in their

941
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
hands, an orange, apple, whatever.

942
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And so, the remote viewer is back above the head, kind of like an out of body experience

943
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
is the way that those are reported, and you're watching yourself going down, we can talk

944
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
about that later, going down a hallway, but you're above yourself.

945
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Same way with remote viewing sometimes, they would be in that kind of a position.

946
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And so, did you describe everything in your drawing?

947
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Maybe not.

948
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Well, then you didn't get 100%, did you?

949
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
But you were spot on as to where they were.

950
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You could go find that location, and that's actually where they were at that point in

951
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
time, that was true.

952
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
That's exactly where they were.

953
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So, they were able to figure out where people were, and they were able to get a sort of

954
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
an understanding of what they were doing, and how they were doing it, and what their

955
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
surroundings looked like.

956
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That's the tip of the iceberg.

957
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
The tip of the iceberg.

958
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
But what was the methodology?

959
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
How would a person remote view?

960
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Would they be alone in a room?

961
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Would they have to achieve a certain state of meditation?

962
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Like, what did they do to do this?

963
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So, they would be in a room, and with a control, per controller, I forget the terminology now

964
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
that they use.

965
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So, the remote viewer would be there, at a desk, and pad, and paper, and there would

966
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
be the person sitting across as a controller.

967
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And then at the appointed time, and it depends on how these remote viewing sessions were

968
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
constructed, I think.

969
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
The real people that you should talk to are the guys that ran the programs.

970
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I'm just, you know.

971
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I talked to Ed Daines.

972
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
That's the guy that I talked to.

973
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
The only guy.

974
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I would recommend people like Hal Putoff.

975
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
He would be a very, very good person to talk to on this.

976
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So, how would someone learn how to do this?

977
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And who figured it out initially?

978
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Don't know who was necessarily the first.

979
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
You have early players like Pat Price and Go Swan.

980
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I think Helen Hammond.

981
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Joe McGonigal.

982
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Those kinds of folks.

983
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
And I'm not sure of the genesis of how it began.

984
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
A lot of times things happen by accident, right?

985
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And you stumble on something and say, oh, wow, what just happened?

986
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Right.

987
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But it has to be some sort of repeatable skill, like something that you could teach someone

988
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
how to do, right?

989
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Yeah.

990
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And I believe what I've been told is that most people have some degree of abilities that

991
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
are beyond the five senses.

992
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And some have more of those abilities than other people.

993
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And so, it can be taught and built up and developed, but some people are more predisposed

994
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
to certain kinds of stuff than other people are.

995
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And so, how would they train people to do something like this?

996
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Who was the first person to figure out that they could do it?

997
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And then, how do they train other people to do it?

998
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Joe McGonigal has a book.

999
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I think he authored it back in 1993.

1000
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And he had, I believe, a near-death experience about 1970ish, 70.

1001
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And, I mean, there's a lot of literature out there on the shelves that people can buy.

1002
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
They can get a hold of this stuff without having to talk to these fellows and these people.

1003
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And the stories are amazing as to what they can do.

1004
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And purportedly, distance is irrelevant.

1005
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I mean, you could do something thousands of miles away, and that could be the target.

1006
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And you can describe that target.

1007
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It doesn't have to be on the surface.

1008
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
It can be a building.

1009
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It can be inside a building.

1010
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
It can be inside a room.

1011
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I mean, it just really gets strange.

1012
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
And so, you have actually experienced this, and you are 100% on board with remote viewing.

1013
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
You think it's real.

1014
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Well, I've experienced it to a wee extent.

1015
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I hired a fellow to do it twice.

1016
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But he did it.

1017
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
He did it.

1018
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That's not wee.

1019
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
That's pretty big.

1020
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
If the guy did it, he did it.

1021
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And I sat once.

1022
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I got to sit behind a screen on a computer to play around a little bit.

1023
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
So I don't have any real experience with this.

1024
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I just have a lot of admiration for the people who manage the programs and who can function that exercise.

1025
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
It's really amazing.

1026
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
There's an old story about Ingo.

1027
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Swan.

1028
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
He's passed over.

1029
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I can't say that.

1030
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
He's passed over.

1031
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
You don't say he's passed.

1032
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
He's passed over.

1033
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Well, now you know where my thought is about things.

1034
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Well, I do know where your thought is about things, but I just want to get to that, too.

1035
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
But the way you describe it, he passed over.

1036
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Oh, there's a story I love about Ingo.

1037
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
He's being tested.

1038
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
As always happens, you're trying to verify, verify, verify, right?

1039
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Trust, but verify, verify.

1040
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Always.

1041
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And you're doing exactly what you should be doing, is questioning.

1042
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Always questioning.

1043
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
And so he's being tested by officials.

1044
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And they have a submarine that is his target.

1045
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
He doesn't know what his target is, of course.

1046
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And it might even have been a blind or double-blind situation, I don't know.

1047
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But they go to a lot of efforts so that maybe even the person that's with you doesn't know what the target is.

1048
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
That's usually the kind of protocols.

1049
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And he identifies the sub.

1050
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
He identifies the sub accurately.

1051
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And this is an advanced sub that he's identifying.

1052
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
So it's underwater.

1053
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's deep, and he's able to see this thing and describe it.

1054
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
So it makes them pretty uneasy.

1055
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And they're impressed.

1056
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
This is like, wow, this is a big deal, this guy.

1057
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So it's not like, just how is he doing this?

1058
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It's like, he did this.

1059
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So they're calling the meeting kind of to a close.

1060
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,000
He says, well, don't you want to know what's following it?

1061
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Duh, right?

1062
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
See, then he starts describing this other craft that's following behind the sub.

1063
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Ingo was an amazing guy.

1064
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
And what was the other craft?

1065
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I guess it was some kind of UFO, something else that wasn't another sub of ours or Russians or anybody's.

1066
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,000
That's one of the speculations about unidentified flying objects is that they're not just flying.

1067
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
That some of them actually exist underwater.

1068
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
There's been many sightings of things that went into the ocean.

1069
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
What do you think of that?

1070
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Well, supposedly, aren't there stories even about Christopher Columbus' crew and so forth

1071
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
seeing things going back for centuries, things coming in and out of the water?

1072
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Well, that was part of the tic-tac, the Commander David Fravor's encounter,

1073
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
that there was something below the surface of the water that was creating a wake almost like rocks.

1074
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah, well, it was churning.

1075
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
It was churning.

1076
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It was a very large thing.

1077
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,000
And that it went under as they approached and the tic-tac craft faced them.

1078
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And that, you know, they don't know to this day what that thing was that was under the surface,

1079
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
but that's what led them to go and investigate in the first place.

1080
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And as they were going towards it, that's when they realized that there's this thing,

1081
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
like, you know, roughly the size of this room that's floating around.

1082
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Yeah, well, in that carrier group was a ship or two that was bristling with electronic equipment.

1083
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And it's the first thing that sensed something out there.

1084
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And that's when I, my understanding was, and I'm going back a long time now,

1085
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
was that that's when they were launched to go check it out.

1086
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Because what was out there shouldn't be out there and behaving the way it was behaving

1087
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
according to all the electronics on this ship that was part of the battle group.

1088
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Right.

1089
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:53,000
You know, with the aircraft carrier, I think a couple of subs, it was a battle group.

1090
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And so, and then they had eyes on the target now.

1091
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Yes.

1092
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Right. So they're able to see firsthand for themselves what's going on.

1093
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Yeah.

1094
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And when they were speaking over the mic, they had found out that they had been encountering these things.

1095
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Yeah.

1096
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Over the last, because when Commander Fravor was inquiring, like, what the hell is this thing?

1097
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Yeah.

1098
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
The other end was saying, look, we've been seeing these things over the last few weeks.

1099
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
No one knows what it is.

1100
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yeah.

1101
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Yeah.

1102
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
But like, what do you do about that?

1103
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
What do you do about something that...

1104
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I think sometimes better left alone.

1105
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah.

1106
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:32,000
If you know they're really behaving fantastically and they're not the Russians or Chinese or whatever,

1107
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
go have a sandwich.

1108
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Forget about it.

1109
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Well, I don't think they have a choice.

1110
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I mean, you can't catch it.

1111
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It's literally jamming your radar.

1112
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You have images of it.

1113
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Right.

1114
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
You know you're tracking it and they're moving in a way that is literally impossible with our technology.

1115
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Right.

1116
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
And what do you do?

1117
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Yeah.

1118
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
You can't do anything.

1119
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
What, are you going to go to war with it?

1120
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
What are you going to do?

1121
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Are you going to try to grab it?

1122
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And it's not like it's offensive.

1123
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Right.

1124
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
It hasn't tried to attack you or do anything.

1125
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Right.

1126
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
They've done nothing.

1127
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Yeah.

1128
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Yeah.

1129
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,000
It's a very strange situation to be in, to be a fighter pilot with the most sophisticated military equipment

1130
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,000
and to encounter something that is beyond the scope of even imagination of what's possible.

1131
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Right.

1132
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Yeah.

1133
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:23,000
You had encounters with Bob Lazar.

1134
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You know Bob and you were around when Bob Lazar first came.

1135
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Now, is this going to be all about the Mylar Balloon event?

1136
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
What's the Mylar Balloon event?

1137
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Oh, you don't know that one?

1138
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
No.

1139
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So, we all jump in my car to go out to the Alien Inn area out there, you know.

1140
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
The Alien Inn is that?

1141
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Out there.

1142
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Yeah.

1143
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
It's like a bar or something.

1144
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
North of that area.

1145
01:09:53,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And so, Bob Lazar, George Knapp, myself, and I think Gene Huff, who is Bob's friend, we all go out there.

1146
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Well, and be known as to me, Bob has a Mylar Balloon, which really bounces the radar signature a lot for its size.

1147
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
And a bottle of gas.

1148
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Helium.

1149
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
So, we find our way back out in the desert out there.

1150
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
We're kind of, I'm thinking we're on a UFO watch, which is always fun.

1151
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Sometimes the best thing is the food you take along.

1152
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Right.

1153
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And you're out there under the stars, and it's nice, and you have a good time.

1154
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Just watch it.

1155
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So, but there's a rustle of things going on here.

1156
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And next thing I know, there's a balloon.

1157
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
This Mylar Balloon's inflated, and there's a slight breeze, and Bob lets it go.

1158
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
And we're on the opposite side of the mountain range from supposedly S4.

1159
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And he wants to go that way.

1160
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Thank God, the wind was going in the opposite direction.

1161
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It was traveling north instead of south.

1162
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
And it went the wrong way.

1163
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
So, I'm thinking my life's just passed before my eyes.

1164
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Why do you think your life passed before your eyes?

1165
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Because if the balloon goes towards area S4, it's going to get picked up.

1166
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
And then they're going to go find out where it came from.

1167
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And Wackenhut security is going to come get us, and I'm going to spend the night in jail.

1168
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Right.

1169
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
So, it all just unraveled real quick.

1170
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And was this before Bob had gotten in trouble for bringing people to the observation point to watch?

1171
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Because let's tell a story about Bob real quick.

1172
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Bob said he worked for area S4, and he was hired to back-engineer what they believe were alien crafts.

1173
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Along the lines, he had this top-secret clearance, and along the lines of all this happening, they're monitoring his phone calls.

1174
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Turns out Bob's wife is having an affair.

1175
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Bob doesn't know about this.

1176
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
They remove him from the project because they believe he'll be emotionally unstable.

1177
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:00,000
So, he's freaking out, not knowing, A, that his wife is having an affair, not knowing why he's pulled from this project.

1178
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
He doesn't totally understand.

1179
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So, he starts telling people about what he's doing, and telling people, listen, I can take you to a place where once a week they do these tests.

1180
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So, he starts bringing people to this area.

1181
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:21,000
They see these objects flying in these spectacular ways that we really can't do with any of our conventional aircrafts, and then Bob gets in trouble for that.

1182
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Then Bob goes on the George Knapp show and starts explaining all these different things, presumably for self-preservation.

1183
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Because the best way to probably protect your own life is to go public with this and explain everything that's happening.

1184
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And they can discredit you and make you look like a nut, but if they kill you, then it leads credence to your story.

1185
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Yeah, it gives you a huge hardship if they kill you.

1186
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
So, when do you fall into this story?

1187
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Well, you've just given me an overload of information now that I'm pretty much aware of, but I don't know exactly when.

1188
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I don't think, as I recall it, everybody was pretty much at ease, and it wasn't part of...

1189
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
What year is this that this is all going on?

1190
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Oh, God. I don't know, 91?

1191
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
So, this is around that time? When was he on George Knapp's show?

1192
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Somewhere in that time frame. But I wasn't aware of a lot until...

1193
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I don't think at that time I was aware of him taking people out on Wednesday nights to go see something out there.

1194
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I kind of missed out on that or whatever, and I don't think this was anything connected to that.

1195
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I think that was before this.

1196
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Yeah, probably.

1197
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I think you're dealing with him after he had met George and after he had told his story.

1198
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Because George is with you.

1199
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Oh, yeah.

1200
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Yeah, so obviously they had already met.

1201
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Oh, sure.

1202
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
So, what was your initial...

1203
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Obviously, you're a person that has a deep fascination with UFOs.

1204
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Now, here you are talking to this guy who's clearly a genius, brilliant guy, Bob Lazar, and he's telling you this fucking banana story.

1205
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:18,000
He's out there back-engineering spacecrafts that came from another land that are using this element 115, this stuff that's just a theoretical element.

1206
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
It wasn't even proven by particle collider until, what, 2013?

1207
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Somewhere along that line? It was just theoretical up to that point.

1208
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
So, he's telling you about all this stuff.

1209
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
What was your... What did you think?

1210
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I wanted to reserve judgment until I knew a lot more.

1211
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:49,000
And the more he talked, the more interesting it became, the more research that George did, things that he uncovered, it became more interesting.

1212
01:14:49,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And so, as I said a while back, I think George was doing an interview with me, and I said, I wouldn't bet against Bob's, the truth, or the majority of everything that Bob has said.

1213
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I wouldn't bet against it.

1214
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Could they be errors and omissions for different reasons?

1215
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Yeah, sure they could.

1216
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:33,000
But I would tend to say Bob is legitimate, and there are certain aspects of things that are parts of stories that you wonder, well, how could this happen, and so forth.

1217
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:43,000
But I think if you take all of the collective information and the work that George Knapp has done to validate things, it's awfully damn impressive.

1218
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:52,000
But George is such an important part of it because he's a legitimate investigative journalist, and that was his career, and so he poured himself into this.

1219
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And exposed all the different aspects of this story that seem to indicate that he's telling the truth.

1220
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
And that's what's crazy about it.

1221
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And George is not any normal journalist. He's like what? He has like six P-bodies.

1222
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Yes, he's fantastic. So he's diving into this, and the more he uncovers, the more it seems like Bob's story is legitimate.

1223
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Right, right. So I think until you, I like the philosophy of reserving judgment until you have a preponderance of evidence that really moves you one way or another.

1224
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
You don't have to have 100%. I go by reasonable doubt.

1225
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:44,000
But what was it like for you to be this guy who's had this deep fascination with flying saucers, and here you are talking, let me tell you my experience with Bob, doing the podcast with Bob.

1226
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I wanted one of two things. I wanted to go, oh, this guy's full of shit.

1227
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Or I wanted, whoa, this guy's, it seems like he's not full of shit. I think he's telling the truth.

1228
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I think this guy really did encounter these aircrafts and really did work on these spaceships, whatever they are.

1229
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:08,000
That's where I'm at right now. My experience with him, my communication with him, he didn't seem like he's full of shit at all.

1230
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:16,000
He's clearly a brilliant guy. His story has not changed at all over the 30 plus years that he's been saying it.

1231
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:34,000
It's a crazy story. But when you are a person like yourself, you so meet even more than I, who is obsessed with this subject, the possibility of alien life that's visited this earth and maybe even left crafts behind.

1232
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And maybe these crafts are in the possession of some secret government agencies that are trying to observe them and back engineer them.

1233
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
What is it like to talk to this guy? Because this guy has seen the thing you're looking for.

1234
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,000
You're searching and all of you're wondering and staring out into the heavens.

1235
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And here's a guy that has actually touched it, actually worked on it, been inside one, tried to figure out how they work, can't do it, doesn't understand it.

1236
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:09,000
He's talking to these people. Everything is compartmentalized. You've got the metallurgist people that are working on what kind of alloy this thing is made of.

1237
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
You've got him who's a part of the people that are trying to understand the propulsion system.

1238
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And then you've got people that are giving you this information that maybe they have been here forever.

1239
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Maybe this is a part of an archaeological dig. Maybe they've been trying to study these things for decades with no advancement at all.

1240
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yeah. So we came across or myself and a couple other people came across folks who could collaborate some of the things going on out there, such as silent craft actually lifting off at nighttime.

1241
01:18:49,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Not looking as though the control was very good, but actually lifting off, maneuvering like a real small trial kind of thing.

1242
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And that fellow observed it from a distance where he wasn't supposed to be.

1243
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:18,000
George has come up with collaboration, I think, from two or three other sources also, besides what Bob said, about certain aspects of things out there.

1244
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:32,000
It's just that Bob's story is so much more in-depth, so much more detailed, like that book that he talked about years ago coming across. Amazing things.

1245
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Tell people about the book?

1246
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Well, there was a book, as I remember, there was some kind of a book that Bob was allowed to look through, or he sees the opportunity to do it when he was in a room where the book was, but I think that was by design.

1247
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And it was some kind of a holographic book that as you opened up the pages, whatever the stories were became a hologram.

1248
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:14,000
That's my recollection of a conversation that's decades old now. So, you know, if I got it wrong, fire me.

1249
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:22,000
You'll have to talk to Bob about that, would you? Or talk to George, because I remember something like that.

1250
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I mean, that was like, wow, what an amazing way to portray information in some kind of a book and actually have holographic images coming forth out of the, I don't know.

1251
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:51,000
So that, I haven't ever heard of that being repeated anyplace in terms of something else like that happening, and so much that happened to Bob, it was so unique.

1252
01:20:51,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I think there was also some very strange summary of what they understand or what they believe to be true about the origins of human beings, and that they believe that what these visitations were about was that human beings are the product of accelerated evolution, and that the species from wherever had been coming here and doing genetic experiments with primates and created human beings.

1253
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Which is the ultimate, like, who knows? Like, wow, that's fun to think about, but we were talking about this last night, like how bizarre humans are, that out of all these things on earth, we're the only ones with shoes.

1254
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Out of all these things, we're the only ones that have to wear clothes, we're the only ones that jump into metal boxes with rubber tires and roll around these hard surfaces that we created, or fly in planes, or send video through your phone to other people that are on the other side of the continent.

1255
01:21:49,000 --> 01:22:04,000
We're weird. We're real weird. We're way weirder than anything else that exists. And if we are really a product of some sort of accelerated process, like that this is how they get the party started on these planets.

1256
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:16,000
They find semi-intelligent, curious animals that are using tools or using, you know, opposable thumbs, and they do some things to them.

1257
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Yeah, there's a large variety of potential beginnings. More evidence for some than others, right? So that's always the trick.

1258
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Have you considered that? Is this, like, a subject that you've deeply considered and thought about?

1259
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Not really.

1260
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Really?

1261
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I'm here. I don't want to look a gift horse in the face. I'll take it for what it is, you know.

1262
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Really?

1263
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Yeah. I mean...

1264
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I think about it a lot.

1265
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I don't know. I think I need more evidence to be more curious about. I'm more concerned about other kinds of things that are now than where do the human species come from, particularly.

1266
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I'm more driven by other kinds of things that could make a difference today, going forward.

1267
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So getting back to the Bob Lazar thing, when you first got to know him and you first were considering this story and how crazy it was, what was it like to meet a guy who, at least by his own accounts, had encountered this thing that you were seeking?

1268
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Well, Bob's a likeable guy. As you said, he's very smart. And so he's interesting to talk to, right?

1269
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Yeah.

1270
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And so that's more than just entertaining. To listen to his story is profound, right?

1271
01:23:49,000 --> 01:24:02,000
So it gives you an awful lot to think about and to try to position as to how can you measure future information you might get against that story?

1272
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
How can you verify different kinds of things?

1273
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:19,000
So I've heard a lot more silly things, I think, than what Bob was talking about. It didn't seem all that ridiculous.

1274
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And then the more you get to talk to him, the more you get to know him, and people like George, who's an investigative journalist, it gets more and more, wow.

1275
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:43,000
If there's like one thing that I could know about on this earth involving human beings, I think that's the thing.

1276
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
There's a lot of things I'd like to know who killed Kennedy, I'd like to know, there's like a lot of things I'd like to know.

1277
01:24:48,000 --> 01:25:01,000
But whether or not that's real, to be in that hangar and see that ship and to go walk through it with him and to really understand that this is not from here.

1278
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I think that would be the one.

1279
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And have crashes been intentional?

1280
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Yeah, that's a weird one to me. We were discussing that last night.

1281
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,000
The problem with that is there's also this discussion of alien bodies.

1282
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:22,000
If crashes have been intentional, what do you have, suicide bombers just for our own edification? That seems silly.

1283
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And that's really disheartening to think that someone could come here from another galaxy and still get tripped up by lightning.

1284
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Yeah, but maybe they're just anthropomorphic. Maybe they're more robotic.

1285
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Maybe that's our future.

1286
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:41,000
At what point does a species have a spirit or a soul?

1287
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Could it machine, even if it's very advanced and can think better than we can think and calculate faster and actually understands fear, love, passions?

1288
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Would it ever evolve to having a soul or a spirit?

1289
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
That's a good question.

1290
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Yeah, it's a different kind of question.

1291
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
It's also a good question as to are those things imperative for life?

1292
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:19,000
When we think of ego, when we think of our mating instincts and all the various pleasant and unpleasant aspects of being a human being, how many of them are impediments to growth and progress?

1293
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
What is growth and progress, right?

1294
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Are we trying to achieve mastery of the elements and of life?

1295
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Are we trying to keep peace?

1296
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Are we trying to make things better but stay human?

1297
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
What are we trying to do?

1298
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Because when we talk about artificial life, it's just artificial in terms of the fact that another life form has created it.

1299
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
But if they figure out a way to...

1300
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
You've seen Ex Machina, that movie?

1301
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
No.

1302
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
You haven't?

1303
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
No.

1304
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
How dare you?

1305
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Go out and see it right now.

1306
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Hey, I'm living in the desert.

1307
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Well, listen, they have movies in the desert.

1308
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I've been in the desert.

1309
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It's a great movie, fantastic movie, one of my favorites ever.

1310
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:08,000
And it is about this super genius guy who develops these artificially intelligent humanoids.

1311
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And there's a lot of suspension of disbelief when you're watching a science fiction movie that takes place in a modern era that has robots that look exactly like people and have emotions and thoughts and stuff.

1312
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:33,000
But it makes you wonder how far away are we from something like that, some super intelligent thing that we create ourselves, and then it can create other super intelligent things.

1313
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Are we 50 years?

1314
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Are we 100 years?

1315
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
When is that going to happen?

1316
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And is that going to happen?

1317
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Or are we going to become some sort of symbiotic creation?

1318
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Are we going to merge with technology?

1319
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Instead of create some sort of technological being, are we going to become one?

1320
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:01,000
And that's one of the things that I've always been very curious about when it comes to these aliens, these iconic aliens that people experience.

1321
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
They always seem like what we will look like in the future.

1322
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,000
If you look at a chimpanzee or a gorilla, they're much more muscular than human beings.

1323
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
They're much stronger.

1324
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
They're covered in hair.

1325
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
They have smaller heads.

1326
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
And then our heads are bigger.

1327
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Our bodies are smaller.

1328
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
We're weaker and softer.

1329
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And then if you continue to move forward and we advance and evolve and eliminate all the problems that human beings experience,

1330
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:39,000
whether it's because of war or crime or all these different things that trip us up as a society and as a culture,

1331
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:49,000
these things are all connected to tribalism and biology and emotions and the desire to sexually procreate.

1332
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:59,000
If they eliminate all of those things with technology over time and you get these genital-less aliens that have these enormous heads

1333
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:04,000
and that don't communicate with mouth noises anymore, they communicate with thoughts,

1334
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:12,000
and they don't have the need for physical strength anymore, so their bodies are these tiny childlike things, but they have godlike powers.

1335
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Is that our future?

1336
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So is there a prerequisite in all of that for the reptilian brainstem to be eliminated?

1337
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Is there the potential for either inanimate objects or combination biological material, android type of objects, to have consciousness?

1338
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And what is it to be human in the first place?

1339
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Well, if you have bred out or artificially created something that is close to whatever perfect might be as opposed to a human being that's very imperfect,

1340
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:23,000
a human being has all kinds of imperfections, all kinds of emotional imperfections and capabilities that go from here to here,

1341
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:34,000
and so that is what it's like to be a human being. We are very imperfect, and so we're in a class by ourselves.

1342
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Now you introduce something else. Maybe our consciousness is unique to being a human being,

1343
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:53,000
and it's not possible to actually evolve consciousness in an artificial mechanism.

1344
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:02,000
So consciousness and thought are two different kinds of things, like mind and brain are two different kinds of things.

1345
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:16,000
So consciousness, to me, is a force. Like we just saw Caligna, whether you think it's real or not,

1346
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:23,000
but there are many other demonstrations of being able to use consciousness, attention, as a force upon something.

1347
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:31,000
To either gather information you shouldn't be gathering from remote viewing or moving an object, it's a different kind of force.

1348
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Thought is a creative mechanism, and thought can come to promoting the force, in other words, to channel the conscious effort.

1349
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I don't mean to be getting off the topic, but I think...

1350
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
No, I don't think it's off the topic at all.

1351
01:31:51,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So then it comes down to, even if you did create those kinds of advanced beings, why did you do it? Why? Is perfection that important?

1352
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I mean, does everything have to be perfect, or isn't there some beauty in having some imperfections?

1353
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Well, here's the question. All of the human elements that we talked about, whether they're emotions or the desire to procreate sexually,

1354
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:42,000
or jealousy and rage and territorial behavior, tribalism, all the awful and great things about human beings, ego,

1355
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:53,000
all those things lead people to want to do things, to get recognized, to get attention, and they also want to get recognized for their achievements,

1356
01:32:53,000 --> 01:33:03,000
and they also want to push things past the boundaries that have been established by other people that are in the same business or the same creative venture as them,

1357
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
whether it's artificial intelligence or whether it's art or creativity or music or anything that people do.

1358
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:18,000
They're always piggybacking on the work of the people that came before them. It's part of being a person with everything, with architecture, with technology.

1359
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Everything is piggybacking on the work before it, and these things are motivated by these very imperfect aspects of being a person,

1360
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:36,000
by ego, by the desire to be loved, by all these, and even by the positive things, by curiosity, by creativity.

1361
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:45,000
All this soup of influences are all making people advance technology and innovate.

1362
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:52,000
That, if you just extrapolate, if you just look at what technology is, and if you look at what we're doing,

1363
01:33:52,000 --> 01:34:04,000
if you were from another planet and you had no idea about human culture, and you had no familiarity to the human form and to what our life is like down here,

1364
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,000
and you looked at us, you would say, well, what is this species doing? What are they doing?

1365
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Well, I'll tell you what they're doing. They're making stuff, and they're making better stuff every year. That's what the species does.

1366
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,000
What do bees do? They make beehives, they make honey, but they do the same shit every year.

1367
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Human beings don't. They need a new goddamn phone every year, the TVs get bigger, the cars get faster.

1368
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Everything they do is better. The computers have more terabytes of hard drive, their processors work quicker, the video cards are better, everything's better.

1369
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,000
No one's settling for less good. Everybody wants better, and they want better constantly.

1370
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
And they want to show their friends it's part of being attractive.

1371
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Look, look at Johnny, he's got the new car, he's got the new phone, she's got the new watch, you've got the new Oculus Rift headset, you got this and that.

1372
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:59,000
We make technology. It's our primary thing. We work, we get ourselves together like human batteries, and we generate income and revenue,

1373
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:06,000
and we're all obsessed with making or buying better stuff. That's what we do.

1374
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Now, what does that mean ultimately? Well, it means technology. Technology is the pinnacle of human achievement.

1375
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:20,000
It's the stuff that puts us into space, it's the stuff that allows us to videotape things, it's stuff that allows us to essentially capture time.

1376
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
You can capture time on a phone and play it back to people.

1377
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:31,000
This is when I showed Jeremy this thing, we both laughed. Ha, ha, ha, look, you can laugh too. You can laugh at our memory. That's what it's doing.

1378
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Well, we're going to get better at that. It's going to keep getting better and better and better.

1379
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Well, where does that lead to? It leads to some sort of singularity. It leads to some sort of a paradigm shifting invention

1380
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:51,000
where all of these technologies piggyback onto themselves until we reach some sort of pinnacle of human achievement.

1381
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:59,000
And I think that's probably going to be some kind of artificial life or some sort of a symbiotic relationship with technology

1382
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:07,000
where literally instead of carrying around like a phone, like a baby that you don't want to leave behind, it's going to be in your body.

1383
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I don't think it's enough and I don't think it's altogether better.

1384
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I don't think it's altogether better either, but I think it's going that way.

1385
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I think you've got half the coin.

1386
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Half the coin?

1387
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Yeah. You're missing the other side.

1388
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
What's the other side?

1389
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So you've built this societal empire of technological achievements, right?

1390
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
That's what we have right now, right?

1391
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Well, and who knows in 50 years or 150 years, whatever.

1392
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Okay. I think you've just described an infrastructure for a serious problem coming.

1393
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Yeah.

1394
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:56,000
What if you were to create a graph and on the graph were just two things, two lines,

1395
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:03,000
and you were tracking over the last 150 years spiritual maturity among the species?

1396
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:14,000
20th century was the worst annihilation of people, 60 million people ever in terms of numbers, wars, right?

1397
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:20,000
What if you were to track in that same graph the progress of technology?

1398
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Well, you'd have one vertical line, the technological line in the 20th century and now,

1399
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
and it would probably be segmented, which I mean is jumping.

1400
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:37,000
It's going faster than arithmetic progression or any normal progression.

1401
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
It's jumping.

1402
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,000
So it might be at a 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 situation.

1403
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Now you look at the spirituality line. It's practically flat line.

1404
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
So what's the consequences of that eventually?

1405
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
What do you mean by the spirituality?

1406
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I think a species needs to have grounding spiritually.

1407
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
I think a species have to have an essence of spirituality,

1408
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:22,000
something that in their being to their bones says it makes a difference what you do.

1409
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:30,000
It makes a difference how you behave for your overall good and the good of others.

1410
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
And it makes a difference.

1411
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
So an intelligent species like us, not just all species.

1412
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Correct.

1413
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Sure.

1414
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
The most intelligent.

1415
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Yes, right.

1416
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:50,000
So if you don't have a grounding though in a solid spiritual philosophy in a species like us, like humans,

1417
01:38:50,000 --> 01:39:01,000
then you're rolling the dice on handing a species that might be immature spiritually

1418
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:07,000
to do some very advanced dangerous stuff that can be used as weaponry

1419
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:12,000
or just misused and abused in other kinds of ways.

1420
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
And maybe the species thinks it knows it all and is cavalier,

1421
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
as careless about the way the disposition of the technologies.

1422
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,000
But more than likely it's hostile because things tend to be weaponized.

1423
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
So you wind up with a species that's more like the Klingons than you want.

1424
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Right.

1425
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
So you wouldn't want to be on some other planet and having these discover you.

1426
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Right.

1427
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
So I think those two lines are really important to try to harmonize.

1428
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,000
The problem is there's no intersection in sight.

1429
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:48,000
In our lifetimes and other lifetimes, there's no intersections in sight.

1430
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:54,000
We haven't even begun to create a homogeneity of spirituality in the human species

1431
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
compared to the proliferation of technologies.

1432
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:03,000
So that incongruity can be a really serious problem someday, maybe.

1433
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Yeah, for sure.

1434
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I mean, if we continue to concentrate only on things and on improving technology,

1435
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
but not improving the way we communicate with each other and love each other.

1436
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Exactly.

1437
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Yeah.

1438
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Exactly.

1439
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
So what's the solution?

1440
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Wow.

1441
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I mean, that's the big, you know, that's the $64,000 question that they used to say,

1442
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
a little television program.

1443
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Yeah, I mean, that's what is a solution, you know, but who ponders that?

1444
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Who ever ponders this?

1445
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Only people with a lot of free time.

1446
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Yeah, I suppose so.

1447
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Yeah.

1448
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Some monks on the mountainside somewhere, some Buddhas someplace.

1449
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
That's the problem with the way we live our lives.

1450
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,000
We're very, very busy with things that aren't exactly spiritually satisfying, right?

1451
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Yeah.

1452
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Yeah.

1453
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,000
There's a tremendous amount of noise for attention.

1454
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
And so when do you get the time to just to think?

1455
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Right.

1456
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
When do you?

1457
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Who, me?

1458
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Yeah, when do you?

1459
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I'm just, I'm too busy running in circles.

1460
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:14,000
But I know you think about these things and I know you've thought a lot about consciousness.

1461
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
And this is one of the things that you've studied.

1462
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:22,000
And one of the things you're involved in is the concept of whether or not consciousness extends beyond death.

1463
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Right.

1464
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Yeah.

1465
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
And what do you think?

1466
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I think it's a really important subject.

1467
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
So we have two Holy Grails, right?

1468
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
And the second Holy Grail is, are we alone, as you've said?

1469
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And everybody kind of is attracted to that question.

1470
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And the other is, does, do aspects of your consciousness survive your bodily death?

1471
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:55,000
So is there a difference between mind and brain?

1472
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:04,000
So is brain the generator and mind is a reservoir and actually more causal than the brain is, in a sense?

1473
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:16,000
So in theory, the question relates to, guys, you are doing away with the brain if the container decomposes and dies and is permanently offline.

1474
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Are there any aspects of your mind that continues?

1475
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Does your consciousness continue?

1476
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:30,000
That is a question that has been attempted to answer since maybe the dawn of man.

1477
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:36,000
A loved one has just died.

1478
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Is there any way to recapture that?

1479
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Any way at all?

1480
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Well, no.

1481
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
It's written off as, it's gone.

1482
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:55,000
And that is just a relevant question today as ever because you have a lot of disparate kinds of folks' beliefs and you have religions that are against that notion altogether.

1483
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:08,000
And so you have a huge difference, amount of differences in people's philosophy and driven by religious beliefs or just the way they've arrived at their own conclusions or whatever.

1484
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:25,000
So you have to be respectful of all these different kinds of beliefs and try to yet approach that subject in a way that is somehow determinable.

1485
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Try to arrive at something that maybe is not 100 percent, but can you find answers in different ways that drive you into the high levels, 80, 85, 90, 95 percent, that you're leaning towards that?

1486
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:51,000
That would be really good news if you could legitimately do that for yourself and know that you have something else in addition to this.

1487
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Well, that's always been what religions have strived for, right?

1488
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,000
To show people that there's something more than this life.

1489
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Oh, yeah.

1490
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
There's something beyond.

1491
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
It's their backyard.

1492
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
There's something waiting.

1493
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Yeah, for the majority of religions.

1494
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:15,000
It's their backyard and there's all kinds of promises about what our backyard contains if you're a follower of our religion.

1495
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Yeah, and the cynical people would always say, well, they're just trying to promise you that to get you to behave in this life, but there's really no evidence whatsoever that anything happens once you die.

1496
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:34,000
But then you have people that have had near-death experiences and those are the weird ones because they've had these near-death experiences and they almost always come back saying it's going to be okay.

1497
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
They almost always come back going there's something more to this.

1498
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Right.

1499
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,000
And we don't know what those near-death experiences are.

1500
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:52,000
We know that certain aspects of them can be recreated with psychedelic drugs and we do know that the brain produces psychedelic drugs, particularly DMT.

1501
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:59,000
And people that have had experiences on psychedelics have had these moments.

1502
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Like Larry Haggard, the guy from Dallas, remember that?

1503
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Oh, yeah.

1504
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:10,000
He famously was on CNN once and I watched this interview where he's talking about how he had a high dose LSD experience once.

1505
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
He never worried about death ever again.

1506
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:23,000
And he was talking about it and the CNN anchor was clearly a little rattled because I believe what they were talking about was his green home.

1507
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:35,000
He had this home that operated off the grid and he had it all set up so it was really well insulated and solar powered and all this stuff so that he could not have a heavy carbon footprint.

1508
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Right.

1509
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:42,000
So they're talking about this and along the line they get to talking about his LSD experience and death.

1510
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:57,000
It was pretty trippy to see him say that and to see them going, oh, but many people that have had intense psychedelic experiences have had this thing happen to them where they believe they've gone to another dimension.

1511
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
They've gone to this other place that seems more real.

1512
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:17,000
From my own personal experiences, I've had these where you go to these realms that seem more real than the realm that you're living in and you encounter something, whether this something is imaginary or whether it's actually you could put it on a scale and measure it.

1513
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I'm not sure if it matters because it's still a thing you experience.

1514
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Did you have, after these experiences, did you have any kind of evidence afterwards that you could draw a connection between what you saw in the visions and actually now what you discovered?

1515
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I mean, was there anything that popped up later on that connected the two?

1516
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
No, no, there's no evidence.

1517
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
There's even the memory is shaky.

1518
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Your memories are shaky, just like the memories of a dream are shaky.

1519
01:46:52,000 --> 01:47:01,000
But when it happens, and I've done it a bunch of times, every time it happens, you're like, oh yeah, I remember this, because it's so intense.

1520
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Each time that you do it, is it more vivid?

1521
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
No, it's always vivid.

1522
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
You can't get more vivid.

1523
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
It doesn't get any more vivid.

1524
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
It's just it's way more vivid than life.

1525
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
What do you learn as you've been doing this multiple times?

1526
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
What what's the lessons learned?

1527
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Abandonment of the ego is a big one.

1528
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:33,000
That's the big one that your ego and your your desire to protect yourself from failing or from reality, that those things are ultimately very detrimental to your consciousness, very detrimental to the way you communicate with other people.

1529
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:42,000
And that it's a battle, a constant battle to abandon these monkey instincts that we all have and that these things have protected us and gotten us to the stage.

1530
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:48,000
But they can ultimately trip you up as you try to to sort of understand yourself better.

1531
01:47:48,000 --> 01:48:01,000
You know, you're just hitting on something in the literature of of survival of consciousness, of which there's hundreds or thousands of books that you could actually access and people to talk to.

1532
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
The message seems to be in the literature.

1533
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Abandonment of the ego is a very important thing to do.

1534
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
It's a very important thing as you passed over.

1535
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:18,000
That's one of the things that happens is try to remove the ego and shove it aside.

1536
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Yeah, yeah, that's it seems to be.

1537
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:28,000
That's an impediment to learning in a lot of different ways.

1538
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
It's an impediment to learning art.

1539
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,000
It's an impediment to learn because you think you're better than you are if you let your ego lie to you.

1540
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Oh, sure. And same with technical skills, physical skills.

1541
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
You can lie to yourself.

1542
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
And a lot of that is the ego.

1543
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
But the ego is also what keeps you alive.

1544
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,000
You know, it's the thing that makes you want to be successful.

1545
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It's the thing that makes you want to progress.

1546
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
It's the thing that makes you want to accomplish things like it's not.

1547
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:02,000
And the key to and one of the keys to an actualized life is to progress.

1548
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Move your motivation away from ego to the fascination in problem solving and acquiring skills and getting better at tasks is that there's something something interesting in it.

1549
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And especially if you're doing something that benefits other people, when it benefits other people that you get better at these things,

1550
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:32,000
because these other people get to enjoy these things on a higher level, then you get this this cool feeling of actually benefiting people, actually helping people with your your fascination with these things.

1551
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:43,000
And the more you concentrate on the ego, the more you're going to it'll taint whatever progress you're making, you know, taint whatever thing you're creating.

1552
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
So back to the near death experiences.

1553
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:59,000
So let's suppose that you just look at the ones that come along naturally, you know, somebody has flatlined on an operating table, they fall through the ice, whatever.

1554
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,000
OK, so there are so many near death experiences.

1555
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I mean, I've heard numbers that are ridiculous in the millions of people in this country, not just in the world.

1556
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
And so there's a hell of a lot of smoke.

1557
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:29,000
There's often there must be an awful lot of heat somewhere in terms of the probability that this is real, because other explanations are really tough.

1558
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Now, you can have out of body experiences and you can validate conversations in a room.

1559
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
You should have no way of understanding where tools were taken from what drawers or anything like that.

1560
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
But people look like and yada yada because you're gone.

1561
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
You're under anesthesia, right?

1562
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
There's no way.

1563
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:51,000
And yet the literature is replete with stories, thousands of stories like that.

1564
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:59,000
And same thing with near death stories, you know, huge volume of information, every example you can possibly imagine.

1565
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:07,000
And and so then you wonder, well, how can you correlate that?

1566
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:21,000
How can you correlate anything to do with did the person have an experience not just through the tunnel, but what they saw afterwards in that period of time after they exited the tunnel into wherever they were?

1567
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:28,000
And how do we how do we verify that what they actually saw was the other side?

1568
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Not only that, you have different human beings with a different understanding of language.

1569
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:39,000
So they have limited vocabulary or limited ability to describe things or limited ability to express themselves.

1570
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,000
And maybe they're not so good at relaying what it was.

1571
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,000
And does it fit with their religions rights and their philosophies?

1572
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Right. Right. Right. Yeah.

1573
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:54,000
And how much of it do you distort when you get back to make yourself feel better?

1574
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
How much of it do you how much do you actually share with people?

1575
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I mean, remember, you were you were talking about your childhood experiences.

1576
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
You didn't want to share with your wife.

1577
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Like when people have a near death experience, maybe maybe some of it's like unpleasant.

1578
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Yeah, I didn't want to share with her.

1579
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I mean, she might have said, hey, go sleep in the other room.

1580
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Hey, crazy. Yeah.

1581
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I don't want you around me.

1582
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
You know, so why take the chance?

1583
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Well, people people have a real fear of being ridiculed, you know, and to be ridiculed for a near death experience is probably similar to being ridiculed for a UFO encounter or ridicule for any other.

1584
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Super spectacular thing that most people are never going to experience.

1585
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Right. Right.

1586
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Yeah.

1587
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:47,000
So what when you have talked about this, the the ability to measure whether consciousness exists outside of life when they're what how can that be measured?

1588
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And what what steps can be made to try to quantify and to try to validate whether or not this is a real thing?

1589
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
You don't want to hear this.

1590
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I do want to hear this.

1591
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
All right.

1592
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
How can you say I don't want to hear this?

1593
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Well, I don't know.

1594
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I'm just guessing.

1595
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I'm just guessing.

1596
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I'm sitting here with a reptilian brainstem trying to keep up.

1597
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
All right.

1598
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:14,000
So so how do you verify a near death experience?

1599
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:25,000
It might be that there's some kind of messaging that can happen from whoever greeted you temporarily on the other side because you are coming back.

1600
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:29,000
And maybe that message can be verified in some way.

1601
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Maybe it's something that doesn't make sense to you.

1602
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
OK, so you do come back.

1603
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
You snap back in to this reality.

1604
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
You're alive.

1605
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:47,000
And sure enough, what was conveyed to you from the other side actually happens.

1606
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
And it wasn't something that was expected.

1607
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
It was it was profound in some way.

1608
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And so that might be a way of verifying through this message that you had no way of knowing or predicting that this was going to happen.

1609
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,000
There's also the subject of psychic mediums.

1610
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
All right.

1611
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I can see your stone face right now.

1612
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
You're not buying it.

1613
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
All right.

1614
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I didn't say anything.

1615
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I know.

1616
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I always give stone face.

1617
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I'm looking at you.

1618
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I give stone face when people talk.

1619
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
OK.

1620
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
All right.

1621
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
But yeah, most psychic mediums I think are full of shit.

1622
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Yeah, I know.

1623
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
So.

1624
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
OK.

1625
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Doesn't mean they're all.

1626
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Well, OK.

1627
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Now, we'll say that again.

1628
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
It doesn't mean they're all full of shit.

1629
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
OK.

1630
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
OK.

1631
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Good.

1632
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
All right.

1633
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
All right.

1634
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
And some are a whole lot better than others.

1635
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Yes.

1636
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
And look, it's like everything else.

1637
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
There's con artists out there.

1638
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Yes.

1639
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
And then there's people that are genuinely unique.

1640
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Yes.

1641
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Yes.

1642
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Absolutely.

1643
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Yeah.

1644
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
World class performers.

1645
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Yeah.

1646
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Yeah.

1647
01:54:52,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And so of course, you can't help yourself, but try to get information that falls in the

1648
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
categories that they should have no way of knowing.

1649
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,000
In fact, you might not even know the information yourself at that moment in time.

1650
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Right.

1651
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
You know, you'll say no.

1652
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Or it's only later after you've listened to the recording or whatever that, oh, my gosh,

1653
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
they were right in this and this and that.

1654
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:26,000
So that is a very important source of information, assuming you're talking to ones that have

1655
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
been legitimized, right?

1656
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
And they've been bona fide.

1657
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Do you know any?

1658
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I know a very good one.

1659
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
You know, a really good psychic medium.

1660
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Can I meet that person?

1661
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I don't see why not.

1662
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I mean, it's up to them too, right?

1663
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Yeah.

1664
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
But I think that would be.

1665
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Yeah, I would.

1666
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I'll ask.

1667
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
What does this person do professionally?

1668
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Are they a psychic medium professionally?

1669
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:57,000
So they make money doing it?

1670
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:10,000
This person isn't motivated by, as far as my understanding is, by just doing these things

1671
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
as a business.

1672
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:24,000
This person will do things, will do readings pro bono without a fee, without charging.

1673
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
That's promising.

1674
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
That helps.

1675
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
That helps believe you.

1676
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
It helps you believe them, rather.

1677
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
They have a family.

1678
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
The person has a family and so on.

1679
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
It's always a woman.

1680
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Why is it always a woman that's really good at it?

1681
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Is it a woman?

1682
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Is it a woman?

1683
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Actually, yes.

1684
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Well, it is interesting why psychic mediums tend to be women.

1685
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I think because women have to be worried about men because men are fucking crazy.

1686
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:03,000
And men are more violent and women are probably more intuitive because they have to pay more attention to these assholes.

1687
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Well, you know, pound for pound, they're the best astronaut there is.

1688
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Women?

1689
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Of course.

1690
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Yeah.

1691
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Of course.

1692
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,000
You get all that brain power in a package that doesn't weigh as much.

1693
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Oh, that makes sense.

1694
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
You're launching less weight.

1695
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
But all kidding aside.

1696
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Yeah, psychic mediums are a really good legitimate source of getting alternate information that helps to collaborate things maybe that have happened other ways or information has come maybe from a near-death experience or, you know, for example.

1697
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:45,000
But outside of psychic mediums, when you're talking about measuring whether or not consciousness exists outside of life,

1698
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,000
whether or not your consciousness somehow or another transcends your physical body.

1699
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Right.

1700
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
So you've heard of automatic writing.

1701
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Yes.

1702
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And I don't mean that means...

1703
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
You explain it to people's eyes.

1704
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Well, it has nothing to do with your wife automatically going into your checkbook.

1705
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
It's got nothing to do with that.

1706
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Do people write checks anymore?

1707
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
That's automatic writing.

1708
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
No.

1709
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Oh, okay.

1710
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
They don't do that anymore.

1711
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I'm old fashioned.

1712
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
They bank online.

1713
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I write a check.

1714
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I understand.

1715
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
It's automatic writing to people.

1716
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
All right.

1717
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:43,000
So apparently it's something that has occurred for many, many years over, especially back when the study of spiritualism and the whole investigations of psychics was very, very strong from about 1835 or 40

1718
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
to 1930-ish.

1719
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:52,000
And then it has continued in some ways up until recent times.

1720
01:58:52,000 --> 01:59:02,000
So you have somebody who is writing and they are being controlled by a spirit.

1721
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Okay.

1722
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Or they're in a trance.

1723
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Or maybe they're in a trance.

1724
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Yeah.

1725
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
But they could be lucid.

1726
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
It doesn't have to be in a non-lucid trance.

1727
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:16,000
They could be lucid in their writing or they could be in a trance.

1728
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:21,000
And maybe they're not writing in the vernacular and language that they're used to.

1729
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Maybe they have a sixth or seventh year education.

1730
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,000
And they're writing very sophisticated information.

1731
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Have you experienced this?

1732
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
No.

1733
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I'm an explorer and a researcher, investigator, a student.

1734
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:54,000
So I'm trying to gather information through other ways.

1735
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,000
And I've had personal experiences, but nothing of automatic writing.

1736
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:07,000
So anyway, again, the literature is huge on this subject of automatic writing.

1737
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:12,000
And it's easy to dismiss because it just seems very strange.

1738
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
You're being possessed.

1739
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
You're actually being controlled.

1740
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,000
But has anybody ever verified any of this automatic writing stuff?

1741
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
In the literature, yeah.

1742
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:28,000
You have a lot of information that the writer isn't aware of, shouldn't be, doesn't know.

1743
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,000
It's outside of their world.

1744
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:41,000
So there has been different kinds of cross-correspondence and other kinds of ways of verifying that this didn't come from this person.

1745
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Something else is going on here.

1746
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
It didn't come all from this person.

1747
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
It's not right.

1748
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
It's completely illogical.

1749
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:56,000
So that's one means of adding something to the menu.

1750
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:05,000
But when you're trying to measure whether or not consciousness exists outside of life, just because someone's automatically writing,

1751
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,000
they could be receiving some signal from someone that's still alive.

1752
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:16,000
If there is some sort of psychic communication, if there is a possibility of remote viewing,

1753
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,000
and you can transmit information from person to person without words.

1754
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
And this is one of the ultimate goals of Neuralink.

1755
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Elon Musk actually said you're going to be able to talk without using words.

1756
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I mean, if human beings, if it's possible to do something along those lines,

1757
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:39,000
this could be a live person that's somehow or another projecting these thoughts,

1758
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:44,000
and someone else is tuning into them in the same way you would tune into a radio signal.

1759
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Okay, so the way you would test that is probably it's going to be what's the nature of the entire subject matter?

1760
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,000
How extensive is this subject matter?

1761
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Because at some point you're adding on so much weight and so many different variables

1762
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:14,000
that it stretches the credulity, the credibility of that theory working.

1763
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
It's kind of like using ball lightning as an excuse for all kinds of things.

1764
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:24,000
When it has a very short life, usually travels in one direction, and it's very, very, very rare.

1765
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:29,000
So everybody uses Occam's razor as this is what you do.

1766
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:38,000
You want to go to what is the simplest solution instead of trying to find swamp gas to describe the craft that just landed.

1767
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:44,000
So I would say that's probably testable.

1768
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:52,000
You could probably create the methodologies to do some laboratory type tests on that.

1769
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:57,000
But my guess is that would fail as a solution.

1770
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:03,000
See, we're talking right now in these weird terms because I don't know if that stuff's real.

1771
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:09,000
I could describe what I think would be wrong with these scenarios,

1772
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:17,000
but I don't know if any of this remote writing or automatic writing has been verified. You do.

1773
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Through the literature.

1774
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Yeah, but what does that mean though? It's through the literature. People are full of shit. They write things down that aren't true.

1775
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:28,000
It just means that we haven't set up experiments ourselves to verify ourselves

1776
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:34,000
and actually watching, implementing it under controlled conditions, double-blind conditions.

1777
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
So what else do you have to resort to?

1778
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:43,000
It's what's in the literature thoroughly, digest and pros and cons and everything from a lot of sources,

1779
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
and people who have engaged in this.

1780
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
And maybe they have film. Maybe they actually have film of the writing.

1781
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
When you compare the handwriting, maybe it's different handwriting altogether.

1782
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Maybe it's in a different language completely. In fact, there are stories of a lot of accounts of exactly that.

1783
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
But the subject of consciousness and whether or not consciousness exists beyond life, this is something that's important to you.

1784
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:10,000
So I would assume that you've looked into it further than just this idea of automatic writing being the only piece of evidence.

1785
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Actually, that area is the least I've looked into.

1786
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Automatic writing.

1787
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,000
What's the area the most you've looked into?

1788
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Well, now, first of all, I have kind of recaptured this survival of consciousness inquiry that I was into in the 1980s.

1789
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:37,000
And I have now formed an institute called BICS that started in June of last year.

1790
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
What does BICS stand for?

1791
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Bigelow Institution for Survival of Consciousness.

1792
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:50,000
And for Conscious Survival.

1793
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Bigelow Institute for Conscious Survival of Consciousness.

1794
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:01,000
And this organization is very new.

1795
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:15,000
And so we're in a method of trying to stimulate research and investigate and catch up on the literature.

1796
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:30,000
And we have a unique situation where we have people around us that have ongoing things happening.

1797
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Ongoing things.

1798
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Yeah.

1799
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
What does that mean?

1800
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Different kinds of events that are being reported by family, staff, friends.

1801
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Like?

1802
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Apparitions.

1803
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Ghosts.

1804
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Yeah.

1805
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
You believe in ghosts?

1806
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I have.

1807
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
It's fun.

1808
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
My experience is, well, there's a difference.

1809
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Fun to believe in ghosts.

1810
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Well, there's a difference in terms of what causes you to believe in something the most.

1811
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Personal experiences?

1812
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Probably.

1813
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:11,000
So my personal experiences are not having ever seen an apparition.

1814
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
My wife did.

1815
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I have had poltergeist, a very demonstrative poltergeist event.

1816
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
What was that?

1817
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Decades ago.

1818
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,000
What happened?

1819
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Probably, I don't know, 25 years ago or more.

1820
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
11 o'clock at night.

1821
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
My wife and I are laying in bed.

1822
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Halloween Eve.

1823
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
This is appropriate.

1824
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Halloween Eve.

1825
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Okay.

1826
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Hardwood floors downstairs in the entrance hall.

1827
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:57,000
On which tables are all set up with lots and lots of candies, bags, because bags are being given out.

1828
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Large, very large candy bars and bags and bags of everything piled up.

1829
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Hundreds of kids having to be taken care of.

1830
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Halloween, big deal.

1831
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Big deal.

1832
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Ghosts in the trees.

1833
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
And this is a family thing that is a big deal.

1834
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Every year.

1835
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Decorations, the whole nine yards.

1836
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
The full Monte.

1837
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Got it.

1838
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
All right.

1839
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:25,000
So, we're laying there and there's this crash, bang, boom, crash, crash, crash, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1840
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Like a thousand malt balls just dropped to the hardwood floor.

1841
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Made all this noise.

1842
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:37,000
It sounded like the sound I estimated seemed to last forever, probably about three and a half, four seconds.

1843
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Which is a long time for noise to continue.

1844
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
And I said, oh, jeez.

1845
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Stay here.

1846
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I'll go take care of it.

1847
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Whatever.

1848
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I'll get it all.

1849
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
I'll go take care of it.

1850
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
The mess.

1851
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
So, I go downstairs.

1852
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Nothing's wrong.

1853
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Nothing's wrong.

1854
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
She doesn't believe me.

1855
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
She comes downstairs.

1856
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
And she says, oh, my God.

1857
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I said, yeah.

1858
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
I don't have to do anything.

1859
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Everything's perfect.

1860
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I didn't touch it.

1861
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,000
It's just like we set it up.

1862
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
So, that was a really interesting event.

1863
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
And Poltergeist, a lot of times...

1864
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
So, it's just a sound that you heard.

1865
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Yeah, just a sound.

1866
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
A sound like something crashed.

1867
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Like everything on all those tables piled all up had all crashed to the floor and bags broken open.

1868
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Yes.

1869
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
But nothing did.

1870
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
You had children at the time?

1871
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I had teenagers and they were gone.

1872
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
They were out of the house.

1873
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
They were gone.

1874
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
You sure they weren't fucking with you?

1875
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
The teenagers?

1876
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
No.

1877
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
But, well, what would they have to do?

1878
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Have a recording.

1879
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Make a loud noise.

1880
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Yeah.

1881
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
They would have to crash all this and record it, wouldn't they?

1882
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Isn't that more likely than a ghost?

1883
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
And spend hundreds of dollars doing this.

1884
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Hundreds.

1885
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
And, well, that's how much we always spent.

1886
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
On recordings?

1887
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
No.

1888
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,000
On the candy.

1889
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I mean, just sounds.

1890
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
It sounded like mothballs, you said, right?

1891
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Or like malt balls hitting the floor, right?

1892
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Is that what you said it sounded like?

1893
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Yeah.

1894
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
You know, chocolate makers, whatever.

1895
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Candies, hard things, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1896
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Whatever.

1897
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
But that was it?

1898
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Just a sound?

1899
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
That's a lot.

1900
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
But it's not necessarily a ghost.

1901
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
When nothing has happened, well, no, we're talking about poltergeists.

1902
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Now, poltergeists don't have to be anything manifested as a ghost.

1903
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
It can be an audible sound.

1904
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
But was there anything more to the experience than just a loud sound that turned out to

1905
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
be nothing?

1906
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
No.

1907
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
No.

1908
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
That was pretty good.

1909
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
That's not enough.

1910
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
For a starter, that's pretty good.

1911
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:45,000
You know, I probably like, OK, what's going to happen tomorrow night?

1912
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Did something happen tomorrow night?

1913
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
No.

1914
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
That was it.

1915
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Just one loud noise.

1916
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
To me, it was a big deal.

1917
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
You know, it was like, wow.

1918
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Imagine if that was that whole movie, Poltergeist, just a loud noise.

1919
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Oh, wouldn't that be that entertaining?

1920
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Wouldn't be a good movie.

1921
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
No, you have to have chandelier swinging and crashing and all that kind of stuff.

1922
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
That's what I was expecting.

1923
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Yeah.

1924
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I wasn't expecting just like candy hit the floor, but no candy actually hit the floor.

1925
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Well, I never said that my life was that exciting.

1926
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,000
You know, it hasn't been that great.

1927
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:14,000
But I want to get to this idea that you're trying to pursue of measuring consciousness

1928
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
or trying to figure out whether or not consciousness survives death.

1929
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Right.

1930
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Like, what do you want to do and how do you want to do it?

1931
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:26,000
You can't just do it through remote writing or automatic writing or psychic mediums.

1932
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,000
There's got to be a way to figure this out.

1933
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Yeah.

1934
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:39,000
So we started the institute and I said, OK, let's stir the pot up.

1935
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:49,000
And in fact, we thought we would join an organization and they didn't want us.

1936
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
So we got rejected.

1937
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:58,000
So we got rejected and then crawled off and conjured up a contest.

1938
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,000
So the contest says you have to have some credentials to enter this contest.

1939
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
What kind of credentials do you have to have as a psychic?

1940
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
You have to have no, no, no, no.

1941
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:17,000
You have to have background in the topic of of and you could be you could be a priest,

1942
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,000
a minister, a rabbi.

1943
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:23,000
You have to have background in the topic of studying and understanding.

1944
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Does potentially does the other side even exist?

1945
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
We're not asking you to tell us what it's all about.

1946
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,000
OK.

1947
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Just does it friggin exist?

1948
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Right.

1949
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:41,000
So you might be a producer or director of a television show for years and you've got more stuff on film

1950
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:47,000
than you could imagine of different kinds of weird things happening that you have no explanation for any of that.

1951
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,000
And you've made a study of this for a long time.

1952
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
You could be a good candidate.

1953
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
You could be a detective.

1954
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:58,000
And maybe you're solving murder cases by using psychic mediums.

1955
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
So you'd have to have something you bring into the table.

1956
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:04,000
So you have to have someone bring to the table and you can't send us an essay.

1957
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,000
You're going to write an essay to present your case.

1958
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:11,000
And it can't be more than twenty five thousand words, which is about 50 pages.

1959
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:17,000
So you're just essentially going to allow people to come up with some convincing argument and bring it to you.

1960
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
So you have a contest to do this.

1961
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Is that what it is?

1962
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Yeah, that's what it is.

1963
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:26,000
So we say, OK, there's a deadline to get all your applications in.

1964
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
And then you have many months.

1965
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Deadline is actually the end of this month, the 20th of February.

1966
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
And then you have Jamie's got it up here.

1967
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Dick's essay competition.

1968
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Best evidence for afterlife.

1969
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Essays will be judged by five renowned experts.

1970
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
That's up to six now.

1971
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
We have another judge, which is good thing, because because the winning

1972
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
essay gets a half a million.

1973
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Is that too much?

1974
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
No, it's perfect.

1975
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
It's good.

1976
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Second place gets three hundred.

1977
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Third place gets one hundred fifty grand.

1978
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:06,000
So if you have a semi shitty near death experience story, you get one hundred fifty.

1979
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,000
It's it's an interesting way to do it.

1980
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:18,000
But, you know, I would hope there would be some better way to measure, you know, you know, the expression extraordinary claims.

1981
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Yeah. But now, wait a second.

1982
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Extraordinary evidence.

1983
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Yeah, true.

1984
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:33,000
But you got to remember that, well, first of all, we're causing conversation and and thought about the subject.

1985
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Right.

1986
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,000
And we're stirring the pot.

1987
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,000
And this kind of contest has never been done before.

1988
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
And what if they're all terrible?

1989
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Do you still give first place to someone as terrible worse than that?

1990
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
What if there are only three applicants?

1991
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Right.

1992
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Even second third price.

1993
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
They all suck.

1994
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1995
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Well, the good news is we have some really good people.

1996
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Jamie's thinking about right one right now.

1997
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
We have some.

1998
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Yes.

1999
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Yeah.

2000
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Half a million bucks.

2001
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
We have some very good people who are entering this contest.

2002
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Their credentials are terrific.

2003
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,000
They're very good.

2004
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:11,000
They're authors of many books.

2005
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:16,000
There's there's an extensive, extensive background of these kinds of folks.

2006
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,000
So we're excited about that.

2007
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
The response has been favorable.

2008
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Hmm.

2009
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
And so then there's a lot of money on the table.

2010
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Well, they haven't told us the first to do this.

2011
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
OK.

2012
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
And then the judges now.

2013
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
So here we are.

2014
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
What is it?

2015
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
The twenty fourth.

2016
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
What is it?

2017
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Twenty fourth of February.

2018
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Right.

2019
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
OK.

2020
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:42,000
So then the judges start and we just added a physicist to this group.

2021
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
He's the sixth one.

2022
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:51,000
And so he understands judging things and being a critical thinker.

2023
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,000
And so he really rounds out the group very well.

2024
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:59,000
And so the judges start August 1st, August, September, October.

2025
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:04,000
And they're supposed to be finished by November 1st and have made decisions.

2026
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:10,000
So then we announced the winners and we want to post all the three winners.

2027
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
And I suspect the judges are going to have a problem.

2028
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:22,000
It's going to be damn hard to pick three out of the group because we have that kind that we have.

2029
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,000
This has been generated a lot of interest and we have some really good folks into this.

2030
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
So we are going to get permissions as an applicant.

2031
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,000
They have to give us permission just to we don't own anything.

2032
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,000
We just want to put it on our website so people can read all the essays.

2033
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:41,000
So maybe we have 20, 25 essays, not just the three winners.

2034
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:46,000
So it's going to give people a chance to really read a lot of different kinds of arguments.

2035
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,000
By what metrics are you going to accept evidence of the afterlife?

2036
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Good question.

2037
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
OK.

2038
02:15:53,000 --> 02:16:00,000
So we patterned this after the legal system of the Western world.

2039
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:11,000
And the Western world says two things that you can convict providing you have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.

2040
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
It doesn't say 100 percent.

2041
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,000
It says beyond a reasonable doubt.

2042
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Number two, witnesses really matter.

2043
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:23,000
The veracity and the quality of the witnesses matter.

2044
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:26,000
And how many did you have to something?

2045
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:31,000
What is it that is being claimed here?

2046
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:38,000
And what is the cross correlation, collaboration in whatever it is that you're trying to relate here?

2047
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:43,000
So when you're talking about convicting someone for a crime, here's the problem with that analogy.

2048
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Crimes are real.

2049
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Like if you're talking about convicting someone for a murder, the murder is real.

2050
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
The person is dead and you want to catch someone.

2051
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:55,000
So you have eyewitness encounters, you have evidence, you have all these things.

2052
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,000
And you can convict someone on that evidence.

2053
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,000
There's no evidence that ghosts are real.

2054
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
There's no evidence that the afterlife is real.

2055
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
So you're guessing.

2056
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Wrong.

2057
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
How is it wrong?

2058
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Wrong.

2059
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
But murders are real, right?

2060
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
You would say murders are way more real than the afterlife?

2061
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
What you said is wrong in this context.

2062
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
In what way?

2063
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
An applicant.

2064
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
An applicant.

2065
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Who's a detective?

2066
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Who's been using?

2067
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Dick Tracy?

2068
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Psychic?

2069
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
No.

2070
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,000
What?

2071
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
In fact, I got my watch right here.

2072
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
You talked to that watch.

2073
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
That turned out to be real, right?

2074
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
It did.

2075
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
It is.

2076
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Dick Tracy's talked to his watch.

2077
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
We were like, that's crazy.

2078
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
The time didn't fast forward two hours.

2079
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I come from a Pacific time.

2080
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Oh.

2081
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
It didn't?

2082
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
No.

2083
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
That's weird.

2084
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
No.

2085
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
And so I haven't been using my cell phone and I forgot to bring my charger.

2086
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,000
What are you on?

2087
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Some shitty service?

2088
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Mine changes everywhere I go.

2089
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
I don't know.

2090
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
It isn't yours?

2091
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
I'm going to talk to my granddaughter because she gave it to me as a gift.

2092
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
But you understand what I'm saying, though?

2093
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Because we actually talked about this.

2094
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Well, wait a minute, though.

2095
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
This guy's a detective.

2096
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Oh, a detective.

2097
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Solving murder cases.

2098
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Right.

2099
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Using mediums.

2100
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Right.

2101
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Isn't this like, wow.

2102
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Yeah, but when they solve murder cases using mediums, if that has ever been real.

2103
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
And I've talked to some detectives that say that's all horseshit.

2104
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Because I did have a long discussion with someone who is a, he's an investigative detective

2105
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
and he solves crimes.

2106
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,000
And he's like, there's no evidence that any psychics have ever given you any real information.

2107
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Now, he hasn't investigated the subject.

2108
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,000
He has had probably one experience, maybe two in this.

2109
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:32,000
This is his personal opinion on cases that he's been involved in and maybe he's wrong.

2110
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
But this is just what he said.

2111
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
He said, people are desperate.

2112
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:38,000
They hire psychics.

2113
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,000
But my point is, murder is real.

2114
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:45,000
The difference is you're convicting someone for something that absolutely happened.

2115
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:50,000
When you're talking about trying to figure out whether or not there's an afterlife based

2116
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,000
on the kind of evidence that would be used to convict someone of a murder, that doesn't

2117
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
necessarily work.

2118
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Because we know for a fact that murder is real.

2119
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:03,000
We know for a fact that human beings are real and that if you kill them, you're a murderer.

2120
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
This is all fact.

2121
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
We don't know whether or not there's an afterlife.

2122
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:15,000
So to use the same obligation or the same preponderance of evidence that would convict

2123
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:23,000
someone of a crime for something that you don't even know is real, they're not comparable.

2124
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:34,000
No, I wouldn't say, don't put the seriousness of an event in terms of the harm it caused

2125
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:42,000
as being more legitimate than an event that actually produces information that you should

2126
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,000
have no way of acquiring.

2127
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Well, let's not say that then.

2128
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Let's talk about it in terms of something different than a murder.

2129
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Let's talk about it in terms of vandalism.

2130
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Just someone spray painting some building somewhere.

2131
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Let's talk about that.

2132
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
No one gets hurt.

2133
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Just physical stuff.

2134
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Okay, so let's take that example.

2135
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Suppose you went to a psychic medium and she says, what I'm hearing is that your house

2136
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
is going to get spray painted with a message on the backside of your house.

2137
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
I'd go to that lady.

2138
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
She probably fucking did it.

2139
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,000
She knew it was coming.

2140
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
You're impossible.

2141
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,000
That's how she knew it was coming.

2142
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,000
You're impossible.

2143
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,000
No, I'm possible.

2144
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
I'm very possible.

2145
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
But this is all nonsense.

2146
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Well, wait a minute.

2147
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:20,000
No, wait a minute.

2148
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
No.

2149
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
So there is a predictability in events, however.

2150
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Only if someone actually can prove that they've done that and no one's ever done that.

2151
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
No one's ever said someone's going to spray paint your building and it wasn't them that

2152
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
did it.

2153
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
How do you know?

2154
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
How do you know?

2155
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Prove it.

2156
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Prove it.

2157
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Show it to me.

2158
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Do you see what I'm saying?

2159
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
People have definitely spray painted people's buildings.

2160
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I do.

2161
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:44,000
No one has definitely showed you that there's real evidence that consciousness survives

2162
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
death and you can talk to someone from beyond the grave.

2163
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:55,000
There have been a mountain of readings for sitters where the information comes that says

2164
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:58,000
something is going to happen and it happens.

2165
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:02,000
It's prognostication that's a day or two or a week away and it happens.

2166
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Maybe.

2167
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Maybe.

2168
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
No, no.

2169
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:06,000
It is.

2170
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
You just have to read them.

2171
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,000
But you've got to show me specifics and we're going to have this conversation.

2172
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,000
See what I'm saying?

2173
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:13,000
For you to be so convinced, you should have things that you could pull out of the top

2174
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:18,000
of your head right now and tell me specifically that this event was predicted by this person

2175
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,000
and this is how it happened and there was no way they could have known about it otherwise.

2176
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Otherwise, you shouldn't be convinced.

2177
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Or in the tens of thousands.

2178
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
But that doesn't mean anything.

2179
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
When they're written down after the fact, that doesn't mean jack shit.

2180
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
No, but there are actual accounts of things.

2181
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,000
You have to say, well, the authors are all fraud.

2182
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Maybe.

2183
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,000
The authors are all fraud.

2184
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Their sources are fraud.

2185
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:37,000
The problem is you want to believe.

2186
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
That's the problem.

2187
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
So what you have to do.

2188
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Maybe it's true.

2189
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Maybe it's true.

2190
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I got the solution for you.

2191
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
But here's the thing.

2192
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
I got the solution.

2193
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Robert, I love you.

2194
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,000
You don't know.

2195
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
I got the solution.

2196
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
What's the solution?

2197
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
The solution is for you to have a sitting for Christ's sake.

2198
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Maybe that is not even good enough.

2199
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Wait a minute.

2200
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Earlier it was.

2201
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
No.

2202
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Never.

2203
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
It was never good enough.

2204
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,000
It was interesting.

2205
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Interesting to have a sitting.

2206
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
You could have both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and you wouldn't be happy.

2207
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2208
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Look, there is no proof ever that someone has been able to accurately perform some sort

2209
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
of psychic demonstration.

2210
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
That's the whole James Rand thing.

2211
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
You need a sitting badly.

2212
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I don't need a sitting man.

2213
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Yes you do.

2214
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:21,000
You have a belief in these things that may or may not be founded.

2215
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:24,000
But the problem is you don't have any evidence.

2216
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,000
You're not saying.

2217
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
You're not saying specific.

2218
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,000
I can tell you specific things that I know are true.

2219
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I'll talk to you about them because I was there or I know about them.

2220
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
I can talk to you about martial arts events.

2221
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,000
I can talk to you about stand-up comedy events.

2222
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:41,000
I know things that absolutely did happen.

2223
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Therefore, if you argued with me and said there has never been a UFC fight, I'd go,

2224
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,000
well, that's not true because I can tell you specific dates.

2225
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I can tell you what happened, what the result was.

2226
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I can show you a videotape of it.

2227
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:56,000
You don't have that same knowledge of these things, but you have the same conviction that

2228
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:01,000
I have when I'm talking about things that are hardcore facts like a mixed martial arts

2229
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
event or whatever.

2230
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Fill in the blank with whatever the event you want it to be.

2231
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:10,000
You have the same sort of conviction that these things are real, but you don't have

2232
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
the same kind of hardcore evidence.

2233
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Not only do you not have the same kind of hardcore evidence, but give me an example.

2234
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Give me an example.

2235
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:24,000
So an example is any kind of information coming from the other side that maybe you

2236
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
don't even know about.

2237
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Okay?

2238
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,000
So it can't be explained away as telepathy or clairvoyance because you don't even know

2239
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,000
about it yourself.

2240
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Okay.

2241
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Give me an example of that.

2242
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Well, pick anything.

2243
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
That something is going to happen.

2244
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
No, no, no, no, no.

2245
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Or that something did happen.

2246
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Give me an example of someone actually doing this.

2247
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Okay.

2248
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:45,000
So that Aunt Martha just died.

2249
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Who the fuck is Aunt Martha?

2250
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Is this a real person?

2251
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Well, you said give me an example.

2252
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
No, no, no.

2253
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:56,000
I want an example of a real psychic prediction that turned out to be true that you can tell

2254
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,000
me.

2255
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I can fill this table up with examples, with literature.

2256
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
I just want one.

2257
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
You don't have to do that.

2258
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Just give me one that you know about.

2259
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Listen, like I'm saying, I have the same conviction in things that I know are real as

2260
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:14,000
you have when you're arguing that psychic ability is real.

2261
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,000
I just want you to tell me one.

2262
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Okay.

2263
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,000
My own sitting.

2264
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Okay.

2265
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
My own sitting.

2266
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Okay.

2267
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:25,000
My father came across in the sitting.

2268
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:31,000
And my father was killed in a private plane crash when I was 18.

2269
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,000
And it wasn't his plane.

2270
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,000
It was his partner's plane.

2271
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:38,000
And so she tells this to me.

2272
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:45,000
And I hadn't thought about anything to do with his partner for decades.

2273
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,000
How long ago was this sitting?

2274
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,000
How long ago?

2275
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
How long ago did you have this sitting?

2276
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:52,000
A few days ago.

2277
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:57,000
You're a famous public person and your history is available.

2278
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Someone could find this out about you.

2279
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:07,000
That's maybe true on about the plane crash, but not the first name of the pilot.

2280
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:10,000
The first name of your father's partner?

2281
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Why couldn't someone find that out?

2282
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:12,000
The pilot.

2283
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Yeah.

2284
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Why couldn't someone find out the pilot?

2285
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:17,000
I think because this is over a half a century old.

2286
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I think it's like 60, I'm 76.

2287
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Right, but there was probably a record.

2288
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:24,000
I think that's stretching it.

2289
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I don't think that's stretching it at all.

2290
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:30,000
You were telling me about UFO encounters from 1947.

2291
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,000
You were telling me about people that have seen things.

2292
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:36,000
You were telling me about events that happened that are in the historical record.

2293
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Okay, so let's shift to something else that could not have been written down.

2294
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Okay.

2295
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Okay, so in my own sitting.

2296
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Okay.

2297
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:58,000
So my wife passed February 19th, last year, and she was in and out of hospitals a lot for a long time.

2298
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,000
I was kind of the nurse at home for a couple years.

2299
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:10,000
And so toward the end, she was in the hospital about three days before.

2300
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
She wanted to pass at home.

2301
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:22,000
So the challenge was how to get her out of an area in the hospital that was basically a waiting area for people to go to die.

2302
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:27,000
It was an area that that's where people were that weren't expected to leave.

2303
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Okay, alive.

2304
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:40,000
And so there was a day there where my son and my granddaughter and I were playing a lot of loud music in the room for my wife.

2305
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:50,000
And the medium said to me, and I'm recording this, and the medium said, thank you.

2306
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Thank you.

2307
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Your wife wants to thank you for all the music that was played for her before she passed, all the music.

2308
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:02,000
And I said, well, I don't know about any music.

2309
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
I don't remember anything.

2310
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Why did you say that?

2311
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Because I didn't remember.

2312
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
You didn't remember playing loud music?

2313
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
No, I didn't remember.

2314
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
But you remember it now.

2315
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,000
What is she talking about?

2316
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,000
How do you remember it now?

2317
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Because of my granddaughter.

2318
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Because I had recorded it and we listened to the recording together after I had done the sitting.

2319
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,000
And my granddaughter says to me, Pop, don't you remember?

2320
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Oh, da da da da da da da.

2321
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Oh, God, that's right.

2322
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Yeah.

2323
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Well, yeah, I forgot.

2324
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
I completely forgot it.

2325
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Well, that's certainly interesting and unusual.

2326
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:42,000
So what I would I don't know if she would do it, but I think she probably would be very interested since it's you.

2327
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,000
It's you.

2328
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:55,000
And because you are a big figure that and you're easy to learn about, you'd go into this assuming which she's very, very honest person.

2329
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:00,000
But you would have to go into this assuming that you're everything about you is so public.

2330
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
You can find out a lot of things.

2331
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
So that's the problem that I always have with psychics.

2332
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Yeah.

2333
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Don't tell me something that I already know.

2334
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:13,000
For her is to tell you tell you something that nobody else could possibly know.

2335
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:18,000
But even that well, nobody else could possibly know is stretch.

2336
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Right.

2337
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
But tell me something that I don't know.

2338
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:27,000
When whenever I've had friends that have gone had psychic readings, I always say, well, how did they structure the questions?

2339
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,000
How would it just go?

2340
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,000
How did it go?

2341
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
What did they say?

2342
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Were they fishing around?

2343
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Did they accurately get to it or did they give you probing questions first?

2344
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
It's almost always probing questions.

2345
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
And they told me about my grandfather.

2346
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
How could they know?

2347
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I go, you know, you know about your grandfather.

2348
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Why don't they tell you some shit you don't know?

2349
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Everybody tells you things you already know.

2350
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Tell me something I don't know.

2351
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,000
So that'll be the challenge for her, wouldn't it?

2352
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Is to be able to to tell you to tell Joe Rogan things that essentially only Joe knows.

2353
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,000
No, don't tell me things.

2354
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,000
I know.

2355
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
OK. Tell me things.

2356
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I don't tell you things.

2357
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:06,000
It's a reality that I'm not aware of that has nothing to do with me or that may happen soon.

2358
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Well, something along those lines.

2359
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Yeah, something where, you know, don't say you're going to spray paint my house.

2360
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
But it's supposed to be a sitting for Joe.

2361
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Yes, I understand.

2362
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,000
So it's just the problem is they tell you things you already know.

2363
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,000
And I'm like, this is just I guess I guess there's something to that.

2364
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Right. There's some sort of clairvoyance to that.

2365
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:29,000
You're saying, well, then that's only relevant because they're reading my mind, which is a whole.

2366
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
That's what I'm saying.

2367
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Well, I'm saying they're they're telling you they're giving you these questions in a way like I have a friend who does this.

2368
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
He's a mentalist.

2369
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,000
He does it out of Las Vegas.

2370
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
And he tells me it's all bullshit.

2371
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
He tells me how he does it.

2372
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:47,000
He tells me how he structures these questions and probes people and gets people to give up information.

2373
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Then he makes these educated guesses.

2374
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
And then they start saying, oh, my God, I can't believe you know that.

2375
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:54,000
You are not supposed to say anything more than yes or no.

2376
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
You don't talk during the sitting.

2377
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
You're supposed to say yes or no.

2378
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
That's it or say or say nothing.

2379
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,000
That's it.

2380
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:02,000
You're not supposed to talk.

2381
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
OK. Well, listen, I haven't experienced this before.

2382
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
I try to keep an open mind.

2383
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,000
If someone actually could do this, that's pretty pretty spectacular.

2384
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:26,000
But to my understanding, and I've spent a lot of time reading about these things and reading about skeptics and the James Randi challenge and all these different people that have tried to attempt to demonstrate psychic ability that no one has ever successfully done that.

2385
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:29,000
OK, let's go back earlier.

2386
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Am I wrong, Jamie?

2387
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Well, wait a second.

2388
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Like the James Randi challenge.

2389
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Oh, he was a fraud.

2390
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Forget about it.

2391
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
James Randi was a fraud?

2392
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Yeah, he was.

2393
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,000
He wouldn't have ever paid out anything if somebody had been successful.

2394
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,000
People all know that.

2395
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:47,000
No, he would not have paid it out because he disputed arbitrarily disputed everything that would have been attempted.

2396
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:51,000
And finally, people quit because he was not going to be fair in his judgment.

2397
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:54,000
What is fair, though, in terms of psychic ability?

2398
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:57,000
If you could prove psychic ability beyond a shadow of a doubt.

2399
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:01,000
But what was his what was his rules?

2400
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Like, what did he want you to establish?

2401
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I don't care about James Randi.

2402
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
I care about Joe Rogan.

2403
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:09,000
And my wish we never talked about this.

2404
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,000
We just stuck with aliens.

2405
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,000
OK, but wait a second.

2406
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Wait a second.

2407
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Earlier, correct me if I'm wrong.

2408
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:20,000
You actually said, yes, there could be legitimate mediums.

2409
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Yes, possible.

2410
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Yes, possible.

2411
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:26,000
And there can be better ones and really terrific ones and maybe capabilities.

2412
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Yeah, maybe.

2413
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:32,000
But my problem is your conviction, your belief in this is so strong.

2414
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Well, no.

2415
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:39,000
But what happened to the Joe of just a little while ago that says, yeah, there can be legitimate mediums.

2416
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,000
That Joe's open minded.

2417
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
They're all fraud because I know a magician.

2418
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
No, that Joe's open minded.

2419
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
I'm willing to believe that it's possible.

2420
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:53,000
But I don't understand why you're so convinced by just one story about music in a room.

2421
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Maybe that's what happened.

2422
02:31:55,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Maybe this lady tuned in to the Akashic records and figured out that there's some music in the room when your wife is dying.

2423
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I would argue start with in time is precious for a busy guy like yourself.

2424
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:14,000
But you have to start with reading good literature, reading good books.

2425
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
OK, tell me a good book on psychics.

2426
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
I'll have to send you a list.

2427
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:24,000
I'll send you a list of things to read and I will do that.

2428
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,000
You've got to give me how I do this.

2429
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,000
OK, we'll talk afterwards.

2430
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:33,000
But you understand that most skeptics believe that this is all bullshit, right?

2431
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Well, they would or they wouldn't be skeptics.

2432
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
But I mean, that's what they do.

2433
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
They study things that are extraordinary.

2434
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
There's open minded skeptics, too.

2435
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,000
You can be skeptical but still be open minded, right?

2436
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Right.

2437
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:52,000
And I don't immediately buy off on anything I'm told just because I hear something.

2438
02:32:52,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I like to get to a point where I stay open minded and then I may start to shift into saying there's more and more maybe to this.

2439
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Let me investigate more.

2440
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I'm not going to let go until I investigate more.

2441
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:13,000
So just because I had one sitting here with this particular person, I've had others years ago.

2442
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
But you seem particularly convinced that...

2443
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Well, this particular person was very good.

2444
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,000
It was three and a half hours long.

2445
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:26,000
OK, so was there another example besides just the music?

2446
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Yeah, there were a number of other examples.

2447
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:35,000
I'd have to stop and regurgitate everything.

2448
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:36,000
OK.

2449
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Because right now I'm all pumped up for questions about space, cosmology, ETs, survival of consciousness, and what kind of car is the most fun to drive.

2450
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
What kind of car is the most fun to drive?

2451
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,000
The Lamberdoodle.

2452
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,000
The Lamberdoodle? What is that?

2453
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:56,000
It's a name I gave a car I just bought.

2454
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
What is it?

2455
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:06,000
It's an orange Lamborghini called Ursa.

2456
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Ursa, yeah, the truck, the SUV.

2457
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Yeah, it's an SUV.

2458
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:16,000
640 horsepower, four-wheel drive, eight speeds forward.

2459
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
It's the most fun car I've ever had in my life.

2460
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:19,000
It's a cool car.

2461
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
My friend Russell Peters has that exact same car.

2462
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Who does?

2463
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Russell Peters, hilarious stand-up comedian from Toronto, Canada.

2464
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,000
It's an exciting car.

2465
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Yeah, he loves it.

2466
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
He's got the same color, too.

2467
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:41,000
In fact, I bought two, and one's going to be given away at the Larry Ruvo Cleveland Clinic gala in October in Las Vegas.

2468
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
It's going to be auctioned off.

2469
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Oh, really?

2470
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,000
And the price of that car is $286,000.

2471
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Out the door, that's tax and everything, and he's going to auction that car off come October.

2472
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:54,000
I think they're lining it.

2473
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
I think it's more than that.

2474
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:58,000
I think that car's like $300,000-something, isn't it?

2475
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
That's an expensive car.

2476
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:04,000
It says MSRP base is $200,000.

2477
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Oh, the base, $280,000 for the base.

2478
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Yeah, Russell's was super loaded up.

2479
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,000
You ought to be at the gala to bid.

2480
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,000
No.

2481
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Why not?

2482
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,000
I've got things to do.

2483
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Why not?

2484
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I'm busy.

2485
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:18,000
I'm going to be talking to a psychic.

2486
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Larry Ruvo puts on a hell of a show every year for these galas, and they're fantastic.

2487
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:23,000
I'm sure.

2488
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Sounds like a good time.

2489
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
So that's the most fun car to drive?

2490
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
For me, it has been.

2491
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:31,000
What other cars have you driven that are like contenders?

2492
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:39,000
I have a Corvette my wife bought me when I was turning 70, and I can't control it.

2493
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Which one?

2494
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Is it a ZR1 or something?

2495
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,000
I don't know.

2496
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:45,000
It's a Stingray.

2497
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,000
It's too much car.

2498
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
It's goosey on the rear end.

2499
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:51,000
It's too slow.

2500
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
I can't predict where it's going to go.

2501
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Well, I just need to learn how to handle it.

2502
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,000
The new Corvettes are better for that.

2503
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,000
They're mid-engine now.

2504
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,000
I can't see out of them.

2505
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,000
The new ones?

2506
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
The rear window.

2507
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:03,000
There's no rear window.

2508
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,000
It's like four inches high.

2509
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Yeah, it is a little smaller.

2510
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
And an 18-wheeler is up behind you.

2511
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,000
What do you do?

2512
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Hit the gas.

2513
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Yeah.

2514
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Don't let them be behind you.

2515
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:12,000
They make me too nervous.

2516
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
I understand.

2517
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Yeah, the new ones are pretty sweet, though.

2518
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:19,000
It's much better traction with the mid-engine design.

2519
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Let's get back to aliens.

2520
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,000
We've been talking for a long time, but I really want to talk to you about this.

2521
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:34,000
What evidence do you think is the best evidence in terms of what physical evidence?

2522
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Is it just video?

2523
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Is it just photographs?

2524
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Or do you think there's physical evidence that either our government or some other government has somewhere

2525
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:49,000
that could show beyond a shadow of a doubt?

2526
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Because I know Jacques Vallée, who was on the podcast before, discussed

2527
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:58,000
that we were talking about specific metals that had been examined,

2528
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:03,000
that these alloys, that if they had been produced in mass,

2529
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:07,000
it would be billions and billions of dollars for these alloys.

2530
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:14,000
And that this was, although not evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence,

2531
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,000
seemed to indicate that because of the examination of these alloys,

2532
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:22,000
that this is not something that's mass-produced in this country right now,

2533
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:26,000
or in any country right now, that this is something that if it was done,

2534
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:30,000
it would cost an insane amount of money to create, but yet here it is.

2535
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Right.

2536
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Yeah, so people have pieces of things that are like that, that have been,

2537
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I don't know, I assume they've gone through electron microscope for a look-see,

2538
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:53,000
but they are very unique in how thin they are, how many layers of material they have,

2539
02:37:53,000 --> 02:38:04,000
and the view, the opinions are that we can't make them.

2540
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:08,000
And that these things have been recovered from crash sites?

2541
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Apparently.

2542
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Apparently.

2543
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Yeah.

2544
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:17,000
But that is part of the problem, right, is that there's so little real concrete information.

2545
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Like, there's no consortium of scientists that's aligned together that's saying,

2546
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:27,000
this is 100% from another planet, we've all examined this,

2547
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,000
we've got together with the people at Stanford, and we've done these tests,

2548
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:35,000
and this is what we know, and here's the press conference, right?

2549
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
But that's never happened yet.

2550
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Well, so far there have been investigations on these materials, and they're anomalous.

2551
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Yeah.

2552
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Do you think that's the...

2553
02:38:49,000 --> 02:39:01,000
They could be, you know, something that's part of the kitchen of the UFO, you know,

2554
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:07,000
some bowl that they ate out of, you know, who knows?

2555
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Because how can you tell about a craft just because of one little piece?

2556
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Right.

2557
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Other than Bob Lazar's experiences, which, you know, he has, of course, the most spectacular experience,

2558
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I actually haven't been there at S4.

2559
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:29,000
You know, I wish there was a way we could convince whoever is in charge of that

2560
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:33,000
to allow people to film this, to allow people to examine this,

2561
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:36,000
to bring in the scientific community if it is a real thing.

2562
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:42,000
But the other thing about the Lazar story was that element 115.

2563
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:46,000
What are your thoughts on that?

2564
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:54,000
This was the idea that there was some super spectacular element that was a new version of propulsion.

2565
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:59,000
So instead of shooting something out of the back end, it was literally bending gravity.

2566
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Yeah.

2567
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:04,000
I don't know enough about it to really comment.

2568
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:10,000
I mean, I'm not saying about anything to do with disparagingly with Bob Lazar at all.

2569
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:14,000
I'm just talking about the element 115.

2570
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:23,000
I have no understanding of its properties and what it can do or not.

2571
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:28,000
I don't have any information like I do on these other subjects, survival of consciousness.

2572
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Yeah.

2573
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
I don't have any information about element 115.

2574
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Did you talk to Bob about it?

2575
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Oh, no.

2576
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:46,000
No, the conversations about it were somebody had taken his

2577
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:55,000
and he was kind of regretful that he had let go of it in some way and he wanted to get it back.

2578
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
And this was when he was at S4.

2579
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Yeah.

2580
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:06,000
But I don't remember much about conversations about how much, what all of its properties were

2581
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:09,000
and that kind of thing.

2582
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Did you bounce a ping pong ball and it didn't come back to you straight?

2583
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:17,000
It took off in a different direction or something or a candle flame?

2584
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
I don't know about those things.

2585
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
I don't know.

2586
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:31,000
But I think that I had something else I was going to say and I forget now on that 115.

2587
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Oh, well.

2588
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
I forget what I was going to say.

2589
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:39,000
These diagrams of the UFO.

2590
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Oh, I know what it was.

2591
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Okay, getting back to these kinds of treasure.

2592
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:55,000
You were talking earlier that really what ought to happen is there ought to be a major program

2593
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:01,000
where you're gathering all the best scientists to analyze the hell out of all these materials

2594
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
that have been retrieved.

2595
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:14,000
But the problem is a lot of this stuff purportedly is in corporate hands.

2596
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Corporate hands.

2597
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
And some in government hands.

2598
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:27,000
And it's come to be kind of corporate treasure and national treasure at the same time

2599
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:37,000
because there's a relationship between a company and the government that has this kind of treasure.

2600
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:40,000
It's a national kind of treasure.

2601
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
No pun intended there.

2602
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:45,000
But in a sense, it's a national treasure, right?

2603
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:52,000
And so it's also a phenomenal treasure that isn't understood.

2604
02:42:52,000 --> 02:43:00,000
And so the problem is it may be the most precious thing around.

2605
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:04,000
You don't have diamonds that are more valuable.

2606
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Especially if it really is from an extraterrestrial craft.

2607
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Exactly.

2608
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:18,000
And so it's drug out every 10 years, looked at to see if there's anything that has improved in 10 years

2609
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:24,000
on the understanding of X, Y, and Z that makes sense or has something else shifted.

2610
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Has something else happened in the last 10 years that could make a difference

2611
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:35,000
on trying to understand the material or craft or whatever.

2612
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
So you think that's what they do with it?

2613
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:41,000
They drag it out when technology has advanced and say, what do you think now?

2614
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Right.

2615
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,000
And allow people to examine it.

2616
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:46,000
And then it goes back in, storage.

2617
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Because not enough has changed.

2618
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Not enough has changed.

2619
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:53,000
We were talking about the speed of technology, but it's all relative, right?

2620
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Right.

2621
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:59,000
So this technology is so much more advanced.

2622
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:04,000
You could do 10 years for 100 years and still be way short.

2623
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Now how do you know that this stuff is in corporate hands?

2624
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Is this just hearsay?

2625
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Is this the discussions you've had?

2626
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:12,000
I would imagine because you're so open about your interests

2627
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:17,000
that in your conversations with other people, whether it's at NASA

2628
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:21,000
or there's got to be other folks that also have similar interests

2629
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:26,000
that come to you and want to talk to you about these things.

2630
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Yeah.

2631
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:32,000
So there's a community of people, not necessarily NASA people,

2632
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:39,000
but that have been trailing this for years.

2633
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:42,000
George Knapp, for example.

2634
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:53,000
And so it's not poorly known that certain corporations are involved.

2635
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
It's not poorly known.

2636
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,000
So it's kind of common knowledge?

2637
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Among certain folks, yeah.

2638
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,000
That corporations are involved because they recovered it or they acquired it

2639
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:08,000
and that if they were able to mass produce whatever these alloys are,

2640
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
whatever these particular properties of these metals are,

2641
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:16,000
there would be obviously some amazing commercial value for this stuff.

2642
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:23,000
It may be too precious for that.

2643
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:28,000
What about bodies?

2644
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Now are you talking about the Las Vegas desert or what?

2645
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
I'm talking about alien bodies.

2646
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,000
No, not like Sinatra's enemies.

2647
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Splashes in Lake Mead at one o'clock in the morning off of a cliff?

2648
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
I'm talking about alien bodies.

2649
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:45,000
That was one of the weirdest stories about Roswell,

2650
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:50,000
was that they had not just recovered a crashed UFO,

2651
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:53,000
but they had recovered these alien bodies.

2652
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:58,000
What do you think about Jackie Gleason's wife's story about he and Richard Nixon?

2653
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Yeah.

2654
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Nixon taking him to the base and showing Jackie.

2655
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Yeah, I remember that story.

2656
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:08,000
I had a friend who knew Jackie Gleason,

2657
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:15,000
and he said that Jackie Gleason had recreated in his backyard what he saw,

2658
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:16,000
what Nixon showed him.

2659
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:17,000
Oh, wow.

2660
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Yeah, that apparently he was so blown away by Nixon.

2661
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
I guess they were drinking.

2662
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,000
This is the legend.

2663
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2664
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Nixon and Jackie Gleason were drinking.

2665
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Jackie Gleason's a fucking hilarious guy.

2666
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:29,000
Probably loved to drink.

2667
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Definitely loved to drink and probably so fun to drink with.

2668
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Him and Nixon are talking, and Nixon says,

2669
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:36,000
you want to see a UFO?

2670
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:39,000
And takes Jackie Gleason to wherever it was,

2671
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Hangar 18 or wherever it was where they had this UFO and shows him,

2672
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:47,000
and apparently changed Jackie Gleason's life,

2673
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:48,000
and he couldn't stop talking about it.

2674
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:54,000
And what I had heard was that he had it recreated in his backyard, this thing.

2675
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:55,000
See if there's a story about that.

2676
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:56,000
That's a powerful impact, isn't it?

2677
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:57,000
That's a story I'm looking through.

2678
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

2679
02:46:58,000 --> 02:46:59,000
He saw something.

2680
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Yeah, listen, I'd be friends with Nixon just for that.

2681
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:02,000
It wasn't because of the booze, right?

2682
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
No, no, I don't think it was because of the booze.

2683
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:11,000
I mean, look, I am as ridiculous as it sounds for someone who doesn't believe in psychics.

2684
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
I'm a believer.

2685
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
I want to believe, you know?

2686
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:20,000
That's probably part of my problem is that I want to believe.

2687
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Sure, sure.

2688
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:24,000
And also, there's so many planets.

2689
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,000
There's so many stars.

2690
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:29,000
I mean, the universe is littered with planets.

2691
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:33,000
And the idea that this is it, that you and me, this is as good as it gets?

2692
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
Well, the odds of that are a trillion to one.

2693
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Yeah, they're not that good.

2694
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:37,000
It's off the table.

2695
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
The odds are so unlikely.

2696
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:42,000
And then when you take into account people like Commander David Fravor,

2697
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:46,000
who I've had the pleasure of sitting down and talking to and listening to his explanation,

2698
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:53,000
and then when you realize that the way his vehicle, the vehicle that he observed moved,

2699
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:58,000
mirrors what Bob Lazar talked about from 1990.

2700
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Now we're talking, we're in this weird realm of like, huh, so I'm a believer.

2701
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Yeah.

2702
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:13,000
So if the government has it, I mean, shit, in the 1960s when Nixon was president

2703
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:17,000
and him and Jackie Gleason are partying, that's a credible story.

2704
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Or at least a fun one.

2705
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,000
I always thought it was.

2706
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,000
You find anything?

2707
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:26,000
I find the thing about the backyard because it just keeps bringing up his UFO house he had in New York,

2708
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:29,000
which is like a UFO shaped house and a bunch of interesting cool shit inside.

2709
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Oh, wow.

2710
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Maybe that's part of it.

2711
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Okay.

2712
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:39,000
Upon his arrival, armed guards took Gleason to a building in a remote location on the site.

2713
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:43,000
There, Gleason, who harbored an intense interest in UFOs,

2714
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:49,000
saw the embalmed bodies of four alien beings, two feet long with small bald heads and big ears.

2715
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
He was told nothing about the circumstances of their recovery.

2716
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:57,000
He swore his wife to secrecy, but after their divorce, Beverly freely discussed the story.

2717
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:58,000
That bitch.

2718
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,000
He swore to secrecy.

2719
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:03,000
That's what happens when you divorce them.

2720
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:10,000
In the mid 1980s when UFOlogist Larry Bryant sued the US government to get it to reveal its UFO secrets,

2721
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:14,000
he tried without success to subpoena Gleason.

2722
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Holy shit.

2723
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
So that's the thing in his house.

2724
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:18,000
That's his backyard.

2725
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:19,000
That's his UFO house.

2726
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:23,000
So he built a house.

2727
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,000
So that was what they were talking about.

2728
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
It wasn't that he just built a UFO.

2729
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:29,000
He built a fucking house shaped like a UFO.

2730
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Where is that?

2731
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:31,000
New York.

2732
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Is that still there?

2733
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:35,000
You ought to buy it.

2734
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
That's what I'm talking about, bro.

2735
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,000
That's what I'm talking about.

2736
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:39,000
It was for sale.

2737
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Well, here's the reality.com thing for it.

2738
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:42,000
12 million.

2739
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,000
12 million.

2740
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Oh, that's a little steep for a fucking house.

2741
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:46,000
He couldn't negotiate.

2742
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Must be negotiable.

2743
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:48,000
But it's Jackie Gleason.

2744
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
It's probably worth it just because it's Jackie Gleason's.

2745
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Listen, The Hustler is one of my all time favorite movies.

2746
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:54,000
I'm a pool player.

2747
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:58,000
And so that movie, I've seen that movie literally probably a hundred times because they used

2748
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:01,000
to put it on in the executive billiards in White Plains, New York.

2749
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
They would play it late at night all the time.

2750
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:04,000
So we would be playing pool.

2751
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:05,000
They'd put The Hustler on.

2752
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Everybody loved it.

2753
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Such a great movie.

2754
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
And Jackie Gleason was amazing in it.

2755
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
And a serious role too.

2756
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Not a comedic role at all.

2757
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
He was great in The Honeymooners, wasn't he?

2758
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:15,000
He was great in everything.

2759
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Jackie Gleason was great in Smoking the Bandit.

2760
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:18,000
He was just great.

2761
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,000
I loved that guy.

2762
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:22,000
But I love him even more because he's a UFO freak.

2763
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Do you think that they have some sort of body somewhere?

2764
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Yeah.

2765
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:30,000
You do?

2766
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,000
I do.

2767
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,000
What makes you think that?

2768
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:42,000
I think, what would it be?

2769
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Why do I think that?

2770
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:51,000
I'm trying to narrow it down.

2771
02:50:51,000 --> 02:51:03,000
Well, I think that I'm trying to not get into conversations.

2772
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:13,000
So I think that because it's in the,

2773
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:20,000
I think there are enough different kinds of sources in the media about people seeing things.

2774
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:32,000
I did an interview years ago with Sapphira Henderson and Stan Friedman and Kevin Randall.

2775
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:39,000
Went to her house in California because her husband was Pappy Henderson.

2776
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:48,000
And Pappy Henderson was one of the pilots that flew material, flew stuff out of Wright-Patt.

2777
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:56,000
And she said, he said, they were in a grocery store one day and the Inquirer had a big article,

2778
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Aliens Revealed, so on and so forth.

2779
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:02,000
And they're at the checkout stand.

2780
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:06,000
And she said he took the story seriously.

2781
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:12,000
And after they checked out, he said, well, I guess I can tell you now because it's out.

2782
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:13,000
So he told her.

2783
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
He thought the Inquirer was serious?

2784
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
He thought it was, whatever it was, Inquirer I think it was.

2785
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Could have been some other one.

2786
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:21,000
But I just used that as a one of those tabloids.

2787
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:22,000
As one.

2788
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Yeah.

2789
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Magazine.

2790
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:27,000
And he said, well, I guess the story's out.

2791
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:37,000
I can tell you now about I flew the crates and wreckage out of,

2792
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
and he told her about the whole UFO thing.

2793
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:46,000
And I believe that she said that he said to her there were bodies.

2794
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Now this was part of the story that went with the whole Roswell crash,

2795
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:59,000
was that there was a local mortuary that was told to make small coffins

2796
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:02,000
and that people had said that they had seen these bodies

2797
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:08,000
and that the wreckage was flown in two separate planes to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

2798
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
And that if they really thought it was just a balloon,

2799
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:13,000
why would they fly it in two separate planes to Wright-Patterson?

2800
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
And that Truman, it was Truman, right?

2801
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:19,000
How is it they couldn't recognize balloon material from something else

2802
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:22,000
and you had a brief field that was a quarter mile wide, half a mile long?

2803
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Yeah, it's all pretty fantastic stuff.

2804
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:29,000
But again, part of my problem is I want to believe that's part of my problem,

2805
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:32,000
is that I'm willing to bullshit myself.

2806
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Well, do you believe in a God force?

2807
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:36,000
A God force.

2808
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
A God or a God or a God force?

2809
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:41,000
Do you believe there is such a thing?

2810
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Can you define it?

2811
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Well, do you have any belief that there is a supreme being of the universe

2812
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:58,000
or a God force of some kind?

2813
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:02,000
I don't think it's impossible.

2814
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
I don't know.

2815
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:07,000
I don't know what creates a big bang.

2816
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
What starts this whole process?

2817
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
What causes nature?

2818
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:15,000
What causes all these elements to fuse and create carbon-based life?

2819
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:21,000
What causes planets to exist in a Goldilocks range around the sun?

2820
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Is it just happenstance? Is it coincidence?

2821
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
So, big bang, you know, is on its way out.

2822
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
The big bang is on its way out?

2823
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,000
It's on its way out.

2824
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:31,000
Oh, okay. So it's like fossil fuels?

2825
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:34,000
So string theory is on its way out.

2826
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Is it?

2827
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Yep.

2828
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:39,000
What about all those guys that have been scribbling shit on legal pads for years?

2829
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:48,000
A physicist friend of mine said very recently that perhaps an entire generation has wasted its time.

2830
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:52,000
We've lost an entire generation of people, maybe longer than that, in my opinion.

2831
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
So what do they think now?

2832
02:54:54,000 --> 02:55:05,000
The thinking is, first of all, it's a little bit bogus to think that the universe extends only as far as you can see,

2833
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
13.5 billion light years.

2834
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:12,000
I think they don't believe that, though. They think that's just as far as we can measure it, right?

2835
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Well, they assume that the universe is expanding, and they're judging that based on 13.5 billion light years of sight.

2836
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,000
Right.

2837
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Okay? That may be a very, very small neighborhood, but that's as far as the cave wall is, and you're not seeing beyond the cave wall, right?

2838
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:42,000
You're also telling me that you know a lot about the cosmos, and you want me to believe you, but yet you don't know what 95, 96 percent of the cosmos is of the energy.

2839
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:45,000
You have no idea. Dark energy, dark matter.

2840
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Right.

2841
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:47,000
You haven't a clue.

2842
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Right.

2843
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:55,000
And you're telling me that you know all this stuff about the cosmos, and you're missing 96 percent of the information. Really?

2844
02:55:55,000 --> 02:56:01,000
I think what they're trying to tell us is this is what we know so far, and I think that's what they're trying to tell us.

2845
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:15,000
I think they're as perplexed about dark matter and dark energy as we are, but they have a lot of information about background radiation, about the signals that seem to indicate...

2846
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:16,000
In a neighborhood.

2847
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Yeah.

2848
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:18,000
In a neighborhood.

2849
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,000
Yeah, in a neighborhood.

2850
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:20,000
In our neighborhood.

2851
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Well, if the universe is infinite, 13 and a half billion years is nothing. It's like literally this block.

2852
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Yeah.

2853
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Not even.

2854
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:30,000
And then, of course, what's singularity? You know, Big Bang started from what?

2855
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:31,000
From what?

2856
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:32,000
From what?

2857
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Right.

2858
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:47,000
And so string theory, a series of what, 11, 12 theories, hypotheses stand on top of each other, and they all have to be perfect. They all have to fit, for you to wind up with this other conclusion that basically everything started from nothing.

2859
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:56,000
Well, they don't think it started from nothing. They think it started from an infinitely small point that exploded in an instant and created all the matter that we see in the universe today.

2860
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:59,000
Okay. So I concede the head of a pin as not being nothing.

2861
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:00,000
Okay.

2862
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:01,000
I concede that.

2863
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:04,000
Well, better concede it because it's got more matter than anything in our solar system or galaxy.

2864
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:07,000
I've got to concede that that's the theory. That's only the theory, though.

2865
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Okay, right. It's just a theory.

2866
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Right, just a theory.

2867
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Right.

2868
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:11,000
So it's just an opinion.

2869
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:14,000
Right, but it's an opinion by people that have been studying this their whole lives, and they...

2870
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
And now it's going out the door.

2871
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:17,000
It is?

2872
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
That's what I've been told.

2873
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Who told you that, the psychic?

2874
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:21,000
No.

2875
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:28,000
No, if I correlate the physicist that told me that along with the psyche, do you really have something here?

2876
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:40,000
No. I think there's been a bunch of different ideas about the Big Bang, whether or not it's a constant cycle of expansion and contraction, and then there's been...

2877
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
I kind of actually like that one.

2878
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Yeah.

2879
02:57:43,000 --> 02:58:02,000
I like that a certain kind of steady state of elasticity, expansion and contraction that continues to go on and on with the orderly force being whatever dark energy and dark matter is to maintain organization, to maintain harmony and everything.

2880
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:10,000
So you reach maximum elasticity, and then it starts to retract again to your density as maximum density, and you do this all over.

2881
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:13,000
That is a theory that I've heard.

2882
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:14,000
I like that one.

2883
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Another theory that I think is pretty fascinating is the theory that inside of every black hole might be another universe.

2884
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:38,000
That the idea of inside every galaxy apparently is a supermassive black hole that's exactly one half, I think it's one half of one percent of the mass of the entire galaxy, so this intense, massive black hole at the center of every galaxy.

2885
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:55,000
And the theory, at least the one that I had read, was that if you could go through that black hole, you would enter into another universe, and that each of these galaxies has infinite, like there's infinite number of galaxies, essentially.

2886
02:58:55,000 --> 02:59:06,000
There's hundreds and hundreds of billions of galaxies, and each galaxy has a black hole inside of it, a supermassive black hole, and that through that you would go into another universe.

2887
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:15,000
And that there's infinite universes, because there's just all these portals, and inside each one of them there's hundreds of millions of galaxies or hundreds of billions of galaxies.

2888
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
Each one of them has a black hole.

2889
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Go through that, you reach more universes with hundreds of billions of galaxies, and that's true infinity.

2890
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:26,000
And you can have the same effect if you have infinite bubbles.

2891
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
So you have multiverses that are these bubbles.

2892
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:34,000
Maybe the bubbles are 100 or 200 billion light years in diameter, you know, and they're just unlimited.

2893
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:38,000
So I don't buy that space is finite.

2894
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:39,000
I think it's endless.

2895
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
I don't think there ever was a beginning.

2896
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
I don't think there was an end to the universe.

2897
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:56,000
And so I think time is only relevant when it's connected to some kind of matter or electrical energy or like electrons or protons or something like that, and otherwise there's no time.

2898
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Because what are you measuring it against?

2899
02:59:58,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Right.

2900
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:02,000
So that means then, okay, time could be infinite.

2901
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Okay.

2902
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
And so is distance.

2903
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:08,000
There was no beginning and there is no end.

2904
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
Yeah, that freaks us out.

2905
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:15,000
But so should 13 and a half billion years, 13 and a half billion light years.

2906
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
That should freak you out too.

2907
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:23,000
All of it is beyond our possibility of understanding because it's just so massive.

2908
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:26,000
Like when you see the number 13 billion, it's like, okay, I see it.

2909
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:29,000
I know how many zeros there are, but my brain's not ready for that.

2910
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
It doesn't really compute.

2911
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:35,000
But what does that have to do with the concept of God, though?

2912
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:38,000
So I was asking you, do you believe in a God force?

2913
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
And you said, yes, you think so.

2914
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
I said it's certainly possible.

2915
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Okay, now why do you think it's possible?

2916
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:54,000
Because the universe is so spectacular that the idea that there's some force that's created it doesn't make it any less spectacular.

2917
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
It's so insane.

2918
03:00:56,000 --> 03:01:04,000
Just what you're looking at on a night sky, on a clear night sky, if you're in a place with no light pollution, is so insane.

2919
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:10,000
The idea that there's some God force as well that makes all these things happen and creates all these things,

2920
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:15,000
and there's actually like a good path and a bad path for at least sentient life forms,

2921
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:23,000
and that there's some sort of ultimate goal for this matter coalescing, like, it's possible.

2922
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:33,000
So if you think there's a God force that's omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, what role does thought play in that?

2923
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
That's a good question.

2924
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Thought could be what we were talking about earlier, that this could be how this human animal creates,

2925
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:49,000
how this human animal innovates, and how it interacts with other animals and gives it motivation to create and innovate,

2926
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:53,000
and this is what creates this new form of life.

2927
03:01:53,000 --> 03:02:03,000
I've often said that I think that human beings might be some sort of biological caterpillar that gives birth to an electronic butterfly,

2928
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:10,000
that we create something because of our desire for innovation and for material possessions and for...

2929
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
There's a lot of weird instincts that people have.

2930
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
You've got to wonder, how are these serving us?

2931
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Like, how is it serving us to live your whole life to try to buy a new house in Alexis?

2932
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
Like, what is it? What is it about that?

2933
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:28,000
Well, there's something about the pursuit of material possessions that encourages innovation and encourages the production of things.

2934
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
That's what people do. They make things.

2935
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:38,000
And if this is what our goal is, just like a bee makes a beehive, and we make things, what's the ultimate expression of those things?

2936
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:41,000
Well, the ultimate expression would be a new form of life.

2937
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:45,000
And it seems there's a lot of work being pushed in that direction.

2938
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:51,000
There's a lot of work being pushed in the direction of artificial intelligence, of robotics.

2939
03:02:51,000 --> 03:03:01,000
I mean, there's so much research that's going on right now to try to create these autonomous things that move around on their own,

2940
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:10,000
whether it's autonomous soldiers for the battlefield or whether it's drones that can fly themselves and operate on artificial intelligence.

2941
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:20,000
This direction is going to eventually, if you talk to people far smarter than me, like Elon Musk is terrified of it because he thinks it's unchecked

2942
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:31,000
and that it's going to lead to something that's super potent, sentient, far smarter than us, and has no use for us the next stage of life.

2943
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
Not a good thought.

2944
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:42,000
So then you keep it open that God can be a creator and can respond to the power of prayer.

2945
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:51,000
If you are praying for somebody, and there are a lot of studies that say the power of prayer works more than just a placebo kind of effect,

2946
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:57,000
that it actually works if you have a control group and a group that you're praying for,

2947
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:06,000
a group that's, you know, there have been a lot of tests like this that are blind, double blind tests, and it works in a laboratory kind of context.

2948
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:15,000
What is it that's responding to the request for prayer? Is it a God force? What is it that's responding?

2949
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:21,000
I don't know that that's true. I don't know that it's true that prayer works like that.

2950
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:27,000
I do know that the placebo effect works, and I do know that the mind has extraordinary properties that we haven't harnessed.

2951
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:33,000
I do know that people have the ability to change their state of mind, and it'll change their physical well-being.

2952
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:39,000
I do know that people have the ability to boost their immune system through breathing exercises and meditation,

2953
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:47,000
and that we don't totally understand how they're doing that or why they're doing that, or why we can't recreate that without that kind of discipline.

2954
03:04:48,000 --> 03:05:01,000
There's a fellow who's written some good books. He's an MD, retired, and I guess he left the hospital world

2955
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:05,000
because he was intrigued with the anomalies he found among his patients.

2956
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:13,000
And one of his books, I think, has something to do with the title of Power of Prayer. His name's Larry Dawsey, Dr. Larry Dawsey.

2957
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:20,000
And it's a really book that's worth reading. He authored it quite a few years ago.

2958
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:24,000
And he talks about the power of prayer.

2959
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:33,000
The power of prayer, and I think he gets into the investigation of the power of prayer that works.

2960
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:40,000
I think that also probably works in a negative way, too, right? This is what the concept of voodoo was.

2961
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:45,000
The concept of voodoo was that someone puts a curse on you, and they let you know they put a curse on you, and then your life is fucked,

2962
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:50,000
and then you get it in your head that your life is fucked, and then you have this self-fulfilling prophecy.

2963
03:05:50,000 --> 03:06:03,000
Well, supposedly the results under tested, you know, legitimate test conditions are that the results are greater than you can explain otherwise,

2964
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:11,000
just because of just you may not even know that you're being prayed for. So it's a controlled situation.

2965
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:15,000
So you don't even know that you're part of the group that's being prayed for.

2966
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:18,000
How would you measure that, though, when you're talking about response from illness?

2967
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:25,000
And everybody varies depending upon your immune system, and there's a lot of different things, your nutrition, youth, health.

2968
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:40,000
I think that gets into how the tests are set up in order to make sure that they're balanced in the group, the sample group that's being prayed for, or the person, maybe it's an individual.

2969
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:45,000
I think if someone knew you were praying for them, it would help. That seems to make a lot of sense.

2970
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:54,000
If you know you're being loved, it would make you feel better, it would make you energized. When you're loved, there's a feeling, a reaction.

2971
03:06:54,000 --> 03:07:10,000
According to the literature, not just his book, but others, that it helps also the number of people that are praying for you, and how committed everybody is to that, how earnest they are in the effort. So apparently that matters.

2972
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
What do you think about all that, Jamie?

2973
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
It's a lot.

2974
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:17,000
It's a lot. It's a lot to think of.

2975
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Listen, Robert, we've had a long conversation here. I think we're at three hours in?

2976
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
Yeah.

2977
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Three hours.

2978
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:28,000
It's been interesting.

2979
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:29,000
With no restroom break and I'm just fine.

2980
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:37,000
You're amazing. A lot of people, they tap out early. They'll run out to pee. You handle it like a champ.

2981
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:44,000
But thank you for all your work. Thank you for all the things you're interested in investigating, and thank you for your time to come here and sit down and talk to me.

2982
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:50,000
Hey, this is my pleasure. This is for me. It's a great honor to be able to be on your show.

2983
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:53,000
Thank you. It's an honor to have you. I appreciate it. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

2984
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:54,000
Thank you.

2985
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
Goodbye, everybody.
