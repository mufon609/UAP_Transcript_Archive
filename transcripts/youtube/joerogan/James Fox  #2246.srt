1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,480
It's a very good time to have a UFO expert in.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,000
A lot has been going on.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,520
This is, you know, I had, I know you ran into him.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
I had Ryan Graves on yesterday.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,520
Oh my God.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,000
I'll tell you the funniest story about how I ran into him.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,560
You ran into him in the lobby of the hotel, right?

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,160
The lobby told me, they were all, don't use this one elevator.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,000
It's really rickety and it makes a lot of noise and it's just, it's not very reliable

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and just don't use it.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So I didn't.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,200
And then I was leaving 24 hours later to come down and get some coffee.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
And I was like, ah, fine.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Let me take the rickety elevator.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,040
I was like, they told me not to take it, but I'm going to take it anyway.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
So I pushed the button.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
I'm standing there.

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,000
I hear this, the door's open.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,240
I look, I see this shadowy figure in the corner.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm like, Ryan Graves, what are you doing?

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
He goes, I don't know.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
What are you doing?

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,200
I was like, are you doing what I think you're doing?

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
He goes, yeah.

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Did he tell you that?

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Did he tell you that?

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Yes, he did.

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
He told me he ran into you.

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,600
He didn't tell me the whole story about the rickety elevator.

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,320
And he was like this shadowy figure up against the corner, like kind of just, you know, looking

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,320
at it.

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,320
He was looking at me.

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
It was really funny.

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,720
We had a lot of, we talked a lot of nonsense about aliens, but we also talked about the

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,320
technology that he knows is state of the art when it comes to drones.

37
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,840
And that some of these ones in New Jersey, they're doing things that you can't really

38
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
do yet.

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Yes.

40
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Yeah.

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Which is really fascinating.

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Because it's like, okay.

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
And they're the size of SUVs.

44
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Right.

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
So is it ours?

46
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,960
And we somehow or another have some stuff that the mainstream drone manufacturers at

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,320
the highest level aren't aware of yet?

48
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Is it ours?

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,840
Is it like some crazy military stuff?

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,080
Because if it's not, and it's coming from the ocean, like, what do you mean it's coming?

51
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
What the fuck do you-

52
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,760
Fifty of them.

53
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,800
What do you mean?

54
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,040
What do you mean 50 suburban sized?

55
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
So check this out.

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
UFOs are coming out of the ocean.

57
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
This is really funny.

58
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,840
I've been working with this guy.

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,080
We've been communicating on the signal for a long time.

60
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,480
Actually he was through Proton.

61
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,880
He was emailing me stuff about Virginia, the UFO crash in Virginia.

62
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,080
And but he was anonymous.

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,520
One day I was like, he's really knowledgeable.

64
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,480
And he was sending me stuff that was really helpful.

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,800
Like you should track down this flight.

66
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,720
If it happened, it was going to this airport, go to this base.

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,960
And I was like, finally one day I was like, who are you?

68
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
And how do you know what you know?

69
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,640
He goes, I'm a retired United States Air Force colonel.

70
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,160
I was like, oh, and he goes, and I'm also an experiencer.

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,880
I had an experience back in 1980, blah, blah, blah.

72
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,360
So what happened to him?

73
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
He had a UFO encounter.

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,680
It's in the movie towards the end.

75
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,680
But anyway, he texted me yesterday and he goes, James, I really want you to explain

76
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,000
to me how the hell you orchestrated a UAP invasion right around the time your film's

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
coming out.

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
I was like, I really like to know how you did that.

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,320
I was like, I know I could.

80
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,160
Do you know what kind of a budget you would have to have to have drones running in the

81
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,240
sky all over?

82
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,000
How many different cities are reporting it now?

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,280
Like what's the numbers?

84
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,440
It's exploding all over all over the place and it's getting better.

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,560
I've heard California, I've heard Europe now bases in England, New York, New Jersey.

86
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,480
I've heard San Diego.

87
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,720
I definitely wasn't there something in Ohio, right?

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

89
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,280
They had to shut that place down.

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,400
Yeah, that's Ohio.

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,120
So I've heard New Jersey.

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,480
I think Florida, right?

93
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,120
That was the one that Ryan Graves showed us a photo of that was from Florida.

94
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,160
So like, who fucking what's going on?

95
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,440
Who fucking knows?

96
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
I was super busy.

97
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,400
You know, I had the release of the film going on.

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,000
And so I was like trying to focus on that and getting everything lined up.

99
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,680
It was a huge push and all these text messages from all around the world are

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,600
pouring in like, what the hell's going on with these drones?

101
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,160
And I was like, it's probably something conventional.

102
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,280
I'm not going to worry about it right now.

103
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,720
I'm trying to keep on focusing what I got what I got at hand here.

104
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,240
And then I started getting more information coming in, more information

105
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,200
that a buddy of mine called me.

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,520
And he actually went to Brazil with me a couple of years ago.

107
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,720
And he's like, bro, I live here.

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,480
I'm seeing these things in the sky.

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,360
I've seen them seven times now.

110
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
They're the size of an SUV.

111
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
I was like, well, what do they look like?

112
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,600
What do they behave like?

113
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,160
He's like, well, they're making noise.

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,120
I was like, OK, well, that quickly kind of eliminates

115
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,680
something non-conventional in terms of propulsion.

116
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,320
But then I got reports of objects that didn't make any noise.

117
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
And it would go silent.

118
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,160
What kind of noise it was making?

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,960
Like propellers drones would make, but loud.

120
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,000
And they have a loiter.

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,880
But they're big.

122
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,600
And they have a loiter time of hours.

123
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,120
The average drone, like I fly drones for my films,

124
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,200
is like you're lucky to get 25 minutes.

125
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,800
These things are there for hours.

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
Yeah, five hours at a time.

127
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,960
They go dark when they're approached by other objects.

128
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,520
They're not getting picked up on FLIR at times.

129
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,920
And then some of them have no noise.

130
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,160
I've heard crescent-shaped.

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,720
And then I heard about the ones that really got me,

132
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,120
because I contacted Christopher Mellon.

133
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,720
I was like, Chris, what is going on, buddy?

134
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,880
I really rely on him for good information.

135
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,680
And he's like, I really don't know, man.

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,800
It's a real shit show.

137
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,120
And the US government seems to be clueless right now.

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,760
He goes, some of them are conventional.

139
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,240
Some of them are misidentified conventional craft.

140
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,760
But there are other ones coming in off the ocean that are up

141
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,280
to 50, the Coast Guard and Police Department are reporting

142
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,920
that truly remain a mystery.

143
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,240
And then you had Schumer at a press conference,

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,800
just like it was yesterday.

145
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,160
And then he's going, and he's like,

146
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,520
we don't know what they are.

147
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,360
We don't know what they are.

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,600
And the guy goes, yeah, so it's a UAP.

149
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
He goes, well, they're drones.

150
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,000
He goes, well, you wrote the legislation.

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,840
It's a UAP.

152
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,720
It's Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon.

153
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,960
Why don't you just use UAP?

154
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,040
I think they're using the word drone

155
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,920
because UAP is almost too scary.

156
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,800
Like some kind of invasion's happening.

157
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,560
That's what, UAP is Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon?

158
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
Couldn't that be kind of anything?

159
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,680
It doesn't even mean flying.

160
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
Well, that's the thing,

161
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,360
because it used to be Unidentified Aerial,

162
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
well, it was UFO, Unidentified Flying Object.

163
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,200
Then it was UAP, Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon.

164
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,000
But then they're coming out of the water, right?

165
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,840
I feel like this is nonsense.

166
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,680
So they said anomalous.

167
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,320
Why don't they just keep using UFO?

168
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,840
Because it has, because people associate UFO

169
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,120
with otherworldly and they wanted to take that,

170
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,480
remove that baggage and make it a little less scary.

171
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,960
That's my personal opinion.

172
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,400
I kind of get that.

173
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,600
But also, it's just an Unidentified Flying Object.

174
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,080
If we find out what it is,

175
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
then it becomes an identified flying object.

176
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,120
It doesn't necessarily mean it's alien.

177
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
True, right?

178
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Like think of the stealth bomber.

179
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,200
People probably jumping out of their windows right now

180
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,400
if they said UFOs are invading the East Coast.

181
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,560
You remember World of Worlds?

182
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,720
Right, that's true.

183
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
People were like jumping out of their windows.

184
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,400
That's a good point.

185
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,440
That's actually a very good point.

186
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,680
So I think they touted it out.

187
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,840
I think they're using the word drone,

188
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,080
even though they're unidentified,

189
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,280
just because of the fear factor.

190
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,560
I think the fear factor's real.

191
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,280
Yeah, I can't help but cringe when I hear that word.

192
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,120
Oh, sorry.

193
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,320
The fear element.

194
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,520
It's so funny.

195
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,360
Sorry.

196
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,480
It was too much of a part of my life.

197
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,400
Too close to home.

198
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,720
So when did they start?

199
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
When was it acknowledged that this was an issue

200
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,440
that was reoccurring recently?

201
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,320
Like, obviously there's always been something in the sky.

202
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
People have always seen things.

203
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,080
Who knows what they are, whether or not they're,

204
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,440
a lot of people see Starlink

205
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,480
and they think it's UFOs, right?

206
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,520
Yeah, yeah, of course.

207
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,240
But when did this drone thing

208
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,800
that we're currently experiencing basically every day,

209
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,680
when did it start?

210
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,920
Couple weeks ago.

211
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Maybe a month ago.

212
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,880
That's when I started really hearing about it.

213
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,360
Jamie, is there any sort of official answer to that?

214
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
I have something that-

215
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,680
20th, 19th, something like that.

216
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,520
Mid-November.

217
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,760
Mid-November.

218
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,720
This episode is brought to you by GoPuff.

219
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,400
Does grocery shopping drive you nuts?

220
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,160
The lines and the chaos and the inflated prices.

221
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,680
Then you have all these third-party delivery apps

222
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
with their ridiculous fees, markups,

223
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,240
and you still have to wait hours for delivery.

224
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,080
Well, enter GoPuff, the game changer.

225
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
They deliver snacks, groceries, alcohol, essentials,

226
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,760
whatever you need straight to your door in just 15 minutes.

227
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,000
And get this, it's cheaper than the store

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
because GoPuff uses their own fulfillment centers.

229
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,720
No middleman, no crazy markups.

230
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,520
It's like Amazon, but for everyday essentials and way faster.

231
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,840
GoPuff also just launched cheapest on the planet pricing.

232
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Think $2 organic eggs, $2 milk, $5 diapers, $10 Tide Pods.

233
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,280
It's insane.

234
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,920
They're beating big grocery stores at their own game.

235
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,400
So do yourself a favor, download the GoPuff app

236
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,600
on your phone, use the code ROGUE20 for $20 off your order

237
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,520
and experience faster, cheaper, better shopping.

238
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,120
Trust me, you'll thank me later.

239
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,920
I have something that this is about an air base

240
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,040
in Vandenberg Air Force Base in 2003.

241
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,120
And this is not an anonymous,

242
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,080
but this is about incursions over, listen to this.

243
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,760
I promised this individual that I met at Seoul Conference.

244
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,840
He's a witness, he's a military guy.

245
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,400
My name is Jeffrey Nusatelli.

246
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,080
I served 16 years in the United States Air Force

247
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,280
as a technical sergeant and a military police officer.

248
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,080
In October 2003, my coworkers and I witnessed a series

249
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,440
of extraordinary UAP incursions

250
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,360
at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

251
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,360
The initial event is known as the Vandenberg Red Square.

252
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,600
And it was first mentioned during the historic UAP hearing,

253
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,920
UAP hearing held in 2023.

254
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,200
The case involved Boeing contractors

255
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,480
who witnessed a huge red square shaped object,

256
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,760
roughly the size of a football field,

257
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,920
hovering over a missile defense system.

258
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,320
The object was silent

259
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,520
and had no visible means of propulsion.

260
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,240
The contractors watched in amazement

261
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,120
as the massive object slowly drifted east

262
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,280
and vanished over the hills.

263
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,800
I retained official Air Force records of the event,

264
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,080
including the blotter form entry,

265
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,160
which includes the names and contact information

266
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,360
of all the witnesses and provided it

267
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,240
to select members of Congress, Aero and the FBI.

268
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,000
Aero is a new UAP task force,

269
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,520
All Domain Anomalous Resolution Office.

270
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,840
After the initial event,

271
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,520
several other UAP incursions took place at Vandenberg.

272
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,240
I was on duty during many of the encounters

273
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,160
and I investigated the incidents as they unfolded.

274
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,440
Now remember, this is not anonymous reporting here.

275
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,000
They include a football field sized craft

276
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,400
that terrified security guards

277
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,440
as it silently hovered over a launch facility

278
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,000
before flying off at an unbelievable rate of speed.

279
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,920
A brightly illuminated silent object

280
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,280
that landed on the base flight line

281
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,800
before accelerating instantaneously

282
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
and disappearing into space.

283
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,960
A huge triangular shaped craft larger than a C-130

284
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,600
that hovered 50 feet over a police officer

285
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,320
before it drifted slowly over the base.

286
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,960
A blue-white liquid orb roughly the size of his house

287
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,000
that hovered over his house on the base.

288
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,440
The object stayed no sound

289
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,280
and had zero obvious means of propulsion.

290
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,440
And he says, my experiences with UAP

291
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,840
were awe-inspiring, exciting and terrifying.

292
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,120
I don't know why UAP are flying over our bases

293
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,080
and our neighborhoods,

294
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,360
but I do know the UAP phenomenon

295
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,520
is of the utmost importance to all of humanity.

296
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,080
I currently have five other military witnesses

297
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,880
to the Vandenberg incursions

298
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,080
that are all willing to testify tomorrow under oath

299
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,720
that these statements are true.

300
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
We need answers to this mystery

301
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
and better government transparency.

302
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,000
Thank you for the opportunity to share my story,

303
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,480
former United States Air Force technical sergeant

304
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,800
and witness, Jeff Nusitelli.

305
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,360
Whoa. Crazy, right?

306
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,880
I mean, we're talking object the size of a football field?

307
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,720
That's bananas.

308
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,640
And then they take off in insanely fast,

309
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,880
just like the tic-tac.

310
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,000
Straight up into space.

311
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,840
So, what was the exact date of this?

312
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,160
This was 2003.

313
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,600
There was a number of incursions during that year

314
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,880
up all the way into 2005.

315
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,440
And he has the names and they submitted it

316
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,560
to the new head of arrow.

317
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,080
That's interesting because that coincides with the tic-tac.

318
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,920
It does coincide with the tic-tac.

319
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,160
I wonder if it's like vacation season.

320
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
It's like every few years.

321
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
Let's go check out what those guys are up to.

322
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,520
You know what I mean?

323
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Maybe it's like a real pain in the ass to get here.

324
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,480
Maybe it's one of those things like,

325
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,680
you can go to Australia, but it's a pain in the ass.

326
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,840
It's 16 fucking hours on a plane.

327
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,760
It's a long flight.

328
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
Oh my gosh.

329
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,240
I went to South Africa one time and that was like 22 hours.

330
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,360
I was like, the plane's gonna run out of gas.

331
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,520
That's exactly what I'm saying.

332
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,880
It's like one of those things.

333
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,000
It's like, you can do it, but it's a pain in the ass.

334
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,440
So, maybe they only travel to Earth every now and again.

335
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,000
How could these incursions have been taking place

336
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
and like, here we are 20 years later

337
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,880
and we're only now really starting to talk about them?

338
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,360
I think the reason being is if you don't understand it

339
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,200
and you can't protect people from it

340
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,640
because it's so beyond our capabilities

341
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,200
that if just describing it accurately

342
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,520
removes all confidence that our government

343
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,680
has everything under control.

344
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,480
That's one reason why.

345
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,920
And also, if you have no answers,

346
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,280
you don't know what the hell it is.

347
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,120
That's a very good point, yes.

348
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
If you don't know what the hell it is,

349
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,440
what are you even gonna say?

350
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,840
Hey, there's something that came.

351
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
We don't know what the fuck it is.

352
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,280
It's as big as a football field,

353
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,440
shot off into the sky.

354
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
We have no idea.

355
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,560
They'd be like, what do you mean we have no idea?

356
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,840
Hire someone who understands this

357
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,720
and then they'd be like, fire him.

358
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,760
Get him out of hospice.

359
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,680
I remember, like 20 years ago,

360
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,640
bright-eyed bushy-tailed, totally naive,

361
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,280
still naive, but I was meeting with a general

362
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,240
and I said, God, it'd be so amazing.

363
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,400
This story is so unifying

364
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,480
and we had this kumbaya moment

365
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,880
and we discovered that we're not alone in the universe

366
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,000
and wouldn't that be amazing?

367
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,480
And blah, blah, blah, the implications for all of humanity.

368
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
And he sat there almost chuckling at me.

369
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,320
And he looked at me and he goes,

370
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
you got it all wrong, man.

371
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,480
You gotta see this through our lens.

372
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,760
I was like, through your lens?

373
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,400
He goes, yeah, the military's perspective.

374
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,560
I was like, okay, tell me.

375
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,760
And I never thought about this before.

376
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,240
You just mentioned it.

377
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,120
He goes, okay, imagine this scenario.

378
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,800
We sit there and we say, my fellow Americans,

379
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,640
it has been brought to our attention

380
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,160
that there are craft of unknown origin

381
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,760
whizzing around with impunity in our airspace.

382
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,040
They exhibit a technology that's light years advanced

383
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,160
from anything that we have.

384
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,880
We don't know who they are, where they come from,

385
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,840
what they want.

386
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,000
Shall they turn to be hostile?

387
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,200
We have no visible means of defense against them.

388
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,160
Thank you and good night.

389
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,000
You're fired.

390
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,840
You're fired.

391
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,680
You're fired.

392
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,640
And someone like Trump will come along.

393
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,040
I'll make a deal with the aliens.

394
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,960
But you see that predicament.

395
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,360
People always go, why the secrecy, duh.

396
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,800
Yeah, you have to have secrecy

397
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,760
because you gotta imagine the job of a politician

398
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,040
in general, right?

399
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,600
You have to pretend that you're gonna be able

400
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,920
to handle situations that you well know

401
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,360
you're not gonna be able to handle.

402
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,640
If you're running for president,

403
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,320
you know that you're not gonna fix this economy.

404
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,240
All right, stop.

405
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,080
Just stop.

406
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,120
I'm gonna wave the magic wand

407
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,960
and it's all gonna be taken care of.

408
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,360
You know you're not gonna implement electric cars

409
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,880
over the, stop, stop.

410
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,840
Shut the fuck up.

411
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,880
There's not enough batteries.

412
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,560
So if you're lying about all that,

413
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,240
you're probably gonna lie about whether or not

414
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,480
you can handle the alien threat.

415
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,520
I will unite us.

416
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,360
I will unite us as a planet

417
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,040
so we can deal together with the aliens.

418
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,880
Yeah, let's do that.

419
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,840
Let's do that.

420
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,680
That's all you have to do

421
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,520
is just say some bullshit like that.

422
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,360
And then someone probably bends his ear

423
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,920
when he gets into office and is like, yeah.

424
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,760
A good speaker.

425
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,920
About that disclosure.

426
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,160
Like a J.D. Vance, like a guy like that.

427
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,880
Very bright, young, energetic speaker.

428
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,840
He can convince people he can talk to the aliens.

429
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,680
He can convince people that he can unite us all.

430
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,160
Have you seen the program?

431
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,000
No, I have not.

432
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,680
Okay, so there is-

433
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,600
Explain it to everybody.

434
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,280
Okay, so the program, basically,

435
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,680
it's funny because the last time I was on the show,

436
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,800
we were talking about an alleged crash retrieval case

437
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,600
that took place in Virginia, Brazil in 1996.

438
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,960
And your documentary on it, which is-

439
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,080
Yeah, Moment of Contact.

440
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,520
Amazing, amazing documentary.

441
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,720
So we're talking about that,

442
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,240
and I came off the heels of doing The Phenomenon,

443
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,200
which touched a little bit

444
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,800
on a potential crash retrieval program,

445
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,520
but then it was like,

446
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,960
then it was the crash retrieval over in Virginia, Brazil,

447
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,720
and then I got hyper-focused on that,

448
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,200
and then I had sort of, it was a personal journey for me,

449
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,440
was, okay, the elected officials, what do they know,

450
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,600
and when do they know it?

451
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,840
Do we have a crash retrieval program?

452
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,600
That's what I set out to do.

453
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,640
And then three months after I was on your show,

454
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,160
in April of 2023, the highest level intel officer,

455
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,720
David Grush, testifies under oath

456
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,200
that there is a crash retrieval program,

457
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,480
and that the government does have definitive proof

458
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,440
that we're not alone.

459
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
So he kind of opened the door for me,

460
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,760
and a lot had happened since the release of The Phenomenon

461
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,880
and Moment of Contact.

462
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,640
There was all this legislation,

463
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,880
there was the first congressional hearing,

464
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,080
there was behind closed doors meetings

465
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,000
with a number of intel officers and witnesses,

466
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,200
and then you had the second congressional hearing,

467
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
which was David Grush, which was absolutely phenomenal.

468
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,920
I'm sure you saw that, right?

469
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,280
And then just recently, just a couple of months ago,

470
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
we had the third congressional hearing,

471
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,600
which I actually, funny enough, got to attend.

472
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,840
So it was the first time in my 30 years investigating.

473
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,640
I was actually sitting behind people

474
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,520
while they were testifying under oath

475
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,800
about legitimacy of The Phenomenon,

476
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,240
as well as there's a crash retrieval program.

477
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,520
I mean, people have to understand

478
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,320
that feel like maybe things aren't happening fast enough.

479
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,240
Just a couple years ago,

480
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,480
they didn't even admit that The Phenomenon is real.

481
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,960
Now there's people testifying under oath

482
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,760
that we have a crash retrieval program.

483
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,280
So drip, drip, drip, things are happening,

484
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,120
they're not putting the genie back in the bottle.

485
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,880
Do you wonder at all that you're being mind-fucked?

486
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,080
Do you wonder at all that this is a massive PSYOP

487
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,800
and this is all just to cover up

488
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,760
some very advanced American weapons technology?

489
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,160
I think it's a very good question,

490
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,240
and here's why I don't believe that,

491
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,520
because I have done 30 years of field research, right?

492
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
So I've gone to China, I've been to Russia,

493
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,520
I've been to Australia and Africa and South America,

494
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,720
Canada, Alaska, all across Europe, United States,

495
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,280
and I've investigated close encounters of the third kind.

496
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,680
Ask your audience, don't take it from me,

497
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,200
but the United States Air Force investigated and categorized

498
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,520
close encounters of the first, second, and third kind,

499
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,440
during their official capacity, Project Blue,

500
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Blue Book.

501
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,240
Great fucking movie, by the way,

502
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,560
if you haven't seen it, folks,

503
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,000
Close Encounters of the Third Kind,

504
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,560
probably the best alien invasion movie of all time.

505
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,080
Dr. Heineck has a cameo appearance in that film,

506
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,920
did you know that?

507
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,760
I had heard that.

508
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,960
I don't remember who he was, though,

509
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,720
but wasn't the French guy, didn't he?

510
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,560
Jacques Follet.

511
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,440
Jacques Follet has a cameo,

512
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,560
well, there's a guy acting his part,

513
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,760
but actually, Dr. Jalen Heineck,

514
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,120
who's a scientific advisor to Project Blue Book

515
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,640
all those years for the Air Force,

516
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,040
actually has a cameo appearance,

517
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,960
smoking a cigar during the encounter.

518
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,800
And that's him.

519
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,640
Oh, that's right, that's right.

520
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,480
That's Dr. Heineck.

521
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,560
That's right, smoking a pipe.

522
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,080
Smoking a pipe, and a lot of the cases right down

523
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,720
to Richard Dreyfuss's face being burned by the UFO,

524
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,880
those came directly out of Project Blue Book files,

525
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,120
even the description of what the entities looked like.

526
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,440
Close Encounters, again,

527
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,000
Close Encounters of the Third Kind,

528
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,080
this is the United States Air Force documenting this stuff.

529
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,560
And he took it directly out of Project Blue Book files

530
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,840
and made a movie out of it.

531
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,120
And as a little wink, wink, nudge, nudge,

532
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,280
he has Dr. Heineck have a cameo appearance in the movie.

533
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,120
You know what?

534
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,560
Most people don't know that.

535
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,080
It's a fantastic movie, too.

536
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,920
It's a great movie.

537
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,960
Because it's a movie that's filled with,

538
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,520
it's not like standard UFOs land.

539
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,700
There's some play going on.

540
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,620
There's some weirdness to the way they interact with us

541
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,180
that sort of is much more realistic

542
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,580
in terms of the things that people experience.

543
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,940
They experience interactions, very strange interactions.

544
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,180
And when they had those little orb-like things

545
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,340
that were flying around in the movie,

546
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,700
that's all straight out of like, yeah.

547
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,580
Oh, 100%.

548
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,620
I remember I had a buddy of mine,

549
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,820
he was a pilot over in Europe in the 70s,

550
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,500
and he used to come for family dinners

551
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,340
and he was always talking about it,

552
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,540
and I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

553
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,700
And then later we're all in the life of it.

554
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,540
Foo fighters.

555
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,780
When I started getting interested in UFOs,

556
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,820
I was like, Michael, tell me about that UFO

557
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,940
and kind of you had that red orb.

558
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,100
He goes, it was just like it was in The Close Encounters

559
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,140
of the Third Kind, Steven Spielberg's movie.

560
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,420
And I was like, ah, they took those files directly

561
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,660
out of project movie files and right onto the big screen.

562
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,340
That's what the foo fighters were, right?

563
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,260
Yeah, foo fighters, too.

564
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,220
They had little orbs.

565
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,060
Yeah, these fighter pilots are flying around.

566
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,420
They're seeing these things with them.

567
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,940
Well, let me ask you,

568
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,340
and this is why that I don't think it's a Psy-Op thing.

569
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,420
I don't think it's a Psy-Op either.

570
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,940
Well, the reason why I don't is because, okay,

571
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,940
I don't just believe Grush

572
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,140
because he testified under oath

573
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,220
and he is a high level intelligence officer.

574
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,940
That's very impressive.

575
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,020
I believe Grush because his claims align

576
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,980
with my personal research in the field.

577
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,900
Remember, I've investigated crash retrieval programs,

578
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,220
crash retrieval cases, right?

579
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,300
And so I was, I mean, when I put out Moment of Contact,

580
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,820
well, actually, when I went in to put out Moment of Contact,

581
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,540
people were going, James, you just dropped

582
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,020
one of the biggest, most successful UFO films

583
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,820
in terms of transcending the UFO community

584
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,300
and penetrating a much broader, more mainstream audience.

585
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,340
Are you sure you want to put out a documentary

586
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,780
that deals with an alleged crash and live aliens

587
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,940
walking around the town of Virginia, Brazil?

588
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,540
Like, seriously, that's what you want to put out there?

589
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,180
You got access to like Harry Reid

590
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,360
and all these intel insiders, and now you want to do that?

591
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,980
You're going to tarnish your reputation.

592
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,820
It's a bad-

593
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,660
Who gave you that advice?

594
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,500
A lot of people did.

595
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,360
I wish you called me.

596
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,200
Well, you-

597
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,020
I was like, James, you can handle it.

598
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,540
You probably heard about Moment of Contact,

599
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,420
and then you thought, oh, this sounds too crazy,

600
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,540
then eventually you watched it.

601
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,820
No, I thought, well, I always think a crash

602
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,260
and contact sounds crazy.

603
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,500
I know, and it does.

604
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,460
I always think that,

605
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,340
but I would have never told you not to do it.

606
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,160
Oh, okay.

607
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,000
I would have never told you not to do it.

608
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,840
You're really good at this.

609
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,680
You know how to, like,

610
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,340
you're really good at explaining-

611
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,660
But you look half the town talking about it,

612
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,500
including the mayor.

613
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,380
Well, that's an incredible story.

614
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,220
It's an incredible story.

615
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,060
It's a phenomenal story.

616
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,220
It's one of those stories where you're like,

617
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,580
if everybody's in on this, this is crazy.

618
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,420
If everybody's telling it,

619
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,020
and no one, there's not one contrarian that comes out

620
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,620
and goes, they all told me to lie.

621
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,920
I'm not fucking lying.

622
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,760
This is stupid.

623
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,920
They're doing it for tourism.

624
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,760
Oh, yeah.

625
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,580
Not one person?

626
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,420
Come on.

627
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,260
There's always some hater.

628
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,820
There's always some hater who wants to ruin your gag.

629
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,660
I remember-

630
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,500
You know what I mean?

631
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,340
Oh, yeah, no, I totally do.

632
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,060
I remember when I was making Moment of Contact

633
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,980
and I wasn't done with it yet,

634
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,900
Lou Elizondo was like, he's like, James, he called me up.

635
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,980
He goes, I need a copy.

636
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,140
I was like, the film's not done.

637
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,980
I don't care.

638
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,800
I need a copy.

639
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,640
Give me a rough cut.

640
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,480
I don't care.

641
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,440
And he's like, okay, what's the urgency?

642
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,400
And he's like, you don't understand

643
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,040
who's watching this right now.

644
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,760
So I was like, okay, so I'm giving him copies.

645
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,760
And I had absolutely no idea ever in a hundred million years

646
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,120
that I think we're gonna be having months

647
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,020
after the release of Moment of Contact,

648
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,600
a congressional hearing under oath

649
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,680
that was a crash retrieval program.

650
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,040
What year did Moment of Contact come out?

651
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,760
It came out at the end of 2022.

652
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,120
Do you think Biden watched it?

653
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,640
Do you think he sat down with Biden?

654
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,840
That would have been wild.

655
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,760
He's been so dismissive at all.

656
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,120
Like, Obama said a lot more about it.

657
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,960
You know why?

658
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Because he's already in space.

659
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,840
He's in space right now.

660
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,680
He's like, go talk to Obama.

661
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,360
He's in orbit right now around Saturn.

662
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,200
I was like, really, that's the best you can do?

663
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,280
He's like Dr. Manhattan.

664
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,500
He's on the moon in a glass house.

665
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,000
Okay, let's say, if Biden, if you're listening right now,

666
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,440
you have nothing to lose.

667
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,920
You're the president of the United States, sir.

668
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,760
Release the hounds.

669
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,480
He's never running ever again.

670
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,320
Exactly.

671
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,600
He's not running for a second term.

672
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,440
Come on, we're done.

673
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,640
He's already part in more human beings

674
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,560
than any president ever, other than Carter.

675
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,300
Listen to the advice at the end of the program

676
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,480
by Senator Harry Reid,

677
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,880
who's now the late Senator Harry Reid.

678
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,760
And I said to him,

679
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,640
what advice would you give the president?

680
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,400
It could have been any president at the time.

681
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,440
And he said, don't be afraid of tarnishing your legacy

682
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,000
by addressing this issue head on.

683
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,680
And I hope that Biden gets to see that.

684
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,360
And I really hope that president-elect Donald Trump

685
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,320
gets to see that.

686
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,680
People are ready for the truth.

687
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,320
They've had enough of the line.

688
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,880
I think we're way beyond that at this point.

689
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
I agree with you.

690
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,260
However, when I confronted Mr. Trump, he was very cagey.

691
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,100
Was he really?

692
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,940
Very cagey.

693
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,120
I've seen some things.

694
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,920
They told me some things.

695
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,120
He didn't tell me shit.

696
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,380
He basically, it was basically like

697
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,000
neither confirmed nor denied.

698
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,880
No, there was no eyes.

699
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,000
I don't do that shit.

700
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,600
Especially to a pro like Donald Trump.

701
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
Like you're not, yeah, yeah.

702
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,280
You're gonna do it to an actor, so shut up.

703
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,200
You're not gonna know what the fuck they think.

704
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,400
Daniel Day-Lewis told you that he just ate a baby.

705
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,720
You'd fucking believe him.

706
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,760
You know what I mean?

707
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,600
You know what I mean?

708
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,160
Like this idea that what did his eyes tell you?

709
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,000
What did his eyes tell you?

710
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,880
It depends on the person.

711
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,000
Depends on the person.

712
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,680
If it's your regular crackpot and they tell you a lie,

713
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,960
like something's up.

714
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,840
But there's people that can hide things.

715
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
They can hide things behind their eyes.

716
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,440
I think he knows something.

717
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,800
I don't think he's that interested.

718
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,440
I think he's more interested.

719
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
I think he's sort of a no-nonsense type of guy

720
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,120
This is why.

721
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,080
You kind of have to be to be managing

722
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,480
multiple businesses simultaneously.

723
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,120
He's always done that his whole career.

724
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,560
Managed being on The Apprentice

725
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,840
while running these golf courses,

726
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,840
while having these buildings, apartment buildings, hotels.

727
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,720
He's constantly doing something.

728
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,680
So while he's doing all that, and he's playing golf,

729
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,160
while he's doing all that,

730
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,040
there's no time for fucking aliens, man.

731
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,440
There's no time for nonsense.

732
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,560
There's no time for sitting around with your buddies,

733
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,440
smoking a cigar going, what do you think, man?

734
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,960
I mean, if they fucking, if I was them, man,

735
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,600
I would do what they're doing.

736
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,560
You know, I wouldn't even,

737
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,080
there's no time for that nonsense talk.

738
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,360
That guy's got businesses.

739
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,720
But we got objects of unknown origin,

740
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,320
flying over residential areas,

741
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
flying over military bases,

742
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,040
flying over nuclear silos.

743
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,400
Well, now I think he's much more interested because.

744
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
That's a matter of national security.

745
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,760
I mean, people are freaking out.

746
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,680
Like, what the hell are we seeing?

747
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,240
And they're going, we don't know what they are,

748
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,600
but everything's fine.

749
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,720
Well, he's totally safe.

750
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,960
There's no national security issue here.

751
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,640
We don't know what they are, but you're fine.

752
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,480
Don't worry about it.

753
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,160
You remember, what was the Steven Spielberg movie

754
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,520
with the shark, the great white shark?

755
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,360
Yeah, Jaws.

756
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,480
Jaws, you remember when they're like, everything's fine.

757
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,320
The mayor.

758
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,360
The mayor is like, keep swimming.

759
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,240
Yeah, keep swimming.

760
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,280
The water's fine.

761
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,920
Everyone's saying people are getting bitten halfway.

762
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
That's the perfect analogy.

763
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,600
Dude, that is the perfect analogy.

764
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,440
That is it.

765
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,800
Everything's fine.

766
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,200
Go about your lives.

767
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,800
They're definitely not nuke sniffing drones.

768
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,600
Come on, nuke sniffing drones.

769
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,880
So what if some nuclear material was just stolen

770
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,960
off a cargo ship?

771
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,360
Whatever, whatever.

772
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,400
Guys.

773
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,320
All the online conspiracy stuff is crazy,

774
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,160
and I get a lot of it,

775
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,880
because obviously what I do,

776
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,520
and people send me all kinds of stuff.

777
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,560
I was like, well, hang on a second.

778
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,280
I wish I could put poods on the ground,

779
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,400
but no, there's something really weird going on,

780
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,560
and the fact that they don't know

781
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
or they're claiming that they don't know what it is,

782
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,720
and here's another really funny thing.

783
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,680
I actually, in the program that I did now,

784
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,920
and I hope you get a chance to watch it,

785
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,080
because it's crazy.

786
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,280
It's got.

787
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,200
Tell people what it is.

788
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,680
Okay, so basically I was talking about earlier.

789
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,080
Tell people the title the whole time.

790
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,400
It's called the program.

791
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,440
It's gonna be on, it just came out.

792
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,480
It's at number one right now.

793
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,320
It's on Amazon.

794
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,140
When did it come out?

795
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,980
Yesterday.

796
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,820
Oh, beautiful.

797
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,640
I know.

798
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,000
So it came out yesterday.

799
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,840
It's on Amazon.

800
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,640
It's on Apple TV,

801
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,480
and you can Google the,

802
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,720
because the algorithms are just starting to catch up

803
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,640
with it on Google right now,

804
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,480
because everyone's like,

805
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
I can't find it.

806
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,760
Look up the program,

807
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,720
and then Google James Fox UFO documentary, the program.

808
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,160
You will 100% find it.

809
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,720
It's being also made available internationally.

810
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,360
They're working as fast as they can to get it up.

811
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,520
It just went up yesterday.

812
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,720
It's the most independent film from start to finish

813
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,600
that I've ever made,

814
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,520
and it covers what happened,

815
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,720
because everybody thinks the government

816
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,760
suddenly had this epiphany

817
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,320
to decide to be more transparent with the general public.

818
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,720
That's not what happened.

819
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,740
What happened is there were a couple of intel insiders

820
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,280
in the Pentagon reviewing some of this classified data

821
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,800
or so-called classified data,

822
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,800
and resigned in protest of excessive secrecy.

823
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,280
They found a loophole.

824
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,660
This is Lou, probably Jay Stratton.

825
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,880
I don't know for sure.

826
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,520
Definitely Chris Mellon,

827
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
and they walked these evidence tapes

828
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,640
out of the Pentagon through this loophole.

829
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,680
They bent the rules a little bit,

830
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,900
and onto the front page of the New York Times, right?

831
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,280
So that happened,

832
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,800
and it got, it was just,

833
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,720
it was exploded.

834
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,000
You remember that.

835
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,360
Since then, there has been this unprecedented push

836
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,960
by a bipartisan group of lawmakers

837
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,320
to find out what the intelligence agencies know

838
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,400
and when they knew it.

839
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,160
So that started happening behind the scenes, right?

840
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,160
So it was 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,

841
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,640
and then in 2022, they were like,

842
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,040
we're having a congressional hearing.

843
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,520
Congressman Andre Carson,

844
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,600
I think he's of Wisconsin, but I'm not positive.

845
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,680
He spearheaded the first open congressional hearing,

846
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,240
public open congressional hearing,

847
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,760
and in that congressional hearing,

848
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,760
they acknowledged the fact that the phenomenon was real.

849
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,360
It was slowly introduced

850
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,560
that we were not getting told the facts.

851
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,320
There was a document that came out

852
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,600
called the Wilson Davis Memo,

853
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,800
and that was about the discovery by a former DIA guy,

854
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,880
Admiral Wilson, of the crash retrieval program

855
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,360
that was like maybe 20, 20 plus years ago,

856
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,320
and none of the names or anything

857
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,800
in that document were redacted.

858
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,200
I covered that memo in the film.

859
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,120
And then 2023, another congressional hearing.

860
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,360
This time it was David Grush

861
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,920
talking about the crash retrieval program.

862
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,400
It's been a steady progression,

863
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,040
and so a lot has gone on between 2017 and 2024,

864
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,680
and that is what this film does,

865
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,120
is it covers behind the scenes effort,

866
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,760
bipartisan, a group of lawmakers effort

867
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,560
to find out what the intelligence agencies really know.

868
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,360
Whew.

869
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,160
Yeah, and people that were,

870
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,640
and in one of them, there was an encounter,

871
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,120
and I think I remember you hearing about it,

872
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,640
because you wanted to get ahold of David Grush,

873
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,280
and so you contacted me,

874
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,680
and I actually had a drone up in the air in England,

875
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,000
and I was, I know,

876
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,680
and I had my phone attached to my drone thing,

877
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,520
because that's what it was using

878
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,360
as a controller for the screen,

879
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,640
and I'm flying the drone,

880
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,800
and there was a huge windmill,

881
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,640
and I saw this windmill,

882
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,480
and I was like,

883
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,880
oh, that's gonna make a beautiful shot for the movie,

884
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,000
and it is in the movie.

885
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,880
So I'm up there flying it,

886
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,360
and the wind, the turbines are going round and round,

887
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,280
and I can't quite tell how close my drone is to him,

888
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,920
so I'm paying really good attention,

889
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,360
and I'm getting close to these big turbines,

890
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,800
and all of a sudden my phone's ringing,

891
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,760
and it's you.

892
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,840
I'm like, oh my God, I can't not answer this,

893
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,400
I gotta answer, so I answered it

894
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,120
while my drone was up there,

895
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,040
and we talked briefly,

896
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,360
and you said, hey, can you get me in touch

897
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,600
with David Grush?

898
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
I said, yeah, I got a guy that can put you in touch with,

899
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,880
that was Jason Sands,

900
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,480
and I guess you and Jason Sands talked about

901
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,840
this alleged encounter in 1994

902
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,720
with this entity, alien,

903
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,640
whatever you wanna call him, in the desert.

904
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,480
Yes.

905
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,440
So that was a crazy story.

906
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,280
Crazy story.

907
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,240
But in any case,

908
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,120
so when you watch the movie and the program,

909
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,520
you'll see the drone flying dangerously close to these,

910
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,440
and that's funny, a little inside thing.

911
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,280
So it didn't crash.

912
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,120
It didn't crash,

913
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,560
but I was on the phone with you when it happened.

914
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
But when you watch the footage,

915
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,040
it's like, wow, that's really close.

916
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,880
Is that guy public with that story?

917
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,760
He, well, so.

918
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,280
Because otherwise I would discuss it.

919
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,360
Yeah, yeah.

920
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,760
Because it sounded so nutty.

921
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,600
No, no, yeah.

922
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,160
Okay, so here's what happened.

923
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,320
This is funny because

924
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,400
when I was in Washington, D.C. with Mellon

925
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,680
and this gentleman, Jason Sands,

926
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,440
I'm using his name now,

927
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,760
and Mellon looked at me and he goes,

928
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
this guy's story's pretty wild.

929
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,640
I was like, what do you mean?

930
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,160
He goes, really wild.

931
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,320
And we're sitting down having dinner

932
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,240
and Chris Mellon orders,

933
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,600
he orders a drink.

934
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,000
He had a tequila, so whatever.

935
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Anyway, and we were all having dinner,

936
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,040
and Jason Sands starts telling the story

937
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,000
about this alleged encounter in 1994.

938
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,040
And it's one of the craziest stories,

939
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,320
and I've been doing this for 30 years,

940
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,760
and this story is nuts, okay?

941
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,600
You remember it.

942
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,440
Oh, yeah.

943
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,400
Yeah, I went like this to my phone.

944
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,680
He was telling me like there was one.

945
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,880
Yeah, me too.

946
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too.

947
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,240
So I'll get it.

948
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,960
It was one of those, wait, wait,

949
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,480
what the fuck did you just say?

950
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,000
Insane, okay.

951
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,480
Tell everybody what we said.

952
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,320
I will.

953
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,160
I'll get to that in one second.

954
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,000
This is the reason why I can.

955
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,800
Well, the reason why I can discuss it publicly, I know.

956
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,400
The reason why I can discuss it publicly

957
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,360
is because he was gonna appear anonymously in the movie,

958
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,160
and I was debating on exactly how to go about doing this

959
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,480
because I was torn,

960
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,200
because you got a statement from an individual,

961
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,280
you don't have his identity,

962
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,200
but I was in DC, I put the whole thing down,

963
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,320
and I said, look, if he was worried about his security,

964
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,440
he was a whistleblower,

965
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,160
he'd already testified to a number of Senate Intel communities,

966
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,480
Senate Armed Service community, and.

967
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,800
All about the UFO phenomenon?

968
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,480
Yeah, about the UFO phenomenon.

969
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,040
They're part of the UOP task force.

970
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,800
They found him, and he was giving them information

971
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,280
and reporting on things.

972
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,280
And so he goes, I'm really fearful.

973
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,920
I don't know if this witness protection program

974
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,320
is gonna be that helpful.

975
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,160
I'm just, I'm worried.

976
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,640
I said, look, if you're concerned

977
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,480
about the story getting out or not getting out,

978
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,680
if you want, I'm here.

979
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,560
You can come to our studio,

980
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,760
we could film you on camera,

981
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,440
and if anything happens to you, it could be released,

982
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,880
and it could be a little insurance policy for yourself.

983
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,400
He goes, that sounds great, let's do it.

984
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,280
So I did a whole film about it.

985
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,160
And then I'm periodically posting clips,

986
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,640
or just still frames and updates on the movie

987
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,720
as I'm making it, as I do on social media.

988
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,560
And I posted this one scene,

989
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,760
and it had a clipboard in the scene.

990
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,360
And on that clipboard, if you zoomed right in,

991
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,720
it had his name.

992
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,640
So I posted the, by accident, I posted the damn thing,

993
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,760
and my phone starts blowing up 10 minutes later.

994
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,240
You just revealed this guy.

995
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,080
What are you doing?

996
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,240
Take it down, take it down, take it down.

997
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,640
Too late, too late.

998
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,480
So it was out there, and he's getting all kinds of heat.

999
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,520
So as a result of it, I'm giving the truncated version,

1000
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,480
he basically had to go through the Dobser process,

1001
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,160
which is basically pre-publication of authorization

1002
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,320
of what you can and cannot say.

1003
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,160
Excuse me.

1004
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,560
So he basically could talk about a number of cases

1005
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,480
that were in the film.

1006
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,560
We had to blurp out one particular word,

1007
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,960
which in the movie, it's blurred out.

1008
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,000
We had to do that, that was Dobser.

1009
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So it was the winter of 1994.

1010
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
There was a unidentified flying object

1011
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,440
that was picked up on the base.

1012
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,680
Old school, UFO.

1013
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,480
Oh, yes, sir, old school, it was a UFO.

1014
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,440
It was picked up on the base,

1015
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,160
and it was recorded by sensory data,

1016
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,440
and it was picked up on camera.

1017
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,040
It had camera footage of it from different locations.

1018
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,880
What did it look like?

1019
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,440
It looked like, it was a weird shape,

1020
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,920
it was like an unusual shape,

1021
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,000
and there's people talking about it, it's in the movie.

1022
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,840
And.

1023
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,920
The film is in the movie?

1024
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,640
The film footage that leaked from the base is in the movie.

1025
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,960
So you can see what it looks like flying around.

1026
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,200
Kind of, yeah, it's kind of blurry in some spots,

1027
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
and yeah, you'll see it.

1028
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,240
So.

1029
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,080
It's in the program.

1030
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,920
It's in the program, yeah.

1031
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,840
And then you hear all the voices.

1032
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,360
I actually had the voices cleaned up.

1033
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,160
You can hear people talking about, what the hell is it?

1034
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,000
Is there a clip we could see online?

1035
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,880
Just so I could show people what it looks like?

1036
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,320
Damn, I'm sorry.

1037
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,360
Could you maybe just say the actual name of the incident?

1038
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,400
Maybe Jamie can find it?

1039
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,440
Yeah, try and find it.

1040
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,960
It's Nellis Test Range UFO 1994.

1041
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,800
See if you can find it.

1042
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,640
People put stuff up so quick.

1043
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,240
It's long and it's really bad, yeah, true, good point.

1044
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,640
Cause it's on Amazon right now,

1045
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,880
people put clips up so fast.

1046
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, it's true, yeah, and there's other things on there.

1047
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,840
So in any case, so that, that, that video.

1048
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,920
Bam, there it is.

1049
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,520
Oh, that's terrible, there's much better footage of it.

1050
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,200
Yeah, there's much better footage of it.

1051
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,920
It's in my movie, I had it cleaned up.

1052
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,240
But yeah, that's it, basically.

1053
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,240
Can I see it again?

1054
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,760
So that's what it looked like?

1055
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,160
The footage I have is way better than this.

1056
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,520
Yeah, sometimes it's, so.

1057
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,400
So what did it look, Jesus Christ,

1058
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,240
you know what that looks like, Jamie?

1059
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,920
It's a very weird shape.

1060
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,200
Jamie, you know what that looks like?

1061
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,960
It looks like, looks like Terrence Howard's creation.

1062
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,760
Doesn't it?

1063
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,520
It's weird.

1064
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,760
What is it, what did he call that again?

1065
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,600
But it was.

1066
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,960
Those things that lock together?

1067
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,840
Those, you know, the flying drone thing that he created?

1068
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,640
Linchpins.

1069
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,440
Yeah.

1070
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,400
Terrence Howard created this fascinating concept

1071
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,440
for like a drone, where it's like propellers

1072
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,280
going all these different directions

1073
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,440
and they sync up and they link together,

1074
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,480
and it looks like that.

1075
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,040
Oh yeah, so it's, anyway, so it's footage,

1076
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,080
people talking about it, what is it, we don't know,

1077
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,840
it's not identified, and it flies around the base,

1078
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,520
and that leaked, and the names of the witnesses leaked.

1079
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,360
Three days later.

1080
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,400
I'm sorry to keep cutting you off,

1081
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,880
but can you just say what it did, like how it moved?

1082
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,960
It just, it was like, it didn't have any visible means

1083
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,360
of propulsion, it didn't have any wings,

1084
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,120
it didn't have propellers, it just looked like an object,

1085
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,840
a round sort of object, weird shape,

1086
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,560
almost like a helmet or something,

1087
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,040
with things coming off of it,

1088
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,440
and it was just moving around the base.

1089
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,280
How fast?

1090
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,200
Nobody, slowly at time.

1091
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,040
Oh, there it is.

1092
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,960
Okay.

1093
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,240
That's it, that's exactly it, yep.

1094
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,560
It's definitely not a big balloon.

1095
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,000
And you hear, no, you hear everybody talking about it,

1096
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,480
the audio that goes along with it,

1097
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,080
and I had it cleaned up, is, they're all talking,

1098
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,800
nobody knows what it is.

1099
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,480
So this is Zoom, is this why it's moved around like that,

1100
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,680
they're trying to keep it in focus,

1101
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,520
and they're zooming on it?

1102
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,360
It's all, Mr. Sands explains all of that in the film,

1103
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,040
the program, he talks about it.

1104
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,560
So anyway, so this leaks, people's names,

1105
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,560
the witnesses leaks, and three days later,

1106
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,200
he's in a convoy,

1107
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,520
Gesundheit, he's in a convoy,

1108
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,160
and it's early in the morning,

1109
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,160
and there's three jeeps, trucks, jeeps, in convoy,

1110
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,800
on a dirt road, heading out in Ellis Test Range,

1111
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,040
and they see what looks like,

1112
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,880
maybe somebody was involved in a plane crash,

1113
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,480
somebody that was struggling out in the middle of the desert,

1114
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,080
it was early in the morning, wintertime,

1115
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,280
and they're looking at this individual,

1116
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,400
and they're like, oh my God, is that a person,

1117
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,640
that individual needs some help,

1118
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,360
that individual looks like they need some help,

1119
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,600
they look cold, their skin had a slight blue tint to it,

1120
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,560
and they're looking at this gentleman,

1121
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,000
and they're like, hey, stop the convoy,

1122
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,040
this person needs help, medical attention,

1123
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,400
maybe they had a plane crash,

1124
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,440
and so we're gonna help this person out,

1125
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,640
and they pull the convoy over,

1126
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,760
and this individual comes up to the car,

1127
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,440
Jason Sands gets out the right side of the door,

1128
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,920
and as he's getting out, somebody in the truck screams,

1129
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,480
he's got no effing ears,

1130
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,760
and Jason says, he turns around, and he looks at this guy,

1131
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,360
and he had the same kind of uniform that they had had on,

1132
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,720
but the uniform was just immaculate,

1133
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,720
like there wasn't any dust on it, no dust on the boots,

1134
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,040
and he was thinking to himself, well, that's weird,

1135
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,160
this guy's got no ears, is this guy some kind of mutant?

1136
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,040
And he looks at him, and he said his eyes were a lot bigger,

1137
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,920
it's all illustrated in the movie,

1138
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,280
and then he starts talking like,

1139
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,960
he said it was like a snake bite him,

1140
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,680
and he was just paralyzed with fear,

1141
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,480
it was really scary, what am I looking at?

1142
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,760
Is this a human, is this a mutant, is this an alien,

1143
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,040
what is this?

1144
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,240
And he starts talking to him in gibberish,

1145
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,440
but he said he started to understand, like telepathically,

1146
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,040
everything this person or entity being, creature, alien,

1147
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,720
whatever you wanna call it, was saying to him,

1148
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,800
and he was looking for some kind of metal,

1149
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,080
and he didn't know tantillium,

1150
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,240
and Jason Sands is like, I don't know,

1151
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,680
I don't have any, you mean titanium?

1152
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,200
He's like, no, tantillium or something,

1153
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,040
and this conversation goes on for a bit,

1154
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,480
and then the guy just wanders back off,

1155
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,440
and gets into that little craft

1156
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,720
that looked very similar to what you just saw there,

1157
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,800
and flies away, and he sort of stair stepped away,

1158
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,880
and everybody sort of came out of this comatose state,

1159
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,240
and off they went,

1160
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,960
and we have the names of the other military witnesses

1161
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,760
that were on duty during the encounter,

1162
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,240
the alleged encounter.

1163
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,320
People are gonna criticize me,

1164
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,640
because I'm reporting on a close encounter

1165
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,800
with a third guy,

1166
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,760
but this, Jason Sands says he's willing to do

1167
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,760
a lie detector test, like public.

1168
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,920
He's willing to testify under oath

1169
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,400
that everything he's saying is true.

1170
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,880
We have a date, we have a location,

1171
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,320
and we have the names of the other on duty officers.

1172
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,400
So what I'm hoping is,

1173
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,640
despite the level of criticism I'm gonna receive

1174
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,880
for reporting on this,

1175
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,440
is that other individuals that have more information on this

1176
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,280
are gonna be inclined to come forward.

1177
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,480
I also met with people in the Senate Armed Service Committee,

1178
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,

1179
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,280
sorry, in the House,

1180
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,280
and they said, Jason Sands is who he says he is,

1181
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,880
he checks out, he is named previously classified,

1182
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,760
or classified programs, he's identified,

1183
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,240
the guy's legit, his credentials check out,

1184
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,280
and so I opted to go ahead and report on it,

1185
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,280
with the hope that more information will come out on it.

1186
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,680
Listen, man, there's nothing wrong

1187
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,240
with reporting on a story like that.

1188
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,440
There's been a bunch of them.

1189
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,120
It's not a small number of these things

1190
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,480
where people have experienced these things.

1191
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,440
And imagine if it's true.

1192
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,280
If it's true, yeah.

1193
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,100
They're not all liars.

1194
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,240
I can't believe they're all liars.

1195
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,520
Oh yeah, it's hard to imagine.

1196
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Imagine being that person who had that experience

1197
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,400
and not have anybody believe you.

1198
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,000
Not only that, but it can actually ruin your reputation

1199
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,680
and your career to talk about this experience,

1200
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,880
which is the reality of it.

1201
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,520
And it's one of the things that stifled discourse on this

1202
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,180
until I think the New York Times really broke the ice.

1203
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,640
I think in 2017 when they published that,

1204
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,760
all of a sudden serious people who were unwilling

1205
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,640
to talk about UFOs before just for the ridicule.

1206
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,280
Now you've got the gimbal video, the go fast video,

1207
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,720
you've got fighter pilots, Commander David Fravor,

1208
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,920
you've got these people discussing these things openly

1209
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,900
and like, okay, this seems like something

1210
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,800
that a serious person can discuss now.

1211
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,320
And so then it's open, but actually meeting one

1212
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,380
and talking to, it's like the Virginia story.

1213
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,100
Like when I told people the cop picked it up

1214
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,540
and carried it in the car and the cop died.

1215
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,380
Manhandled it.

1216
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,380
Some horrible bacterial infection that they couldn't cure.

1217
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,500
He was rubbing himself down with rubbing alcohol,

1218
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,340
according to his family.

1219
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,460
Like he was like, it's greasy stuff on my skin.

1220
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,740
And he was rubbing himself down

1221
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,580
and he had to stench, smell, grease.

1222
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,140
And then I interviewed the doctors,

1223
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,380
there's a couple of actually going back

1224
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,980
to Brazil next month.

1225
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,620
There were a couple of forensic pathologists

1226
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,220
that are willing to come forward that we're gonna cover,

1227
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,860
kind of update the movie and re-release it.

1228
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,220
So it's an ongoing investigation.

1229
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,780
Wouldn't that be the best protection

1230
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,740
from an alien planet's bacteria

1231
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,900
if you had the most vicious bacteria

1232
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,580
on the surface of your skin, right?

1233
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,700
Like imagine, like if you go to another planet

1234
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,300
and the way to mitigate the effects of viruses

1235
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,940
and bacteria on that planet is to have skin fluid

1236
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,180
that's like unbelievably toxic.

1237
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,380
Anything that comes near you just gets cooked.

1238
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,380
Yeah, like a skunk.

1239
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,220
Right.

1240
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,220
Have you ever had a skunk?

1241
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,340
Oh yeah, I had a skunk, got my dog once.

1242
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,260
I took out this guy's garbage one time

1243
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,500
and he's like, hey, it's in my garage.

1244
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,700
He flipped up the thing and dropped it in there.

1245
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,980
So I was kind of hung over.

1246
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,100
We had a party the night before

1247
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,940
and I went out to the garbage can

1248
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,060
and I kind of heard some rustling in the garbage can

1249
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,300
but I didn't really think anything of it

1250
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,340
and I lifted up the thing

1251
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,540
and then I heard some rustling again.

1252
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,700
So I reached over and I put my head down inside

1253
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,140
and the skunk just turned and got me right in the face.

1254
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,580
Now, I held my breath, I held my breath

1255
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,980
and I closed my eyes at the last second

1256
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,940
and it went right through me.

1257
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,500
It penetrated my molecules.

1258
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,700
It was so powerful that it was paralyzing.

1259
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,580
Absolutely paralyzing.

1260
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,420
Can you imagine?

1261
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,220
Just a smell, that's their way of defense.

1262
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,260
It's just this stench that just goes through your body

1263
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,380
like just paralyzes you.

1264
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,420
That's crazy.

1265
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,260
Anyway, it was really-

1266
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,220
You got it in the mug, huh?

1267
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,220
I got it right in the face.

1268
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,620
Wow, how long did it take before you didn't stink?

1269
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,460
Cause you smoked normal now.

1270
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,300
Probably two weeks.

1271
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,140
Ah!

1272
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,820
I was wondering like how long did that wait?

1273
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,020
It was several weeks.

1274
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,940
Yeah, and I tried the tomato

1275
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,500
and I tried the baking soda and I tried-

1276
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,100
I think they have the special soap now

1277
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,500
just for skunks.

1278
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,500
When my dog got zapped, she got zapped in like 1980.

1279
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,220
I think it was 1980 cause I was living in Jamaica Plain

1280
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,740
and she went out in the backyard

1281
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,940
and I think she thought that it was our cat

1282
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,100
cause we had a cat that was black and white

1283
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,180
and she just ran right up to that skunk

1284
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,180
and it took her right in the side of her body.

1285
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,780
She tried to turn away but it got her all over her body.

1286
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,660
She was wet with skunk spit.

1287
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,500
Oh, God.

1288
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,420
It was so nasty.

1289
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,580
I had to take her inside and I had to do it

1290
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,820
cause she was my dog.

1291
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,900
I was 13.

1292
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,540
I had to like cover her with tomato juice

1293
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,620
and wash her down and she still stunk.

1294
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,740
The whole house stunk.

1295
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,100
It's so funny because I was getting ready for a road trip

1296
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,020
this couple of years ago and I looked over

1297
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,140
and I was like, did we walk Duke?

1298
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,060
It was like nine o'clock at night.

1299
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:17,880
We were exhausted.

1300
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,720
We packed everything up.

1301
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,060
They had the car ready to go for the next morning.

1302
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,420
We walked Duke.

1303
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,540
You don't walk Duke.

1304
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,740
Take Duke, our dog.

1305
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,260
So we died, I was like, ah, it's nine o'clock.

1306
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,260
I gotta slide him outside.

1307
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,980
And I hear him like,

1308
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,060
Ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh.

1309
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,700
Then he goes, Ruh-ruh.

1310
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,660
And I thought, oh, my God, he just got eaten.

1311
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,500
Somebody just ate him.

1312
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,700
I was like, oh, my gosh.

1313
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,540
I ran out there to look for him

1314
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,580
and he comes running in and he jumps in bed

1315
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,400
covered in skunk.

1316
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,100
The whole house.

1317
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,740
Like it was so, so strong.

1318
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,580
It's unbelievable.

1319
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,060
That smell is just like.

1320
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,020
It's so incredible.

1321
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,860
The way someone explains to me, you know, like animals like bloodhounds and bears

1322
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,900
They have the insane sense of smell god like a hundred thousand times stronger than ours, right?

1323
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,160
But they can pick up parts per million the way we pick up skunk

1324
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:07,740
Really? Yeah. Oh my god think about that. So if a skunk gets hit by a car like a mile away, you can smell it

1325
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,300
Have you ever driven in your car? It's a mile drive over it and then my car smells like yeah

1326
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,900
If you're in the but if you're in the neighborhood where a skunk got something you could smell it. Yeah

1327
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:24,740
For some strange reason it permeates it like it carries more than any other smell with dogs. That's how they smell everything

1328
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,020
They're like, oh Ross goes home, you know

1329
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:34,140
like they can smell things that you can't even imagine they could smell especially like a bloodhound and then a bear can smell like

1330
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,940
What is a bear's like?

1331
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,100
Ability to smell above a bloodhound. It's some something something crazy

1332
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:47,660
My friend was sharks in the in the ocean can sense blood from miles away miles miles incredible insane miles away

1333
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,020
They could smell blood miles away

1334
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,520
God something I remember look at this

1335
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,900
300 times but look at this

1336
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,260
This is crazy bears are sent the best sense of smell of any animal on earth

1337
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,780
for example average dog sense of smells 100 times better than humans a

1338
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:09,020
Bloodhounds is 300 times better a bear sense of smell is seven times then a bloodhound or

1339
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,820
2,100 times better than a humans

1340
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,300
Unbelievable, that's why they say when you go camping and put your food up in a tree or something

1341
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,020
100% you have to you can't have the tent at all. Oh when I was a kid

1342
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,060
We went camping and the bear broke open our cooler. Wow

1343
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,420
Yeah, people just had regular coolers back you'd have like a little cookie in your pocket and be in bed

1344
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,380
I mean, yeah, you're gonna have you're gonna have an issue. Oh a hundred percent. Yeah. Wow a hundred percent

1345
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,780
I remember when I was a kid I went camping and they were like don't have any food

1346
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,780
I was like, yeah, whatever like that. No, no, no put that stuff. They were really adamant

1347
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,260
I was like why these guys making such a fault and bears not gonna smell a cookie in my pocket like yeah, of course

1348
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:49,140
They'll look at that like a wanton like look at that soft outer layer and there's meat inside of it

1349
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:54,900
They're gonna look at that tent like look it's trapped in there. The meat is trapped in the tent. This is crazy

1350
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,660
What was that one movie called where they got the the grizzly man or something? Yeah grizzly man

1351
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,820
That's when they came and got him. Remember they well

1352
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:07,940
One with the Grizzlies and then he got eaten. It's a very complicated movie. That's a Werner Herzog film. Yeah, Werner Herzog

1353
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:14,900
Yes, it's a really funny camera was rolling and they played it sort of the camera was rolling but all the lens cap was on

1354
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,800
So there was an audio. So it's just audio. Yeah, that's even worse

1355
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:25,460
Audio you hear on the internet. That's fake. Oh, that's not the real one the real audio Werner Herzog told the lady to destroy it

1356
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:33,780
Destroy it. No one should hear. So he heard it. Yeah, he heard it. It's long, you know, because bears don't kill you

1357
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:39,340
You know like a salmon they don't kill salmon they just put their paw down and start pulling chunks off of it

1358
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:44,100
That's what they do with people too. That's terrifying. Is that well, they don't have any predators

1359
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:49,100
So they don't have to kill things and then you know worry about someone taking it from them

1360
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:54,420
You know shit from a bear, especially a grizzly bear. You're not taking shit from a bear unless you're a bigger bear

1361
00:47:54,780 --> 00:48:01,060
So like all the other animals have to worry like mountain lions kill quick because wolves will steal from mountain lions

1362
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,620
And apparently in the areas where wolves have been introduced

1363
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:10,260
It's actually become a problem because mountain lions are killing much more than they normally do

1364
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:16,300
Because mountain lions will kill like a deer or two deer a week something like that and eat the day. Yeah

1365
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:21,660
That's a lot of meat. Well, they're big, you know a big mountain lions, you know 150 pounds

1366
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:29,380
It's a big cat their cats are just their obligate predators. All they eat is meat, you know bears lead a little berries

1367
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,300
They'll eat a bunch of shit not cats. So the cats are

1368
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,460
Killing more because the wolves scare the cats off of the kill

1369
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,180
So if the cat's on a kill and a bunch of wolves show up the cat will just get the fuck out of there

1370
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:46,060
Like fuck cuz he feels I didn't want to have to fend himself against the wolves exactly because wolves hunting packs

1371
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:52,260
So there might be 13 14 wolves and one cat the cat will just get the fuck out of there cats run from dogs

1372
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:58,620
Right, like they have a fear of like canines and I think it's from wolves stealing their food

1373
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,220
So like that's how they hunt cats the way they hunt them

1374
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,140
You have to tree them because otherwise you're not gonna find if you find a mountain lion

1375
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,540
But tree them you have to get the dogs to bark them up a tree

1376
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,860
Oh, they run a tree and they shoot them when they're in a tree

1377
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:18,700
Yeah, and they it sounds cruel. But listen, they have to do that to manage the populations if they don't they start eating dogs

1378
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,700
They start that's what you get in San Francisco

1379
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,900
California still kills mountain lions

1380
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:28,660
They kill as many mountain lions as they would if they gave tags out to people to kill them

1381
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:34,180
Because you have to kill certain numbers of them for depredation because they'll start killing livestock

1382
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,940
They start killing dogs in the Bay Area

1383
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:41,900
They were the problem cats that they wound up killing in like San Francisco

1384
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,900
Half their diet was pets

1385
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,860
Really half their diet half their diet was house house dogs dogs and cats

1386
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,940
That's half their diet half of their diet

1387
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:59,300
So you manage, you know a hundred plus pound cat and he's running around just eating dogs

1388
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,500
You leave your dog in your backyard gone

1389
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:07,220
Happens all the time. Wow, it happened to my dog. Really? Yeah, my dog in Colorado got eaten by a mountain lion

1390
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:13,620
That happens. Oh god. I feel so bad for my little guy. It's terrible. I'm not there to protect my little feller

1391
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,700
You know one time I was I was hiking up this mountain

1392
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,140
And I had my son with me at the time and he was in that little pouch

1393
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,220
You know that little pouch

1394
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,820
Oh, yeah put him in the front like he was like probably like maybe two two and a half

1395
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:29,900
And I was hiking this mountain pretty daily. It's funny actually cuz when I went up there without him

1396
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,900
I was like, well, this is why people hike with weights on this feels amazing. I could run up this mountain

1397
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:40,180
But anyway, I was going to the mountain and I had my dog my little little Duke and I had my son

1398
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,420
Walking up this mountain and I come around this like good left hand

1399
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:49,380
It's a pretty exposed not too many trees some bushes and it's a hot sunny day

1400
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:54,460
And I see this leg of a deer like just fresh kill with blood in the ground. I was like god damn

1401
00:50:54,460 --> 00:51:01,980
What the hell's the hell looked? Wow, that's fresh. It's like, huh? I kind of keep going and come around the corner

1402
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,980
There's a long straightaway. The hill goes up like this

1403
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,580
And I see what looks like a big

1404
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,420
like greyhound dog

1405
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:16,940
Kind of like brown light brown kind of walking kind of back and forth like this with a tail and I was like man

1406
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:21,700
Who the hell's greyhound is doing out of here? Like what the hell is that's a mountain lion?

1407
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:26,900
I was like, holy shit and the mountain lion turns around and looked at me and I had my kid

1408
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,020
I was like shit

1409
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:33,940
I so I grabbed my dog and I turned around and I started running and I knew that I shouldn't be running

1410
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,620
So I'm running going I shouldn't be running. I shouldn't be running

1411
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:40,860
I know he should be running but I wanted to get around the corner and get it out of its light sign of

1412
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:47,340
Line of sight and then I go I go well if he comes up on me, I'm gonna have to throw my dog

1413
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:52,580
I was like I look at Duke and if it comes down to it, you're gonna have to take one for the team

1414
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,180
Horrible choice, but I had my son

1415
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,700
But I remember my dog too and I was like looking at my dog going

1416
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,220
Oh man, this is a horrible decision to make but if it comes down to it, I'm gonna have to sacrifice you buddy

1417
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,980
I love you, you know, but it didn't come down to it. But I remember running going you're an idiot James

1418
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,600
Why are you running not supposed to be running? You can't run. Well, that's the problem with mountain bikers

1419
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:19,540
They get got because when they pass by a cat, it's almost like rolling a ball of yarn past a kitten

1420
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:27,660
They're predators and they will they'll catch bikes, huh? Oh, yeah, they get people on bikes. Yeah, that's happened a few times

1421
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:32,340
They get people on bikes. They get joggers people on bikes. They think you're running away from them

1422
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:38,880
Could you tell me what it was like to be running for your life having something like that chase you yeah, I can I mean

1423
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,380
It hasn't happened to me, but I've seen them

1424
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:46,260
I've seen three of them in my lifetime only one of them that scared the shit out of me. I saw one in Colorado

1425
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,260
I saw one in

1426
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,980
Montecito like the Santa Barbara area. It was small. Those are small ones

1427
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:58,220
They were like 50 60 pounds and then I saw one with a buddy of mine my friend Colton and I we spotted one under

1428
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,820
A tree that was 30 yards away. We were in a truck and it made me shit my pants

1429
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,540
Wow, it was so big. This one was really big

1430
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:12,700
This was a mature male with a big pumpkin head and huge forearms like a fucking bodybuilder. It was freaky

1431
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:17,980
It was freaky to see because you know, it was first of all, it was dusk

1432
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,940
So the the Sun was going down and the lights of the truck even though it wasn't quite dark yet

1433
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,220
The lights of the truck were making his eyes glow

1434
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,460
Oh my god, and you can see him with the naked eye

1435
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:33,580
But then I put my binoculars on and so I've got these 10-power binoculars and I'm zoomed in on this thing's face

1436
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:39,180
I'm like, holy looks like he belongs in Africa. Well, he belonged right where he was and we didn't belong there

1437
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,060
Let me tell you a really cool story that's a UFO the best UFO picture I think it's ever taken

1438
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:56,260
Okay, so can you find the program trailer on on here at all or yeah for sure right find the program trailer

1439
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:03,100
I'm gonna tell you about this. So yeah, just watch the trailer. Let's watch it story exposing a secret government program

1440
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,060
investigating UFOs

1441
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,220
That story was kind of a catalyst for a lot of things that have happened since

1442
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:15,660
Members of Congress started to ask questions instruments report. There is something there

1443
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,540
There are flight characteristics that we can't explain

1444
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:22,860
UAPs are unexplained. It's true. They need to be investigated

1445
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:29,340
Here we are having a hearing where just a few years ago we didn't even acknowledge that these things were real

1446
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:36,580
Do you believe that our government is in possession of UAPs? Absolutely based on interviewing over 40 witnesses over four years

1447
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:43,500
You're telling me people have come forward claiming firsthand knowledge of craft of non-human origin

1448
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,060
That's correct

1449
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,900
We have sources who have asserted not only that there have been crashes

1450
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:57,820
But there have been crash retrievals. Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft?

1451
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,900
Biologics came with some of these recoveries. Yeah

1452
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,540
Were they human or non-human?

1453
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,220
non-human

1454
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,620
I'm sitting here today because the American people are being lied to

1455
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,960
We are the American government and we are open and we're gonna be open about this

1456
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:24,040
What has been revealed non-human intelligence exists non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity

1457
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:29,100
There's only part of the story the pressures on Pentagon CIA. They're gonna have to answer the man

1458
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:34,680
Some are risking everything. Have you had incidences that have caused you to be in fear for your life?

1459
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,180
Yes personally to uncover the rest

1460
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:43,240
What is being done to verify the assertion that the US government has spaceships of non-human intelligence in their possession?

1461
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,880
That kind of revelation unearth people's beliefs

1462
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,120
I would go to jail to say things that I've been exposed to

1463
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,520
in the program

1464
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,120
Bro, is that Mick Jagger?

1465
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:03,440
Was that other guy Mick Jagger? Isn't he amazing? That's Hal put off. Hal put off. Oh, yeah

1466
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,860
I know doesn't look like Mick Jagger. That's not Gary McKinnon

1467
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,580
He's the biggest computer hacker in history. Let me see what he looks like. He almost went to jail for life

1468
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,600
Because he was like, I'm gonna find out what the government knows about UFOs. So he hacked into the systems

1469
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,180
NSA CIA DIA like

1470
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:28,320
Where is he? Yeah, you want to see that really cool picture the foot no in the film. Oh, yeah

1471
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,960
Yeah, you gotta go towards the end. Yeah. No, he's totally looks like

1472
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,660
You should say that because I totally thought I saw it. I'm like, wait a minute. That does look like a rock star

1473
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,400
He is a rock star in the UFO community. It's coming up

1474
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:46,680
You'll have to pause it quickly when it when it hits but Gary McKinnon took it upon himself a computer hacker

1475
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,440
to find out if the government had

1476
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:56,440
Proof of alien visitation and he spent a couple years hacking systems and he found and he got pay dirt

1477
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,160
Yes, that was it

1478
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:07,760
You should just like only show that clip, you know, like they do in horror movies where the mask is not that good

1479
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:13,280
Yeah, but so well I was gonna tell you there's a photograph of a jet circulating

1480
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,640
Can I can I go in a little bit of detail because everyone's always worried about like where's the good evidence?

1481
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,960
Where's the good photograph? Yeah, so it's yeah. There we go

1482
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,040
This was a lost photograph that was recovered. Yeah. Yeah, you know about this. Yeah, I know about this

1483
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,040
Okay, so I heard about this in the late 90s

1484
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:29,920
Okay

1485
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:36,400
So there was a guy Nick Pope who investigated he was part of the UFO desk at the Ministry of Defense of England in the late

1486
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,400
90s mid to late 90s

1487
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,040
Maybe in as late as early 2000s

1488
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,800
But in any case and I was in fact I was interviewing him for a number of my films. I did a film called out of the blue

1489
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:52,080
I know what I saw before I did the phenomenon and I I asked him like hey man

1490
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:58,000
You were part of the UFO desk at the MOT. What was the best case you ever saw and he goes? Oh man

1491
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:04,960
1990 he didn't give me this the town it was calvine, but he said Scotland there were two poachers

1492
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,480
They called them hikers, but they were actually poaching and that's what made me think about this

1493
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,960
We were talking about animals earlier and he said uh, it was it was late in the afternoon

1494
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,160
They were in a place. I now know it's called calvine and

1495
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,560
they

1496
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,080
came upon

1497
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,200
In this relatively remote area

1498
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:29,200
I know because I hiked out to the exact spot and it's in the movie but and they came upon this diamond shaped or disc shaped

1499
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,600
Object that was quite large that was hovering silently

1500
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,800
Really close I mean close and they were scared to death and they were kind of

1501
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,480
Hiding out underneath this tree and they're looking at this thing

1502
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:48,920
What the are we looking at and there's looking at this thing as it silently hovering remember. This is 1990. Okay, and

1503
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,120
one of them had a camera and

1504
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:59,160
Just as he was considering taking his camera out a military jet came in turns out

1505
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,040
It was one of those Harrier jet

1506
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,840
they think it was a Harrier jet and it came out into the scene and it flew all the way around the disc and

1507
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,920
As it did so the guy mustered up the courage came out from under the tree and he snapped five or six photographs of

1508
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,520
This object suspended in the air and it went

1509
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:26,000
so the disc is here and the plane is flying around us click click click click click click and

1510
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,080
the reason why I know this is because

1511
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,720
The individual who kept one of the prints. Thank you very much

1512
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:39,560
Craig Lindsay RAF press officer and thank you David Clark for uncovering this because it's the most amazing picture ever and

1513
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:49,240
The two hotel workers in just outside the town of calvine Scotland came back and they were like telling their co-workers

1514
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:54,320
Oh my god, we encountered this thing. We don't know it was so they go to the local newspaper and they were like, hey, man

1515
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,360
We just filmed something in the sky. We got six prints of it

1516
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,280
it was I was it was 35 millimeter film footage, right and

1517
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,920
And they're gonna go public with their story two witnesses broad daylight

1518
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:14,680
I know a UFO points of reference with a military jet flying around five or six prints. That's pretty solid evidence, right?

1519
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,520
so

1520
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,520
the local newspaper was like

1521
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,160
They're about to go public with it print print the story and they were like well

1522
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:27,000
We need a statement from the RAF. So they contact the press officer Craig Lindsay and they were like, hey

1523
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,160
What do you make of this?

1524
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,720
UFO these guys took and the guy and Craig Lindsay goes I don't know what you're talking about

1525
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,980
I I haven't seen the picture. You haven't seen it. Well, let me send you a print. This is the new the newspaper

1526
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:43,160
sends him a print big big print like this the one you see today and

1527
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:50,600
He's like, holy shit. The hell is this? He's already a press officer Craig Lindsay and he's good. So he

1528
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,880
starts getting in touch with the MOD and he goes out and he

1529
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,720
Investigate this go talk to the witness talk to the witnesses and they were telling him and he goes well

1530
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,160
They tell him what happened and he goes well, what kind of noise did it make they say it didn't make any noise

1531
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,240
No, he goes no noise. That's impossible

1532
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,280
You know an object that can hover like that in the sky for that period of time. They're talking 34 years ago

1533
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,560
didn't make any noise and

1534
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,760
the witness said no

1535
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,000
So he was like, holy shit. This is crazy

1536
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:25,080
So he takes a color Xerox a machine and he sends it to the MOD in London and he says hey

1537
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:30,640
There's a case that you might want to check, you know, you might want to look into and here's a Xerox, which is really crappy

1538
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,760
It's just a it's just a scanned Xerox like a fax machine over to MOD

1539
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,960
He said he went from the office where the Xerox machine was and before he can get back to his office

1540
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:46,260
His phone was ringing off the hook MOD and the MOD basically stepped in took over the investigation

1541
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:51,640
They said you can step down to Craig Lindsay. He steps down. He keeps the print, right?

1542
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,820
He steps down they take over

1543
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,100
Witnesses gone five or six prints gone

1544
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,100
story killed, right

1545
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,860
so

1546
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:06,600
30 and we rumored about it because Nick Pope had talked about this case in a book he wrote called

1547
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:13,540
Open skies closed mines and then I talked to him about it in late late 90s

1548
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:17,780
Then I talked to him about it again in the early 2000s and I was like Nick, especially in 2007

1549
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:20,820
I was like tell me about this photograph. He's like, I was incredible

1550
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,020
We had a big poster of it on the wall the MOD and I was like, well, where is it?

1551
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,460
He goes well, I don't know. I stepped down

1552
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,180
I'm no longer that at the UFO desk and I said well

1553
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:33,300
They didn't just throw that away once you get in touch with the people that were there and find out he's like

1554
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,940
Oh, you know James I can't just make those inquiries that we we killed the story

1555
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:41,800
It was like, you know, so I was incredibly frustrated. So so discreetly for over a 20-year period

1556
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,840
I was making inquiries because I don't like letting things go

1557
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:50,520
Right. It was like this picture exists and bloody hell. Let's get this one out there, but the story went dark

1558
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:57,280
so David Clarke found Craig Lindsay and the way he found Craig Lindsay the guy that kept one of the prints is that he got

1559
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,280
a he got a

1560
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:06,280
Declassified government document out of the MOD's office that had redactions on it. And one of the things it said was

1561
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,800
It was 1990 and they said RAF press officer in Scotland

1562
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,560
Blacked out, you know said that blah blah blah blah blah and he's like, huh

1563
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:21,840
Who was the RAF press officer in 1990 in Scotland Craig Lindsay boom contacts great Lindsay

1564
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,760
They started communication going and then after like so much for redaction

1565
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:34,320
Yeah, so much for redactions, right? And so this whole dialogue starts going and there's you know developing a and and then um,

1566
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:40,280
He goes well gosh, I might I guess I might have when it turns out he ended up keeping one of those prints

1567
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:44,680
Which he had and that story broke probably two years ago David Clarke again

1568
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:49,120
I can't thank you enough you deserve accolades for this and so I flew to England

1569
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,920
I met with David Clarke and his crew that people that did the analysis work. Then I went up to Scotland

1570
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,580
I met with Craig Lindsay the art press officer gave me the first and only on-camera interview about it

1571
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,720
What astonished him about it the analysis work that did on it what the witnesses said?

1572
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,240
But we didn't have the witnesses the people that took the photograph

1573
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,080
We didn't have them but I was gonna report on this anyway just because wow

1574
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,480
This is the picture that we've all been waiting for this picture is phenomenal

1575
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,360
But if you don't have provenance and you don't have the background story on it, it could be AI

1576
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:23,000
It could be right could be a hoax. Some people call it a reflection not a reflection not a hoax. So

1577
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,360
I'm ending production of the program and

1578
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:35,160
I get a text from David Clarke and he goes something big is about to happen and I said what he goes just sit tight

1579
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,560
I can't go public right now, but something big's gonna happen. There's a there's a new development and this is just teases

1580
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:44,400
Well, I'm coming out with that. I promise so he did he did he did tease me

1581
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,400
But I was like, well, I'm almost done with the movie

1582
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,480
And if this is something I conclude in the movie about the case, please let me know

1583
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:56,760
So long story short this guy Richard Greaves who was one of the hotel cooks worked in the kitchen with the

1584
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,900
Photographers with the two witnesses that took the photograph and Richard Greaves

1585
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:07,540
Came forward on print but I contacted David Clarke. I was like, hey, can this can I can you get me an interview with this guy?

1586
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,700
so

1587
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,380
He kept putting it off putting it off putting it off

1588
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:16,780
And then finally I was like didn't want to be I wanted to be persistent

1589
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:20,620
But I didn't want to annoy the guy to the point where he's been like, hey, you know what you like, right?

1590
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:24,380
You're being annoying, you know, yeah, but I got it right up to that point

1591
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:27,580
Right when I was like I was rapping the movie the movie's done

1592
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:30,900
I want to get this movie out all the people that participated wanted it out

1593
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,340
And then I finally sent him one final text

1594
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:37,700
I was like, look, I'm really sorry to pastor you and I know you're probably really busy and I really appreciate the fact that

1595
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:43,700
You even said that you'll meet with me, but that you'll give me an interview and then probably about 10 o'clock that night

1596
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,820
I'm in the editor room buttoning the film up and all of a sudden I get a phone call and he's like

1597
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:53,820
I'm just come out the pub. I'm ready to go. I was like, okay grab a camera roll it. Let's record this and

1598
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,060
he

1599
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,900
reveals that

1600
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:02,460
He knew the the witnesses. He worked with them in the kitchen. He gave all the specifics

1601
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:06,860
He provided their names and then he said that two or three nights after

1602
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:12,820
Two or three nights four nights after they took that photograph. They were all on a cigarette break at the hotel early evening

1603
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,820
Pissing rain. He said a car rolled up

1604
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:21,300
There were three guys in it a driver and two men in suits in the back. They roll up they come out

1605
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:26,260
They say cigarette breaks over they pull the two witnesses aside and they

1606
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:32,460
Grill him and you got to hear it directly from the horseman Richard Grieve said that when they were all

1607
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:37,500
The people that were not involved with the incident were told to go back inside the hotel which they did but they looked through the window

1608
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:43,160
And they saw in the pissing rain. He said they're out there for 10 or 15 minutes in the pissing rain and that these guys

1609
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:48,460
They came back inside and they were white as he said he's he literally goes

1610
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,620
They they came back inside they were white as a fucking ghost and

1611
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:58,620
Which we all get a good laugh out of but and then they started drinking heavily and within a couple of weeks

1612
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:04,820
They vanished without a trace and they've been gone ever since so we report on this and yeah, that's a that's a replica

1613
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,820
That's a replica. I say it's way too clear

1614
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:12,660
I was like that's a replica from Nick Pope that he did it for some series talking about it and that was before

1615
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:17,420
The real photograph was found and print. Let's see the real photograph

1616
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:21,340
Let's see the real photograph. Yeah, show the real photograph again. I got it in there. It is. Yep

1617
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,380
Okay, so what was he doing? Show the fake one one more time?

1618
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:31,500
Yeah, that's what the recreation before it leaked out. So was he just recreating what he remembered? Yes. Let me see the real one again

1619
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:35,620
It's pretty damn good. Isn't it that he remembered that not bad. Not bad miss the barbed wire fence

1620
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:40,140
But not mad that put in a bunch of bullshit back. I went to the exact location that bullshit

1621
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:46,140
He put in there put in beautiful hills. I know and and that fence is still there. There was a back throw

1622
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,980
Yeah, that fence is still there. I took an actual I took a model

1623
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:52,340
What is that jet in the back Harrier jump a Harrier jet is what I'm told

1624
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:57,380
They're 99% sure and was that Harrier jet trying to figure out what this was

1625
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:02,960
Well, like I said in the other prints according to to Craig Lindsay the RAF press officer

1626
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,340
He said the other six prints or five prints had that Harrier jet in a different position

1627
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:12,780
So he said it was if the Harrier jet flew around checking that out now, where are those other prints?

1628
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:17,260
We have other MoD just ever gone they killed the story

1629
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:22,660
I mean the guy at the mo do work there Nick Pope told me that they did everything they could to squash it because don't you

1630
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:26,020
Think they probably have it filed away somewhere. Oh, of course. They do throw it away. Of course

1631
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:30,560
They didn't throw those pictures away. They do zoom in on this January, please. Yeah, that's a really crap copy

1632
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,560
You're looking at a really bad break

1633
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:35,180
I've got a much better

1634
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:41,260
I've got a much better version of it. You got it on your phone. I do text it to a homie. There's some this image is

1635
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:47,020
It's weird. Yeah, it's a it's it's a it's hard to see what you're looking at, you know

1636
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:51,500
It's a yeah. Well, let me show you a much better copy of it. Hang on

1637
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:55,200
Let me just scroll up here because I've got a really good I got the original print

1638
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:02,940
Of this copy, but you know people talk about you know, the more compelling data and the links so this is

1639
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:08,520
This is the photograph that I took at the site. You can get an idea of that. Okay

1640
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:14,280
See how right how similar right look exactly the same. Yep, and then here is

1641
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,280
Here's the here's the print

1642
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,400
And I could take a I could text that to you guys if you want

1643
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,240
Yeah, text that to me. I'll text it. I'll text it to you guys

1644
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,480
It's very interesting very interesting case. I mean it's again. I think it's one of the

1645
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,880
Best photographic cases because you're not dealing with just a UFO

1646
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:40,120
You've got a military jet in the background and if you have a date and a location guess what that pilot's still out there

1647
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,440
That pilot can probably got it on radar and probably got gun camp for if he's still alive

1648
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:48,480
If well, he would have been probably young right pilots are young sure

1649
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:53,320
He would have been in his 30s or maybe early 40s and that was 34 years ago. So chances are he's still alive

1650
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:57,820
They're pretty fit, right? Yeah, maybe he's in the 70s. Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna text this to you right now

1651
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,320
Here we go

1652
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,320
Boom, you should have that

1653
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:08,160
Did I get you all did I get all of them to you and here is a picture of Craig Lindsay, this is great

1654
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,160
You're gonna love this

1655
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:18,180
Okay, this is this is the guy that kept it I didn't get it yet you didn't know

1656
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:22,000
I wonder if it's because I have my phone on airplane mode. Yeah, take it off airplane. Oh, bro. I told you

1657
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,240
Okay. Oh you did explain to you. Oh, sorry. Okay. It's off now. I'm sorry. Otherwise, it won't actually send it

1658
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,280
Oh, it won't. Okay. All right. Here we go. Here we go

1659
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:34,840
Like I know I'm so bad. I know you were telling me how to do it. I was like, I haven't done that before

1660
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,600
It's funny people that don't understand how to use their tell me if that goes through

1661
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,920
Okay

1662
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,160
Great great sure need me to send it here you do it

1663
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,380
There's that one and there's flipped it left to right on it

1664
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:57,680
but you know, it just goes to show the links that the Intel community the

1665
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:02,200
Ministry of Defense the DOD go to hide the more compelling

1666
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:08,440
Photographic data because it's so easy to complain like oh, well if they were real there would be good

1667
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,720
Well, there are some really good

1668
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,920
I found drones that you can I don't know that they're commercially available

1669
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,480
But you can have a drone up for 24 plus that didn't send it to me either. Are you serious?

1670
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:29,560
Am I sending to the wrong telephone number let me see your number the number you have

1671
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:35,920
Okay, well, I have it. I definitely have it on signal. Yeah, you do it. Yeah, fuck it. You take over you drive

1672
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Because I'm clearly failing at this one

1673
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:52,000
Oh, I can totally imagine that this is a separate I found some drones that this these companies say that you can take off anywhere

1674
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:58,000
They're showing them taking off from like small platforms in the ocean. They can stay up in the air for 14 plus hours

1675
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:03,320
They're small and they do have propellers. I will say that. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and like I said, I mean

1676
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:09,200
It's not the question is and are all these drones, you know explainable by aliens and the question

1677
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:15,860
Obviously the answer obviously is no the question is are any of these bona fide UAP and there's definitely some evidence to suggest

1678
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,760
That's the case. But again, there's always misidentification of more conventional stuff, right?

1679
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,920
And there's always

1680
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:27,000
And then there's a stubborn core percent like I give you an example

1681
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:33,280
This is something that I've discussed a little bit recently. Did you find it? Okay? Yes. Okay good. Finally

1682
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:40,100
We've got that that enigma worked out. Yeah, it's just your 5g is very slow. Oh, really? Yeah, you're using AT&T

1683
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:44,760
Oh, I use in Verizon Verizon. Yeah, really? Yeah, it's just real slow

1684
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,920
Do I have do I have what's gonna call it on actually accidentally sent myself these are the ones of the guy holding it up

1685
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,200
Too. Oh cool. Yeah, that's cool. That's that's Craig Lindsey. So

1686
01:12:54,680 --> 01:13:00,000
I'll send this to you Jamie. So let me tell you a little a little story. That's pretty cool

1687
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,540
Which I never thought that this would happen. I

1688
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:11,280
There's a guy Kirk McConnell who Senate Armed Service Committee and he participated the very last minute in my in my film

1689
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,240
He's in the trailer and he in an official capacity with a high-level clearance

1690
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:20,960
He had been investigating UFOs ever since the New York Times article in 2017. So he was behind the scenes

1691
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:31,040
2017 2018 telling the 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 22 23 24 and then he stepped down and he came

1692
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,060
Through some Intel folks. We got in touch and I said hey, man

1693
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:40,280
My films almost done if you want I could squeeze in one final interview. He decided to participate up

1694
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:44,240
He went we became friends. We've been talking and he said hey

1695
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:51,240
I could probably arrange a meeting because there's some mutual interest in some UFO cases and evidence that I've been going after as a

1696
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:56,200
Civilian but he goes hey on the inside if you want I can cook up with it with the heads of arrow the new heads of

1697
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:02,600
Arrow John Koskowski and this other guy Ryan it was Air Force Office special investigations. This is just a couple weeks ago

1698
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:08,640
So I went to the congressional hearings, which was incredible and people say always big nothing burger

1699
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,320
But you know what? It was very exciting seeing people testifying to oath

1700
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:17,640
There's a there's a crash retrieval program seen at a rear Admiral Tim guy at Gallaudet saying that they're under the water

1701
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,840
I mean, it's pretty fascinating stuff. Yeah, so I

1702
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,400
had to I had to apply for a

1703
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:30,680
Security background on me which about 48 hours and then I got approval for that and then I showed up

1704
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:35,940
And a wing across the street from the Pentagon and I had to go through the metal detector and then there are these

1705
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:40,580
Kind of exciting for me because I had never had this kind of experience before there are these like glass

1706
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:47,580
Tube type things that were lined up like in a row and I only one person go in at a time the doors open

1707
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:51,460
Just like in Star Trek and you walk in and that door closes the other one opens you go to the other side

1708
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:55,860
Then I had to get rid of my phone and everything and leave it outside and then I go into a skiff

1709
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,980
Which is a sensitive compartmented information facility

1710
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:03,540
As gifts all super top-secret whatever and

1711
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:07,420
And I got to meet with the new head of arrow John Kostelowski

1712
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:13,540
I was like, I can't believe I'm in the belly of the beast. This is crazy. I got how could I I'm a civilian

1713
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:19,420
I don't I don't belong here, but we started talking. They're just very nonchalant. You know, I said hey

1714
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,700
You guys got to throw us a bone I said, you know, we're not going away

1715
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:30,660
The story is not going away and I said, you know, and you know what we're ultimately dealing with

1716
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:37,380
I mean obviously the vast majority of UAP or UFOs can be and have been explained away in down-to-earth conventional terms

1717
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:42,660
Right, but there's a stubborn core 15 20 percent that really defy conventional explanation

1718
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:46,660
Not because of a lack of data because they truly can't explain what these things do and you know

1719
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:50,060
Well, you've had many people on these objects exhibited technology

1720
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,020
That's just light years advance from anything that we have

1721
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:59,140
I mean this is and it's been well documented since the 1940s and possibly some people say way before that but modern-day UFO wave

1722
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:02,580
No question. So there's two, you know two stories

1723
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:08,980
One is someone's been in possession of this revolutionary technology for 85 plus years and kept it secret or two

1724
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:15,700
We're not alone, right? Right and a chai. So I said I said to the gentleman very candidly

1725
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:21,020
You know, we're probably dealing with a small percentage of of NHI and what's the plan to tell the general public?

1726
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:25,220
And this is just a couple weeks ago and he looked at me and he goes James

1727
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:31,700
I can't part my hair without approval from the DOD and you can quote me on that and

1728
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:38,820
That was him in my opinion telling me. Hey, this is structured in a way that's that I'm my hands are tied

1729
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:41,380
I can I can uncover all the things in the world

1730
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:45,940
But I can't tell the general public or even Congress without the DOD approving it first

1731
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:46,700
Yeah

1732
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:52,340
so that's what's kind of happening right now and one of the reasons why we were so fortunate to get the number of of

1733
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:59,300
I say whistleblowers or potential whistleblowers or people to come forward in the program is because they were super frustrated with the previous head of

1734
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:03,740
Head of error which is guy named Sean Kirkpatrick, which basically just kind of blanket

1735
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:09,840
You know denied pretty much almost almost everything and people were extremely disappointed with that. But just like blue book

1736
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:15,600
Yeah, I kind of like blue book. Yeah, they've always done that right? Yeah, but but again, he brought everybody's doing it

1737
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,800
Not everybody's right. There's a bunch of well, I think now also with the internet

1738
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:27,580
There's there's ways to get information out. That's much quicker and cleaner. No question then trusting a reporter

1739
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:31,800
Yeah, you know and then your life's in danger. Yeah reporter get threatened and yeah

1740
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:37,020
Yeah, now things just kind of get out. So so well, I've thought about this like, you know

1741
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,760
I'm going back to Brazil and I thought you know, I'm obviously going after you know

1742
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:46,280
Additional eyewitness testimony. I'm going out to the photographic stuff and those of you out there that are like tired of hearing about it

1743
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,920
Well, I spent

1744
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:54,360
20 plus years in search of the photograph that I featured just now that one with the background story on it provenance that sort of

1745
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,600
Thing Jamie go look at the one that I sent you it's a better version

1746
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,040
Yeah

1747
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:03,600
and and so I saw I just because you've you know, you can't after a year or two haven't

1748
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,400
Successfully obtained stuff. So this is a better. Yeah

1749
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,060
Better version that you can see the granular of the film footage weird

1750
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,880
It's almost looks like there's something in the back

1751
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,640
It does look a little bit like that propeller or something like a Jetsons type thing

1752
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,840
But but let's just say nothing was silent

1753
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:23,160
Silent according to the witnesses that didn't make any sound hover there for an extended period of time

1754
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,480
But when it took off it took off straight vertical like this

1755
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,760
Straight up fast. It started going fast faster faster faster and then was gone

1756
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:35,060
Yep, that was that was Craig Leslie who interviewed the witnesses who told me that

1757
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:43,980
And it's so weird though according to Richard Greaves in Scotland the Americans got involved of course we get involved in everything

1758
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:44,180
Yep

1759
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,860
they showed up and they

1760
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:51,260
Intimidated the shit out of the witnesses and I I know people can criticize me for reporting on these alleged men in black

1761
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,180
But it's not me saying it

1762
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:59,660
it's the witnesses that are saying it and I did it full bore for the first time full bore for the first time in moment of

1763
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:06,460
Contact because I remember hearing these stories for decades and I finally was like everyone's gonna think I'm crazy if I report on this

1764
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:10,980
but this lady who was the mother of the two daughters that saw they had these visits and

1765
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,740
Intimidation and I was like screw it

1766
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:16,260
I'm just gonna report on this and I'll just take the criticism, you know

1767
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:22,340
And then I wasn't expecting this for the to be the case with this photograph, but it lo and behold it was but

1768
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:27,020
Anyway, it's it's a huge story

1769
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:33,580
It in my opinion they can't put the genie back in the bottle it's coming out and it's drip drip drip

1770
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:39,980
But I have to remind your audience people that are feeling impatient that we've had three open congressional hearings in the last three years

1771
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,300
Yeah, we hadn't had any in over 50 years prior to that

1772
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:48,620
It's definitely even though it's still difficult to get information and figure out what's actually going on

1773
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:54,700
There's way more open mainstream discussion of it. And it's frustrating at times. I get it, you know people are like

1774
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:59,260
Well, why all these people why can't they just say why can't David Grush just tell us, you know

1775
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:05,220
Well, I can remind people that the DOD has stripped David Grush of his clearances and won't allow him to get into a skip

1776
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:10,060
This is one of the things that I talked to this guy Brian Benner appears in the movie at Politico

1777
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:14,300
And he goes he goes if Congress finds out about it one thing we know on the hill is that you're gonna find out about

1778
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:18,740
It they can't keep a secret. It's gonna leak. So they've been doing everything they can imagine

1779
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:20,740
It's the DOD to prevent

1780
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:24,900
Grush from going into a skip with members of Congress to release and reveal

1781
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:27,260
the

1782
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,940
Classified details necessary to verify his claims

1783
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:34,900
Okay, if you've been keeping this under wraps for 60 plus years or whatever they've been doing

1784
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:38,780
Yeah, would you really tell AOC would you really pull her aside and tell her?

1785
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:44,220
Well, I mean any members of Congress with the proper clearances and feel like they want to have that information

1786
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:49,380
I mean you got not making wrong with her. Yeah, I'm just saying let's pick a young one

1787
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:54,300
Well, you're gonna give them all that information. Are you they're exactly they don't want them to have that information

1788
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,820
There's no question about it. I mean I would that's what I would imagine

1789
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,140
That's probably why they won't let brush get into a skim

1790
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:04,900
So here's another thing I'd like to mention is that David Grush claims that he gave even a street address to the IC IG

1791
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:09,020
Which is Thomas Monheim. That's the intelligence community inspector general

1792
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:13,260
So I'm asking members of Congress to support all their efforts, you know

1793
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:17,240
Burchette who's been amazing regardless of what your politics the guy's phenomenon

1794
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,680
He's been really pushing for transparency. He's super solid guy. You got mace you got

1795
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:30,000
Muscovsky what's this from from Florida Garcia from California AOC New York

1796
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,160
Luna and

1797
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:39,680
Then of course, you got the Senate side. You got Rubio. I totally knows where this stuff is rounds Schumer

1798
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,400
and if you look at the

1799
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:48,800
NDAA you can see the language in plain sight. I mean, it's it's phenomenal what's going on and I and I I

1800
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:56,360
Think that our elected officials that are really pushing for transparency need to hear from us need to hear from the citizens and know

1801
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:03,160
That we support their efforts and that we have their backs and continuing to push for transparency to push to find out

1802
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,640
What the hell is going on? I mean imagine if it's true

1803
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,980
Imagine if we have spaceships and we have biologics bodies, okay

1804
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:13,540
That is not just

1805
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,340
Implications for the United States that's global

1806
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:24,940
Implications, I mean the impacts the ripple effect that would have around the world for that confirmation to happen. No doubt. It would be

1807
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:28,540
Huge. Well, the human race deserves to know it shouldn't be

1808
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:34,340
Unelected officials and Defense Department people that know about this stuff. That's crazy. I totally agree unless

1809
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,220
unless

1810
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:41,380
This is what I had a conversation with Ryan Graves yesterday the way I would argue it if I was a military person

1811
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:43,660
I would say this is a national security interest and

1812
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:46,100
We are trying to back engineer this stuff

1813
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:52,420
We're not successful if China steals our data if Russia can back engineer one before if Iran gets one before us

1814
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:59,260
We're fucked because these things are insanely we was indicated. We would obviously weaponize the technology. That's obvious

1815
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:05,300
Yeah, it's like 101 right we not the basics I mean if you could put a nuke on one of those things

1816
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,300
I mean the exhibited technology that people say

1817
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:10,900
People that have witnessed this stuff say it goes from a standstill to out of sight in the blink of an eye

1818
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,900
I mean these objects what was it?

1819
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:21,540
David Fravor said that it went from space 50,000 feet above sea level to sea level in one second in one second. Yeah, that's

1820
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:27,820
It's insane. We talked about it yesterday. Oh you did. Yeah insane amount of speed and

1821
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:30,380
the way

1822
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:37,380
Ryan explained it in terms of like the amount of force you would need is equivalent to how many nuclear bombs that he say?

1823
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:41,640
Something insane like the entire nuclear arsenal has to be

1824
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:45,820
To generate that kind of power whatever it is

1825
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:54,100
It's if these stories are true. It's doing something that we don't understand. So if it's ours I

1826
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,420
Kind of get why they wouldn't want to spill the beans

1827
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:05,100
My thought once was what if this is not weaponizable with our current technology like what if these are

1828
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:10,160
These things are our drones, but they don't know how to put a weapon on it yet

1829
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:14,340
Like because whatever you do I have a problem with that a speed

1830
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:18,760
I have a problem with that theory and the problem I have is that the United States government has

1831
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:25,120
Documented close encounters of the third kind that's a beans connected right? That's their own files, right? That's not me saying it

1832
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:31,820
Right, so it's not just these objects exhibiting revolutionary technology for at least 80 years, right?

1833
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,120
No wings, no tail

1834
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:37,960
No visible means of propulsion the ability to hover accelerate at a site the blink of an eye right angle turns at high speed

1835
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:44,560
No wake no sonic boom that kind of stuff, but you also have reports credible reports of beans

1836
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:51,060
Connected to some of the craft and that's documented all around the world. So that eliminates

1837
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,720
Right if it's true

1838
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:56,200
So well, yeah the whole thing like just because something's written down somewhere

1839
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,040
It doesn't mean that someone didn't write it down as a Psy op

1840
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:03,280
So don't someone did write down to discredit other people with a ridiculous story

1841
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:09,440
One way to discredit a credible story is to attach it to a bunch of ridiculous stories, right?

1842
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,520
So if I was gonna hide some sort of technology

1843
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,520
One thing I would do is connect it to a bunch of kooky stuff

1844
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:22,200
What's a psychic stuff and remote viewing just a bunch of things that people like very easily dismissed UFO abductions

1845
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:29,640
UFO encounters encounters with an actual being right but put a bunch of stuff in there that like makes people go what is this real?

1846
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:33,760
And just enough just enough so that you can hide the real stuff in there

1847
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,080
Well, I think I'm again. I'm not I'm playing devil's advocate

1848
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:44,320
And again, I've said this earlier on the show and I'll say it again is like the reason why I believe David Grush

1849
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:49,160
Who testified not just I believe David, but David doesn't have firsthand experience

1850
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:53,120
I know talked about but the reason I know I know but the reason why I believe

1851
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,840
Him is because it aligns with my research in the field

1852
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:03,760
I remember I spent over 12 years investigating on and off with my buddy Marco Leal and in in Virginia, Brazil

1853
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:10,080
That UFO crash case and only found out last minute the last time I was there is that the Americans were involved

1854
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:13,800
So I was like, oh my god, the rumors are are true

1855
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:18,200
Like, you know, the Americans really are do you see like I obviously looked into Roswell for years

1856
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:23,200
I went to Roswell the 50th anniversary. This is how the deal works, bro. You want the aid we get the UFO

1857
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:29,120
We give you the aid but if a crash UFO you fucking call us. Yeah, stay out of there

1858
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,160
Don't be carrying that dude to the hospital

1859
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,160
Leave it to us and then we'll just scoop that up and shut the fuck up

1860
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:41,240
What do you think about that that the one of the craziest stories is that there's a building somewhere?

1861
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:47,160
That's an enormous building that was actually built around the UFO UFO was too big to move. Have you heard this story?

1862
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:53,320
Yeah, it was reported on used News Nation with Ross call hard to be real and well Ross cold heart is a credible

1863
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,120
He's got a great accent

1864
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:00,120
Not quite British we believe

1865
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,840
What it's close more credible than a New York accent there's something about a British accent that just adds credibility to anything

1866
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,560
It was some guy from New York. So we got this fucking car right for the story

1867
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,920
This spaceship so fucking big

1868
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:20,600
Build a building around it, but they talked about it now. Here's what is this building and where is it supposed to be?

1869
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,200
I I don't know. Oh, you're holding them back. No, no

1870
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,640
Nope, I have a little bit but I don't have the same connections on that

1871
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:33,440
But I'll tell you a case that I do think needs to get looked into oh, you see, you know

1872
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:37,960
You're gonna move us around. Yeah, yeah, because this is what this is. No, but this is a craft

1873
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,320
Government agent this guy so trying to so there's a there's a memo in the program

1874
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:49,960
That was through the dobson process was released. Unfortunately, some of the names are redacted

1875
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:54,520
Christopher Mellon obtained it. It was from correspondence. He had with a high-level government official

1876
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:59,960
Back in 2020 it just got approved for release. I don't know maybe a year ago

1877
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,120
it's featured in the in the in the dock and

1878
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:06,440
In it has the names of not just the gatekeeper

1879
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:10,520
But other people that names who found the gatekeeper to the crash retrieval program

1880
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:18,400
I'm told that unredacted versions that had been handed to select members of Congress and people that are investigated in an official capacity for the government

1881
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:23,400
But in it, they specifically mentioned a case not crash a landed case. It happened in

1882
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,120
1953 it came in, Arizona

1883
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:32,200
So I've made some inquiries with aerospace folks that I've been meeting with quietly and I'm like, what's this case?

1884
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:37,920
So you guys keep talking about with the King in Arizona. They're like, oh, it was like they just landed and left

1885
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,040
I was like, well, how do you know they like what do you mean landed and left and they're like

1886
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:45,920
Well, the doors are open and nobody home and they walked off

1887
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,460
I said you mean somebody just flew this thing down

1888
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:55,820
It landed on the ground in the desert and came in Arizona in 1953 and they left the doors open and laughing

1889
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:57,820
They're like, yep, that's pretty much what happened

1890
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:04,300
So I'm so they left the craft there somebody just they flew it down and left a craft on the ground

1891
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:09,140
I was told that and I I wouldn't be repeating this if I didn't think there was some serious credibility to it

1892
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:16,180
But apparently is and well doesn't that align with how Diana Pesolka and Gary Nolan have started describing these things as donations

1893
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:22,100
The individual that I talked to was so funny because this individual was like not a scratch

1894
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:28,740
And I go not a scrap what not a screw not a scratch not a scratch on the no

1895
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:32,540
It was perfect didn't have a scratch. I was like, oh my gosh

1896
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:40,180
This sounds like somebody who's more than just heard about this but that one of the aspects of it didn't have a scratch on it

1897
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:44,500
So I think that's that's a case that I think that so the first hand

1898
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:49,260
Witness said it didn't have a scratch. I don't know if it was the way they describe the way the problem

1899
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:55,220
The way the problem I have with all this stuff, but here's the thing if you were Travis Walton. Yes. Okay. Love that guy

1900
01:29:55,220 --> 01:30:00,780
I love that guy too fascinating. I really enjoyed there's we got a bobblehead. That's a Travis Walton bobblehead. Oh

1901
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:07,140
No way. Yes way. I got it from Travis. That's him staring at the sky. Oh my gosh when he's a young man

1902
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:13,540
I went to the location. So that is I'm interested in that because that's a first-hand witness. Yes, right? That's a guy

1903
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:20,660
Yes explaining his bizarre experience. He told the same story. No question for whatever's 56 forever's whatever the hell

1904
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:26,100
It's 1975 whatever it was since he got abducted 50 almost 50 years. So this guy

1905
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:32,220
Was there that was his story that I'm interested in that when I hear a guy told a guy

1906
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:37,540
That this is what happened and this is how he described it. I'm like super frustrated. So talking to Jay Sands

1907
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,680
Yes, first-hand again first hand was like

1908
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:44,440
Yeah, yeah face-to-face yes, tell me what it was doing what it looked like yeah

1909
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:49,680
That's it. He thought it was an adolescent too. He didn't think that it was a full-grown one. He thought it was young

1910
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:53,680
Well, he's got an illustration of it in the documentary and I tell you it's it's one of the crazy

1911
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:58,480
I remember after imagine I know I was like if this is true. I was like

1912
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,760
Crazy

1913
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:05,520
Person now, this is something that we didn't reveal in the documentary was really funny

1914
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:09,880
He thought that this individual was suffering from frostbite or

1915
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,560
That when you get really cold hypothermia

1916
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,880
Skin had a blue tint to it

1917
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,400
so he was take he took his jacket off and he

1918
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,760
Very insistently put the jacket on this individual because he was thinking this person's really really cold

1919
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,000
He's been out in the desert probably had a plane crash or whatever

1920
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,760
Right, and so he's putting his dad and the person was kind of resistant

1921
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,720
But Jason said I insisted I took one layer of my jacket and I put around this

1922
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:37,520
Individual and that individual left with the jacket on so we jokingly I jokingly say where do you think your jacket is now?

1923
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:45,120
Probably out there it helps Atari or god. Holy knows or right here. Yeah. Yeah, or yeah, or this is the thing that gets right here

1924
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:51,600
Logistically, yes. Okay, if these things are coming from the ocean just logistically you would have to have a large ship

1925
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,560
So we were talking about this with Ryan yesterday and I was saying like if they had a battleship

1926
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:01,440
We'd be able to see that right like 100% he said so it would have to be a submarine

1927
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:06,520
So Mike Jesus Christ, what if there really is some sort of a civilization?

1928
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:13,060
Underwater that that has existed co-existed with us forever. Did you hear about the

1929
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:22,600
Testimony by rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet just recently in Congress. Is this the one where the things moving underwater 500 knots?

1930
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,560
Yes, he's reporting. He's

1931
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:30,620
I don't have all that you can remember. Yeah, what I can remember is basically is confirming that we have

1932
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:37,880
Objects that are exhibiting a technology underwater that defies any conventional explanation things that are just virtually impossible

1933
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:43,080
Like so much faster than the fastest submarine or anything like that just and they're really big

1934
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:48,200
Yeah, it's moving as if there's no resistance underwater. Yeah, then they moving like a fighter jet would in the air

1935
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:52,920
It's moving like that. Yeah, they call the transmedium or something. Yeah, but there's but confirmation

1936
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:58,320
I mean that's and I actually spoke to to to rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet

1937
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:05,280
On a couple of occasions recently and I thanked him for coming forward to testify and he said, you know

1938
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,480
I felt an obligation to do so because a lot of my men

1939
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:15,680
The pilots were coming forward and I wanted to back them up and so that's why that's why he stepped forward and

1940
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:20,320
You're if you're coming here from somewhere else and you wanted to hide in plain sight

1941
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,720
You would hide in the ocean

1942
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:28,440
Especially if you have the technology to like completely negate any of the effects of the the water and the pressure least explored

1943
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:33,480
Place on earth. Yeah, we can't get to it. We don't have the technology to get they know we don't they know

1944
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:38,600
It's really hard to get a submarine out to wherever the fuck they went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench

1945
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:43,240
Cameron Cameron by himself. I would never do that. He's a wild boy

1946
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:47,680
Like 35,000 feet down. How far is it bizarre like that?

1947
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:51,840
I mean, that's those poor would you go down in a submarine by yourself? No, definitely not

1948
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:55,440
Homemade one like the one those people died in yeah

1949
01:33:55,440 --> 01:34:00,440
but that was there's another thing about that case when the people went down that submarine apparently I

1950
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:05,520
Guess it's the Navy has some sort of very sophisticated underwater

1951
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:13,040
Audio sensors and they heard the implosion and they knew about it like immediately and didn't report on it

1952
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:19,020
Well, I mean I think the problem with reporting on is that you have to report on your technology now

1953
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:25,640
Yes, I don't even know if this has been confirmed, but this is what I had heard methods and means or well

1954
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,720
It's also

1955
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,560
It's got to be top-secret

1956
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:33,260
Like it's got to be one of those things where if you're gonna reveal that you heard that you have to have clearance to do

1957
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:34,880
You probably have to run it up the ladder

1958
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,880
One of the reasons why we know about overhead

1959
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:42,560
Satellite imagery of UAP is because of Ratcliffe who was former head of ODNI

1960
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,460
and he came forward and I remember it's funny actually it was classified and

1961
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:55,000
Christopher Mellon participated in this latest production with me because of Ratcliffe revealing it on Fox News and Ratcliffe basically says

1962
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:02,440
Yeah, we have overhead collection satellite data of UAP that are pretty fucking far out and that yeah that that happened

1963
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:05,360
So they're talking about this but getting back to your point because I know you said you were frustrated

1964
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:11,040
You're like, oh, yeah, it's just another anecdotal piece of evidence a piece of testimony third-party not firsthand

1965
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,040
No, I know I what I'm saying is I totally agree with you

1966
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:19,080
I'm frustrated as somebody who's been chasing the story for 30 years

1967
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:22,160
I too want access to the better more compelling data

1968
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:22,560
Yeah

1969
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,840
Why chase after that photograph I just shared with you earlier on for as long as I did because I hear about something

1970
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,840
I go after it, but I want to remind your audience

1971
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,920
You can't go after something without knowing that it exists

1972
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:39,480
So you get the leads you find you start we're learning more about the programs

1973
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,720
We're learning how these programs are hidden these who saps

1974
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:47,840
They're waved unacknowledged special access programs probably hidden somewhere in the deal

1975
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:48,920
I know it sounds crazy

1976
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:55,440
But but least guiding giving some guidance to where are these things and how these things are hidden where they might be found

1977
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:02,000
We reveal there's a gentleman in the film called Navy X and people are like, ah, it's just another person

1978
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,760
Testifying anonymously. Well, yes true

1979
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,560
But he gives us specifics on telling members of Congress where to look to find this specifics

1980
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,120
Jwix, what is it? And this is where to find the more compelling data

1981
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:20,480
I'm gonna read this because it's important that people know that he's saying look I've seen it and this is where it is

1982
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:28,400
It's called the official UAP data is kept either in sipper secret internet protocol router network or jwix joint worldwide

1983
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:34,920
Intelligence communication system that's used by the DOD and only available in a skiff and a skiff is a sensitive

1984
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:41,360
Compartmented information facility. So is it frustrating to hear that and people criticize? Oh, it's it's another person

1985
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,360
But he's saying I've seen it

1986
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:49,160
It's phenomenal. He gives descriptions of some of the stuff he saw and he's telling members of Congress

1987
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:53,640
If you have the clearances, this is where it's being kept. So those are very good specifics

1988
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:58,600
And again, I remind you guys like okay, just be patient. This is not a hundred-yard dash

1989
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,600
We're running a marathon right now

1990
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:04,160
We are we're trying to get back to what I was talking about earlier

1991
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:12,400
Logistically, I'm kidding. If you're letting something go from the ocean. Yes, if you're flying it out of the ocean logistically

1992
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:16,360
You would have to have some sort of a large craft out there

1993
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:22,520
That's going to house these things or it's gonna launch from yeah, if it is actually coming from the ocean

1994
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:29,200
Oh, you see the drones you're talking about right now, right? Yes, so either they're ours and if there are ours

1995
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:36,280
Yeah, how do they hide the fact there's a battleship out there if is that possible? And if if it's from a submarine

1996
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:43,240
How do they develop a submarine that can launch 50 car sized or SUV sized drones from yeah

1997
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:47,760
That's one of the things that Christopher Mellon said to me this morning. He goes that's just that's the one

1998
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:54,880
element or aspect that that really is a head-scratcher because but this is the question 50

1999
01:37:55,440 --> 01:38:00,000
50 of these things coming in off the ocean that's just confirmed right, right? No one said no

2000
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:06,440
Here's the question. Yes, is it possible to classify the location of a US battleship?

2001
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:13,400
That's capable of having these things so big. How could you like what how big would it have to be to launch 50 drones?

2002
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,360
God, you're not talking you're talking. I don't know man

2003
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:22,120
But that's a question a lot of drones, especially the size they're reporting they're talking about drones the size of an SUV, right?

2004
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:26,280
So let's uh on loiter time, let's imagine let's imagine you

2005
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:30,680
So when you take a ferry, how many cars can a ferry fit on it?

2006
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:36,440
I take a ferry all the time in Vermont like a legit one like a European 50 cars

2007
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:39,080
I put well the one that's medium legit I put

2008
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:45,040
25 30 maybe 40 25. Yeah

2009
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:51,440
So could you think couldn't you do that with drones and couldn't you have something that's a little larger than the average ferry?

2010
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:55,320
So you wouldn't need a battleship? Why would they do that? Why would they do that?

2011
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:00,600
Residential areas. Well, I don't know have everybody scratching their heads all these press conferences

2012
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,560
You're talking about the head of the gang of eight. Okay

2013
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,200
but if they're if they need to

2014
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:11,200
You're gonna tell the if they are really looking for a nuke

2015
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:20,760
Okay, let's imagine that this story about you know a Ukrainian nuke from the time when they they disarmed them

2016
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:26,160
There's one that's unaccounted for this is one of those stories that's been on the internet. I don't know if it's true

2017
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,640
Yeah, that it's unaccounted for that

2018
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:32,800
They think it's headed to the United States if you were trying to find that thing like a dirty bomb

2019
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:37,440
Yeah, or like a just a regular nuke that if you're looking for gamma rays

2020
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:45,040
like the you could devise a drone that could search for that and you'd fly it over an area and you wouldn't care whether people

2021
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:48,480
Freaked out because it's more important to find this goddamn thing. Mm-hmm, right?

2022
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:52,000
So if you have this technology, it's some skunk works

2023
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:59,560
No, I don't think so. I think you have to be there certain proximity within I think to pick up whatever

2024
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:04,240
Did you bring this up with Ryan Graves? Yes. What did he say? You mean he doesn't know either, you know

2025
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:10,240
He doesn't think so everybody that I trust that's the issue people in the FBI people that I'm I communicate with often

2026
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,760
I'm like what is going on?

2027
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:17,960
it almost seems too sexy that the United States has that kind of ability and they're just flying these things around and that

2028
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:20,920
They're doing it for that specific reason to find a nuke

2029
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:25,560
It's like that we have this kind of technology that we didn't none of us are aware of that

2030
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:29,960
We have these these drones that can shut off when you come close to them. The lights shut off. They disappear

2031
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:34,600
They that go dark avoid tracking the RF signal doesn't show up

2032
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:40,720
They they're cool. There's some they have some sort of cooling mechanism in them. So it's difficult to see with infrared

2033
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:44,440
I don't understand any of that. He was saying that's above what we can do right now

2034
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,560
And saying they but they're not moving in a way necessarily

2035
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:52,640
That's not possible with drone technology that is mainstream

2036
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:59,040
But there's some aspects of the way they move and what they're doing that doesn't lead them to believe that this is

2037
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,800
Current state-of-the-art technology. There's no yeah

2038
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:07,720
They even even I had some and tell people tell me like even if it's conventional, it's highly advanced conventional, right?

2039
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:12,520
But let's look at China like China has highly advanced drones. Yeah, they're drunk. They're

2040
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:16,720
We're talking about this as well that the bottleneck in America was the FAA

2041
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:22,800
The FAA put a lot of restrictions on the manufacturer of drones and how you can do them what you can do

2042
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,200
China doesn't have any of that

2043
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:30,680
So they're full steam ahead with innovation if you look at what drone manufacturers in the United States have been able to do and then

2044
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:37,760
Imagine untethered if they weren't fucked over by all these regulations that got in the way of innovation

2045
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:42,120
Who just come obviously you have to have one because if you have some

2046
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:45,280
Commercial drone that someone can buy that can move

2047
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:51,520
500 miles an hour and fly through the air and stay up there for six hours at a time and film video of everything and anything

2048
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:58,040
Well, and you can't control it. You can't block the the radar screen. You can't find it with infrared. That's pretty nuts

2049
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:03,320
So I would imagine that would not be a thing that they would want in the hands of the average American person

2050
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:08,080
But why did it just start happening fairly recently when I say this I'm saying if it's Chinese

2051
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:15,720
If it's Chinese if they if they're unburdened by our regulations and that not only do they have the help of the government they have

2052
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,660
Financing behind them. They have an imperative there. They're told what to do

2053
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:25,960
They're flying it over Langley. They're flying it over wouldn't you do that bet just to fuck with these people

2054
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:31,060
What's the golf course that Trump has? Yeah, it's golf course. Yeah, what's that called? I don't know Westminster

2055
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:34,560
They're flying over that yeah the president-elect

2056
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:42,040
So it's Langley Air Force Base did experience incursions of unauthorized unbanned aerial systems in last year December

2057
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:48,020
2023 says Sabrina Singh Pentagon spokeswoman the number of those UAS incursions did fluctuate

2058
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:52,340
But they didn't appear to exhibit any hostile intent. It's something that we have kept our eye on

2059
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:56,980
Well, thank God you're keeping your eye on it. Yeah, we have no idea what they are, but they they're fine

2060
01:42:57,860 --> 01:43:01,560
That's been happy this is the third year in a row this has been happening right around Christmas time

2061
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:07,860
One of the reasons why I wanted you guys to hear that account by the guy at Vandenberg Air Force Base

2062
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:14,180
This is not anonymous reporting the guy's giving his name right and he's talking about objects that are the size of a football field

2063
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:18,800
Yeah, hovering over a silo launch control area. That's also the Phoenix lights

2064
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:22,200
They described them as size of a football field or larger. Oh, yeah

2065
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:26,920
Well, I interviewed a guy there was a case that happened in right here in Texas Stephen Ville

2066
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:31,840
Ricky Sorrell is one of the best witnesses. I love the guy. He's a he was a hunter and

2067
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:37,320
He's like he's like James. He's like you could have landed an airplane on this. I said you gotta be kidding me

2068
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:42,600
He goes no man. I goes I stood under this thing. He goes it was so big I was

2069
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:48,080
Standing under it and he had his rifle and he's standing under it and he's looking up and he's looking to the left

2070
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:52,780
He's looking to the left right back forward can't see the edge of it in any direction

2071
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:56,520
So he grabs his hunting rifles. He was he was hunting dear. This is 2008

2072
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:03,400
Gives his honey shot it. No. Well, so he holds his honey, right his rifle up and he's looking through the scope and he goes

2073
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:08,040
James I'm a metal worker. I work with metal. I know what metal looks like and he's looking through the scope and he goes man

2074
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:13,400
There's no rivets. There's no seams. There's no weld marks. He's like there are these on the belly of it

2075
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,560
There were these reverse like recessed

2076
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:21,080
Cones it's like bigger and then they got smaller as it went up in the belly of the craft

2077
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,560
He's looking up at it and his fingers on the trigger and he's like man

2078
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:30,240
I wonder wasn't that how I go I wonder what happened if I just pulled the trigger here and I bet it would ricochet off

2079
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,520
Or hit the belly or something

2080
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:36,040
So he's looking at it and he's just about to pull the trigger to check it out and he goes

2081
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,560
Hmm, maybe this isn't such a good idea. I

2082
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,720
Interviewed him in 2008 when this is going down and then about a year later

2083
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,640
I was doing some follow-up interviews for a film I did

2084
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:52,000
I know what I saw and I had this gentleman walk up to me and I was filming in the downtown square in

2085
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,600
Stephenville or it might have been Dublin and

2086
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:58,280
This gentleman looks at me and he goes you mr. Fox

2087
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:05,240
Yes, and he pulls out a badge and he shows me as his badge and he's like, can I talk to you for a minute?

2088
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:09,820
I'm officer so-and-so and I was like Jesus Christ. What the hell did I do and I say yeah

2089
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:12,180
We walk off to a cafe and he goes

2090
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:17,820
He's looking at the head is back. He had his back to the wall and the cafe so you can see everybody coming in

2091
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:22,140
He was really paranoid and he says, you know, Ricky Sorrell's I said, yeah, he goes that guy's telling the truth

2092
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:25,420
I said, how do you know he goes because the whole police department saw it

2093
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:32,640
I can't remember if it was Dublin Police Department of Stephenville. I think it was Dublin Stephen Police Department. He goes we have and we he said we

2094
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:36,540
We were sitting over there patrol cars and this object was like a floating

2095
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:43,620
Department store me it was absolutely colossus colossal like a city took out my radar gun pointed at it and it was doing

2096
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:48,460
22 miles an hour and then he said it drifted off and they one of the officers

2097
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:54,460
I don't remember the name of the gentleman took his his gun his sorry his dashcam and he flipped it up and he filmed it

2098
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:58,740
And apparently with one of the biggest mistakes he this individual made this police officer made was it

2099
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:01,360
He didn't make a copy of it because the local Air Force base

2100
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,960
Requested that film footage and got it

2101
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:07,680
And so I've been telling people to go after that stuff exists

2102
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:14,540
But my point is this object was so big people claimed the witnesses the first-hand witnesses that you had landed an airplane on it

2103
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:18,880
Yeah, I mean what is what is that?

2104
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:25,000
See that that's the thing like if you see that do you even tell people you sound like a kook

2105
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,040
Yeah, like if I saw it if I was outside in the desert. Yeah, I was just chilling

2106
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:35,120
And something so big that I couldn't see the edges of it. Yeah flew overhead. I don't know what I'd say

2107
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:37,840
He said when it took off it was like this

2108
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:43,640
He goes James and Ricky didn't want to give me an on-camera interview for the longest time. He said I'm not coming forward

2109
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:49,280
I'm not gonna do it. I'm not going public. I worked on him for eight months. Finally. I got the green light

2110
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:52,200
I flew back out to Texas got him on camera put him in the movie

2111
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:57,320
But he said when it took off it went from this a complete standstill and it went

2112
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:03,200
Straight up like a slight angle, but straight up and gone. He goes James. I said describe the acceleration

2113
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:09,280
He goes hell I'll tell you the best way I can describe is it had I blinked I would have I would have missed it

2114
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:16,200
That's how fast it took off. So it went from here like that. He had um, he had helicopters hovering over his I know

2115
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:21,160
This sounds crazy. People are gonna be like, oh this big, you know, but he had helicopters flying over his property for a while

2116
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:24,280
Right around the time that I was trying to get him to go on camera

2117
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:29,360
He came out in his underwear and his shotgun late at night with his helicopter spotlighting him up

2118
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:34,080
and he ended up calling the local Air Force base and said stop flying over my house at night and they said we

2119
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:36,080
suggest you stop talking about what you saw and

2120
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:39,640
So he was kind of spooked and about eight months later

2121
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:43,080
He finally he finally decided that he was gonna go public with the story

2122
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:49,160
But you know everything to lose nothing to gain you get this countless reports of these cases

2123
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:53,240
You know and they're around the world, right? It's not just the United States

2124
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,280
I've demonstrated that time and time again

2125
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:58,400
But there's more of them in the United States than anywhere else, right?

2126
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:03,400
Well, I mean one of my favorite cases Ruiz and Bobway. That's an amazing right right

2127
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,960
But there's more sightings in the United States

2128
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:11,960
There seems to be an attraction almost like a moth to a flame with with nukes

2129
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:18,740
Somehow they're interested in our new nuclear capabilities and and I remember interviewing that Robert Salas

2130
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:25,460
Who was a launch control officer who described this whole event at Maelstrom Air Force base in the 60s where these UFOs were witness

2131
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:27,460
on the base and then all their

2132
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:34,460
Minutemen missiles started getting shut down and I remember saying to him like well what what?

2133
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:36,940
What's what's your take on that?

2134
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:43,660
Like what kind of you know, he goes and I could realize I realize why this individual was a launch control officer because he was

2135
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:45,740
So measured and so calm and so cool

2136
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:48,220
And he goes well James

2137
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:53,260
The message I got was kind of clear. It's almost like taking matches out of the hands of a baby

2138
01:48:54,460 --> 01:49:01,140
About the news. Yeah. Yeah, so, you know with the phenomenon you look at what they do

2139
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:04,420
Right and then that says some things

2140
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:11,220
They've done some pretty brazen events right over the around over the decades, but you also look at what they don't do

2141
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:14,100
Because if the phenomenon

2142
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:20,580
Wanted to end this like, you know secrecy once and for all all they'd have to do is hover over the Macy's Day parade or

2143
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:26,860
Of or the next big Super Bowl and it's game over they don't do that. They've done some pretty brazen things, right?

2144
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:34,020
I mean case in point March 13th 97 over the state of Arizona including the governor 5 Simon witnessed that

2145
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:37,600
Massive there were a number of UFOs witnessed but that the main one

2146
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:43,580
You know was this big boomerang shaped craft and even the governor said it must have been at least a mile across from wing

2147
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:49,060
Tip that floated and I actually interviewed people that worked at Luke Air Force Base at the time

2148
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:55,540
And they said that they scrambled jets to intercept this thing and I interviewed a number of people that saw that craft

2149
01:49:55,540 --> 01:50:00,220
I mean that stood on their that light down in their lawns and watched it float over the top of them and

2150
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:05,380
Apparently according to this individual that I met in the in the late 90s at Luke Air Force Base

2151
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:10,060
They scrambled a military jet to intercept this thing. He came up on it could have landed on the damn thing

2152
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:16,540
It was so big and it went from moving very very slowly to accelerating like warp drive boom just gone

2153
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:22,020
when the jet came back to the base Luke Air Force Base, they had to carry him out of

2154
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:25,620
The plane I'm told because he was so shaken by what he saw

2155
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:30,280
Yeah, I could imagine you wouldn't handle that. Well, can you imagine having to keep that secret?

2156
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:34,220
No, imagine like could you imagine taking the governor?

2157
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:39,700
We had to lie right the government had to like stand up with a rope or a guy in a just an alien suit

2158
01:50:39,860 --> 01:50:43,420
Yeah, and the alien costume. Yeah, and I hammered him on that one

2159
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:48,580
Well, then afterwards once he left office, then he talked about it. Yes, he talked about seeing it. Yes

2160
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:52,620
Yeah, I got why he had to do that though. I got oh well

2161
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:56,380
so I interviewed I was the one that got him to break his silence after ten years and

2162
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:01,700
He told me and I don't necessarily know that I fully believe it

2163
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:07,940
But he told because initially when it happened in March and now remember the vast majority of people were out of the night's guy

2164
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:09,900
You get a glimpse of the hell bob comment

2165
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:14,980
so it was witnessed all the way across the state of Arizona and even in Nevada, Southern Nevada and

2166
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:20,660
Yes, there he is five told me that it was growing hysteria

2167
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:26,740
But initially he had set out and he said we're gonna find out I'm contacting Luke Air Force Base

2168
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:31,940
We shot to the Pentagon and all these various services and we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of it

2169
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:35,100
And then I don't know how much longer it was. Was it later that day?

2170
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:42,180
The next day he held an unscheduled press conference and that's when he had his aides dressed up in an alien suit and made a

2171
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:49,820
Mockery of it all and I can assure you pissed the hell off his constituents and the witnesses all across the state of Arizona

2172
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:51,820
they were furious and I

2173
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:57,220
Confronted him on that ten years after the fact because I was pissed off

2174
01:51:57,220 --> 01:52:03,740
I was investigating that case when it happened in the 90s and I interviewed a lot of really good witnesses really good witnesses and

2175
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:09,580
He said the reason why he did it was because of growing hysteria that he wanted to

2176
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:13,620
quiet calm down the the hysteria, but

2177
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:17,620
Did he get a phone call just saying hey kill this story? I?

2178
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:21,580
Lean in that direction, but he's never even when we're having cocktails together

2179
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:25,860
He's never confessed that that happened, but it was awfully suspicious the way it all went down

2180
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:32,440
It's a little weird especially considering he actually saw it that could have been a turning point in the UFO phenomenon reporting

2181
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,440
You know

2182
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:39,720
Era right like suddenly you get this massive sighting which would happen today

2183
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:46,360
We would have been covered by you know everybody's phones and I whatever but but if the governor had come forward and said yeah

2184
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:49,960
We need to figure out that thing is I'm a former captain in the Air Force on a pilot

2185
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:52,160
And I don't I saw it. I don't know what the hell that thing was

2186
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:59,200
Is there any footage of the actual thing that the triangle boomerang there are there's some footage floating around and I featured some

2187
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:06,000
And I know what I saw you got an object in the night sky with lights that and I at the time in

2188
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:11,200
2009 I did some kind of enhancement. I'm sure the software is a lot better nowadays of

2189
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,880
It looks like

2190
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:19,600
Like a big I can draw it like a boomerang yeah, yeah, but more angular. It was like

2191
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:22,240
like this

2192
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,400
like this

2193
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:27,640
Am I drawing my drawings are terrible look up at the screen

2194
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:35,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah kind of like that. Yeah, mm-hmm. Yep, and so that image in the far left

2195
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:43,140
That's but that's yeah, and there was that's it right there, right? Yeah, and here's something that kind of throws off the trail here because

2196
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:50,400
Excuse me the object came down of the state of Arizona it went from north to south is that legit

2197
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,240
on the right there yeah, I

2198
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:56,240
Honestly, I can't say

2199
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,160
I'd have to really do a deep dive into it

2200
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:00,160
But let me tell you what happened because this is brilliant

2201
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:06,600
So what happened was you got this massive object from around 530 at night in the southern?

2202
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:15,480
Nevada and then it drifts down very slowly over across the entire from north to south across the entire state of Arizona and right around

2203
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:22,560
738 830 the Gary the Barry Goldwater Mountain Range, which is the direction it was heading in

2204
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:26,240
The military decides to drop a bunch of flares and

2205
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:31,220
So people were like, oh there it is. There's some you know, and they and a bunch of people film the flares

2206
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:34,480
So in my opinion, it was a diversionary tactic

2207
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:40,960
That was brilliantly done because why the military suddenly decided to drop flares and the shape of somewhat of the shape

2208
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:47,920
So I think that some of the footage that you've seen out there is military flares, but there's and there was an effort

2209
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:51,800
I don't know if you want to get into it right now, but there was there was an effort

2210
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:58,640
By the so-called M&B, which the MIB these men in black or the whatever unknown government agency they come from

2211
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:00,680
to

2212
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:03,000
That took that took some footage that I was

2213
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,560
learning about

2214
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:08,680
During my investigations in the 90s and then you're looking at me looking crazy

2215
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:09,920
No, no

2216
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:15,440
So the first time I really heard a really credible report of the MIB and I decided not to report on it

2217
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:21,800
Was when I was in touch with a woman who was councilwoman Frances Barwood who was one of the few officials

2218
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:23,600
in

2219
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:27,660
Phoenix area that was saying hey, let's investigate what these people are claiming they've seen

2220
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:32,800
She's not saying aliens have landed. All she's saying is hey these people have a right to know what's going on

2221
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:38,040
Let's launch an investigation. She was lambasted over the media made fun of ridiculed

2222
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:42,160
But as a result of her inquiry public inquiry and putting it out there

2223
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:48,000
one of these individuals reached out to her and I know this because I know her Frances Barwood and I heard the whole story and

2224
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:50,040
he was a

2225
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:55,400
He was a Vietnam vet and he was on the roof of his house with a tripod and a camera and he was trying to

2226
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:55,880
Get a glimpse

2227
01:55:55,880 --> 01:56:01,880
He was trying to film the pale Bob comment and he had walkie talkies and he was monitoring the truck drivers driving up interstate 10

2228
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:04,480
from Tucson to Phoenix and so he's

2229
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,560
Monitoring this and he hears these truckers talking about a massive UFO and he's like shit

2230
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,040
That's heading right towards my house

2231
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:11,240
Who was like I'll film it

2232
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:17,200
So he had a camera all ready to go and the object went right over his house according to him and he filmed the whole

2233
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:19,280
Thing and he goes. Yeah, I filmed the whole thing. It's pretty spectacular

2234
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,680
And I know that you're launching an investigation Frances Barwood. Would you like to see it?

2235
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:27,120
And she said yeah, so they made arrangements where he was gonna drop it off at her office

2236
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:32,800
Either later that day or first thing the next morning two representatives and it was July at this point

2237
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:38,160
It was very hot two men in dark suits showed up at his house and they said hey

2238
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:44,400
He was apparently relieved. That's all they wanted. He said they were quite menacing looking didn't really say a lot

2239
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:47,520
They said we're from Francis Barwood's office. We're here to pick up that footage

2240
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:53,080
So he gives him the footage and he said the only question they asked him is did they make any copies and he said no

2241
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:57,360
And so they take the footage off. They go when he doesn't hear from Francis Barwood

2242
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:00,880
He's like what the hell so a couple days go by I think possibly up to a week

2243
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:07,520
He calls her up and he says and Francis will tell you this she'll validate what I'm telling you. He says hey

2244
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:08,680
What do you think of the footage?

2245
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:11,040
She goes well, what do you mean? What I think of the footage?

2246
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:14,240
I never got it. You were gonna drop it off at my office and you didn't show up

2247
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:17,720
He goes well didn't have to you had two men from your office show up and pick up

2248
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:22,000
She goes I didn't send anybody around to your office and I know at the time in the late 90s

2249
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:26,600
I'd heard a couple of stories prior to that. I thought this is too out there. This is too outlandish

2250
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:32,720
No one's gonna believe this. I have no proof of this other than her testimony screw it and I didn't report on it

2251
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:36,000
But hearing those cases over and over and over it's like there we go

2252
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:41,680
Once again the so-called evidence that could prove or disprove one way or the other the something truly

2253
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:46,240
Extraordinary took place in the skies over Phoenix back in 1997 vanished

2254
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:49,420
But there is some that's that slip between the cracks that's out there

2255
01:57:49,420 --> 01:57:54,240
You just have to do due diligence and there's I don't have the time to sip through those images that we're looking at

2256
01:57:54,240 --> 01:58:00,800
They look too clean. Yeah, I don't know what's AI generated or whatever. But what could have been in a documentary like a recreation?

2257
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:05,000
I know what I saw features some of the footage. I covered that case extensively

2258
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:10,360
So if anyone's interested in the Phoenix lights case that but I can tell you how many cited how many people saw it?

2259
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:12,400
Oh thousands. Yeah thousands

2260
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:19,560
I talked to another woman Stacey Rhodes and her daughter Emily and they said they were driving on Interstate 10 and she goes look James

2261
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:20,720
I'm gonna tell you how big this thing was

2262
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:26,080
I said how big is she goes first of all, there were people stopped on the freeway just like stopped as this thing

2263
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:28,760
It was like close encounters. They're floating over the she goes

2264
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:36,040
I could have held up a newspaper like this and look to the left look to the right look that and she said I couldn't block

2265
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:39,740
This thing out. That's how big it was and it didn't make a sound. It was gunmetal black

2266
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:41,680
It was witnessed by a lot of people

2267
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:45,360
That's why I say there's some some events that have happened over the decades that are pretty brazen

2268
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,740
And that's one of Hudson Valley's pretty brazen as well

2269
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:50,600
knew if it was true

2270
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:56,540
When you get thousands of people seeing the same thing if you see thousands of people saying the same thing including the governor

2271
01:58:56,940 --> 01:59:01,060
The governor invested in it and you go what happened the governor?

2272
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:04,740
Yeah, the governor same guy who came out with a fucking guy dressed up like yeah

2273
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:10,660
I know but I got him to come clean ten years later, but so he's well not credible. Well, he already bullshits

2274
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:13,860
He does he bullshits. He definitely bullshit. He definitely bullshits

2275
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:19,220
You're right. Yeah, but when someone bullshits about that, they may bullshit about anything, but well I

2276
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:25,300
True. Yeah, but I mean I again. I'm just playing devil's out. No, I hear you. I hear I hear what you're saying and I

2277
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:32,500
He has been a limelight a while. It's good thing to talk about now. There's no smoke without fire. There is so much

2278
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:35,340
evidence in terms of

2279
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:38,300
eyewitness testimony and

2280
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:44,100
radar some photographic not as much as we'd like that something truly inexplicable is

2281
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:47,940
Taking place in our aerospace right for sure something that

2282
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:50,860
after careful examination something that

2283
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:54,380
Not because of a lack of data in some instances

2284
01:59:54,380 --> 02:00:01,620
But that after careful analysis and research investigation that comes out the other end and says I can't explain this

2285
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:03,620
This is gonna have to be one of those

2286
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:09,140
unknowns or you know falls into that 15% category of

2287
02:00:10,580 --> 02:00:17,660
Cannot provide a terrestrial or conventional explanation for and those are the cases that I've so desperately have been going after for a long time

2288
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:24,060
So is all this disclosure and those discussions on television now and all these meetings and hearings does it

2289
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:30,500
So are you think we're on an accelerated path? Do you think this is like this is all good, right?

2290
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:36,780
I'm convinced of it. Yes, but do you think that there's a real possibility like within the next few years that they just completely drop

2291
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:38,980
All the bullshit and come clean about this stuff

2292
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:45,500
Or would it take some sort of extraordinary event where they had to admit it something much bigger than this drone thing?

2293
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:49,020
Well in some respects there has been I

2294
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:53,140
Remember I interviewed this guy Nick Pope at the MOD years ago

2295
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:55,780
And I was like this is the time when we were pushing for

2296
02:00:56,380 --> 02:01:00,700
Transparency there France was was releasing previously classified documents on UFOs

2297
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:04,500
Liz O'Neill as they'd say in the MOD followed suit

2298
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:09,220
They're releasing previously classified documents slowly putting it out there and at the time was rather exciting

2299
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:13,820
I just did a big event at the National Press Club with Leslie Kane and and it was like this whole move and it was

2300
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:15,300
Like oh my god, it's happening, right?

2301
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:22,140
But it it kind of petered out a little bit and I remember asking this guy that used to work the UFO desk at

2302
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:25,900
The MOD Nick Pope and I said Nick do you anticipate this any type of disclosure?

2303
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:29,340
This is like 2009 or something 2008 2009 and he goes

2304
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:34,940
James no, he goes it's gonna be disclosed with a small D. Not a big D

2305
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:39,940
It's gonna trickle out slowly the condition people get people prepared test the waters

2306
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:44,660
You know one of the things that we explore in the program and I'd never done that is the politics of disclosure

2307
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:49,500
It's a far more complex. Let's just suspend judgment for a moment and assume that it's real

2308
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:55,180
Okay, that there really is an NHI or non-human intelligence aspect to the phenomenon, right?

2309
02:01:55,180 --> 02:02:01,300
Let's just suggest that's real. Now. How do you disclose that to the general public? What about the impacts on organized religion?

2310
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:07,820
What about the impacts on financial institutions? What about the fact that we'd have to confess that we don't have full control over this

2311
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:09,380
I mean

2312
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:15,900
Those are real considerations and it's not just the United States, right? This involves the planet. This involves all the humanity

2313
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:17,700
I wanted to ask you about this. You see I'm saying like yeah

2314
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:22,340
Oh, I do I totally understand more complex than you think. Oh, I totally get that

2315
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:26,260
What do you how does Russia handle these things? How does China handle these things?

2316
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:31,300
Well, I there was a case in China that happened in 1994 right around the time of Rua Zimbabwe

2317
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:35,340
also in 1994 called Meng Zhao Gua and

2318
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:42,500
Happened in the Black Mountains and it was a landing alleged contact close to kind of the third kind

2319
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:48,500
It's funny because it happened around the same time of Africa similar message that was conveyed. I went to China

2320
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:55,180
I met with an active general in uniform talked openly about the UFO phenomenon. They were pretty open. I went to

2321
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:59,300
Russia in the late 90s and that was right before Putin

2322
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:03,820
It was right around the time when Putin was coming in and that was a period of openness

2323
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:07,780
And I went to Star City, Russia. I interviewed a cosmonaut Pavel Popovich

2324
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:14,580
A number of generals and they were very open about it. In fact, they said to me at the time if you're here

2325
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:19,000
To discuss whether or not the UFO phenomenon is real the doors right over there

2326
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:26,940
We're here to create an international coalition an international exchange of information and to talk about the implications of the phenomenon

2327
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:30,020
Which I thought was amazing. This is like 25 years ago, right?

2328
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:35,100
So now I don't know things have changed since Putin's been in office, but that was back in the late 90s

2329
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:38,580
I mean, they've been congressional hearings in Brazil. There's been there's been an effort

2330
02:03:38,580 --> 02:03:45,160
I mean shit they had they had hearings back in 1978 at United Nations at least Beagle put on, you know

2331
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:49,540
So there's been an ongoing effort for this stuff to come out. I just think it's different this time to me

2332
02:03:49,540 --> 02:03:51,540
It feels like they're not gonna

2333
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:57,060
There's too much. There's too much momentum behind it at this point and there's so much legislation that's written

2334
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:59,420
It's too much that's come out and it's too important

2335
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:05,700
Look, whether you believe it or you don't believe it if you can just imagine for a moment if it is true

2336
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:08,860
And if the US government does in fact have

2337
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:12,020
Irrefutable evidence that we're not alone in the universe

2338
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:18,540
That's so significant that we all have a right to that information and that we should continue to support this

2339
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:25,660
Unprecedented push for transparency with our elected officials and get to the fucking bottom of it. Why not everybody agrees, right?

2340
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:31,460
I think the general public no one's gonna disagree with you about yeah, and then new administrations coming in

2341
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:36,340
There's I you know, there's Ratcliffe and Rubio. I'm telling you Rubio knows a lot. I know that how do you know?

2342
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:40,740
He knows because I've talked to people that have debriefed him and been in the room with him during the first haven't talked to him

2343
02:04:41,020 --> 02:04:47,520
No, I have not. No, I have not but I talked to people that were in the room when he was being briefed from first-handers

2344
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:49,620
I'm told that there were

2345
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:52,140
I'm gonna say right around 12

2346
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:59,260
First hand people that have that have had behind closed doors meetings firsthand

2347
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:07,260
people that are concerned concerned about their secrecy concerned about their safety concerned about the implications and the of them coming forward and

2348
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:14,140
You know going going public that they're not quite they don't quite have this comes from very good source of information

2349
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:20,780
That the witness protection program and the legislation that they've created around that is not quite there yet. It's getting closer

2350
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:27,180
They need to continue to work on that. You don't mean like witness protections program like whistleblowers. They have whistleblower protection

2351
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:30,900
I'm sorry. I meant to say that. Excuse me. Yeah, whistleblower protection. It's not quite in place

2352
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:37,300
One of the things I really wanted to mention is that there is a gentleman a young man who's 30 and he feels like he's old

2353
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:42,760
His name is Jesse Michaels and he's got this new show called American Alchemy new a couple years old

2354
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:46,460
Why does it feel like he's old because you know when you're 30 you feel like you're old really well

2355
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:49,460
I did when I turned 30. I was like, I'm 30 because just 10 years earlier

2356
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:52,900
I was almost 19 right or 11 years earlier. I was 19, right?

2357
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:54,620
You go for a teenager to suddenly you're 30

2358
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:59,060
You always stick like 30 and I was talking to him not too long ago Jesse and I said he's like, yeah

2359
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:02,260
I feel a little old. I was like dude. You are just getting into your prime, baby

2360
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:05,780
This is rock and roll tub, but I really wanted to this is a guy who's young

2361
02:06:06,340 --> 02:06:13,140
Julian Dory is also doing some amazing work on this and podcasts, but he was young and he's doing a deep dive into the implications and

2362
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:18,580
Into he meets with aerospace engineers the guys he's a Jesse

2363
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:21,580
Phenomenon keep rocking and rolling. I want to cut tip my hat to you

2364
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:25,820
I don't know if you've seen this guy or not or no, he's doing deep dives into what's happening

2365
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:29,980
Yeah, he's documented it with these podcasts and he's doing a fantastic job

2366
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:32,420
and I just got a tip my hat to the guy because

2367
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:38,020
He's ten times smarter than I'll ever be and he's young and he's a force to be reckoned with and he's really doing he's

2368
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:42,260
Answering all the questions that you and are exploring all these issues that you and I are talking about

2369
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:47,740
Well, I'm glad there's people out there pushing it and I'm glad there's guys like brush that are sticking their neck out and guys

2370
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:49,700
Like you who are making documentaries about it

2371
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:55,420
It's the the subject is much more open to discussion like I was saying amongst serious people

2372
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:58,980
Yes, where it didn't used to be before and now I think with this drone thing

2373
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:01,260
I think there's so many people are going okay

2374
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:06,100
Okay, even if they're ours or they're China's or who what's going on? Yeah, why are there so many of them?

2375
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:11,340
What are the answers and why can't you tell us is it because they're searching for a new Jesus Christ?

2376
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:13,340
Maybe you should warn people and get the fuck out of here

2377
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:15,700
Is that really what's going on like

2378
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:22,220
If it's not what is going on and if it's not ours, what are they and how come you can't track them?

2379
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:25,980
How come like what kind of very bizarre? It doesn't even make sense

2380
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:30,860
It's very doesn't make sense when you think of the capabilities of the United States military

2381
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:33,060
It doesn't make any sense. They can't figure out what's going on

2382
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:39,140
I think what Trump said is probably correct that the government knows they know what's happening and they don't want to tell people

2383
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:42,620
He could tell us why wouldn't he I don't think he knows yet

2384
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:50,020
Until he gets in the office. He was he gave a speech about it at Mar-a-Lago. I saw that I saw that but did he say

2385
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:54,740
Well, let's watch it. We'll watch it. We'll watch it. Yeah, pull the speech up because I'm wondering if he yeah

2386
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:59,900
Well, we're about to find out. Yeah, essentially he was saying that he knows that the government knows what's going on and

2387
02:08:00,220 --> 02:08:04,140
They're not telling us so that means they're not telling him. So they're not telling him

2388
02:08:04,140 --> 02:08:08,260
No, I don't I'll think until you get in the office. You're not the president, right? So he's the president elect

2389
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:12,380
I don't know what kind of clearances that he has. Yeah, I don't understand how that works

2390
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:17,380
I'd be very curious to know what he knows right especially with this like who to even ask

2391
02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:24,060
Who is the person that can lay out the information like which department which which agents? Yeah, right?

2392
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:26,060
It seems like they're so compartmentalized

2393
02:08:28,700 --> 02:08:31,220
Thank you, good to see you good to see you

2394
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:40,240
The government the government knows what is happening

2395
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:42,680
Look

2396
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:45,400
Our military knows where they took off from

2397
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:51,960
If it's a garage, they can go right into that garage. They know where it came from and where it went

2398
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:55,320
and for some reason they don't want to comment and

2399
02:08:55,720 --> 02:09:01,720
I think they'd be better off saying what it is our military knows and our our president knows our president

2400
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:03,640
And for some reason they want to keep people in suspense

2401
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:10,080
I can't imagine it's the enemy because it was the enemy that blasted out even if they were late that blasted

2402
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,040
something

2403
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:18,280
Strange is going on for some reason they don't want to tell the people and they should because the people are really I mean

2404
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:20,280
They happen to be over Bedminster

2405
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:29,480
Very they're very close to Bedminster. I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster. I've decided to cancel my trip

2406
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:33,680
Yeah, I think I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster. Yeah

2407
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:41,600
Wow, I bet someone told him mr. President, it's pretty important that you don't go to the golf course. Yeah

2408
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:47,440
God, that's so crazy. Yeah. Um, so what does that mean? I gotta I gotta if you don't mind

2409
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:51,720
There I was contacted what is this?

2410
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:55,880
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is all about exactly what we're talking about

2411
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:00,120
I just this is something that that I really need to put out there because it's very important

2412
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:06,560
Okay, and it's an unprecedented effort spearheaded by this woman Andrea who runs a number of communities on reddit

2413
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:10,160
And she said that they're banding together for the first time ever

2414
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,600
It's the biggest grassroots campaign for government transparency

2415
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:18,800
This is happening on Friday the 20th of December at 3 p.m

2416
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:24,440
Eastern time and this has the potential to reach millions and millions of people. It's the most

2417
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:31,360
Unprecedented event on reddit in history and I'll post all of the necessary information on X

2418
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:39,120
Because this is a very grassroots effort and I'm reach and what are they doing at James C Fox on X formerly known as Twitter

2419
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:45,720
It's there the reddit community is banding together for a huge grassroots campaign for government transparency

2420
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:52,640
So basically all the various platforms on reddit like paranormal UFO. They're all they don't usually get along too well, but they're all

2421
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:58,760
Combining their resources and they're getting together for the first time ever and to push for government transparency

2422
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:03,800
There's a couple of government insiders that appear in my film that will be appearing on this to answer questions

2423
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:10,000
And what steps that need to be happening? What's going on today? And and this is happening on the 20th of December

2424
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:17,640
3 p.m. And I'll be posting more information the very specific details on X at James C Fox

2425
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:24,880
I just wanted to get that out there before because well the more of this stuff that happens the better the more people demand it the

2426
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:29,400
Better the more politicians hear from the people and want to I mean

2427
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:35,480
Especially politicians that are up for re-election and they want to show that they're doing what the people want them to do. Yeah

2428
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:43,600
I'd like to know more but obviously I'm very happy that we're hearing much more about the subject in a serious way

2429
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:46,560
Yeah, you know whatever the hell's going on. Yeah. Well, I

2430
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,440
Really encourage you to watch the program

2431
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:55,080
I will 100% I went bent over backwards to put together in and explain everything in layman terms

2432
02:11:55,240 --> 02:12:01,400
What's happened from 2017 to today because it's it's unprecedented. We're living in an unprecedented moment in history

2433
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:08,160
There's an unprecedented push for government transparency and I want to continue supporting our elected officials

2434
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:13,520
Bipartisan effort to get to the bottom of this and I especially want to throw a shot out to representative

2435
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:19,760
Burchette because you're you're killing it buddy. Thank you. Hey, Jamie, why don't you use chat GPT and ask chat GPT?

2436
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:23,320
What's going on with the drones in New Jersey? That'd be very curious to hear about that

2437
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:26,520
Yeah, it's a damn good idea and maybe then ask rock but uh

2438
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:34,360
Ask chat GPT what is really happening with the drones in New Jersey

2439
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:38,720
Let's just see what tell me how that works

2440
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:41,600
It's AI right and

2441
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:47,680
What is really happening with the drones in New Jersey, let's see

2442
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:50,880
So what does chat GPT say?

2443
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:54,400
Chat GPT is gonna search the web. Oh

2444
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:59,960
Numerous Jones side had been reported across New Jersey and other East Coast. It's incredible. How fast is this? Look how fast?

2445
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:01,760
Look at this. This is incredible

2446
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:05,600
They found no evidence suggesting threat to national security or public safety despite these assurances

2447
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:11,320
Some local officials and residents remain concerned for instance Belleville Mayor Michael Melham

2448
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:17,320
Speculated the increased drone activity might be related to a search for missing radioactive material from the medical facility in New Jersey

2449
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:24,040
Additionally the public figures like Bethany Frankel have shared unverified theories about the drones purposes

2450
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:29,720
Further fueling speculation the situation is evolving and authorities continue to monitor investigate new reports

2451
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:34,120
Residents are advised to report any suspicious drone activity to local law enforcement

2452
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:38,280
Avoid taking matters into their own hands like shooting them down people are shooting them down

2453
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:41,320
So they shoot them down they're eating the dogs

2454
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:46,760
It's anything to shoot down drones as it could pose safety risks and violate laws

2455
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:49,360
Now ask chat GPT

2456
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:54,840
Oh, let's just keep going with chat GPT for a little bit because you're asking it again

2457
02:13:55,360 --> 02:14:01,160
Ask chat GPT if I live in New Jersey, should I get out of town?

2458
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:06,520
Yeah, if I live in New Jersey, should I get out of town

2459
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:10,720
Should I evacuate? Yeah, should I evacuate? You'll say evacuate because get out of town is like a colloquialism

2460
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:12,720
Should I evacuate?

2461
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:20,280
Okay, this is amazing at this time there's no official recommendation for residents in New Jersey

2462
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:27,160
Uh-huh follow official updates. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay

2463
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:30,280
As a precautionary measure, are you sure are you sure?

2464
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:39,720
No federal evacuation orders, okay, it knows that there's no fat federal evacuation orders if you were gonna give me advice

2465
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:47,240
Would you tell me to leave the East Coast

2466
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:50,720
Would you tell me to leave the East Coast

2467
02:14:58,120 --> 02:15:00,120
Advice is fucked up

2468
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,440
There we go

2469
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:07,040
Based on the current information provided by trusted authorities. There's no evidence of an imminent threat

2470
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:09,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2471
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:11,160
Could you imagine?

2472
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:12,880
Put this in

2473
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:15,280
Could you imagine a scenario?

2474
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:24,200
Where these drones are actually looking for a nuclear bomb and

2475
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:28,120
If so

2476
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:33,000
Would you advise me as a preemptive measure

2477
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,960
To evacuate

2478
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,960
I type so much worse when people are watching

2479
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:47,320
I'm so impressed at how well he's typing actually I

2480
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:54,280
Really am while it's possible to imagine scenarios involving drone searching for dangerous materials such as a nuclear bomb

2481
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:58,880
There's no verified information suggesting such an extreme situation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2482
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:00,560
so I

2483
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:02,640
How about this? I think

2484
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:06,400
Type this in I said if I put it in grok and fun mode

2485
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:11,280
We might get but hold on a second, but try this is there a non-human intelligence behind it. I think

2486
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:18,680
The drones are looking for a nuclear bomb and I am going to leave New Jersey

2487
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Where should I go

2488
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:29,000
To Montana how far away should I go? Oh, that's okay. If you leave New Jersey is a precautionary measure

2489
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:34,720
Here are some suggestions for place to relocate temporarily. You're doing good head west. Okay, so now we're getting better

2490
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:36,720
So now it's saying go further away

2491
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:38,560
Wow

2492
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:42,400
Colorado consider scroll back to up so I can read that where it's a Colorado

2493
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:49,000
Consider Durango Grand Junction or areas outside of Denver. These are safe and equipped with modern infrastructure

2494
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:54,440
Almost telling you to move this is telling you to get away from big cities to Rango, Tennessee

2495
02:16:54,440 --> 02:17:00,560
The Smoky Mountain region and Gatlin Burger, Knoxville provides natural beauty lower cost of living and a sense of isolation

2496
02:17:00,560 --> 02:17:03,120
They're telling you how to rebuild civilization

2497
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:05,360
Okay, if a nuke goes off

2498
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:13,000
Where to go if an if a nuke goes off on the East Coast type this in Jamie if a nuke goes off on the East Coast

2499
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,520
Where should I be to be safe

2500
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,800
Oh my gosh, if you're concerned about potential nuclear incident

2501
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:33,920
Here's a list of safest options based on geographic environmental and strategic factors, Montana, Colorado

2502
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:39,920
Wyoming, Idaho sparsely populated vast distances for major cities and military targets

2503
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:45,360
Towns like Bozeman Jackson Hole Sandpoint are beautiful remote and away from the fallout paths

2504
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:50,180
Jesus Christ. I'm curious. What would happen if you asked chat?

2505
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:53,800
GBT is it GPT GPT if

2506
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:59,720
What percentage of UAP represent a non-human intelligence, okay, that's a good one

2507
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:02,880
what percentage of

2508
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:05,920
UAP

2509
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Represent a non-human intelligence

2510
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:13,240
Really curious

2511
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:15,480
I know

2512
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:23,280
Could represent non-human intelligence remains unknown and speculative current investigations by UAP organizations like the US government

2513
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:29,960
And it did it emphasize the following most UAPs have conventional explanations as project blue-blue bullshit

2514
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:35,560
It's all percent of five or ten percent of UAP cases remain undefined even after thorough analysis these cases

2515
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:38,320
I was like 15 to 20, but yeah, five to ten percent

2516
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:41,120
Evidence inconsistent with known human technology

2517
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:49,640
No conclusive evidence for non-human intelligence while some UAP cases are public puzzling the government as not officially, okay

2518
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:52,680
Commander would type this in

2519
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:55,160
Commander David Fravor

2520
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:04,520
Encountered a tick-tock a tick tack. Yeah tick tack shaped

2521
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:07,200
craft in

2522
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,680
2005

2523
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:15,320
But 2004 2003 2003. Okay 2003 that defied

2524
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:19,100
our understanding of

2525
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:22,060
Of known physics

2526
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:27,080
Period what do you think he saw?

2527
02:19:29,300 --> 02:19:31,300
Wow

2528
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:39,280
2004 I'm sorry with tic-tac shape craft remains one of the most compelling and well-documented UAP cases in modern history key deal

2529
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:47,380
Details the encounter craft describes smooth white oblong resembling a tic-tac no visible propulsion wings or exhausts play extraordinary flight characteristics

2530
02:19:47,820 --> 02:19:52,860
Accelerated instantly from a hovering position descended from 80,000 feet to near sea level in seconds

2531
02:19:53,020 --> 02:19:58,060
Fravor reported the object mimicked his movements during their engagement and then vanished at extreme speed

2532
02:19:59,060 --> 02:20:07,380
It's possible. The craft was an ultra-secret military project either US based experimental aircraft aerospace technology or developed by another nation

2533
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:15,700
However, the extreme flight performance raises doubts such advanced technology would suggest a significant leap beyond publicly known capabilities

2534
02:20:15,700 --> 02:20:17,980
Which is inconsistent with current engineering limits

2535
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:26,940
sensor anomaly or perception issues then yeah, I asked the heads of arrow if they could explain that one and they said no if

2536
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:30,820
Don't type this in

2537
02:20:31,420 --> 02:20:33,420
Really good case if all

2538
02:20:35,140 --> 02:20:41,780
Accounts of the capabilities of the tic-tac craft

2539
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:47,740
Are true

2540
02:20:50,980 --> 02:20:56,180
What are the possibilities that it came from another planet

2541
02:20:56,180 --> 02:20:58,180
If

2542
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:16,100
The accounts of the craft capabilities are accurate instantaneous acceleration hypersonic speeds without the propulsion no heat say it loud

2543
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:17,380
So people can hear you. Okay

2544
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:24,140
So if the accounts of the tic-tacs crafts capabilities are accurate instantaneous acceleration hypersonic speeds without visible propulsion

2545
02:21:24,540 --> 02:21:30,260
No heat signatures and defiance of inertia then the possibly the possibilities of origin

2546
02:21:30,580 --> 02:21:35,260
Origin being extraterrestrial or from another planet become a viable hypothesis

2547
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:38,380
Here's why the physics of the tic-tac craft reported behavior

2548
02:21:38,460 --> 02:21:43,740
The craft suggests technology that operates beyond our current understanding of physics and propulsion systems

2549
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:48,540
No visible propulsion and implies propulsion system unrelated to conventional jets or rockets

2550
02:21:49,140 --> 02:21:56,380
Instantaneous acceleration defies inertia in Newtonian physics achieving this would require manipulating gravity or space-time itself

2551
02:21:57,060 --> 02:22:03,500
Silent operation no sonic booms despite hypersonic speeds points to a technology that likely emanates

2552
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:09,620
Eliminates air resistance such as surrounding itself in an electromagnetic field or bubble this level of

2553
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:17,660
Technological advancement far surpasses anything developed on earth if true such capabilities would suggest a highly advanced civilization perfect

2554
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:23,540
Perhaps thousands or millions of years ahead of us scientifically if true. Where do you think it came from?

2555
02:22:25,220 --> 02:22:27,220
This was 20 years ago

2556
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:32,620
I know but if true, where do you think it came from if how about this?

2557
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:35,780
It's still typing

2558
02:22:35,900 --> 02:22:42,780
Final thoughts look at this writing a whole turnpaper. Yeah, it's amazing how fast it does. It's amazing. How fast it does. Wow

2559
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:48,300
Tic-tac if the tic-tac UAP is real and the accounts are accurate then its origin may very well be

2560
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:56,900
extraterrestrial or involve unknown physics and technology that we haven't begun to comprehend the extraordinary nature of the case suggests an equally

2561
02:22:56,980 --> 02:22:58,980
extraordinary explanation

2562
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:02,780
What do you think? Why are you asking me bitch? You're chat GPT. What do you this?

2563
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:10,220
Extra-terrestrial visitation seem plausible or is there another explanation that resonates more with you? So type this I believe

2564
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:16,380
It seems plausible that they are extraterrestrial in nature

2565
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:26,180
Good luck, I was gonna say if true comma if true

2566
02:23:28,820 --> 02:23:30,820
Where do you think they came from

2567
02:23:30,820 --> 02:23:32,820
Let's see

2568
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:37,580
All right

2569
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:43,620
Identifying where they might come from involves exploring nearby stellar systems known exoplanets and

2570
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:50,300
Plausible scientific ideas about interstellar travel here are the most likely possibilities nearby star systems with habitable zones

2571
02:23:51,140 --> 02:23:56,380
Alpha Centauri system four point three seven light-years away the closest star system to Earth Proxima Centauri

2572
02:23:58,100 --> 02:24:00,100
Potentially habitable planet exoplanet

2573
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:04,900
orbiting Proxima Centauri within the habitable zone if life developed there might be

2574
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:08,580
Technologically advanced enough for interstellar exploration Bernard

2575
02:24:08,580 --> 02:24:15,260
So it's giving me a list of all the potential possibilities possible star systems. This one's only 39 light-years away

2576
02:24:16,220 --> 02:24:21,260
What was the closest one office office and Terry was that was that four light-years or something?

2577
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:23,260
I don't know scroll back up scroll back up a little bit

2578
02:24:23,860 --> 02:24:28,500
Three point nine million point three four point three alpha Centauri four point three light-years away

2579
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:33,060
Wow, but here's the crazy part pretty close. Remember the number the twin paradox theory

2580
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:35,460
They say that if you get like two twins

2581
02:24:35,980 --> 02:24:38,580
Right as kids say one's ten

2582
02:24:38,820 --> 02:24:44,300
They're both ten right and you put one in a spaceship that travels the speed of light for one year

2583
02:24:44,300 --> 02:24:51,540
Mm-hmm. He would come back with an atomic clock on board that spacecraft a year old or CB 11 and his brother would be an old

2584
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:53,380
Man. Mm-hmm. I

2585
02:24:53,380 --> 02:24:59,580
Can't wrap my mind around that right, but that's they say it's pretty much fact, but that's speed, right?

2586
02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:06,540
I think what we're talking about is different than speed. I think it's instantaneous instantaneous relocation, right?

2587
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:11,500
So I think in state yeah, I think instead of like if you like the space time between the two points, right?

2588
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:14,700
So I think the idea is that instead of a rocket that goes

2589
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:19,180
You know five million miles an hour just shoots off of Earth and keeps going until it, you know

2590
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:24,180
Five million years from now. Yeah, it runs into this planet. I think it's different than that

2591
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:27,520
I think what if I had to guess

2592
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:34,020
Where something can manipulate gravity and space what it would do is

2593
02:25:34,860 --> 02:25:36,300
instantaneously

2594
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:38,260
appear in these new places

2595
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:40,900
Like you've talked to a lot of physicists about this kind of stuff, huh?

2596
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:44,300
I have and the way they explained it is baffling and

2597
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:51,020
Bob Lazar's version of it is baffling because Bob Lazar's version of it that he told in 1989

2598
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:53,820
Kind of makes sense

2599
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:59,780
When you talk to people that are trying to develop some sort of a gravity or a warp drive, right?

2600
02:25:59,780 --> 02:26:05,060
And the way Bob Lazar explained it is that this element when bombarded with radiation creates this

2601
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:09,060
I'm really butchering it for sure creates some sort of a

2602
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:16,620
Gravity field that allows it the way described it like if you took a mattress a very soft mattress

2603
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:18,980
They put a very heavy bowling ball in the middle of the mattress

2604
02:26:18,980 --> 02:26:23,980
It pushes the mattress down to that area and that this like folds time, right?

2605
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:29,020
So you go from here here, but when you stretch it down suddenly those two points connect it folds it

2606
02:26:29,020 --> 02:26:35,340
Yeah, right. And so wherever it is, it's here. So it's not like it's going a million light-years

2607
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:41,740
So it's million light-years an hour. Yeah space is malleable. Exactly. It's just well it makes sense

2608
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:45,020
If if you think about how technology scales

2609
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:52,660
Yeah, and if we do I mean Ryan brought up this yesterday as well that there was research and there was papers written about

2610
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:59,860
The idea of having some sort of a gravity drive or having some sort of a gravity propulsion system something that doesn't rely on

2611
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:02,340
Conventional, you know rockets

2612
02:27:03,340 --> 02:27:08,300
That's for sure exactly and he said that this was something that was discussed a long time ago

2613
02:27:08,300 --> 02:27:12,940
But then it just stopped and you know, we brought it up along quite a while ago

2614
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:18,060
There was an episode that we brought up a paper that was written in the 1960s about gravity drives

2615
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:21,020
Was that by hell put off? I do not know because he's like a propulsion

2616
02:27:21,740 --> 02:27:25,500
Expert in terms of the propulsion behind the physics behind UFOs

2617
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:25,820
Yeah

2618
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:30,020
And he tried to I tried to get him to explain it to me in sort of conventional layman terms

2619
02:27:30,060 --> 02:27:35,060
And of course my tiny little brain but he I felt like I almost grasped it for a moment

2620
02:27:35,060 --> 02:27:41,500
But the attire the amount of power that it would take to create that gravitational field around the object and he said that's why

2621
02:27:41,540 --> 02:27:47,700
You see them doing these maneuvers that look like it defy physics, right and then everything inside the craft would just splatter

2622
02:27:48,380 --> 02:27:53,700
It that that you're immune from that on the inside according which also would make sense

2623
02:27:54,420 --> 02:27:58,360
Right, but that would also make sense if you had something like that that you could go in the ocean as well

2624
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:04,440
Right. Yeah, so because whatever's around you wouldn't matter because you're not affected by it, right?

2625
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:08,360
You're somehow creating a field around it. It's it's that that's immune to whatever

2626
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:12,060
That would be the only thing that would make sense where how it could move so fast underwater

2627
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:19,520
Atmosphere space water and how it would be transmedium. Yeah and go from space into the water. It's unaffected by gravity

2628
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:25,720
It's unaffected by all the things around it creates its own gravity field and allows it to just pass through things. I remember

2629
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:30,800
Kirk McConnell who Senate Armed Service Committee who investigated UFOs from 2017?

2630
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:33,420
I talked about him earlier, but he said that they were picking up

2631
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:40,240
Aegis radar systems were picking these objects up from basically from space and they were shooting down from space all the way down

2632
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:43,120
They'd loiter for as long as they wanted to go in the water

2633
02:28:43,440 --> 02:28:47,560
come back out again shoot back up into space and they would just do it like

2634
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:53,160
You know all day long and there was nothing well, we can't see that right and

2635
02:28:54,080 --> 02:29:00,280
Know what someone does have I mean if there's someone in the military that does have some like super advanced satellite

2636
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,920
reconnaissance imagery of these things

2637
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:05,160
I

2638
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:09,120
Could see why they would hold that back. I could see why they would think that people aren't ready for that

2639
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:11,240
I could see it. Do you think Elon knows?

2640
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:16,360
He's real cagey about it. He is cagey about it. He's got deals with the DOD and he's

2641
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:19,680
Everything it's probably why I'd be cagey about it, too

2642
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:23,920
He knows more than what he's saying, this is what he said if aliens are real, they're very subtle

2643
02:29:25,320 --> 02:29:30,120
That's what he was saying. I was like, I don't know if they're subtle man. The Phoenix lights wasn't that subtle

2644
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:30,960
That's aliens

2645
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:37,880
I heard from some people around him that that because of his contracts with DOD that he kind of keeps quiet about it because I'm

2646
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:43,240
Sure, everybody talks about I mean even Ratcliffe talked about the satellite imagery for a view AP

2647
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:46,800
I mean if they're picking it up, why wouldn't his systems pick it up?

2648
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:50,040
He hasn't said a peep about the drone thing and you haven't asked him about it

2649
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:54,800
Nope, if he wants to tell me he'll tell me I'm not gonna be that guy. I'm not gonna be annoying but

2650
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:58,640
Publicly like on X has he said anything about the drones?

2651
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:04,240
Something a couple weeks ago, I believe they think it was a couple weeks ago

2652
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:04,800
I'll check right now

2653
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:10,040
But is that there's a big drone storm or a big drone fight coming and people are taking that as like he knew this was

2654
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:12,600
Happening. Hmm a big drone fight coming

2655
02:30:13,360 --> 02:30:15,160
well, you know, he's

2656
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:21,960
Been real public about the idea that building manned fighter jets at this point kind of foolish, you know

2657
02:30:21,960 --> 02:30:28,000
And he's I think he's correct. You know, so unpiloted only. Yeah, I mean I think the fun out of it

2658
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:31,080
Well, it takes the biological mistakes out of it is what it does

2659
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:34,520
It takes the human mind out the human mind is very fallible

2660
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:42,900
You know, we already know that AI systems like Mike Baker explained to us that AI systems with fighter jets beat actual fighter jet pilots

2661
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:47,540
100% of the time so when they have a simulated yes when they have these simulated dogfights

2662
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:50,720
Wow, they take AI fighter jets that we have right now

2663
02:30:50,860 --> 02:30:55,820
They beat our fighter jet pilots the best of the best 100% of the time

2664
02:30:56,140 --> 02:31:01,300
So they don't have any biological limitations in terms of what what they deal with things

2665
02:31:01,540 --> 02:31:07,400
Yes. Yeah, don't you have that right? So all you have to do is make the equipment and the materials

2666
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:11,240
Robust enough so they can take insane speeds and not blow apart

2667
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:17,240
But it certainly would be way easier to do that than it would be to get a human being to be safe in it

2668
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:24,320
So much less badass though recently. So what does he say? Oh, so he clicked on it future wars are all about drones and hypersonic jets

2669
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:30,280
So this is us talking about that. This is us talking about fighter jet pilots by humans will be destroyed very quickly

2670
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:35,400
So he talked about it. So he put a clip up of us talking about it on the podcast. This was in November

2671
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:41,840
November 28th and so neither side is air superiority and tanks are easily destroyed by missiles

2672
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:49,560
So that leaves infantry and artillery basically World War one drones are not yet available in sufficient numbers to matter much like aircraft in World War one

2673
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:54,480
A defense in-depth trench war means and then some modern example

2674
02:31:55,480 --> 02:32:01,000
So did you get the impression when you spoke to Elon about UFOs that he knew more than he was telling you?

2675
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:05,520
Yeah, he doesn't he doesn't even entertain the idea of UFOs

2676
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:11,000
So if you bring up the flavors incident, he'll just say no it didn't happen or that's doesn't seem interested

2677
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:16,320
I don't know. I mean I would imagine what you're saying is true that it's not wise for him to discuss it

2678
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:17,920
That's what I would imagine

2679
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:18,360
Yeah

2680
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:22,200
If he wants to tell me he'll tell me and if he wants me to tell no one I'll tell no one

2681
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:27,880
Yeah, if he wants to tell me and say don't tell anybody I'll I won't tell anybody but I'm not gonna ask him

2682
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:34,640
I think his position as you know being the guy at SpaceX. Yeah, why would you fuck around with that?

2683
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:36,960
He's got too much at stake. Yeah, there's way too much at stake

2684
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:44,220
Yeah, also like if anybody's gonna find out he's gonna find out if there's something going on if something legitimately going on

2685
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:48,800
The guy who can catch rockets with a crane. That's the guy he's gonna know

2686
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:51,280
I thought the first time I saw that I was like AI generator

2687
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:56,160
I was watching the thing come down and I just thought that's the ones that land before that those insane

2688
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:58,160
And now you can catch them. They don't even have to land

2689
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:00,720
It's nuts like what he's done is just

2690
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:06,920
Accelerate what we are capable of doing far beyond what NASA was able to do just a few years ago

2691
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:13,280
So I used I used to have a neighbor that worked for Elon Musk and he drove a Tesla way early way early on when

2692
02:33:13,480 --> 02:33:18,320
Teslas weren't that many out there and I was like well you got a Tesla as a gas you work for Elon Musk

2693
02:33:18,320 --> 02:33:22,720
I saw him a couple years later and I was like, hey, you're not driving Tesla anymore. He goes no

2694
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:27,840
He goes I I don't work for Elon anymore as a couple months sorry to hear that what happened he goes

2695
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:31,920
He goes well, he's he works so hard and his expectations are so high

2696
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:37,760
He goes I was at the hospital with my wife giving as she was giving birth to our first child and Elon's like

2697
02:33:37,760 --> 02:33:39,760
I need you in the office

2698
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:47,800
He goes I cut I you know, a guy's got an incredible worth ethic work ethic, but it was too much

2699
02:33:47,800 --> 02:33:50,640
He goes I'm at the hospitals. I don't care where you were. Yeah

2700
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:57,440
Like pretty brittle that's brutal wasn't he sleeping in there he was sleeping in the sure

2701
02:33:57,440 --> 02:34:02,680
Yeah, he was sleeping in working 16 hours a day and sleeping on the floor. Yeah, that's commitment

2702
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:08,840
Well, he demands out of other people too. And you know, maybe you want that maybe you don't and if you don't you can't work there

2703
02:34:08,840 --> 02:34:14,600
It's simple. Like if you want that hop on in if you're a single guy and you don't have a wife

2704
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:20,940
You have children. Yeah, but if you do boy, that's not a life for that's not a life for me. I don't want that job

2705
02:34:20,940 --> 02:34:26,020
I think the closest thing to a spaceship on wheels is a Tesla. Oh, they're amazing pretty remarkable

2706
02:34:26,020 --> 02:34:31,980
I've had three of them. This is my third the acceleration is incredible. It's like a gut punch. Yeah, they're getting better

2707
02:34:31,980 --> 02:34:34,700
They're getting the the autonomous driving is incredible now

2708
02:34:34,700 --> 02:34:37,940
I remember once somebody said to me they were like, you know step on it, you know

2709
02:34:37,940 --> 02:34:41,700
Show me the acceleration and I I stepped on it a model three performance

2710
02:34:42,340 --> 02:34:46,460
And it seems fake. I got nauseous. Yeah, I wasn't quite ready

2711
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:49,500
I was like I turned myself a little sideways or something. I I felt no

2712
02:34:49,580 --> 02:34:54,580
I was like wow, I'm all right motorcycles. I would do all this I was like, you know, but I was like now

2713
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:57,340
I prepare myself for that. That's really fast. It's super bike fast

2714
02:34:57,340 --> 02:35:01,780
It's crazy fast and it can actually the beautiful thing is you can merge on the highway

2715
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:03,780
You don't seem like a douchebag cuz you're not like

2716
02:35:04,220 --> 02:35:06,340
It's not like really loud just super quiet

2717
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:10,940
Stealthy. Yeah, it's all sons going a hundred miles an hour. What happened? Yeah

2718
02:35:10,940 --> 02:35:16,380
I remember I got a ticket years ago on a motorcycle and the guy I bought the bike was we had a loud exhaust pipe

2719
02:35:16,380 --> 02:35:18,340
I ended up getting rid of I didn't like the loud exhaust pipe

2720
02:35:18,340 --> 02:35:21,580
It's too loud and I got pulled over and the cop never even saw me

2721
02:35:21,580 --> 02:35:26,260
He just heard me and he wrote me up exactly how fast I was going. He's like you're doing 90 to 35

2722
02:35:26,260 --> 02:35:29,660
I'm like I was he's like, oh, yeah, I could hear you

2723
02:35:29,660 --> 02:35:33,460
I was like I went up to the gears and I put a quiet. So yeah, that's

2724
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:38,180
Quiet is nice. Quiet has its benefits. Well, it doesn't in a motorcycle though. You want to be

2725
02:35:39,020 --> 02:35:43,580
That's true, but I drive like the invisible man when I'm on a motorcycle you have to yeah

2726
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:47,580
I've had people look me right in the eyes and I've they pulled right out in front of me people want to

2727
02:35:48,500 --> 02:35:53,820
Side-swiped and also people are like they don't how many people are medicated. I don't think they see you as a threat

2728
02:35:53,820 --> 02:35:56,860
I think they see is like you're almost like a gnat or something

2729
02:35:56,860 --> 02:35:59,300
I've learned and I tell people that ride motors

2730
02:35:59,300 --> 02:36:04,240
I've been riding bikes for 50 years as soon as you get on that bike. You become the invisible man, right?

2731
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:07,940
Right pretend no one can tend that no one can see you live a lot longer

2732
02:36:07,940 --> 02:36:12,340
Yeah, you can make eye contact with somebody doesn't mean they see you right? I've had people pull out in front of me

2733
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:15,460
Like I said, I've been t-boned and all kinds of crazy accidents over the years

2734
02:36:15,460 --> 02:36:18,940
I wish they weren't so dangerous because I would love to drive. Oh, they're amazing

2735
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:23,340
I know you just had to be like I said, you just you know, yeah until you're not I had three friends

2736
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:27,520
I was I was getting my motorcycle license. Yeah, I was doing it was a while ago

2737
02:36:27,980 --> 02:36:32,220
Ten years. So it was a couple of us that worked on fear factor a couple of guys that worked on set

2738
02:36:32,220 --> 02:36:34,860
we all decided to go and take lessons together and

2739
02:36:35,420 --> 02:36:37,420
shout out to Peter Hershko and

2740
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:44,380
He wound up getting his motorcycle he kept driving it and but one of the guys we worked with he crashed his bike and fucked

2741
02:36:44,380 --> 02:36:49,780
Up his shoulder and then one of the guys who was fighting for the UFC Frank Mir he got hit by a car

2742
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:51,780
he got t-boned and

2743
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:55,660
Ran into his femur snapped his femur and he almost lost his leg

2744
02:36:55,660 --> 02:36:58,380
His leg was and it fucked up his career for years

2745
02:36:58,900 --> 02:37:05,700
So there was that and then I saw a guy on the highway that was covered in a blanket

2746
02:37:05,740 --> 02:37:06,540
Oh

2747
02:37:06,540 --> 02:37:07,980
Yeah, he was alive

2748
02:37:07,980 --> 02:37:13,620
You can see but his his leg was so fucked up that they covered in a blanket so that passerby's wouldn't rubberneck it

2749
02:37:14,020 --> 02:37:20,020
There's three of those and then another friend of mine saw someone get hit saw someone get rear-ended someone not paying attention in their car

2750
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:23,420
Rear-ended a bike and had the guy flying through the air at a red light

2751
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:26,340
So that was enough for me. Yeah

2752
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:31,140
I know I became a dad and I had two motorcycles right before I became a dad and I sold them and then after ten years

2753
02:37:31,140 --> 02:37:35,220
I was like, maybe I get just like a dirt bike because I really enjoy riding

2754
02:37:36,060 --> 02:37:40,020
Nothing like it being on a motorcycle. So I should be getting a dirt bag that a mountain lion takes you out

2755
02:37:40,780 --> 02:37:44,300
Damn it. I have a dirt bike with a motor. Yeah, even with a motor. I

2756
02:37:45,060 --> 02:37:47,740
Don't know if a mountain lion would be scared of a motor. Yeah

2757
02:37:47,740 --> 02:37:50,020
I'd be able to outrun it, but I think most of the time they were

2758
02:37:50,700 --> 02:37:55,060
Bicyclers. Yeah, most of the time they kill bicyclers. This is nuts. Yeah

2759
02:37:56,060 --> 02:38:00,100
So so let me ask your honest opinion. I know we're wrapping up here. Okay

2760
02:38:00,220 --> 02:38:05,500
If you had to say whether you believed or you didn't believe

2761
02:38:06,220 --> 02:38:11,700
Look, you can't make any definitive statements. I get that but you're a very influential individual

2762
02:38:12,420 --> 02:38:16,220
Who's done more for the push for disclosure? I hate use the word disclosure

2763
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:21,580
It's got a bit of a buzz a bit of a connection to it a push for government transparency on this topic, right?

2764
02:38:22,500 --> 02:38:29,540
If you had to say something truly inexplicable that most likely would lead to NHI or non-human intelligence or not

2765
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:31,020
conventional

2766
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:32,940
What would you pick?

2767
02:38:32,940 --> 02:38:40,100
Ultimately that you think there is possibly a non-human intelligence behind this or that there is not I wish I could be definitive like that

2768
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:42,100
I know you can't be definitive. I don't

2769
02:38:42,460 --> 02:38:45,820
I just try to stay as open-minded on this as possible

2770
02:38:45,820 --> 02:38:52,500
Which means I fluctuate back and forth to fully believe from fully believing to fully believing. It's some military

2771
02:38:53,300 --> 02:38:55,300
Experiment and that it's a bunch of our stuff

2772
02:38:55,340 --> 02:38:59,900
But then there's stories like the things like the tic-tac and where you go, okay

2773
02:39:00,420 --> 02:39:07,060
2004 how how do they how could they do that in 2004? Is there a propulsion system available in 2004?

2774
02:39:07,060 --> 02:39:12,540
That's that far advanced and if so, how come there's so little evidence of it in like in

2775
02:39:13,060 --> 02:39:20,420
A practical use like how come that technology you would think that technology would take so much money to develop

2776
02:39:20,980 --> 02:39:23,220
That you would do something with it in 20 years

2777
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:27,100
You wouldn't just have it and just be flying it around like a drone every now and again

2778
02:39:27,100 --> 02:39:31,220
Yeah, it would seem like there would be some sort of a practical application for something like that

2779
02:39:31,380 --> 02:39:35,420
Yeah, and it seemed like like the Manhattan Project and like the stealth bomber

2780
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:38,380
Eventually you find out that it's a real thing, right?

2781
02:39:38,380 --> 02:39:42,820
So 20 years is a long time to not find out that something's real

2782
02:39:42,820 --> 02:39:46,660
Well, how about if we take it up to a lot longer than that? What about the?

2783
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:51,580
1952 two consecutive weekends in July over the White House in the Capitol

2784
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:55,180
Yeah, and that was we had a press conference about that

2785
02:39:55,180 --> 02:39:59,460
Sure, a guy in general that basically admit that they're real Kenneth Arnold, you know

2786
02:40:00,220 --> 02:40:04,020
That was phenomenal. Yeah, and then you got to go to the Bhagavad Gita, you know

2787
02:40:04,020 --> 02:40:07,740
Oh, like there's there's stories of things the historical stuff is incredible

2788
02:40:07,740 --> 02:40:10,940
Isn't it like think of the guy that showed up with the blue skin? Is that an angel?

2789
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:15,260
Is that a devil like what if if you were living four thousand years ago?

2790
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:18,500
You're one of the people that wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls. He'd be a god. Yeah, what is that?

2791
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:24,700
What is what is that visitation that you've experienced with a craft? It would be right connected with a god, right?

2792
02:40:24,700 --> 02:40:29,660
Right and also the story when you tell the story like what is this and then someone illustrates it?

2793
02:40:29,660 --> 02:40:35,460
What does even how does it even relay in words, especially you're using the words of four thousand years ago

2794
02:40:35,460 --> 02:40:40,620
What what are you describing and if they really have always been here and they've always been visiting us

2795
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:45,540
That's probably how you would describe it you would describe it like Ezekiel did in the Bible

2796
02:40:45,540 --> 02:40:45,780
Yeah

2797
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:52,700
Well, you know I was in Africa investigating the the alleged landing and close encounter of the third kind at Rua Zimbabwe aerial school in

2798
02:40:53,220 --> 02:41:00,180
1994 I wasn't there in 94. I was there much later and the teacher Judy Bates who's now they had principal and

2799
02:41:01,100 --> 02:41:07,900
She was sharing with me these drawings that children did of the alleged creatures and they were amazing these drawings big eyes and

2800
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:14,260
Big heads almond shaped eyes blah blah blah, and I'm looking at these drawings one after the other from all these schoolchildren

2801
02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:16,260
it was phenomenal and

2802
02:41:16,300 --> 02:41:19,900
She gave no I took photographs of them and then a month later

2803
02:41:19,900 --> 02:41:25,300
I went to Australia and I was investigating an alleged landing that happened at Westall primary school in

2804
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:27,220
1966 and

2805
02:41:27,220 --> 02:41:28,780
That was that was incredible

2806
02:41:28,780 --> 02:41:33,500
I was there investigating and I was showing some of the drawings of the aliens that I the alleged aliens and I just had

2807
02:41:33,500 --> 02:41:35,420
investigated in Africa and

2808
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:39,940
Some of the people were like, oh wow, these drawings are amazing. They look like the one Gina cave art

2809
02:41:39,940 --> 02:41:46,460
I was like the what the one Gina cave art the aboriginals drew these things and so they pulled it up one Gina and

2810
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:52,540
the parallel of their thousands of years old right these cave paintings in Australia the parallels the

2811
02:41:52,860 --> 02:41:54,580
consistencies the

2812
02:41:54,580 --> 02:41:58,540
It was the comparison of the two was like let's take a look at those real quick

2813
02:41:58,540 --> 02:42:02,060
Yeah, look at one one before we leave cave painting

2814
02:42:02,860 --> 02:42:08,860
UFO or alien was one most likely something there. I just don't know and if it's a thing

2815
02:42:08,860 --> 02:42:14,180
So let's say if it's a real thing. Is it from another planet or is it more complicated than that?

2816
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:19,820
It's more complicated than that. Yeah. Well, that's how you see that. Yes. Yeah, very bizarre, right?

2817
02:42:22,100 --> 02:42:27,100
Look at the three of them and that the one in the center Jamie. Yeah that one look how weird that is, man

2818
02:42:27,380 --> 02:42:32,160
That's so fucking weird look at the one with the dark black eyes right there and pale they are too

2819
02:42:32,820 --> 02:42:37,460
It's like yeah, it's very weird. And then there's that one with the big with the big dark eyes, right?

2820
02:42:37,460 --> 02:42:44,060
Look down just go straight down up down. Yeah, right to the right right there. Look at that. Very weird. Very weird

2821
02:42:44,060 --> 02:42:51,000
Isn't that it's also very weird how this is four thousand years old and then close encounters of the third kind the 1970s

2822
02:42:51,340 --> 02:42:54,260
4,000 years old and I'm telling you I could show you the drawings

2823
02:42:54,780 --> 02:42:56,780
One of the witnesses

2824
02:42:58,780 --> 02:43:03,980
Very weird. Yeah, it's just it's just phenomenal. Listen, man. Thank you for everything. Thanks. Thanks for what you do

2825
02:43:03,980 --> 02:43:08,380
Thank you so much for having me on my pleasure. But I mean you you're

2826
02:43:09,540 --> 02:43:14,740
Fucking dogged determination to get this stuff out there. It's very important. You promise you'll watch the program

2827
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:18,940
I will 100% watch it comment. I will I will. Thank you, sir. Awesome, brother

2828
02:43:19,940 --> 02:43:24,700
Awesome, brother James. Thank you so much. Thank you. It's on Amazon the program

2829
02:43:25,420 --> 02:43:32,580
And then moment of contact is probably available everywhere and the phenomenon. Yeah, I know what I saw out of the blue

2830
02:43:32,580 --> 02:43:36,700
Okay, 50 years of denial. Oh my god. It goes back. Yeah, you've been

2831
02:43:37,780 --> 02:43:40,400
You've been deep in this rabbit hole for a long time, sir

2832
02:43:48,940 --> 02:43:51,540
You
