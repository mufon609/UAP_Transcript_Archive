1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The Joe Rogan Experience, trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What's up?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How are you, man?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, good.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thanks for coming here.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Appreciate it.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No, it's a pleasure.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You've been on a whirlwind sort of tour.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I guess we should start from the beginning.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Well, first of all, lay out to people what your job was with the military and how this

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,000
all started for you.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,400
So I was an Intel officer in the Air Force for 14 years, seven active, seven reserve.

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:49,120
Then I kind of had like a parallel track in the civilian Intel world when I became a reservist.

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,720
And ultimately I got brought back in in civil service in a government way at the National

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,400
Geospatial Intelligence Agency.

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,880
A couple of years ago at a senior level, so I was a major in the Air Force in a GS-15

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,520
at NGA, which is like a full bird colonel equivalent civilian employee.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,080
You know, I'm very humbled that I was able to kind of get that kind of job.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,680
But my career mostly, I didn't even really think about this topic.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,560
UFOs were not on my radar.

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,680
I wasn't really a believer.

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,440
I was agnostic about it.

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,960
Most of my career, I did a lot of behind the door, special access program, technical type

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,400
activities.

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,120
I was kind of a space intelligence expert, a cyber intel expert.

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,120
And like I said, this was not on my radar at all.

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,200
I would joke with my buddies because I used to handle the presidential daily brief for

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,840
the National Reconnaissance Office director in my military capacity as a reservist.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,960
I was well clear to hundreds and hundreds of compartmented programs.

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,400
And, you know, the joke was like, when are we going to get the read on for the crazy

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,840
shit? And that never happens.

38
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,080
And I do remember that the day that I really can remember that I was like, huh, what's

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,880
with this UFO stuff?

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:18,360
I was briefing a senior person at the CIA into a couple hundred special access programs.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,280
So I was at the headquarters at the agency.

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,960
And, you know, after the indoctrination, I was giving to the senior person, this person

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,080
who worked with Lou Elizondo previously was like, yeah, Dave, have you ever heard of this

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,640
guy, Lou Elizondo?

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,160
He's running some UFO program at the Pentagon.

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,320
We all think he's crazy.

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,520
And I'm like, I don't know who this guy, Lou Elizondo is.

48
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,280
And I don't know of any kind of UFO program.

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,440
So that sounds nuts to me.

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,200
But lo and behold, and that was like early 2017.

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,320
And lo and behold, in December 2017, that New York Times article came up with that named

52
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,960
the ATIP program and the OSAP program.

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,320
So Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Application Program and Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,880
Program being the other acronym.

55
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
And I was like, holy shit.

56
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,840
Wait, that's that guy, Lou Elizondo that I heard about.

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
Oh, you know what?

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,600
I think I have heard of OSAP when I was a lieutenant.

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,840
I used to read these reports from the Defense Intelligence Agency on black holes and stuff.

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,280
And I was like, oh, that's like stupid.

61
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Why is the DIA looking in the black holes?

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,000
Time warps.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It just didn't make any sense to me back in like 08, 09 when I was lieutenant.

64
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,480
And all of a sudden, I'm like, well, maybe there's something to this UFO thing.

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,920
I'm not saying I was like a believer either way on the subject, but this was a topic of

66
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,480
concern, apparently, for the Pentagon.

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,480
And in 2018, I started doing kind of what I call my open source literature review.

68
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,400
Like, let me spin myself up on this topic.

69
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,760
Watching Chris Mellon, Lou Elizondo, Leslie Keene, all these people talk about the subject.

70
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,200
And then, you know, just trying to understand.

71
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,920
So what is this with UFOs?

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,800
Has this been going on for a while?

73
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,680
The answer is yes.

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,040
Like Foo Fighters, sightings of weird stuff in antiquity, etc., which we can get into later.

75
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:18,280
But and so early 2019 comes along and my boss at the National Reconnaissance Office and kind

76
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:25,320
of my Air Force Major Capacity forwarded me an email from the what became stood up in

77
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,720
like, I guess it was 2018, which was the unidentified what was aerial now anonymous

78
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,920
Philometer Task Force, UAP Task Force.

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,480
So the UAP Task Force director sent my boss an email saying, hey, we're looking for a rep

80
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
to the task force.

81
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,160
And as like any good officer, I was like, well, I'll put it on my performance report.

82
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,000
Hey, I was on a task force and, you know, that would look good.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And I being well cleared and also bachelor's degree in physics, master's in intelligence

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,360
analysis, I'm like, you know, I'll figure out what the shit is.

85
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,840
It's either going to be weather shit.

86
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Maybe it's an adversarial program.

87
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,560
Maybe it's like a U.S. program.

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,200
People are misidentifying on rare occasions.

89
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,160
So fuck it, I'll I'll go see where the data takes me.

90
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,240
And, you know, early 2019 or so, I joined the UAP Task Force.

91
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:25,200
And then. I started, you know, interviewing pilots, flag officers, you know, general officer

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,720
equivalent type Navy folks.

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,480
And, you know, they were seeing some really crazy shit and like a, you know, event that I

94
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,360
talked about previously publicly in a YouTube video on the Yes Theory channel.

95
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,040
You know, there was this one 30 year senior Navy officer that, you know, he was going to

96
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,080
work sober, no predisposition for fantasy, all that kind of stuff, because I interviewed the

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,120
individual for a couple of hours and he saw this, you know, crazy triangle hover over his

98
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,680
car going to work at a certain naval facility and it like blew his mind.

99
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
He was serious.

100
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,080
The paint on his car turned milky white after the incident.

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
So that's to me, that sounds like ionizing radiation.

102
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,720
So like ultraviolet, just like how your your headlights get all foggy over time.

103
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,680
If you park your car out in the sun, same phenomenon just happened, you know, within 24

104
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:26,040
hour period. And I'm like, whoa, if this is true and the oral testimony and, you know, crazy radar

105
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,800
data that I saw when I was on the task force, you know, stuff making turns, it didn't make any

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,560
sense. Well, holy shit.

107
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,120
What is this stuff that this anomaly with his paint is documented?

108
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,280
Is it photographs or?

109
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,160
Yes, I saw photographs. It was documented.

110
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,520
Yeah. And what is their conventional explanation?

111
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,000
I mean, based on what he described, something to rapidly ionize his paint like that within a day.

112
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,760
I don't I can't think of anything off the top of my head in terms of some conventional aerospace

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,800
technology. And and this was a certain facility in the continental U.S.

114
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,560
This is not overseas. So it's not like our adversaries flying some spooky thing in U.S.

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
airspace.

116
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,640
So this thing hovered over his car for how long?

117
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,960
Couple of minutes while he was traveling at about 60 miles an hour.

118
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,520
So it was pacing how far away from his vehicle.

119
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
It's probably a couple hundred feet in altitude.

120
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,680
It was less than a thousand feet, which is also bad because from an airspace perspective,

121
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,360
pilots would know this. Anything under a thousand feet?

122
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,920
No. Unless you get special clearance and you only do that over controlled airspace like a

123
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,200
military test ranges where people fly low and that kind of thing.

124
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,000
So is he on what kind of a highway is he on?

125
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,040
A conventional civilian civilian house.

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,560
So anyone could have been on it. Yes.

127
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,400
It just happened to be this guy.

128
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,120
Did he have any other experiences with this thing?

129
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,560
No, this was like a once in a lifetime thing.

130
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,880
He kept it to himself for a couple of years.

131
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,680
But then he asked for his name.

132
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,520
I don't know what he's OK.

133
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,480
That individual still on it's called Bob.

134
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,440
Yeah. But didn't we say to him, hey, Bob, what the fuck happened to your car?

135
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,640
You know, that's a good question.

136
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,240
I don't remember if people asked him about his car, so he took pride in his car.

137
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,480
So it actually was probably more upsetting to him personally.

138
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,920
What kind of car was it? It was like a Toyota or something.

139
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,840
OK. Yeah. So all of a sudden this Toyota is fucked.

140
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,760
Yeah. OK.

141
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,720
And so did he have to report this?

142
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,960
Is this something that he did not report it to my knowledge to anybody?

143
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,800
It wasn't until he reported it to us about five years later that it happened.

144
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,840
So are these kind of experiences

145
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,880
something that a lot of these pilots are embarrassed about discussing

146
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,880
or have apprehension about discussing because they could be ridiculed?

147
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,920
Yeah. A lot of people that are on flight status, they don't want to be sent to the site.

148
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,240
Right. You know, there's a whole aerospace physiology kind of empire in the military.

149
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,400
And if you're an operator or, you know, a guy,

150
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,960
missile missile key Turner, you're on what they call personal reliability program.

151
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,640
You're taking like, you know, Tylenol, you got to report it.

152
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,040
If you have a fever, you got to report it because you're, you know,

153
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,440
in control of nuclear weapons when you're on duty.

154
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,760
So. Right. Yeah.

155
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,760
And so this idea of being predisposed to fantasy,

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
that's also something that they

157
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,120
sort of talk to these people about or try to get a gauge of.

158
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,200
Yeah. Yeah. These are people that are very sober minded.

159
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,960
I mean, this individual was early in the morning going to work,

160
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,480
not under the influence of anything.

161
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,360
And that person had a similar clearance as mine, you know, TSSEI.

162
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,240
So, you know, we've gone through. Yes.

163
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,480
Was that top secret?

164
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
You know, since Department of Information Clearance and, you know,

165
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,600
just like myself, I've been through multiple polygraphs in my career.

166
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,880
So did this individual. So does he have any idea

167
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,840
or any theories about why this thing was following him?

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,520
No, that's what freaked him out the most, because

169
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,440
he didn't have any experience in his life like this.

170
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,280
It like totally blew his mind when he looked out his moon roof

171
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,720
and then looked out the side of his car door and saw this 300 foot triangle.

172
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,200
It was like pre-dawn sky, but it was darker than the pre-dawn sky.

173
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,200
And it had this like plasma edges, like it was like purplish glowing edges

174
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,320
in these three lights that had like these omnidirectional,

175
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,440
like almost like pull lights, you know, how there's

176
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
you can't really tell where the light source is.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,320
And it was totally trippy.

178
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,280
And that's just one example of many anecdotal,

179
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,920
with some evidence, you know, pilot stories.

180
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,360
And that's what made me dig deeper.

181
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,800
And I started, you know, cultivating my network like.

182
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,720
Has the government studied this before?

183
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,280
This wasn't just OSAP and ATIP and Blue Book and all this shit in the past, right?

184
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,160
There's this seems serious.

185
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,720
So, like, certainly the government has looked at this.

186
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,040
And, you know, I went to search for that program

187
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
and that's what I ended up whistleblowing on. Right.

188
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,560
So when you what was how did you initially discover this program?

189
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,800
And like, what was your first encounter with the information?

190
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,280
A very senior individual in the Intel community came to me

191
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,480
when I guess I was asking a lot of questions because I'm a very inquisitive guy.

192
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
And it was like, hey, we I need to introduce you to somebody.

193
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,360
You know, he listed that certain person's academic credentials,

194
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,200
which were beyond reproach, you know, PhD level education clearance.

195
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,320
Resume was insane.

196
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm like, well, OK, sure, I'll I'll talk to this person.

197
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,120
And and I ended up meeting that person in a, you know,

198
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,640
top secret facility.

199
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,200
And, you know, he started to discussing like, hey, there's a program.

200
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,720
I was on it.

201
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,280
And, you know, we were reverse engineering crash material

202
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,120
that we've recovered over the decades, you know.

203
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,920
And he's like, I'm not joking.

204
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,040
You know, you know what we're telling you, because you have

205
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,040
you guys have to report to the deputy secretary of defense in Congress

206
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,840
on this matter. Right.

207
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,440
And we were we were actively

208
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,040
briefing like Secretary Esper, Deputy Secretary Norquist, you know,

209
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,840
other cabinet level folks. Right.

210
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,120
And it's like there's a you know, there must there's an oversight issue

211
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,920
because you're the UAP task force.

212
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,200
You should be read into this stuff because like

213
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,280
why spend the taxpayers, you know, dollars looking at stuff

214
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,240
that we already have data on. Right.

215
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,640
So that's and that spooked me.

216
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,080
And that was like fall of 2019.

217
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,440
And, you know, I don't take a guy's word for it.

218
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,040
I'm like, you know what?

219
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,680
Myself and my trusted colleagues that had a lot, a lot of special accesses

220
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,880
like me, you know, we cultivated our network

221
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,640
and we ultimately interviewed about 40 people or so all the way up

222
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,040
to multistar generals,

223
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,480
directors of agencies, mid-level guys that literally touched it,

224
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,640
worked inside of it, all the stuff.

225
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,200
They brought intel reports for me to look at, you know, documents.

226
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,160
And in a lot of that, I could cross verify with other

227
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,560
oral sources that my high level colleagues or I talked to.

228
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,760
And, you know, it checked out, especially when I

229
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,640
had enough information on.

230
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,600
And I know who specifically to ask, like, hey, well, I went right into this.

231
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,680
Like, I'm on the task force.

232
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,080
And we went to those, I'll call them gatekeepers for the lack of a better term.

233
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,840
And they basically said, fuck you to me and my colleagues.

234
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,560
Hmm. So why were these other people willing to discuss this with you?

235
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,120
Well, they determined I didn't need to know I was already

236
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,240
cleared at such a high level handling presidential material and everything.

237
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
It's like Dave needs to know.

238
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,120
And they felt that coming to us, it was a form of a protected disclosure.

239
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,560
They felt that they weren't really violating anything because, you know, we were the

240
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,960
I'll call it the investigatory body for the Department of Defense

241
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,680
and the intelligence community and Congress at the time.

242
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,840
And they, you know, you are allowed to,

243
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,960
you know, disclose to a government official in an official capacity.

244
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,120
And I, you know, did that.

245
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,800
And, you know, of course, I protected those people.

246
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,120
And and do know I took those people, a lot of them,

247
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,120
and they brought them to the intelligence community inspector general

248
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,280
when I filed my complaint, because I don't want people to,

249
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,760
you know, hear it from a secondhand source.

250
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,840
You know, people call it hearsay, whatever.

251
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,080
Well, I have some firsthand knowledge.

252
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,000
I eventually talk about someday I'm trying to get it cleared.

253
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,800
But through through security processes.

254
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,240
So they could hear it and hear the details like,

255
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,280
you know, who, what, when, where, why, where the shit is,

256
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,640
who's in control of it, what are the cover programs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

257
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,160
So and that's what deemed my my complaint credible and urgent in July 2022,

258
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,640
which is a so that my complaint, yes, was about reprisal, too.

259
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,600
I filed that separately eventually to the Department of Defense Inspector General.

260
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,960
That's an ongoing investigation.

261
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,640
But it was my congressional oversight

262
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,000
UAP crash retrieval allegations that was deemed credible and urgent.

263
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,160
It was sent to the director of national intelligence.

264
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,000
And then it was sent to the congressional intelligence committees

265
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,400
around that time, July of 2022.

266
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,320
And I eventually went to Congress in December of 2022.

267
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,120
And it's a crazy story why it took so long.

268
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,200
It's fucking nuts.

269
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,520
But I provided total about 11 and a half to 12 hours of,

270
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,640
you know, classified testimony to the congressional staffers and their lawyers

271
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,040
for both the House and the Senate.

272
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,560
And I I went full open kimono.

273
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,120
I mean, I told them as much as I could within my time slot, if you will. So. So.

274
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,920
This is obviously very compartmentalized.

275
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,880
Where there's only a few people that know about this information.

276
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,920
And they're not allowed to discuss it with other people.

277
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,840
When did this all start?

278
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,240
I mean, is this out of Roswell?

279
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,720
Is it predate that?

280
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,400
Like when when did they first realize that there are things

281
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,720
that cannot be explained or can't be explained through conventional means?

282
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,920
Yeah, I mean, the program goes back a ways the precise

283
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
beginning of it.

284
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,960
I can't talk about, but I did because security stuff.

285
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,840
But I did talk about publicly the 1933 retrieval.

286
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,240
And I did that tactically.

287
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,880
And I ran that through the security approval office

288
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,200
because I wanted to show that this is much older and it's international.

289
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,680
It's not like a U.S. thing.

290
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,560
I mean, this stuff is landing or crashing around the world.

291
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,840
And unexpected countries have had this happen.

292
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,400
And that's why I pick that because I thought that was an interesting case.

293
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,160
And then, of course, the Pope Pius XII and the Vatican were involved

294
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,880
backchanneling it through the OSS, which became the CIA later to FDR.

295
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,520
And that's how the U.S. knew something weird happened in Italy during.

296
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,840
Well, right before World War II.

297
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,280
But so this is 33 was the first like documented.

298
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
That is the earliest one I can talk about.

299
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,040
Yeah, there's something that predates that.

300
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,960
You could infer that you could infer that.

301
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,920
Yeah. So this 33 one, you said, was in Italy.

302
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,320
Yeah. Magenta.

303
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,400
So it's a bad geography.

304
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,440
I think that's like a Lombardy region.

305
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,680
It's like northern, northwest Italy.

306
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,960
And what's the story behind it?

307
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,360
So basically, it it looked like it crashed, right?

308
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,880
The original shape most likely was like a lenticular disk like craft,

309
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,600
you know, with like two dinner plates.

310
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,640
What does lenticular mean?

311
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,840
So like two dinner plates, you know, smushed together, right?

312
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,680
And there's like, you know, like a bubble on top of the classic classic

313
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,200
like like that, like that.

314
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,920
But it looks like when it hits, the edges broke off.

315
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,880
So it became this like bell or acorn shaped thing.

316
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,920
And there was nothing in it.

317
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,440
It was like just an artifact.

318
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,760
You know, there was no biological remnants, if you will.

319
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,440
So it's so funny because the Italians were so confused.

320
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,160
They actually called up the Germans and they were like,

321
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,520
is this one of your Wunderwaffe?

322
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Like, what the hell just crashed in northern Italy?

323
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,640
Mussolini and this is all publicly available information

324
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,560
because some Italian researchers

325
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,160
found all these original documents

326
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,640
that some people were sitting on for years in Italy.

327
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,240
You know, they put a gag order on the press, et cetera.

328
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,400
And Mussolini asked the Germans to come down.

329
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,000
And of course, the Germans came down and they were like,

330
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,280
that is not ours, but let's look at it together.

331
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,560
So that's kind of perhaps a tertiary reason

332
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,280
the kind of Axis powers got together.

333
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm not saying that's like the reason, but I think the Italians

334
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and the Germans were so intrigued with what they found

335
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,240
from like an artifact perspective.

336
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,680
There was at least some scientific

337
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,480
and military collaboration during the war.

338
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,160
The details of which I'm not I'm not sure of,

339
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,280
but I know people that know that specific event

340
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
that are currently still intel officers

341
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,080
within this program in detail.

342
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,280
But so was there witnesses to the crash

343
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,920
or some sort of an understanding

344
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,840
that something had crash landed and then they discovered it?

345
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,240
Yeah, I forget the precise discovery.

346
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,080
I don't know if it was like local police officers

347
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,680
or local farmers found it in the field, something like that.

348
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,160
I don't want to misspeak.

349
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,040
I'm I assume some of the Italian researchers

350
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,480
might have some fact witnesses that can orally say,

351
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,360
oh, yeah, my my great grandfather found it

352
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,120
or something like that. But I don't remember.

353
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
And what was the scale of this vehicle?

354
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,760
It was probably like like 20 feet by 10 feet, something like that.

355
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,040
Not super huge, but kind of big.

356
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,080
Do they think that this was a drone?

357
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,680
Do they think that this was occupied?

358
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,600
There was nothing in it.

359
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,440
So if it if it was piloted, if you will, by some sentience,

360
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,360
I mean, your your guess is as good as mine.

361
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,120
So hmm.

362
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,800
So what happened to that vehicle?

363
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,400
So we knew where it was being stored at a particular location

364
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,920
after the crash.

365
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,440
And then the military came in and we we grabbed it

366
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,520
towards the end of the war, you know, 1944, 1945,

367
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,760
because, like I said, Pope Pius XII already kind of.

368
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,080
Let's FDR know why the pope get involved, because well, Italy.

369
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,480
Well, interestingly enough, there's like a whole history

370
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,320
of human intelligence prior to World War Two and old money.

371
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,840
The Vatican, the Italian mob, kind of the old country boys

372
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,480
did a lot of informal intelligence collection

373
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,920
for the US.

374
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,560
And there's probably some books you can read on it,

375
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,040
but it's really interesting.

376
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,920
You know, human intelligence collection wasn't really formalized

377
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,840
until the Office Office of Strategic Services, the OSS,

378
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,200
which became the CIA in 1947.

379
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,760
You had, you know, Paul Mellon and all these other

380
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,360
affluent guys of all these old money families

381
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,800
that basically created the CIA.

382
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,320
So that's probably the reason why.

383
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,520
So this thing that was recovered,

384
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,000
this was the first documented one that the United States had access to.

385
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,640
I can't get into if it was the first or not, but it was an early one.

386
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,320
Very early. Yeah. So it's almost 100 years ago. Yes.

387
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,560
And so they take this thing and then they bring it where?

388
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,800
Yeah, I can't. I can't get into that.

389
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,280
Can't get into that. No. OK.

390
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,360
So they bring it somewhere in the United States.

391
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,520
And was the attempt to try to back engineer this thing?

392
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,560
Was the attempt to try to understand what it was?

393
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,200
Yeah. I mean, first of it, obviously, it's understanding the situation, right?

394
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,960
What do we have our hands on?

395
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,560
And and like I've said in some other videos and stuff,

396
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,440
you know, that we took the Manhattan Project secrecy

397
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,240
and overlaid it on this issue because that secrecy worked well for atomic bomb

398
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,560
developments and whatnot.

399
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,720
And and certainly this whole program in a nutshell,

400
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,120
if I were to like summarize the 90 plus years of history,

401
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,920
it is a reverse engineering program to garner some kind of insight.

402
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,640
And of course, not a lot of the things that we've learned from it

403
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,280
are like directly, you know, ripped off the technology we found,

404
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,400
but it has inspired other innovations that made its way

405
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,560
into other US classified programs over the year for national defense reasons.

406
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,400
You know, it's a myriad of different things.

407
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,320
So the UFO folklore is that this is where fiber optics were discovered first.

408
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,680
Yeah, I'm not going to break the seal on anything we've discovered

409
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,840
or anything like that.

410
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,960
And yeah, it's a place I can't go to.

411
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,600
Are you and what you can discuss and what you can't discuss and why?

412
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Why do they let you discuss any of this?

413
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,400
Yeah. So anything sensitive that I want to say as it relates

414
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,080
to like US government activity, whether it be intelligence stuff, military stuff,

415
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,840
et cetera, I have to submit it through what they call DOPS or DOD office

416
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,360
of pre publication and security review.

417
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,720
That is something anybody who's been an intel officer,

418
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,760
anybody with like a clearance has to submit that kind of stuff.

419
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,240
Now, obviously, if you're writing a book about gardening, you don't have to.

420
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,960
But if you're going to talk about anything military

421
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,360
and intelligence related, you have to submit.

422
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,000
So it's kind of a catch 22 for this office, right?

423
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,080
They're only looking at it from a security perspective.

424
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,400
They're not vouching for it or anything like that.

425
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
And that's like any author, right?

426
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,000
They could write a book about Navy SEALs and they're not vouching for the story.

427
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,480
They're vouching that you didn't say any nasty code words.

428
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,240
You didn't burn a specific ongoing classified program.

429
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,600
And for them, I mean, I'm not in their OODA loop, but certainly

430
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,600
it's a catch 22 for them where if they want to redact and they propose

431
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,280
a redaction, they're like, hey, Dave, you can't say these sentences.

432
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,320
You can rewrite it and resubmit.

433
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,120
You know, we can't necessarily tell you

434
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,360
what agency said to redact it, but you're not allowed to say this.

435
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,160
They would be basically self certifying there's a there there.

436
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,840
So in my opinion, probably the policy is like,

437
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,560
if it has to deal with the subject, we're not saying anything.

438
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,080
We're not proposing any redactions.

439
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,120
As long as he's not burning a conventional program,

440
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,680
we kind of have to allow him to exercise his First Amendment rights.

441
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,360
So I think it's like a catch 22 for that office is kind of the long

442
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,480
or the short of the long answer.

443
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,720
So this is essentially one of the very early ones, 1933.

444
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,440
How many crash retrieval

445
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,640
incidents have there been?

446
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,440
It is double digits.

447
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,360
These specific numbers, I do know.

448
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,920
However, I can't discuss that.

449
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,080
I know it sounds like, oh, I'm being coy or whatever.

450
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,840
But, you know, this show, any other interviews I do write, you know,

451
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,160
Ford intelligence services are watching.

452
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,600
And it's like, I'm not here to help Russia and China calibrate

453
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,040
their intelligence collection like, oh, Dave said it's this number.

454
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,600
We missed a couple.

455
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,440
Shit, let's put it out for the KGB.

456
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,480
SVR and GRU are now going to hit the streets to try to figure out

457
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,360
which ones they miss.

458
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,960
So I'm I'm here to protect national security.

459
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,840
And I'm just trying to put all the general topics out there

460
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,960
for public conversation to hold our government accountable, really.

461
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,000
So because I'm I'm here as a fact witness

462
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,160
because we have a, you know, a constitutional oversight issue

463
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,280
because this program has not been,

464
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,600
you know, reported to Congress in the appropriate way, you know,

465
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,400
and I can get into a senator I talked to that has died recently.

466
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,120
So I can, you know, explain to you why I'm so sure.

467
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,280
Besides what I read, which we can get into that, what Intel reports I read.

468
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,920
I did get some stuff cleared.

469
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,120
So during my investigation, I'm like, you know what?

470
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,200
I need to talk to somebody at the highest levels. Right.

471
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,280
So and this will give you an idea of the kind of people we talk to.

472
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,760
And this is the only one I'm going to talk about using their name

473
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,240
because they died two years ago.

474
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,560
So in spring 2021, I actually flew with a couple of colleagues of mine

475
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,120
to Las Vegas, and I met with Senator Harry Reid

476
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,360
about nine months before he died.

477
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,560
And of course, he's a private citizen now, and I wanted to brief him on.

478
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,920
The topic, and I wanted to get his kind of thought leadership on it,

479
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,160
because, you know, he was a gang of eight member, right?

480
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,320
You know, which is the top most cleared senators and congressmen.

481
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,280
He was the majority leader, for God's sake.

482
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,560
So the Senate and I knew, you know, he helped sponsor

483
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,520
the OSAP program that I mentioned

484
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,120
and where they looked at Skinwalker Ranch and some other things.

485
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,960
And I wanted to understand, like, what does Harry Reid actually know?

486
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,720
Like, why did he, you know, give 21 million dollars

487
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,800
to DIA and Bigelow Aerospace for this?

488
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,640
So I'm sitting there in Harry Reid's living room,

489
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,840
you know, right next to him with some other witnesses that were there with me.

490
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,800
And he straight up says he's like, yeah, I knew we had UFO material.

491
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,400
I was denied access for decades.

492
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
I tried to get access.

493
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,440
And then he explained some of his efforts during OSAP.

494
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,320
And I was like, holy shit, the former majority leader

495
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,000
just say that he just confirmed this to me as well.

496
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,600
You know, I was already talking to these amazing high level people.

497
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,480
But I have Harry Reid literally saying, yes, we have material.

498
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,440
And, you know, he knew it was non-human.

499
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,200
Did Harry Reid have personal experience with this?

500
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,200
I don't know if he's had any personal stuff in his personal life.

501
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,640
I mean, did he see it? Did he he said this?

502
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,680
In terms of seeing the material himself, he said he was denied access

503
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,640
for years, decades was his term.

504
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,480
And he actually told me on behalf of me, he was going.

505
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,600
So he had like a weekly call with President Joe Biden at the time.

506
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,480
And he straight up said to me

507
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,080
he was going to talk to President Biden about this issue, literally.

508
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,880
And then what he was telling me about OSAP,

509
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,680
I was like, holy shit, I have like 20 other people that told me this, dude.

510
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,120
So the real history, what fucking OSAP was,

511
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,040
because I think there's a lot of people out there

512
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,200
to think when they were looking at ghosts, skinwalker ranch.

513
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,720
Yes, they went to the ranch as a secondary and tertiary objective.

514
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,960
But the real reason.

515
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,040
So like there's a document that came out a couple of years ago

516
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,880
through FOIA from the Defense Intelligence Agency.

517
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,960
There was this special access program request that Harry Reid,

518
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,800
you might have seen this, I think, like George Knapp and company

519
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,000
have reported on this

520
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,680
that he sent to the deputy secretary of defense, William Lynn.

521
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,280
And it was asking for one of the most serious saps you can ask for,

522
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,520
what they call a bigoted, waived special access program.

523
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,600
So waived means it's limited congressional reporting

524
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,680
that is a class of special access programs.

525
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,600
And bigoted means it's like by name.

526
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,440
And it's like it was like you can read the FOIA document.

527
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,920
It was like, you know, Harry Reid, James Inhofe, Luella Zondo, etc.

528
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,840
And I'm like, why are you asking for the most serious sap to be created

529
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,360
for a program that ostensibly is looking at skinwalker ranch and stuff?

530
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,160
And it doesn't make any sense.

531
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,560
So what really happened there?

532
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,360
And, you know, Harry Reid,

533
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,680
God bless his soul, made this disclosure

534
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,560
a couple of weeks after we met in the New Yorker.

535
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,360
And you can look this up.

536
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,200
I think it was like a May 2021 New Yorker story where he says,

537
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,480
I knew for decades and he made this disclosure, not me.

538
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,240
So I'm going to say the name of the contractor.

539
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,080
Harry Reid said this, you know, we knew that Lockheed Martin

540
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,960
had this material for decades.

541
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,240
I tried to get access and I was denied.

542
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,640
And specifically with the Lockheed Martin stuff,

543
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,880
he was talking about during the ASAP program.

544
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,040
And for the people who are on this program,

545
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,480
I submitted the shit to the officer, got this cleared.

546
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,080
So don't freak out.

547
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,160
But I'm telling the truth here.

548
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,120
So Lockheed Martin wanted to divest itself from this material

549
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,160
at a specific facility that's known to me, that I provided to the inspector general

550
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,280
like street address, all that shit, right.

551
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,440
And the idea was if they made a catcher's mitt, a security catcher's mitt

552
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,960
for this shit, you know, most serious sap possible,

553
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,000
the contractor and the other government customer,

554
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,520
which was the Central Intelligence Agency for that specific Lockheed material.

555
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,400
And it was shit that they recovered from like the 50s and stuff.

556
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,160
And it was like bits and pieces of of of of like hall structure, shit like that.

557
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,320
And so they were going to tech transfer it.

558
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,520
And the 21 or 22 million dollars was actually for Bigelow Aerospace

559
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,760
to build out, you know, facilities in Las Vegas and material analysis equipment.

560
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,240
And I've seen I have I saw the staff meeting slides.

561
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,920
I saw the paperwork like there's a paperwork trail I've seen on this shit.

562
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,000
And I talked to the people involved in this program.

563
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,800
And, you know, even Jim Lakatsky, who ran the program,

564
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,920
whose retired DIA officer, PhD in engineering, even made this disclosure in his book

565
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,120
Skinwalkers at the Pentagon, page 152 to 153.

566
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,000
And he also made a disclosure a couple of weeks ago.

567
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,280
I think it was on weaponized podcast with Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp, where

568
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,200
he's like, yeah, we had a whole craft and we broke into the hall and we gained access.

569
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,400
And he ran that through the same, you know, security process as I did.

570
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,240
And so Jim Lakatsky, who ran this program, is also going on the record

571
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,280
that he is aware, personally aware of intact vehicles and everything.

572
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,440
But so they gained access.

573
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,360
What does that mean? And by what method did they gain access?

574
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,920
The way he wrote it in his book, I can only infer it sounded forcible.

575
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,720
So through some kind of, you know, means, I don't know if it was like CO2 laser or something.

576
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,840
I don't actually know how they gained access, but imagine it was not permissive access.

577
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,800
They like broke into the damn thing.

578
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:13,960
So this thing is essentially sealed and it's some sort of what was the shape of this thing?

579
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,840
Lakatsky didn't disclose the shape on this particular vehicle, as far as I recollect.

580
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
What about the dimensions?

581
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,760
I don't believe he did in his book.

582
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,520
But I think it's like Chapter 11 in his new book or something like land status.

583
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,440
But he did make that disclosure on video as well.

584
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,320
And I do encourage both the Aero Office, which is the DOD's UAP task force successor,

585
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,080
and Congress to ask Dr. James Lakatsky to come in for classified testimony,

586
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,280
because the disclosure in his one book that he wrote with Colm Kelleher, George Knapp,

587
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,760
and then the second book.

588
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,960
Well, the guy saying he has close personal knowledge, he needs to go to Congress.

589
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,280
So, you know, I don't know James Lakatsky, but I do encourage him to be a fact witness.

590
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,920
But going back to that transfer with Lockheed, long story short,

591
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:12,800
can't get in all the nuanced details, but basically the CIA said fuck you to DIA and Lockheed.

592
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,200
And it was totally killed.

593
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,600
So Harry Reid's request to get the material transferred to the OSAP program was totally killed

594
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,560
because of bureaucracy and kind of fiefdom stuff.

595
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,400
So they used that money, and then they, you know, they wrote those Defense Intelligence Reference Documents,

596
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,040
the DIRDs, as a lot of people who's familiar with it listening will know about.

597
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:46,720
And then they did look at Skinwalker Ranch because they thought that studying kind of the more woo-woo phenomenon

598
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,440
aspects of this, and I've never been to the ranch, so I've never experienced the ranch for myself.

599
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,120
But, you know, obviously, I think we both know a bunch of people that have been to the ranch

600
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,240
and have seen some trippy stuff, or at least allege that.

601
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,520
They thought that they would be able to gain currency with the program, you know,

602
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:10,200
and in this case, CIA, to unlock the key for the Lockheed Martin stuff,

603
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,280
which actually, I'll tell you right now, it's so weird to say that, but I ran that shit through security.

604
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,120
Yeah, to me, it's like an out-of-body experience to talk about that kind of detailed sensitivity, stuff like that.

605
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,520
But basically, they studied the ranch to gain favor, to be like,

606
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,880
hey, look at all this stuff we're figuring out, this paranormal stuff that's somehow connected to the phenomenon on the ranch.

607
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,480
But ultimately, they never gained favor with the government customer.

608
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,400
And then the program kind of died a slow death because of a lot of politics in the Pentagon.

609
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,680
So that's kind of the long but short of it with the OSAP program that, you know,

610
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,520
I wanted to make sure the public knew it's not what you think it was.

611
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,840
There was some other stuff behind the scenes that, you know, I wanted to speak truth to power on.

612
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:04,200
So this particular vehicle that they had recovered from the 1950s, what was the source of it?

613
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,800
Where did they find it?

614
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,200
Those details, I did not get cleared.

615
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,840
So they have in possession this thing, they gain access to this thing.

616
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,800
And what do they report once they've gained access to it?

617
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Oh, those details, I do not know.

618
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,960
That's probably a question for Dr. Lakatsky.

619
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
I presume he knows those details. I don't know.

620
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,000
So this thing is housed somewhere?

621
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,680
It is, yes. Currently.

622
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,400
It may still be in the same location that I know about, yes.

623
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:47,440
And how many people have access to this and how did they prevent this information from being released?

624
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,560
I mean, you know, it goes back to the compartmentation and kind of the ecosystem of secrecy in this community, right?

625
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:59,920
You know, only a limited amount of people, you know, at least at the time, you know, on Lockheed Martin's side.

626
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,120
And Lockheed Martin was complaining basically like, look, like the secrecy is ridiculous.

627
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,560
We can't even bring the right engineers.

628
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,760
Imagine you're like a hot engineer, a hot engineer, a hot shot engineer.

629
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,040
It might be hot, too. I don't know.

630
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,760
But that you're fresh out of grad school.

631
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,720
Maybe you're like the best PhD electrical engineer.

632
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,880
You want to do cool shit. You want to publish an IEEE.

633
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,840
You want to like, you know, climb the ladder corporately, you know, and that kind of thing.

634
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,160
A Lockheed Martin executive comes to you.

635
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,080
Yeah, dude, you're going to I can reach into something really crazy,

636
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,720
but you're never going to publish papers on it.

637
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,120
You're never going to be able to tell people what you worked on.

638
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,080
And it's probably not the most career enhancing.

639
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,880
But if you want to work on something cool, but I can't tell you because it's unacknowledged

640
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,920
until you sign this piece of paper, non-disclosure agreement.

641
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,880
You know, sorry, but here's the raw deal.

642
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,400
And, you know, a lot of people are like, fuck you, no.

643
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,280
And it's not like Lockheed Martin could broadcast this to universities like,

644
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,320
come work for us. You'll work on crazy shit.

645
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,320
But that is very akin to a lot of other black programs in the government

646
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,080
that are adding knowledge in nature.

647
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,560
You don't know what you're signing up for until you get bred in.

648
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,160
And I've, you know, I've been briefed to a lot of that kind of conventional stuff in my career.

649
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:30,360
So that's one of the problems that Bob Lazar, and I'd love to get your take on Bob Lazar,

650
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:36,360
one of the things that he talked about was that science can't really operate in a vacuum.

651
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:41,800
When you separate the metallurgists from the propulsion's experts, from the biological

652
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,000
experts, like, and they're not allowed to communicate with each other and they're not

653
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,320
allowed to bring in other experts to have different.

654
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,720
Well, that was the frustration that I had some friends that I've known my entire career,

655
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,320
like almost 14 years, right?

656
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,000
I literally know them personally.

657
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,920
I had a relationship with them, but they ended up, you know,

658
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,760
spilling the beans where, you know, look, we're on the program.

659
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,440
I'm an engineer for X, Y, and Z.

660
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,120
We can't even cross talk across like the cubicles for God's sakes.

661
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:16,680
Like I can't, I'm looking at material X doing some X-ray diffraction testing on it,

662
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,240
which is like shooting a stream of electrons and seeing how it bends and looking at the

663
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,440
atomic arrangements.

664
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,040
I can't even like cross talk that with another aspect of the program.

665
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,240
This is like ridiculous.

666
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,200
And that's kind of their frustration.

667
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Yeah, I knew you were probably going to ask me about Bulbasaur.

668
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,560
I know, I figured as much.

669
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,720
Why did they do that though?

670
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,000
If everybody was already sworn to secrecy, everybody already has NDAs.

671
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,960
It seems the most effective way of reverse engineering or at least gaining an understanding

672
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,080
of how these things are structured.

673
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,000
Well, that's exactly how Manhattan was, right?

674
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,880
People working on the fuses for the bomb didn't necessarily know it was going to a nuclear

675
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,280
weapon.

676
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,720
And I've seen this kind of compartmentationist up to secrecy in other programs and it is

677
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,640
debilitating for progress.

678
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:07,720
And honestly, as a former fiduciary of the taxpayer dollars, it's not the best modus

679
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,800
operandus to do it that way.

680
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,520
And very few people kind of had that top down, could look across the silos and see what was

681
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,080
going on.

682
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,600
It just became very dysfunctional and they were afraid of people being too cross briefed into

683
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,520
the different silos for counter espionage, counter intelligence.

684
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,880
They were going to remember a bulk of this program was done during the Cold War and we

685
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,360
were afraid of Russian spies, Soviet moles.

686
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,480
And so we made it ultra locked down, but to the detriment of national security.

687
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,720
And that was one of the crazy things that got me that I wanted to whistle blow on because

688
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm like, this is so stupid.

689
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
We should be making more progress on this.

690
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,480
Were there any breaches that you're aware of?

691
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,760
Were foreign agents were able to gain access to materials or an understanding of what we

692
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,000
know?

693
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,920
So I'll tell you about some intel documents I read that kind of obliquely answers that

694
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,480
question.

695
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,520
So there was sense of human derived foreign intelligence that I read.

696
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,960
So I had access to kind of the ATIP OSAP classified archives and I was like thumbing through

697
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,480
everything and there's some other people were bringing me documents to evaluate.

698
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:28,920
And I'll never forget I had to say stolen by the US intelligence assessment from a certain

699
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,280
foreign adversary discussing the US reverse engineering program.

700
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,360
And I was like, and that was actually another like, what the fuck?

701
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:45,800
And so I had an adversary also confirm this program literally because of exfiltrated

702
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,600
intelligence.

703
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:54,680
And so they certainly had a limited knowledge, at least fact of that the US had a program

704
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,360
like this, a particular adversary.

705
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,040
And actually I was like, well, I want more.

706
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,600
Like I know who wrote this literal or who got it right on behalf of the United States

707
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,000
government.

708
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,600
So I went to that certain agency through the approved and official way.

709
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,760
And this is kind of part of the myriads reprisals against me.

710
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,200
The agency was like, oh, yes, we have what you're looking for, Dave, you're going to

711
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:24,120
need to sign a one time read into something, you know, come visit us to, you know, go to

712
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,320
the vault and read it, right?

713
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,000
You know, hard copy, but yes, we have what you're looking for.

714
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,560
And ultimately, from what I was told by friends in higher places, my request kind of went

715
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,000
up the flagpole at that agency.

716
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:44,520
And all of a sudden, the agency ghosted my boss and I for like two months.

717
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,320
And then when I really pressed them hard to gain access, because I'm like, I have a

718
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,640
need to know I need to evaluate this intelligence for fucking Congress.

719
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:03,720
And they debriefed me from all my accesses over in that other sister agency and made

720
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,000
up some bogus excuse.

721
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,720
Like I shouldn't have been briefed anything in the first place, literally, and basically

722
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,720
gave me an administrative middle finger like persona non grata.

723
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,960
Don't ever fucking ask us about that shit again.

724
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,640
And I'm sure the person who made the oops that told me they had what I was looking for

725
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,360
probably got admonished and slapped on the wrist because I never heard from that person

726
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,760
again, even though it was somebody I actually used to work on occasion with.

727
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:39,080
So that was also another way I knew I was you know, there was a lot of smoke and fire

728
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,480
because I, you know, had stuff like that happen to me.

729
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:52,600
So this knowing that our adversaries were aware of this reverse engineering program,

730
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,120
are we aware of their reverse engineering programs?

731
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,620
Yeah.

732
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,520
Which countries?

733
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,040
You could you could probably guess and you wouldn't be, it won't be too shocking.

734
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,360
Okay.

735
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,760
But I won't acknowledge what the US may know.

736
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:14,520
Right. So are we aware of numbers in terms of like at least a rough estimate of how many

737
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,360
are available to these other?

738
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,400
Yeah.

739
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,360
How many?

740
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:19,960
That's like super sensitive.

741
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,400
But there's more than one.

742
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,920
Yeah, you can read into that.

743
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,280
You can read into that.

744
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,000
And has anyone made any progress?

745
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,400
Yeah, I can't get into if we've made progress, if they've made progress,

746
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,960
because that's like straight up some national security stuff.

747
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:43,080
But like, I want the just to be clear, I want the US populace to learn a lot of this.

748
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,440
And this is why, you know, another reason why I went public is like,

749
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,680
I need to call everybody out.

750
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,720
I'm not here to admonish the entire government, mind you.

751
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,400
But there is an element of the US government and its clear defense contractor base that,

752
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,520
you know, we have a three branch of government oversight issue like going back to Harry Reid.

753
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,880
Harry Reid didn't even get access.

754
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,840
I fucking talked to myself to confirm that.

755
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,360
And he said he was going to talk to Biden.

756
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,480
Because I think there needs to be a disclosure plan.

757
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,440
And this goes back to what's currently in legislation right now.

758
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,960
That's super fucking important.

759
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:27,000
Because 90 some odd percent of this should be open for public discovery,

760
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,440
public analysis and academia.

761
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:36,520
This should be like, at very least true nuclear programs such as nuclear physics,

762
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,760
you study in the university, nuclear weapons classified,

763
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,320
because that makes people in the pink mist.

764
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,280
That's really sensitive.

765
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,200
We don't need everybody to know how to do that.

766
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,800
So I think the stuff that is like legit weapons related stuff,

767
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,520
that's like straight up national superiority stuff, sure.

768
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:02,440
Reasonably classify that, but these programs, we need a change.

769
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,400
And that's why you saw the Schumer Amendment, right?

770
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,400
And I think you might have read that on air or something in a previous episode,

771
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,440
if I remember correctly.

772
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,840
You know, Chuck Schumer, and I knew about the amendment a couple months before I went public.

773
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,160
And that's kind of another reason why I did what I did.

774
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm like, fuck.

775
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,360
I'm like the only guy that kind of has the opportunity to do this.

776
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,520
I know what's in the chute, so to speak, that Chuck Schumer and his staff had

777
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,960
with the Schumer Amendment, which is 67 pages of literal, we want to disclose.

778
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,240
And I'm like, I have to spike the football by going public because,

779
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,320
you know, I can read the tea leaves on the hill.

780
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,320
And I think that they were hesitant to do anything

781
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,480
without being able to point to something publicly.

782
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,040
And I'm like, I'll be that fucking guy and just send it.

783
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:58,280
And then, of course, a month after I went public, I guess I pushed Chuck Schumer over the ledge.

784
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,320
And I do know he talked to the White House about the amendment, too,

785
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,960
because not like Chuck Schumer is going to propose groundbreaking legislation like that

786
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,840
without talking to the national security advisor or president.

787
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,680
Like, I imagine he did so.

788
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,160
And, you know, so you have the 67 page amendments, right?

789
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,440
It's called the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023, known as the Schumer Amendment.

790
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,360
Co-sponsors were Young, Gillibrand, Rubio, Rounds.

791
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,320
Yeah, and Young.

792
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,600
And, you know, kudos for those senators for stepping up to the plate

793
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,160
because they know this is real.

794
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,640
I know what meetings they've had with certain other individuals

795
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,960
that are, you know, even more credible than myself.

796
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:44,760
And so this act, which is like super important, is currently in conference.

797
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,720
As we speak in Capitol Hill.

798
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,360
So the amendment is wrapped in something called the Fiscal Year 2024

799
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,920
National Defense Authorization Act.

800
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,360
So that is the act that funds the military basically every year, right?

801
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,120
So it's an amendment within this bill.

802
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,960
And the act is really long, but the main meat of it is about halfway through the act.

803
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,920
It talks about a presidential panel or agency, which is nine person,

804
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,960
and a controlled UAP disclosure plan that's six years in length,

805
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,280
conceivably from 2024 to 2030 in this panel.

806
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,800
And you can read this is public law.

807
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,760
Anybody can read this.

808
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,440
They want a scientist, economists, you know, you know, sociologists, etc.

809
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,720
It's kind of like who you would want to help craft the plan for the president.

810
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,360
And this whole bill was actually built off the JFK Records Act,

811
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,920
which I know like they're like, well, they never released all the records.

812
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,200
Well, we put some teeth in the bill, some eminent domains, some other stuff,

813
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,160
the, you know, kind of force the issue.

814
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,600
Now, granted, the chief executive, the president has the final say.

815
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,040
The panel can't compel the executive to do it.

816
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,800
But like, I hope the president does and I support that.

817
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,080
But so the Senate already passed it.

818
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,120
They're chill with this.

819
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,880
This is like, we're good to go.

820
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,200
And and but there's pushback in the House right now that is,

821
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,320
you know, pardon my language, fucking ridiculous.

822
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:20,200
So they're saying, for one, it's duplicating the DOD arrows office activities.

823
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,480
They're doing good things.

824
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,160
They're looking at UAP reports, trying to figure out what's balloons and air trash

825
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,080
and what's weird stuff.

826
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:33,080
And of course, they are doing an historical review to try to understand the US's history on this,

827
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,320
too.

828
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:39,240
But the problem is with that agency, it's within the DOD and IC, not above.

829
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,280
So you have an issue reaching into Department of Energy, other, you know,

830
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,960
cabinet level agencies.

831
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:53,080
You need a presidential level panel that can declassify stuff, reach into other agencies

832
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,800
and tell certain secretaries, we're coming in.

833
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,680
We want your stuff under presidential authority.

834
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,760
So what's happening in the House?

835
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,400
From what I'm told from people on the Hill that are working the issue right now,

836
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,680
you have the chair of the House Intel Committee, Mike Turner, who's blocking this

837
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,880
from Ohio, Dayton, Ohio area.

838
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,840
Right, Pat.

839
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,400
Weird.

840
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,120
Right, Pat, meaning Wright Patterson.

841
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:18,680
Yes.

842
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,320
Yeah.

843
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:24,760
And Mike Rogers, which I'm kind of surprised from Alabama, who's the chair of the House

844
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,440
Armed Services Committee.

845
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,760
So I have a problem with Mike and Mike right now.

846
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:35,160
So Mike Turner, now remember, I went to his committee in December of last year.

847
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,960
He wasn't there, but his staff and lawyers were.

848
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,120
And of course, he goes on Fox Business after the hearing, doesn't use my names like this

849
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:44,840
whistleblower.

850
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,680
He has no idea what he's talking about.

851
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,200
I'm like, really?

852
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,080
Tell me, Mike, have you ever been an Intel officer or served in the military?

853
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,640
Oh, wait, you've been the mayor of Dayton, Ohio.

854
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:03,480
You were voted most corrupt person in Congress a couple years ago and pull up his PAC donors.

855
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,000
Who are his biggest donors?

856
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,760
Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing.

857
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:13,000
Okay, so and first of all, if you thought you need more information or wanted to talk

858
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,920
to me personally, why didn't you call me back when I reported to your committee?

859
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,680
So and furthermore, besides blocking the bill, I'm sure you're familiar with like

860
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:28,520
Representative Tim Bershett of Alabama, and he's been very outspoken on the issue.

861
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,560
We may not agree with everything Tim says about conventional stuff.

862
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,800
That's, you know, here, no there.

863
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,480
But, you know, he's been a champion on the Oversight Committee and he was, you know,

864
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,520
one of the members that I testified in public under oath regarding this.

865
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:49,160
So like, and Mike Turner is looking to fund, according to staffers I've talked to last

866
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:54,120
two weeks, an opposition candidate for Tim's reelection in 2024.

867
00:51:54,120 --> 00:52:01,080
So why is Mike Turner going out of his way to destroy the career of a courageous Tennessee

868
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,840
representative on the Oversight Committee?

869
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,680
And why are you blocking a bill?

870
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,440
And it's not going to cost much, a couple million a year max, you know, for the panel,

871
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,000
which is like vaporware and US government speak, right?

872
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,600
If there's nothing to see here, why are Mike Rogers and Mike Turner in the House

873
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:27,000
blocking this bill that is, in my opinion, the most important legislation for transparency

874
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,520
in American history?

875
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,800
If there's nothing to see here, if I'm fucking crazy, multi-star generals I talked to are crazy,

876
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,360
the Intel docs that I read are incorrect, they're fucking forgeries or passage material

877
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,240
or something like that.

878
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,440
Good friends of mine that worked on the program are bullshitting me in some consorted

879
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,440
operation against me and my colleagues that it would be totally crazy to even conduct

880
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:56,040
that because I took precautions, then why don't we just pass this and see what happens?

881
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,840
And what do you think the answer to that is?

882
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,240
Special interests want to keep the genie in the bottle, even though the toothpaste is

883
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,760
coming out of the tube, and I think it's like a death rattle in this industrial complex

884
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,960
that doesn't want change.

885
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:14,040
And I'm not here to be some total adversary.

886
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,640
I think there needs to be a truth and reconciliation process on this issue.

887
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,760
I'm not here to throw people in jail.

888
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,240
I'm not here for big contractors involved to lose money.

889
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,240
I think this would be a boon.

890
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,960
And I think the leadership in these companies need to think about this, where if we're more

891
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,960
open with this, you can hire people, you can push the subject into undergraduate,

892
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:44,840
and postdoctoral programs of research to study this in an unclassified, just like nuclear

893
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,320
physics.

894
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:53,160
And this answers a fundamental question for humanity.

895
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,480
Are we alone or what happens when we die?

896
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,800
Well, I don't know about that, but are we alone?

897
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,720
Well, the answer is we're not alone.

898
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:05,800
And I know that with 100% certainty, which as an Intel officer, you never say 100%, but

899
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:14,520
all things pointed towards based on the people I talked to, like Harry Reid, and I use him

900
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,960
as an example, but I talked to the highest of the high people you could possibly talk

901
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,240
to, if you catch my drift.

902
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,520
So unless all them are lying and they're covering up something else, which I don't

903
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,840
even know what it would be at this point, because the phenomenon is real.

904
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,920
It's been going on for thousands of years.

905
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,400
People have been seeing strange things and not everybody's mass hallucinating.

906
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,800
So that's kind of my long diatribe about what's happening.

907
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
What do they think these things are?

908
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,640
The people that you talk to?

909
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:50,600
So they specifically, the people on the program that handled the material that were in executive

910
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:57,080
level briefings with Intel community leaders and other folks over the years, last 20 years or so,

911
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,040
they did use the term extraterrestrial ET or whatever.

912
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,080
Okay, that isn't a possible origin.

913
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,400
But the Schumer Amendment, if you read it, it specifically uses non-human intelligence,

914
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:15,640
NHI, very deliberately because we want to catch everything, because what if some of

915
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,840
this stuff is not ET and they're going to use that as an escape clause?

916
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,160
Well, this stuff that we don't even know if it's extraterrestrial, so this doesn't apply.

917
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,600
So that's why we want it to be as broad as possible.

918
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,840
Besides ET, a lot of it would be my own personal opinion.

919
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:42,840
I think we have a couple conceivable buckets and I'm using the work of Jacques Vallee,

920
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,840
other people that have thought deeply on the issue on how the phenomenon has changed since

921
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,840
antiquity, it showed itself in a different way.

922
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,600
Like a good example is like witches sitting on your chest phenomenon with

923
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:04,680
a paralysis and medieval and enlightenment era became this alien abduction phenomenon

924
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:14,040
in the modern era and is it the recipient and their analytical overlay cognitively

925
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:20,200
seeing the phenomenon based on a modern interpretation, inside out, or is the

926
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,920
phenomenon, this is like Jacques Vallee's book, Passport to Magnolia, Magnolia,

927
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:30,520
I can pronounce it right, 1969, where he talks about the phenomenon seems to like

928
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:37,320
masquerade itself as different stuff over the years, but we've seen roughly the same stuff.

929
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:43,160
If you look at the Foo Fighters of World War II, there are declassified Air Force OSI reports

930
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:49,720
from the 50s, people can Google the talk about flying butane tanks with the same measurements,

931
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:55,720
approximately what we saw in the 2004 Tic-Tac incident, but they called it flying propane or

932
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:03,960
butane tanks in the 50s. So from a morphology or in the Air Force Intel, we call it vis-rec-y,

933
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:12,600
visual reconnaissance, they basically look the same and we can back-asmith that decades, if not

934
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,480
hundreds of years in the past, wheels of Ezekiel, they're seeing these like disk type objects.

935
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:25,560
Unless Ezekiel is tripping or this is an allegory or fable in the Bible, let's say the event happens,

936
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:32,600
just like in the Vedic text, you have the battles, the blue people and the battles in the sky that

937
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,920
sound like nuclear and directed energy weapons, like what's going on there? Maybe that's a

938
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:44,440
Graham Hancock or Randall Carlson type thing they know more than I. So there is a real phenomenon

939
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:52,520
that origin undetermined but it's trippy and sometimes it presents itself in like a non-corporeal

940
00:57:52,520 --> 00:58:00,760
form too, you know, orbs, balls of energy, they don't appear as like some kind of bipedal hominid

941
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:09,160
like some people have expoused. So I think that might be, call it interdimensional, call it shadow

942
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,120
biome, I mean there's a lot of different theories. What are the primary theories? The

943
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:20,520
primary theories are from another planet or from another dimension. I think those are the primary,

944
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:26,920
I mean there's certainly origins that we probably can't conceptualize as humans because we're just,

945
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:32,760
our meat is stuck in 3D and we don't understand and our IQs are only so high so there might be

946
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,560
some origins that we don't understand. In terms of like interdimensional travel.

947
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,080
Yeah, I mean obviously if you talk to mainstream physicists they say like crossing dimensions

948
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:52,120
physically is kind of a trope of sci-fi and that's why I used an example and I know some

949
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:57,240
physicists don't like me talking about this theory but it is a theory. So the holographic principle

950
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:05,000
which was originally conceived to explain how information is encoded on an event horizon of a

951
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,360
black hole which is a distance away from the singularity of a black hole where if you cross

952
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,800
it you're fucked because you're going to get ripped to shreds or you're not coming back

953
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:21,560
and that principle talks about how information basically from higher dimensional space can be

954
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:29,800
encoded in lower dimensional space and the easiest example is like us casting a shadow on a sidewalk

955
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:36,280
right? Three-dimensional object, 2D shadow on a sidewalk. If you lived in two-dimensional space,

956
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:42,200
flatland you'd be tripped out. What the fuck am I seeing? But they just don't know that it's really

957
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:47,240
just a person in higher dimensional space. So is some of the, I mean obviously we have physical

958
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,720
material that's in three-dimensional space that we've recovered but at least maybe some of the

959
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:58,680
phenomenon is really operating in higher spatial dimensions but is either being projected or quasi

960
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:04,840
projected into our 3D plus time space which is really trippy to think about but we literally do

961
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,960
it on a day-to-day basis like casting shadows. So and that might be some of what we're seeing too

962
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:17,880
but I mean I presume we know more. The people I talked to did not espouse, they had full knowledge

963
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:24,760
either. Like I said the normal colloquialism was to say ET or extraterrestrial. Could you dumb down

964
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:34,040
this concept of interdimensional? I know in physics they have theorized that there are

965
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:39,000
multiple dimensions other than those that we can currently detect. Yeah and a lot of that is based

966
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,120
off of like, this is my bachelor's degree talking, I know there's going to be like some physicists

967
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:50,920
who has a PhD who's like oh Dave you fucked that up. But basically from high energy particle

968
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,240
collisions and based on the deflection angles and all the stuff what happens when the particles

969
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:04,840
collide confirms certain theoretical frameworks about extra spatial dimensions and I can't speak

970
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:12,440
with any real authority on precisely how that works but a lot of whether it be string theory

971
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:20,680
or quantum mechanics are based off of higher spatial dimensions and so that is a mainstream

972
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,880
physics theoretical framework that's not like wacky or loony or anything like that.

973
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:34,200
But that's basically a possibility but like I said like we don't really have a good theory

974
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:40,520
if you lived in like 5D space for example. It's almost like remember the ending of the movie

975
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:45,960
Interstellar right? Where he's pushing the books, he's like in a tesseract you know which is like a

976
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:51,480
4 to 5D structure but he's trying to interact with 3D space and of course he like leaves that

977
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,040
space to come back to his daughter many years later at the ending of the movie, great movie.

978
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:03,640
But so that's a way to conceptualize it in something you may have watched in film.

979
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,680
It's kind of like the ending of Interstellar. Oh yeah. Yeah there you go.

980
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:16,360
Yeah. Which is based on what? Like what theory? So the physicist Kip Thorne was the very famous

981
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:22,280
guy. He was a big black hole and wormhole guy. I think it's Caltech or somewhere in California.

982
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:27,080
Kip Thorne actually did all the physics equations and everything for Christopher Nolan

983
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:35,000
to make sure that they were conceptualizing and visualizing black holes and wormholes and all

984
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:41,080
that stuff correctly in the movie. We saw like the halo around the black hole when they were

985
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,560
coming in with the ship and everything. That's actually based off of real physics models that

986
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:49,240
Kip Thorne did the calculations for which is pretty cool actually that Christopher

987
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:55,560
Nolan took it to that level you know. So this idea that these beings or whatever you want to

988
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:03,240
call them exist in some other dimension. Do we have, I mean I don't know what you can say about

989
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:09,880
this, do we have an understanding? Do we have any sort of communication with these beings

990
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:16,280
that give us some sort of an understanding or a map of this? Yeah the interaction stuff

991
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:24,280
it's a sensitive area. There were multiple very senior people that were concerned about talking

992
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:30,120
about that kind of stuff with me. I mean that is certainly as nuts as it sounds that was a real

993
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:34,280
subject of conversation even it sounds like something out of like Star Trek First Contact.

994
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:40,360
But it doesn't if you have vehicles. Yeah so it's like once you realize the phenomenon's real

995
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:47,720
then you realize we've recovered artifacts and you know biologics or you know dead pilots if you

996
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:52,440
will even though it's you know kind of creepy to even think about that in your world view

997
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:59,240
you don't think they were ever you know alive sometimes too right and I'll you know leave it

998
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:06,440
at that only because you know that is something you know the president and his cabinet need to

999
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,680
disclose this in a controlled manner going back to that amendment you know I'm not here

1000
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:18,760
to you know push the subject in an improper way and that sounds like why don't you just do it

1001
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:25,560
Dave like there's a lot of secondary and tertiary ramifications socioeconomically, theologically,

1002
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:33,400
our relationship geopolitically with our allies and adversaries this is not rip off the band-aid

1003
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:39,320
and it's simple there's a lot of complex stuff behind the scenes that need to happen and that's

1004
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:44,200
why I'm laying out all the general stuff that needs to be talked about during the disclosure

1005
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:50,600
process but I should not be the one disclosing and it would be highly inappropriate because I

1006
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:56,200
care about the health of the United States and its people and national security for me to do so

1007
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,840
so I know there's people that are like oh why doesn't Dave say x y and z it's like this is

1008
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:07,000
serious this is not like haha let me tell you a good story I'm a serious guy I ruined my fucking

1009
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,360
career doing this I was going to make lieutenant colonel in the air force and this winter I was on

1010
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:19,160
track to be you know a flag officer equivalent civilian in my career I spent 18 years in uniform

1011
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:25,960
if you count the cadet time right my whole adult life was serving as an intel officer but

1012
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:33,240
I wanted to see and I'm 36 right older millennial I wanted to see change so I'm throwing the flag

1013
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:40,520
out and I'm here to hold the government accountable to do the right thing in a manner that is mature

1014
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:47,880
and thorough because I don't begin to say that I know everything all the different ramifications

1015
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:52,840
of saying certain things publicly I don't know all the answers to that and that's why I have to

1016
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:57,320
be careful because I don't even know I'll call it you know collateral damage effects to use kind

1017
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:04,120
of a military term what may happen of certain things in detail that are revealed that I might

1018
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:09,320
not know the ramifications thereof because there's something that I'm not privy to so this is like a

1019
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:15,240
serious this is not like a fun situation this is like humanity changing hopefully in a good way

1020
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:23,640
but this is like you know quite serious and I you know risked my personal and professional life

1021
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:31,880
and personal life because things have happened to me to be public like this and you know I

1022
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:35,960
swore an oath but you know myself and my generation you know want to see it change

1023
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,440
Can you discuss the things that have happened to you personally?

1024
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:43,720
Yeah so a lot of the stuff I have to be purposely vague because there's an open

1025
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,960
inspector general reprisal investigation on my behalf and I'm not here to compromise

1026
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:53,240
the investigation by tipping off my antibodies that may be watching right now but

1027
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:59,000
you know when I really started looking into this I mean they came after me

1028
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:06,680
so hard to try to revoke my clearance ruin my career kicked me out of my agency

1029
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:16,520
and they accused me of everything you could possibly think of with like no evidence for

1030
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:23,080
example at first they they wanted to say oh Dave you have mental health stuff you didn't report

1031
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:28,120
to us we're concerned because we think you might have an ongoing mental health issue I'm like what

1032
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:35,480
are you talking about I reported that I had PTSD from Afghanistan in my military service several

1033
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,560
years ago and I sought help for that like I'm not ashamed of that you know I'm high functioning

1034
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:45,960
autistic and and I didn't know that until my early 30s and and how I processed trauma I didn't

1035
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:52,840
really understand until many years later and you know I sought help for that and they were trying

1036
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:59,560
to say that like I had some secret mental health problem that I haven't been reporting to so I had

1037
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:06,200
to go through this whole process three agencies at the same time investigated me for that's which I

1038
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:11,320
don't even know if that's like legal they tried to say that I like mishandled classified all this

1039
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:17,640
other stuff it was insane apparently I was under criminal investigation for a couple months and I

1040
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:23,880
didn't even know that and nor did they interview me but they made a finding with no evidence they

1041
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:29,320
tried to use against me that I had to spend money to basically litigate and maintain my employment

1042
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:35,320
my clearance which I did for the record I maintained my clearance I resigned with full

1043
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:40,520
accesses you know I'm just debriefed now but I maintained my top secret eligibility

1044
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:49,160
and I left with my own accord and and so and of course uh they ruined one of my boss's careers

1045
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:54,120
in another agency they walked him out of the building and revoked his clearance and terminated

1046
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:59,800
him as a show of force after they were going after me and I feel sorry for that certain

1047
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:05,320
individual and they came after co-workers of mine I can't get into who what when where and why to

1048
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:11,080
protect their identities and their own process but so that's what happened to me professionally

1049
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:21,320
and then what happened to me personally was very disturbing so I had to be very vague about this

1050
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:27,160
because ongoing investigation but I think you'll understand what I'm saying is

1051
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:36,440
they showed my wife and I they can touch me at any time two times and it was very disturbing

1052
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,840
it was in conjunction with some other people getting a message like that that are let's say

1053
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:46,920
publicly well known some that are aren't publicly well known and of course I immediately reported

1054
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:52,280
that to you know counterintelligence federal law enforcement local to me because it you know wasn't

1055
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:59,880
criminal but it was like a fuck you to me like and this was right before I filed my whistleblower

1056
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:05,800
complaint now I don't know who did this you know an entity who did x y and z to my wife and I

1057
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:11,240
identity unknown but it fucking happens and I you know provided that documentation to

1058
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:21,480
a couple special agents and I just knew that it was getting serious and you know as

1059
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,720
first of all I'm the kind of person I'm from Pittsburgh you know like steel town I don't take

1060
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:33,480
shit from people and I decided fuck it I'm gonna file an inspector general complaint to protect

1061
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:39,800
myself I don't I'm in fear for my safety you know my wife's an air force veteran too and you know

1062
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:45,320
very strong individual but you know as a man you don't want to put your family at risk

1063
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:51,560
and you know did certain other measures which I won't talk about to protect myself you know

1064
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:59,400
physically and I could not believe that that was happening to me no kidding and I knew

1065
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,760
I needed to do something internally and then when I saw the writing on the wall

1066
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,480
earlier this year and of course I knew about the Schumer amendment like I mentioned earlier

1067
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:13,720
and I knew I'm like you know I gotta do this for my own protection because me leaving the

1068
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:18,280
federal service because I resigned my air force commission I totally threw that career away

1069
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:26,040
to do what I thought was the right and patriotic thing to whistle blow on this you know and I

1070
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:33,320
swore my oath 18 years ago and that sounds hokey but I believe you know integrity first

1071
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,840
service before self and excellence all we do that's the air force motto and I'm like I

1072
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:46,040
this is not going to help me personally like love talking to you I like spreading this message

1073
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,560
because it's the right and ethical thing to do but this is a nightmare for me I don't want to

1074
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:55,400
be public I've served the country in clandestine and covert operations for 14 years I've done

1075
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:00,760
technical intelligence for some of the most high profile takedowns in US history I shouldn't even

1076
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:08,200
be here but I am because I want to see change I saw something unethical and unmoral I want to

1077
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:13,960
make sure I hold that element of the government accountable and it was the right fucking thing to

1078
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:19,800
do and and I get kind of emotional about that because you know my career has been service and

1079
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:26,760
sacrifice and you know I had two friends of mine die and I've talked about this publicly before

1080
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:33,480
and I you know I'm segueing a little bit but the the suffering of the American intelligence officer

1081
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:38,360
is something that for their service of their country and when I'm talking about this subject

1082
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:46,840
obviously people don't realize the kind of trauma intel professionals go through so first of all I

1083
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:51,320
had a friend six months after I got back from Afghanistan his name is Captain Dave Lyon there's

1084
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:57,880
a park in Peterson Space Force Base named after him I remember seeing his coffin come off the

1085
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:04,360
plane stuff so you know I saw him die that that fucked me up for a number of years and that's

1086
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:08,520
what you know gave me a lot of my my problems that I ended up dealing with but then I had

1087
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:16,920
I remarried and then my best man Captain Ben Heine Air Force intelligence officer Air Force

1088
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,960
Special Operations Command I've known him for years he's my closest friend you know best man

1089
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:28,840
at my wedding and then 28 days later unfortunately he suffered from depression and it was you know

1090
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:34,040
as his best friend he didn't even confide in me you know I remember chit chatting him chit chatting

1091
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:40,360
with him on the phone one day about 28 days after he was my best man and I he didn't tell me anything

1092
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:46,520
was wrong with him and a few hours later he walked in his backyard and shot himself and you know I

1093
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:56,120
gave his eulogy at his at his funeral and that really you know really affected me and and and

1094
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:02,360
with what Ben experienced which I can't get into all the stuff he did obviously but imagine

1095
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:11,400
being the guy that decides that that person is bad fire the hell fire that person is now pink

1096
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:17,480
mist that they're dead you just played god let's go back to you know the wife and kids at the end

1097
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:22,600
of your shift and a lot of that I you know I did the same kind of thing I did a lot of stuff

1098
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:31,240
overseas involved interrogations and you know ops that were you had to decide if a target is bad

1099
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:36,840
enough where you're going to affect their life forever and their family's life forever and and

1100
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:41,080
that's the silent suffering of intel professionals especially during the global war and terror which

1101
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:49,160
was you know 21 years or so and you know the the trauma and the mental health problems that people

1102
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,680
get from being an intel professional and operational environment people think like special

1103
01:14:54,680 --> 01:15:01,640
operators pilots etc you know ground army marines ground pounders and they certainly have their own

1104
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:09,080
trauma but it's this weird insidious am i in a video game is this real trauma that intelligence

1105
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,600
professionals and i just wanted to highlight that during the show because that was just a

1106
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:20,440
near and dear to myself so people are aware of the service of military intelligence and

1107
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:25,960
civilian intelligence professionals so that's have to make really tough decisions for the country that

1108
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:32,280
affect people's lives on the receiving end you know so was there a concern while you're going

1109
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:37,800
through all this that if you didn't come out with this that we would be stuck in the same sort of

1110
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:44,280
loop for a long long period of time and no one would ever have access to this stuff that they

1111
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:51,080
would continue yep yeah and that you nailed it on the head is you know i think my generation once

1112
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:56,040
it changed the under 40 generation their parents went to war their older brothers went to war

1113
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,800
were fighting two dangerous proxy wars right now which is extremely

1114
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,760
stupid i don't know the better way of saying it be quite frank and i give you my own assessment

1115
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:13,160
on that if you want but i like we're in this loop we're not progressing in a healthy way

1116
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,920
as a civilization you know it's becoming more divisive whether on the left or the right

1117
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,360
you know people aren't even looking up all they care about is tiktok you know we're creating

1118
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:29,880
potentially dangerous artificial intelligence you know i even saw that in my government service

1119
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:36,280
and i think humanity's kind of stuck right now and we need to change and this subject is like

1120
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:44,600
one of the only unifying ontologically shocking but i would think generally unifying topics were

1121
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:52,200
where if announced by you know the us and other you know major powers that have knowledge in a

1122
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:57,800
controlled manner that this could change humanity for the better make us look inside ourselves

1123
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:05,800
become less divisive and care maybe a little less about superficial things so so that's kind of my

1124
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:12,600
philosophical motivation to do what i did and and you're confronted with one of the biggest

1125
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:20,200
mysteries in in human history yeah which is are we alone and it seems like at least some people

1126
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:25,800
have the answer to that 100 i mean the people i talked to certainly did and they had close personal

1127
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:32,360
knowledge and the intel reports i read you know literally indicated that as well like i talked

1128
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:39,880
about earlier and it just so it's like this caste system i call dudes with sci clearances do not

1129
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:47,160
have an embargo on reality so it's a caste system of you know people in government and outside of

1130
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:53,400
government in the industrial complex that run this stuff under little oversight and you know

1131
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:57,240
i remember some of the people who denied us access they were like you know you know i don't know what

1132
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:02,440
you're talking about but if i did why would you have a need to know and i'm like well why did you

1133
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:09,400
have a need to know you're just some multi-star general where you're a human being you're a human

1134
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:15,560
being you're not better than me i mean who determines need to know on a humanistic question

1135
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,600
um it's like basic fact of life why do you why are we classifying fact of life

1136
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:30,440
at this day and age in 2023 it's insane and the answer to that would be national security

1137
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:37,240
yeah it's obtuse national security right so like why we classify stuff it's called executive order

1138
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:46,680
13 526 right section 1.4 sections e and f are why we classify science stuff why we classify nuclear

1139
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:53,560
stuff it's like a one-liner it's very vague and and are you saying this is these basic

1140
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:59,560
facts should be classified are you saying that this fits in this bill and you know and and you

1141
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:05,800
notice the schumer amendment if anybody reads it awkwardly calls out the atomic energy act in 1954

1142
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:13,560
right and they're basically treating this as nuclear secrets because it gives off

1143
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:20,280
a you know nuclear radiation because if you look at the ultra vague definition

1144
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:27,480
of special nuclear material which is section 51 of the atomic energy act in 1954 it says anything

1145
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:33,720
that gives off a sizable amount of atomic energy literally that's what it says well what's sizable

1146
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:40,840
and what legal gymnastics are you saying this stuff which is obviously not a well who knows

1147
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,800
maybe it is a nuclear weapon and you're saying this is a u.s. nuclear secret you're trans

1148
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:54,360
classifying it into a nuclear secret which i understand maybe at first why they did that

1149
01:19:54,360 --> 01:20:00,600
and i'm not admonishing the hard decisions that presidents and other folks did many years ago when

1150
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:05,240
this was more of an enigma and we wanted to like lock it down figure it out and then see what we're

1151
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:10,840
gonna do but there's never been a disclosure plan i always ask that like to these super senior

1152
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:17,720
people i've talked to was there a plan any kind of plan at all and they're like no never we tried

1153
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:24,200
the muddy to waters back and then you know tried to put it out there and test the populace but

1154
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,040
you know there was never any cogent plan i mean people think the government

1155
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:34,680
is like this fine oiled machine they have plans for everything well i guess sort of but like

1156
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:41,640
it's not i mean look at the war and terrorism we left afghanistan no general officer mattis

1157
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:48,600
betrayus mccrystal i call them the failed generals people loud them but really themselves in the

1158
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:54,280
obama administration bush administration except you know trump whatever nobody had a cogent plan

1159
01:20:54,280 --> 01:21:01,480
for success and we were fighting people who are much less of an adversary than like our one of

1160
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:05,320
our peers or near peers and we couldn't even win that war like what the fuck are we doing

1161
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:12,840
but these protracted endless wars let's be real it's good for the industrial complex right so and

1162
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:18,040
i'm not like admonishing the whole industrial complex for the record you know we need national

1163
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,040
lethality we need weapons to kill bad guys because there's evil people in the world

1164
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:28,440
but you've got to control you know some of it though well that's a part of the problem with

1165
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:34,840
people that have secrets it's like once you have secrets and part of your identity is the holder

1166
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:43,080
of those secrets yeah and part of the culture of these these industries is that they they are

1167
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:49,880
the ones that have the access to that yeah and i saw that in conventional really black programs

1168
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:56,760
i was a part of in my career it was almost like um you got that secret society vibe where it's like

1169
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:02,520
if you're a career government servant uh your salary is not that great but knowledge is your

1170
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:08,280
currency and what makes you special what rice bowl do you control and i remember getting

1171
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:12,520
read into some stuff that like it was like the president and very limited number of people

1172
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,160
getting read into and i was one of them because i was operating a certain thing for a certain op

1173
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:23,960
and oh you're part of the club you know like only 30 people are cleared or whatever and i'm like

1174
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:30,200
who the fuck i don't get off on this shit it's like it's so weird but like these like lifers

1175
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:36,120
and i hate to you know talk so matter of fact about it but like it just it's kind of disgusting

1176
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:41,720
to me because it's like this like uh it's weird it's like a weird like gnostic cultish thing

1177
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:47,640
and you know i live that community for 14 years of my career and people really do enjoy having

1178
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:52,600
information that other people don't have access to i was like i got a secret and like that's why i

1179
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:58,600
whistle-blowed okay so i know this shit's real i know there we're not alone we have stuff no shit

1180
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:05,480
am i gonna sit on my ass for 30 40 years i'm an old man i look back like ah i had that secret i

1181
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:12,920
knew about it but i didn't do anything i didn't change so i couldn't just keep that secret because

1182
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:19,160
i thought it was just perverse and wrong that the people don't even at least get to know the basics

1183
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:25,800
it's insane so when it comes to these i'm gonna bring it back to these these actual entities

1184
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:32,200
yeah do we know or we do have an understanding of how many of them we're talking about and the

1185
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:39,000
variety of them well yeah there is a variety and we have a certain number of different things

1186
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,840
but the like total numbers of like what's interacting with us on earth i mean nobody

1187
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:49,720
knows that and i mean that there's an understanding of some that they do believe are interacting

1188
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:54,280
with us and there's a variety in terms of there's there's variables yeah i talked to people who are

1189
01:23:54,280 --> 01:24:00,840
familiar with uh the biological analysis and everything so we have some idea not a complete

1190
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:06,920
picture because it's like you know you know you're looking at it's like well i don't even understand

1191
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:11,000
the physio physiology at all it's like what the heck it's like way different right so

1192
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:17,320
um we have at least a description of this physiology yeah no i was in i was in the room

1193
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,600
when uh

1194
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:30,040
hey be careful i don't want to i was in washington dc with a very uh number of senior people that

1195
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:36,680
work for members of congress put it that way um when i was still in government and

1196
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:43,480
i brought the people who worked on that stuff to the hill i mean this is why the members were so

1197
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:50,440
confident to put out the schumer amendment and stuff and i was like please explain and

1198
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:57,960
they went into all those details and stuff and i remember you know some some of the professional

1199
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:03,000
staff members were like whoa like like they were like in g-lock right because i mean it like a total

1200
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:11,160
world bubble got burst right there for a lot of people and so we have some idea it's not a

1201
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:15,400
complete picture i mean it's just like but you're not even bringing in the right the right people

1202
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:21,960
like i think about my friend and colleague dr gary nolan which i started the sole foundation

1203
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:29,720
non-profit with i mean he's like you know nobel level biologist virologist like he's the guy that

1204
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:35,080
you would want on it but he's not on it so i think we can make a lot of progress in our

1205
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:41,960
understanding once again if if this is more broadly studied um in an open environment

1206
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:50,600
you aware of the nixon jackie gleason story vaguely i i stayed away from ufology because

1207
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:55,800
i had these contemporary people that were inside i could check all their credentials where they

1208
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:03,080
worked etc but i i'm vaguely familiar where what was it like nixon brought jackie gleason

1209
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:07,320
to some facility and showed him some stuff or something like that yeah supposedly that's the

1210
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:11,640
story and it's very it's very hard to determine the origin of the story or whether or not it's

1211
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:17,000
real it came from there's a story about one article that was supposedly public was it vanity fair

1212
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:25,720
don't make that and uh you can't find the story but jackie gleason by all accounts was obsessed

1213
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:32,600
with ufos and uh even built a home in upstate new york that looked like a flying saucer oh really

1214
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:39,480
yeah that's cool this is the house he had this house constructed supposedly after he had this

1215
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:44,280
meeting with uh nixon so nixon supposedly they were drinking

1216
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:50,200
jackie gleason and nixon are tying one on and nixon's like you want to see some shit

1217
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:59,480
and uh they fly uh to wherever this base is yeah and he shows them these frozen biological entities

1218
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:06,440
and this retrieved vehicle and then jackie gleason becomes a fanatic obviously that's crazy

1219
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:11,080
yeah i mean not crazy but but uh that's interesting that a president would do that to

1220
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:16,120
like an uncleared celebrity friend of his like oh let me just show you the most sensitive

1221
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:21,240
shit our country has i don't know it's kind of crazy to me people are obsessed with celebrity

1222
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:27,160
you know there's even world leaders you know kings and queens of you know they've always

1223
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:31,800
been obsessed with famous people and jackie gleason at the time was incredibly famous and

1224
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:40,600
also beloved right yeah so this is my pal and uh i'm drunk you want to see some shit you know i

1225
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,760
get it i want to hang out with nixon if that's how it was like man well i said he was probably

1226
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:50,520
wild i bet he was like that in a lot of ways you know i mean hunter s thompson famously recalled

1227
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:56,120
his uh yeah there's the two of them meeting together uh famously recalled sitting in the

1228
01:27:56,120 --> 01:28:00,440
backseat of a limo with nixon talking about football and he was like god if i didn't think

1229
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:04,520
he was a piece of shit i actually kind of like him oh that's funny yeah we're just talking

1230
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:11,000
football yeah you know um look nobody in that job nobody as a president is going to be loved by

1231
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,960
everyone and i'm sure nixon has positive qualities and you know if jackie gleason liked them i'm a

1232
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:21,240
giant jackie gleason fan it's probably probably fun to hang out with yeah yeah if you're drunk

1233
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:28,200
and you know you're the president also we're talking about the 1970s right so this is a

1234
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:32,760
different world you know like even if you tell anybody who the fuck is going to believe you

1235
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,200
you don't have you can't get on tiktok like what are you going to do how are you going to get this

1236
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:41,640
information out oh exactly and that's kind of how you know in my personal opinion you know how the

1237
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:48,200
program was protected right forever make make it crazy right so if anybody leaks anything um or

1238
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:52,440
you know that has an unauthorized disclosure yeah people are gonna think you're fucking nuts of

1239
01:28:52,440 --> 01:29:02,120
course yeah yeah um but there are actual reports that we have biological remains

1240
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:11,400
yes oh yes yes how many it's up there uh as well just like with the and they vary

1241
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:18,760
there's different kinds do we have an understanding that you don't have to answer where of where they

1242
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:26,600
came from nobody i talked to espoused any specific origin to me we may know that but

1243
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:33,720
i'm not aware of anything so i don't know are there reports of some kind of interaction with

1244
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:41,000
these things where they're giving information or discussing the the problems of humanity and

1245
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:48,840
possible solutions or explaining why they're here interactions was a sensitive subject

1246
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:57,800
that my interview subjects did not want to get into uh i suppose that there's probably detailed

1247
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,880
documentation of those interactions that goes into a lot of the stuff you're asking i truly

1248
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:07,960
don't even know the answer to a lot of that so but is there discussions amongst these people

1249
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:14,040
that there have been these sort of there was water cooler talk with some people i talked to

1250
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:18,680
on the program i love water cool yeah they're like hey bro guess what i overheard in some weird

1251
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:24,360
meeting you know right and but that is the problem with that is it's like secondary information

1252
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:31,800
right and i'm so anal retentive unless that person told me i had close personal i touched it whatever

1253
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,240
like cool well you're coming to the inspector general or i'm gonna at least give them your

1254
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:41,240
name because that's what you told me and then obviously i did that so those people who physically

1255
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:47,960
were there were on the program did the thing i brought to the inspector general um are there

1256
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:55,320
discussions of interactions with live beings uh there was some water cooler talk about that kind

1257
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,520
of thing but that's it but you know i i don't even want to get into it because it's like

1258
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:03,960
there were some details provided to me but it's like it's secondary and i i don't know if that's

1259
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:11,400
like the telephone game and i don't know if it was hyperbolized in any way um you know in

1260
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:16,600
the break room so to speak so i just i'm so anal about making sure what i say is accurate i don't

1261
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:21,800
you know i don't know so yeah do we have an understanding i mean if if there have been

1262
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,480
these discussions do we have an understanding of when they first took place

1263
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:33,240
yeah some specific events were mentioned to me and i provided that information in a classified

1264
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:39,640
setting and how far back did they go pretty far back it's pretty weird yeah so well one of the

1265
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:45,640
stories from roswell that's fascinating to me is that eisenhower had the wreckage flown to

1266
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:52,520
right paterson air force base in two separate jets in case one of them crashed there has been

1267
01:31:52,520 --> 01:32:02,440
some public testimony um so general debose there were some old timers that at least uh you know

1268
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:08,680
did some videos in like the 90s like i'm i'm brigadier general exxon here's what i heard

1269
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:14,600
whatever i mean that's out there in the the open source so yeah yeah and there was always a

1270
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:21,560
discussion of hanger 18 right if you're a hanger 18 there's a lot of hangers that's the for whatever

1271
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:25,720
reason i think it was maybe a movie was there a movie well you know you know it's funny speaking

1272
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:33,160
of uh senators being denied there's a video in the late 80s of senator barry goldwater of goldwater

1273
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:39,160
nickle zack famed right he was a two-star general in the air force reserve and uh like literally

1274
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:43,560
this video is like on youtube it's like hard to find though but um jesse michaels on american

1275
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:48,120
alchemy put together i think a short video yesterday and there's like a section there

1276
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:54,520
where he actually has that goldwater interview but general goldwater is like yeah one day i called

1277
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:59,400
curtis lame who's a very famous air force general and was like general i heard that there's this

1278
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:06,040
room that you you know have ufo material and barry goldwater exposes in this interview like yeah and

1279
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:12,280
lame got madder madder than hell at me and told me never to fucking ask ask about that again i

1280
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:18,760
might have added the f word in there just for um for fun for fun but uh yeah it's bad the military

1281
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:24,280
too long um my wife tells me to be careful with my language all the time around my niece and nephew

1282
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:33,560
so but but even barry goldwater knew that we had ufo material he asked general lamay when he was

1283
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:38,280
in the air force and general may basically told him to fuck off and that is a literal interview

1284
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:46,600
you can google so a lot of this like people um disclosing fact of has really been out in the

1285
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:52,840
vernacular for a long time but nobody really cared because well everybody was just kind of

1286
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,920
like desensitized from the whole subject and thought it was wacky and i'm not the first

1287
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:02,840
former government official to confirm that you have goldwater and all these other harry reid

1288
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:08,360
who made the same disclosure to the new yorker a month after i talked to him in person melon

1289
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:15,080
yeah melon has said stuff uh lou ellisando said uh you know he believes we have material on i

1290
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:21,640
think it was tucker carlson a couple years ago um so there's certainly been other officials now i'm

1291
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:28,600
just trying to spike the football and take it all the way to the end zone here and and luckily

1292
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:33,880
we have a congress that's mostly motivated minus mike rogers and mike turner you're on you're

1293
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:41,000
getting cool in your stockings i'm going to make sure your office gets cool and um uh you know they

1294
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,920
they want change too and they realize it's time for a change and uh presumably you know chuck

1295
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:52,520
schumer's talked to you know jake sullivan and president biden and you know who's in the white

1296
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:59,880
house right now is john podesta he is the uh green energy czar or something like that in the

1297
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:06,120
white house but you know john podesta uh um shout out to john podesta in the white house he

1298
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:12,200
has an axe to grind on this issue too because remember he tweeted at the end of obama's second

1299
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:19,160
term you know my biggest failure was not to have obama release the ufo file and made the same kind

1300
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:24,520
of statement with clinton so certainly if mr podesta is listening in the white house you know

1301
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:29,160
i'm here to help i you know i hope that you're championing this within the executive office of

1302
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:36,680
the president and um you know the other speaking of people like goldwater who who've made some

1303
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:43,880
weird non-sequitur kind of admissions there's a john stossel interview of mike pompeo the former

1304
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:50,840
cia director about two years ago or so you can find it online where pompeo talks about

1305
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:55,480
the jfk file and like dismisses it or something about like there's no boogeyman here but then

1306
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:04,120
he he quickly says oh i've seen the ufo file too and we have bigger problems

1307
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:10,200
but at least the way it was edited john stossel didn't even follow up uh at least the way the

1308
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,720
final cut was i'm like dude if i was john stossel i've been like right what does that mean what do

1309
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:20,760
you mean mike pompeo you've seen the ufo file and we have bigger problems and ufo file the way i

1310
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:28,280
interpret that is a uh long existing file or briefing document or something that he

1311
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:34,120
had access to so i think i think the former cia director mike pompeo should probably clarify what

1312
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:41,240
he said two years ago next uh if anybody interviews him next ask mike that question what did he mean

1313
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:45,560
yeah yeah we have bigger problems well we certainly have bigger problems in terms of our

1314
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:50,200
current existence specifically with what you were talking about earlier the proxy wars and

1315
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:57,240
collapse of society as we know it which it seems yeah i mean the i mean i feel for the ukrainian

1316
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:03,560
and the israeli people you know i'm not taking any particular side but certainly people forget

1317
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:09,160
us aid in these wars what's the like most expensive thing if you've studied phases of

1318
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:13,240
conflict it's the reconstruction costs after the conflict so are we in it for like

1319
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:21,560
triple digit billions like the war and terror i mean certainly the israeli conflict is a great

1320
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:27,800
distraction because you know like russia is very tight with iran right and personal opinion you

1321
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:32,200
know this is my own personal opinion but i you know i'm sure they commiserated and was like can

1322
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:38,440
you start a two-front war because we would like to win in ukraine and uh this will distract the

1323
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:45,480
u.s because israel is a long-time you know middle east ally so it's brilliant it's brilliant public

1324
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:52,360
opinion i mean the the virtue signalers on social media have essentially completely forgotten about

1325
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:59,160
ukraine it's it's all about israel and palestine yeah you don't even see it and um and i understand

1326
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:03,320
you know what the national security council determination was that they've discussed publicly

1327
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:08,600
where there's kind of like trying to drain the russia's you know military capability and

1328
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:16,120
and annexation of ukrainian territory because they don't want russia sphere sphere of influence

1329
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:21,880
to further enter that caucus region and stuff but yeah it's funny like you said it's like you don't

1330
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:27,480
even talk about ukraine it's all about israel now and which is a horrible conflict on both sides like

1331
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:34,200
it's just it's unfortunate so without a doubt yeah um it's that it was a very interesting

1332
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:39,080
statement though that we have bigger problems so even if we do this seems to be like a

1333
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:46,280
this is such a human question because it's one of the biggest mysteries

1334
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:51,800
obviously you know there's the fermi paradox where are they right if you look out and if you look

1335
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,400
out into the cosmos yeah if you've ever gone a clear night and you look out and you realize

1336
01:38:55,400 --> 01:39:01,640
those are all stars and those stars are all surrounded by planets and there's literally

1337
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:07,320
hundreds of billions of them in the drake equation you can calculate what probable sentient

1338
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:11,320
life yeah and i've been an amateur astronomer since i've been a kid and i've never

1339
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:17,960
crazy enough i've never seen anything remarkable i've seen some stuff that could have been ball

1340
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:25,400
lightning and some satellite passes that weren't registered uh online um what you can you could

1341
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:29,000
actually check to see if there's gonna be like an iridium flare or something like that and that

1342
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,840
maybe that was a satellite pass maybe not but i've never seen in my personal life

1343
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:39,960
never seen anything weird uh and it's funny you mentioned the fermi paradox and it's like

1344
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:45,400
well where are they and okay well you know if you're sentient life you're certainly going to have

1345
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:50,680
sophisticated cover concealment and deception techniques it goes back to like what Jacques

1346
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:55,640
Vallee's work is where you know the phenomenon presenting itself in different ways but also

1347
01:39:56,600 --> 01:40:01,880
i live in the mountains of colorado right so there is a mountain lion den about 10 miles from my house

1348
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:09,560
in colorado literally um you know i am there are lower predatory sentience i'm higher

1349
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:16,600
predatory sentience and i'm using this as a device or an analogy for nhi and us well

1350
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:20,920
i don't on a day-to-day basis i don't care what a mountain lion is doing

1351
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:30,600
i may hike in that area to explore but day to day i'm afraid of it and i don't care and think

1352
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:36,520
about what humans might be unfortunately to some of these higher sentience where this monkey has

1353
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:42,520
a nuke holy shit keep them in the cage we don't want to go anywhere near them and so people think

1354
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:48,440
that there would be some kind of open contact with some higher sentience that is either visiting

1355
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:54,600
earth or from another dimension or whatever the origin is but they probably don't care

1356
01:40:55,880 --> 01:41:00,200
they're probably neutral at best and maybe actually fearful of us in some sense

1357
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:08,200
or we're the progeny of you know personal opinion progeny of some experiment and the

1358
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:11,960
it's almost like living in the matrix but it's not like an actual simulation it's like we want

1359
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:19,160
the simulation to go we don't want to intercede because we want to see what you know homo sapien

1360
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:24,760
sapien 2.0 is going to do after the great flood or something like that right yeah yeah that's one of

1361
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:31,800
the more fascinating ideas is that we're some sort of a product of genetic engineering i honestly

1362
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:37,480
would not be surprised i don't know that to be true but we're so different than everything else

1363
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:44,040
so different so beyond different i mean there's not another primate that is even reasonably

1364
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:51,000
close i mean if you there's speculation amongst primatologists and there's a

1365
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:57,720
not even speculation they believe that chimpanzees in particular have entered into the stone age

1366
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:03,400
so they're at the beginning of the stone age they're using tools you know and this is obviously

1367
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:09,160
some learned behavior like there's some footage of orangutans using spears to hunt fish with

1368
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:14,520
oh interesting yeah have you ever seen that no i'm not it's cool shit there's an orangutan that's

1369
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:23,720
hanging on a branch over a river or a body of water and stabbing at fish with spear huh which

1370
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:28,120
is incredible i mean they're using tools i mean we know they use tools to extract

1371
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:34,520
um you know termites and the like look at that i mean oh that's crazy how crazy is that i mean

1372
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:44,520
he's clearly hunting i mean he's going fishing in borneo i mean that that is you know at the very

1373
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:52,280
least a distant cousin of us some you know intelligent primate that is to figure out a

1374
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:57,960
way to use tools how long would it take an orangutan to become a human being how many

1375
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:01,960
millions of years are we talking about of evolution but it seems to be that process has started

1376
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:07,160
interesting but why are we so fucking different than yeah like are we a product of darwinian

1377
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:11,240
evolution or what is a punctuated equilibrium is obviously another theory and i'm not a

1378
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:17,160
anthropologist by any means you know i watched some netflix episodes but yeah me too a lot of

1379
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:25,640
youtube but yeah we we seem to be oddly advanced advanced and we seem to just possess other skills

1380
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:31,640
i mean it goes back to like the stargate program right you know with the declassified by clinton

1381
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:37,240
and sensibly cancelled i guess in 96 you know where you had people trained in remote viewing

1382
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:43,240
and and like there was feedback loops to confirm what they saw was real and either satellite

1383
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:47,560
imagery or human sources where they sketched out a room of where there's hostages and

1384
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:52,600
they got a hostage out and they're like and this is a real story actually and they're and they're

1385
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:56,520
like did you have a source in that room how do you know where all the corridors were and everything

1386
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:02,040
i was like no actually uh pat price remote viewed you and he's like what the fuck so

1387
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:07,720
there's something going on there and and that's like uh gary nolan you know has studied a lot of

1388
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:14,440
this stuff very famously he's pointed out the caudate patanum in the brain right this horseshoe

1389
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:19,720
shaped thing in the middle of your brain that if uh he's done mri's and cat scans and i hope i'm

1390
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:27,320
not butchering his work gary might you know slap me later but uh it lights up with people who have

1391
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:33,400
those kind of skills they have like an overactive caudate patanum in the brain and it's like okay

1392
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:38,200
well is it a transceiver of some sort i'm guessing that's the case is it an emerging

1393
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:42,760
property of human beings as we have exactly and we're seeing just a few human beings that have

1394
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:49,400
this stuff and then if if it is a transceiver where's the information is it in a higher

1395
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:57,640
spatial dimension or how are they extracting how are they able to basically be um uh non-locality

1396
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:04,200
right they're able to like project themselves somehow their consciousness to a and this is a

1397
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:10,680
declassified example from stargate a russian missile base sketch the crane and where the

1398
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:16,680
silos are what the status is you know satellite comes over takes a picture and it's exactly the

1399
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:22,280
way they sketched it how did they do that like it's certainly real real because there is a

1400
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:27,320
feedback loop now there's a lot of charlatans in the psychic space and all that but like at

1401
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:32,360
least that government program and i've talked to you know how put off and people who actually ran

1402
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:40,120
that program at sri for the cia then dia in the army and that seems to be the men who's

1403
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:44,760
staring at goats right the george clooney movies the famous movie based on the stargate program

1404
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:51,880
seems to be legit as far as we can measure from a feedback perspective what was the explanation

1405
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:58,360
for the discontinuation of that program oh gosh i'm not a scholar on that that something

1406
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:05,000
russell targ or hal putov or one of those guys could explain if it was just like i got caught

1407
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:13,320
up in the bureaucracy or or what i don't remember yeah yeah so the idea of that being an emergent

1408
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:18,520
property of uh of human beings as we evolve has always been fascinating to me because there's

1409
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:25,960
there's certainly something that goes on with human communication other than we make sounds

1410
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:31,560
that represent objects and physical things and that the other person interprets those sounds

1411
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:37,240
and understands it there's communication between human beings that's oh acoustic communication

1412
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:42,920
like the symbol rate if you will is really slow like if you were able to consciously communicate

1413
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:51,640
aka you know the hokey term like telepathy right and it's funny because that's what a lot of

1414
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:56,840
people espouse that have had you know alleged contacts right a lot of the people that

1415
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:02,280
dr john mack at harvard studied over the years where they felt like they were getting hit with

1416
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:09,560
like a qr code it was like instant knowledge or they heard like somebody speaking to them

1417
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:14,120
non-verbally in some way that they couldn't even conceptualize through you know acoustic

1418
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:20,840
communication or talk if you will and it's the same thing like um book proof of heaven by dr

1419
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:24,840
ebb and alexander md i remember reading it when i was in afghanistan and i was like this is a

1420
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:29,000
crazy experience this medical doctor has necrotizing fatty fasciitis of the brain

1421
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:35,400
is a near-death experience and he gets this like crazy like the feelings of love other stuff it's

1422
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:40,440
a really interesting book it's like a scientific take on a doctor's own near-death experience

1423
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:46,920
but when he came back and somehow the fasciitis didn't eat away his brain and he was cognitively

1424
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:55,880
normal he tried to write down what information or facts of the universe he learned during his nde and

1425
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:00,920
he couldn't even put it in english it was like crazy he didn't know how to translate it

1426
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:06,520
into our language it was just there was no like adjectives if you were adverbs etc

1427
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:13,000
that could describe the knowledge that he knew like natively when he had that near-death experience

1428
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:17,960
it's a really fascinating book um and he talks about the disease he had and his

1429
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:23,000
physiological condition at the time really interesting what was he able to discern from

1430
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,720
that like what was what was the overall message yeah it was like this like the you know there's

1431
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:32,200
the message of love which so that's that's positive but it was like this interconnectedness

1432
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:41,800
everybody is kind of connected in a way that um they don't really realize i mean you think about

1433
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:47,240
this is getting really trippy uh a lot of thoughts with people who are smarter than me i like to talk

1434
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:53,480
to them about this kind of stuff where if you're say you know higher dimensional sentience right

1435
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:58,920
the act of creation so act of creation for 3d beings is having a baby right it's producing

1436
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:04,440
another three-dimensional object well if you're in five-dimensional space or even i guess four

1437
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:10,040
dimensional physical space what if act of creation is creating other conscious realities in other

1438
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:20,680
universes and the act of creation is creating the universe where you me jamie whatever we might be

1439
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:29,400
connected to the same um i'll call it universal consciousness or a higher dimensional sentient

1440
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:34,120
life force or life form i know that sounds like really out there but when you think about it

1441
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:40,520
there's a lot of other theologies out there that basically expels that i have a very good friend

1442
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:46,280
of mine who's a phd level kind of higher up in the mormon church and basically the mormon theology

1443
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:52,760
is kind of like that the mormons say you were once with god or like god but then you were sent

1444
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:57,240
down to like a lower plane of existence and that's literally what i'm talking about right now but just

1445
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:05,160
in a secular sense so maybe uh you're all created beings from and this you know this doesn't like

1446
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:10,120
hurt christian theology whatever it's actually kind of enforcing the fact there's a creator and

1447
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:17,240
we're literally created in the image of a creator literally and that's kind of what life really is

1448
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:24,360
it's like think about it's like a weird 3d plus time temporal sensory experience for a higher

1449
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:31,240
dimensional sentience you're here to experience time in this weird linear fashion and to experience

1450
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:39,800
yourself divorced from yourself to gain knowledge and to report back is maybe what life is and that's

1451
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:46,040
just kind of my own personal theology as a summation of just during covid i was really

1452
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:52,920
bored and then and that's what i was looking at well i yeah i extrapolate that to the creation

1453
01:50:52,920 --> 01:51:00,520
of ai and i think if you think about human beings as something that creates things um i think

1454
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:05,160
ultimately we create a new life exactly what if higher sentience is creating some kind of

1455
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:09,560
artificial intelligence you know call it like a commander data from star trek next gen right

1456
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:15,240
not even really it's made in the image of the creator in some sense but it's not even and

1457
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:22,760
that's what might get sent into these like uh long endurance you know missions and of course you know

1458
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:29,880
people are like well why would they you know come here so far uh to crash etc or are they crashing

1459
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:36,440
on purpose do you know that for a fact or are they crashing by accident and what if they're like um

1460
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:42,600
like von neumann replicating probes right you can google that but you know what if they're just

1461
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:47,240
throw away which von neumann probes are just like throw away spacecraft like yeah they're just

1462
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:52,120
we send it out we don't really care what the mission success is or they're seeding us

1463
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:59,320
or as jock valet says it's like you know here's the key can you unlock the cage kind of thing

1464
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:05,320
right yeah so and it seems that it would be a long i mean if you think about biological evolution

1465
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:13,000
so long lengthy process and if ultimately that led us to the creation of a technology that's far

1466
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:19,640
superior in terms of its capabilities of understanding and thinking that seems to be what's happening

1467
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:23,960
and that's one of the reasons why so many people are concerned about the term artificial

1468
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:29,960
intelligence is a very strange term because it's not artificial it's intelligence it's silicon

1469
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:34,600
based at a carbon base yeah it's just it doesn't have blood and tissue and cells but it has

1470
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:41,160
something that's superior but also something that's much more scalable right we're we have a very

1471
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:45,880
obvious biological limitation in terms of evolution you know if you look at evolution

1472
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:52,120
when we turn back to the orang tans that are fishing they're obviously learning new things

1473
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:57,080
and those new properties from those new things we assume will be encoded in their genetics

1474
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:02,360
and then pass to their children do you have children no i have three dogs we went the fluffy

1475
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:08,680
i'm a fluffy dad the problem is dogs don't learn from what they do but one of the most bizarre

1476
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:16,760
things about children is that they have properties that are clearly uh it's hard to say right um

1477
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:23,240
because my children obviously have the example of my wife myself and they obviously see

1478
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:30,440
a lot of how we live our life and you know uh discipline and hard work and creativity and all

1479
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:38,920
those things but there's also they seem to have gifts that are they seem to be clearly genetic

1480
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:44,520
yeah and uh artistic gifts that just seem extraordinary that are unusual that i had

1481
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:50,200
when i was younger that i was an illustrator i have a young daughter that's just extraordinarily

1482
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:54,840
good at art really used to illustrate yeah yeah that's what i wanted to do i want to be a comic

1483
01:53:54,840 --> 01:54:00,520
book illustrator oh interesting interesting yeah um but then i have this other daughter that's

1484
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:06,360
super gifted athletically like she can learn things really quickly it's extraordinary it's

1485
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:14,040
and it's weird and and also this drive that she has i had a drive from poverty and from you know

1486
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:20,040
a lot of like stuff that was wrong with my childhood that seemed to be i had this need

1487
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:26,120
to prove myself she doesn't have any of those problems but she also has this insane drive

1488
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,280
it's weird it's a weird discipline it's extraordinary that seems to be very different

1489
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:38,600
than most kids and i i just think that's an emerging genetic i think there's something encoded

1490
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:44,520
in whatever you are as a human that as you replicate and as you have children they have

1491
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:53,640
that they have some of that yeah you know and i think that is this process this biological

1492
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:59,160
evolutionary process with humans but it's there's so much chaos there's so much i mean you could

1493
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:04,200
breed with a dumb person you can find a hot dumb person have a baby with them now your kid's

1494
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:08,760
fucked yeah and then we see that this is like this obviously some people are just born with

1495
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:13,400
brains that just don't work that well it's just like i'm sure you've met some dull-minded people

1496
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:19,640
and try to talk to them about things and there's no one there you right so okay good luck and good

1497
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:23,880
luck with whatever children you have and whatever what what what are they gonna have well they weren't

1498
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:28,280
genetically yeah we're genetically encoding artificial intelligence now kind of i think

1499
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:32,040
that's where you were going yeah what i'm going with it like these biological limitations that

1500
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:39,480
we have it's it's very clear that we're essentially dealing with a model t as opposed to a tesla which

1501
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:46,760
is just insanely superior to these ancient vehicles yeah we we create technology i've always said this

1502
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:52,120
if you looked at the human race if you were some sort of an outside observer and you stumbled upon

1503
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:57,320
this this thing that occupies this planet this this apex predator of this planet you would say

1504
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:02,680
what is this thing doing what's making technology all the other things that it does it does all

1505
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:08,440
these other things that also but what do these things generally motivate what do they move

1506
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:15,080
towards they move towards the advancement of technology and innovation that is a constant

1507
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:20,840
aspect of human beings if you trace us back to the earliest civilizations to what we have today

1508
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:25,400
things constantly improve unless something goes horribly wrong unless there's some sort of a

1509
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:32,120
natural disaster or some sort of a you know genocide if something doesn't happen to these

1510
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:38,760
creatures what do they do they consistently make better things well that if you extrapolate if you

1511
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:44,200
follow that to its natural progression well what is that going to get to well once they've invented

1512
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:49,480
computers and once they've invented devices and once they've invented things that enhance their

1513
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:53,240
personal understanding of the world around them which we already have now with phones we already

1514
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:56,360
have with the internet we already have with our ability to communicate with each other we are

1515
01:56:56,360 --> 01:57:03,080
the the newest latest android phones that are coming out will translate natively on your phone

1516
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:08,920
in real time in conversation so you could be speaking portuguese to me i would hear it in

1517
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:14,520
english on a phone call which is fucking wild it's crazy it's like universal translators star trek

1518
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:19,960
literally yes literally literally well that that is a real thing now without having to use google

1519
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:27,960
translate it's native to the latest android operating system you you could autumn if you

1520
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:34,680
just sit down and said well where's that going well it's going to something way more sophisticated

1521
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:41,400
and way more capable than we are biologically with our limitations the our monkey bodies we are the

1522
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:48,440
ancestors or the the the the people that emerged from that distant cousin that orangutan that's

1523
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:54,920
using a stick to hunt fish we're we're going in this direction yeah what would be the most logical

1524
01:57:54,920 --> 01:58:00,760
way we would completely accelerate that we create something that does what we do but does it way

1525
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:05,560
better yeah it's almost like to permanently harbor our consciousness eventually right right and that

1526
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:09,800
kind of makes sense right it does make sense and there's a sort of an understanding of that

1527
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:15,640
that leads to this fear of our demise that everyone you know elon's openly discussed this

1528
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:25,320
sam altman and i were talking about it what open ai is doing what chat gbt4 versus chat gbt5

1529
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:30,680
which is going to be insanely superior well what is chat gbt15 going to do you know is that going

1530
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:36,360
to be the president of the world you know like what are we going to bypass government and just

1531
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:41,320
say you know it's it's obviously like this administration is incredibly corrupt and flawed

1532
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:45,240
and influenced by the military industrial complex it's not good for the world it's not good for the

1533
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:50,360
environment we need something that is far superior that doesn't have all these motivations

1534
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:56,040
what would that be that would be an artificial intelligent creator that we or a creation rather

1535
01:58:56,040 --> 01:59:03,880
that we use to govern life yeah i mean that sounds nuts but i think that's probably a better solution

1536
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:09,480
than humans with all of our fucking flaws and issues and greed and envy and all the things

1537
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:14,680
that we have that that would be a better version of it but what are we saying then are we saying

1538
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:21,160
that we're we're programming like empathy into it though you know probably not probably not which

1539
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:30,040
is terrifying but we will become obsolete and or we will merge and if we merge it will completely

1540
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:35,880
change what we are and i think that's very likely what's going to take place i think the initial

1541
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:42,360
stages will be some sort of a merging with technology and then from that merging it will

1542
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:47,640
essentially we'll realize well why are we even fucking around like this this new thing is so

1543
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:52,840
superior and it doesn't have all the pitfalls it doesn't have all the problems it's not short-sighted

1544
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:58,280
it's not going to drain the ocean of fish so that we we can make sushi it's going to do something

1545
01:59:58,280 --> 02:00:06,920
it's going to be far more far more aware of all of the different effects of each individual act

1546
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:13,160
and how we affect everything around us and what is net positive and what is net negative

1547
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:21,560
and how to avoid all these things i i really firmly believe that we are this biological

1548
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:27,160
caterpillar that is making a cocoon to create the electronic butterfly and we don't even know

1549
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:31,400
what we're doing while we're doing it we're just doing it and i think materialism is also baked

1550
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:36,200
into that one of the main problems with human beings in terms of like the ridiculousness of

1551
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:41,080
our actions we're so materialistic people are constantly wanting to get the newest latest

1552
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:45,640
greatest thing what's the motivation behind that other than social status well the motivation is

1553
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:50,840
that that's what that's what fuels innovation if you do like if we all just stopped right now

1554
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:56,600
and said hey you know what iphone 15 is pretty fucking dope we don't need to make new iphones

1555
02:00:56,600 --> 02:01:02,440
let's just keep fixing those and just like exist the way we are right now and let's clean up the

1556
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:06,840
air let's clean up the ocean let's clean up the sea and clean up the rivers and clean up the

1557
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:11,480
forests like let's just fix the earth yeah and then no we don't do that we know i want iphone

1558
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:15,880
16 you know when when is the iphone going to be able to communicate completely just with satellites

1559
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:19,000
we don't have to worry about cell phones it's almost like a drug addiction right they did

1560
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,440
studies where people receiving in text messages is the dopamine rush too yeah so it's almost like

1561
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:31,240
an artificial drug addiction you're fueling because you want the more responsive tech more

1562
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:37,640
integrating with your make easier so you can get your fix quicker and more efficiently or something

1563
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:42,600
like that i don't know and why yeah well i mean why would fucking staring at a stupid cell phone

1564
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:48,920
give you a dopamine rush well it does it does it does yeah i'm not a biologist and you get addicted

1565
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:54,840
to your goddamn phones and then why would it be that we would innovate and create things like

1566
02:01:54,840 --> 02:02:00,840
instagram and tiktok that are insanely addictive to the point where you look down and you've spent

1567
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:08,520
three hours staring at nothing nonsense like what what why is that well that ensures continual use

1568
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:13,080
of this device until it lures you into this ultimate integration well it's right well they

1569
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:17,400
there's people at meta i guess now or facebook you know where they actually have a whole team

1570
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:25,000
of scientists on how to make their apps more addictive right so demons yeah fucking yeah i

1571
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,560
don't use social media i have never tweeted in my life really that's amazing i mean i have like

1572
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:34,600
i used facebook back in the day when it first first came out when i was going to college

1573
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:42,520
yeah i don't have instagram i've never tweeted in my life i don't intend to because you don't

1574
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:48,040
want to get sucked into that mind virus which is like people responding you and you have to feel

1575
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:52,920
like you have to respond back i don't even yeah i don't even touch it well i'm very aware of those

1576
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:58,120
traps so i don't i don't do that yeah i don't i used to but many years ago i stopped interacting

1577
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:03,800
with people because i just realized like overall it's negative yeah like there's positive aspects

1578
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:07,960
to it it's great for people that like you and their fans it's great too that you're an actual

1579
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:12,520
human that you interact occasionally a comment on a post like that's really awesome congratulations

1580
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:17,000
that kind of stuff then i get the fuck out of there and i don't read any responses and i found

1581
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:23,000
that that's the very best way to mitigate all the negative aspects of social media but then you're

1582
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:28,760
also dealing with algorithms you're dealing with things that recognize what makes you more likely

1583
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:33,720
to engage and so those things are constantly showing you the things that you engage and

1584
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:38,200
you know it's not necessarily even positive it's just it's just whatever you engage with

1585
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:42,200
what's coming your way whether it could be cool stuff like maybe you're just like really into

1586
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:47,000
muscle cars and shows you a lot of muscle cars or it could be like murder like i see a lot of

1587
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:53,640
murder on instagram yeah fucking crazy yeah i'm a car guy so like my feed is like oh do you ever

1588
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:58,360
think about this mod for your ford bronco oh those lights look nice i'm gonna wire that shit up next

1589
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:03,400
week you know so yeah i get those too yeah it's bad yeah i have a problem with that i have a car

1590
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:09,000
problem yeah my wife doesn't allow me to have the good stuff anymore so i have to you know keep it

1591
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,200
under a certain price that's good that's good i i'm more actually interested in old stuff than

1592
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:18,920
i am in new stuff you like uh like rat rod stuff right well i like muscle cars like this very

1593
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:24,920
specifically 1960s muscle cars those are my favorite because what they are to me is it's a

1594
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:31,320
toy that you could drive yeah it's like a ride that gives me immense pleasure to just drive around

1595
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:38,120
and it's really fun i don't even have to go fast it's just going around in a 1970 cheval just

1596
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:43,320
driving it it just it's hard to describe for someone who has never experienced it but it's

1597
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:52,680
just uh it's just so engaging and it's like you're on this drug yeah it's like everything

1598
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:59,320
you feel all of it and you're engaging all of these senses yeah very tactile very mechanical

1599
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:02,920
i under yeah i totally understand that i mean the only kind of old cars i like are like uh

1600
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:08,360
black lincoln lincoln continental suicide doors from the matrix i remember seeing that when i

1601
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:13,080
was a teen when the matrix came out i'm like that car is badass yeah it's like totally i want like

1602
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:19,080
have whatever morpheus drove there are yeah they're essentially art it's it's it's functional art

1603
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:23,880
like you could it's a piece of art that you could actually drive around it yeah and it gives you

1604
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:31,720
this very bizarre sensation but the point is like that's not most people most people want the newest

1605
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:37,640
latest greatest thing and this there's a motivation to get the newest latest greatest thing that i

1606
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:45,000
think if you just follow that up to its logical conclusion it's going to create life it's going

1607
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:50,440
to create i mean how many films have been made about this you know x machina and all these

1608
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:55,880
different films that's right yeah that's what we're gonna do we're gonna i mean there's no way

1609
02:05:55,880 --> 02:06:01,960
we're not gonna do that it's it's if if i had a bet on one thing if the human race doesn't get

1610
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:07,720
wiped out by a media or a nuclear war we're gonna fucking do that we're gonna make a life form

1611
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:14,120
100 and it's going to be almost instantaneously able to figure out all the flaws in its own

1612
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:18,200
personal programming and make a much better version of itself if it if it's sentient if it

1613
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:21,800
has the ability to make decisions well i think we're close i mean i think i saw some stuff there's

1614
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:26,600
like a open ai fiasco going on right now and there's rumor that they might have cracked

1615
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:31,320
artificial general intelligence right a gi and that's oh jeez that's frightening i mean

1616
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:35,560
it was like was it sam altman i think we're talking about i think there's like a the board

1617
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:40,040
of open ai there's some shuffle i was just they just removed when i woke up this morning yeah

1618
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:45,080
well they removed him but then apparently the shareholders like what the fuck are you doing

1619
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:50,920
and there was so much outrage that they're trying to bring him back like instantly so but but elon

1620
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:55,240
had a very good point like what was the motivation behind that and when you think about the

1621
02:06:55,240 --> 02:07:01,080
implications for humanity as a whole because this is such an emerging technology that's so

1622
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:07,880
overwhelmingly powerful what happened like what's going on like i think this is one of those things

1623
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:12,040
where like we need to know like what was the motivation behind your decision and if it was

1624
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:18,280
that he was holding back information about the actual creation of artificial general

1625
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:23,720
intelligence that it's already it's already happened and that he's like hesitant because

1626
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:28,680
he's a little cagey in how he talks about stuff when i was talking to him about you could tell

1627
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:36,760
it's like a little bit like he kind of knows yeah that he is at the forefront of this technology

1628
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:46,840
that worst case scenario replaces us yeah and you know going back to is a program with any kind of

1629
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:51,480
empathy etc depending on if it handles critical i guess the thing i saw in the government because

1630
02:07:51,480 --> 02:08:01,000
i did a lot of cyber stuff in my career is as ai gets more advanced you you know you create say

1631
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:08,440
offensive cyber tools that literally have a mind of their own and if say theoretically you release

1632
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:13,720
that on some target and you might not be able to touch that target again say it's a one-time

1633
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:19,400
whoop you put it in there well how do you control it's almost like skynet and the terminator hate

1634
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:24,360
to use that analogy but like that was my fear when i was working at certain agencies working

1635
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:30,200
on offensive cyber tools i'm like oh my god this is not good and then of course with cyber right

1636
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:37,080
it's the attribution actor attribution is the biggest thing how do you know it was you know

1637
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:42,440
hypothetically russia that used the cyber weapon to attack you it could have been another actor

1638
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:48,920
masquerading as that foreign power using tactics techniques procedures ip proxy operations to

1639
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:56,200
hide where it was coming from right so it's like you have uh non-kinetic fires that can

1640
02:08:56,200 --> 02:09:00,920
potentially create mutually assured destruction because you could take out critical infrastructure

1641
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:10,600
blow up the power grid etc no radiation but potentially no attribution or can you know

1642
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:14,440
confuse the attribution such that you don't even know who to go to war with it's like really scary

1643
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:19,400
so it is scary yeah that's just my own it's already happening with social media yeah i mean

1644
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:25,160
think about how many troll farms there are on social media that are just stirring up discontinue

1645
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:31,880
i mean it's an active program that we know that russia uses that is trying to undermine democracy

1646
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:35,800
and try to keep people fighting with each other and it's been very effective and if you look at

1647
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:40,520
social media it's just fucking chaos it's just people yelling at you particularly twitter or x

1648
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:45,960
you know that's and facebook it's like a lot of what's going on one of the studies showed that

1649
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:51,800
out of the top 20 christian sites that are on facebook 19 of them are run by russian troll farms

1650
02:09:52,360 --> 02:10:01,480
so if we know that that on a like relatively rudimentary scare scale if you look at the

1651
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:05,800
impact of social media versus the impact of artificial intelligence they're already doing

1652
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:11,800
that they're already hiding who's responsible and what's the what's the goal and how to manipulate

1653
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:17,080
consciousness and how to manipulate uh influence and how people think about things and what what

1654
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:25,160
the public opinion on things are it's already very effective um you would imagine that a creation of

1655
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:31,640
artificial intelligence would radically accelerate that 100 then i remember the deep fake stuff was

1656
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:36,760
a real problem for my old community because we're like holy shit you could really fake some stuff

1657
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:41,400
and you got to develop algorithms to make sure you can analyze oh hey that that is fake because

1658
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:46,040
you've seen some of the deep fakes where it's like obama or arnold schwarzenegger yes you know the

1659
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:52,440
tom cruise guy holy shit that is crazy like you're going to be able to bring actors from the dead back

1660
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:57,240
at this point you're going to have like carrie grant uh you know doing a musical or whatever

1661
02:10:57,800 --> 02:11:04,040
whatever you know well bruce willis who has uh some sort of degenerate degenerative neurological

1662
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:10,120
condition sold his likeness for the ability to make commercials and all sorts of other things

1663
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:18,920
like he's essentially saying he's fading unfortunately and now he will give this thing

1664
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:24,440
which is this property which is bruce willis this famous person and they will be able to create

1665
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:30,920
versions of him starring in films oh and certainly if you train an ai model just like chat gpt

1666
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:35,880
you could actually get almost like what they would normally say what their knowledge 100

1667
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:39,880
and it's almost like uh having a permanent historian too you could like you know if you

1668
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:45,400
want to talk to clenice wood about his films in the 60s after clenice wood you know passes you

1669
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:50,440
know may live forever but like that would be it'd be crazy i mean really interesting but i mean he

1670
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:55,000
might actually be able to give you advice he might be your personal advisor i know that'd be cool i

1671
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:59,080
mean that's probably one of the things that's going to come out of this but when we think about

1672
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:06,920
empathy we we also think about just human beings and the way we communicate and interact with each

1673
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:12,360
other empathy is very important and also compassion and forgiveness all these things are very

1674
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:18,040
important qualities because we recognize that we're very flawed but when you create something

1675
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:24,200
that is not flawed yeah then the need for empathy the need for all these things that we attach to

1676
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:29,080
human emotions and human reward systems they will they'll no longer be a significant issue

1677
02:12:29,080 --> 02:12:32,680
because you're going to be dealing with something that operates on a higher plane

1678
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:39,000
it might be the answer to all that ails us which is so terrifying for us because we recognize that

1679
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:46,840
what we derive the joy that we derive from love from companionship from friendship from community

1680
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:53,480
it's like a key component to life on earth for us but it's also because we recognize that without

1681
02:12:53,480 --> 02:12:59,000
that we are the mongols without that we're nazi germany without that you know we're hamas we're

1682
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:05,400
whatever the fuck we are that's that we recognize as being like evil or dangerous or horrible

1683
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:11,160
about humans that when we think about the worst case scenario for human beings we always think

1684
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:16,520
about things like the holocaust we think about what is the worst the worst acts that human beings

1685
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:22,200
are capable of with our current programming and our biological flaws like what are the worst things

1686
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:28,280
we can do to terrible awful things well if we don't have those problems if we no longer have

1687
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:34,040
envy we no longer have greed we no longer have evil we don't have any of those properties they

1688
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:41,480
don't they don't exist anymore we just have this new form of consciousness that's far superior

1689
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:47,240
that's an interesting parallel because you have you know you're no longer maybe apex sentience

1690
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:51,960
if you have artificial intelligence you know governing certain things right and i think

1691
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:59,640
that's also kind of this psychological issue with this uap issue where we might not be the apex

1692
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:06,920
predator we have we may be that mountain lion and yes and we're going to have to be comfortable

1693
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:12,520
knowing that we're going to be vulnerable there's people far superior that may have malevolent

1694
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:19,320
intentions maybe not i don't know and almost be humbled the fact that like sorry we're not the

1695
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:24,280
smartest of god's creation and yeah and that might be really hard for a lot of people to process and

1696
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:30,600
i think that's probably certainly i would imagine one of the deliberations they must have done years

1697
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:35,480
ago we're like oh we can't disclose because you know people are not going to feel comfortable

1698
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:42,040
in that world view 100 percent and they're not and then i wonder if these things that we're

1699
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:49,080
experiencing are the natural progression of what happens when you do seed life on planet or you do

1700
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:56,040
accelerate biological life you do have some sort of a genetic intervention where you take this thing

1701
02:14:56,040 --> 02:15:02,600
that it has emerging intelligence and you accelerate it and that that thing will in turn with all of

1702
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:09,560
its desire for innovation and creativity and also all of its desire to control resources and

1703
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:17,000
and have power and have influence that it will eventually lead to the creation of what we're

1704
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:24,760
seeing that these things are the next stage of this process and that maybe we're dealing with

1705
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:29,880
one form of that next stage but there's another stage that's a million years more advanced than

1706
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:36,440
that that's far superior that doesn't even have a biological limitation in terms of physical space

1707
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:43,480
that it exists completely in some other undetectable realm yeah that is not no longer

1708
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:49,400
no longer thinks about biological limitations of life and death and and communication it exists

1709
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:55,960
completely in some other space that that's what these things are and then i always wonder when

1710
02:15:56,040 --> 02:16:00,440
there's a crash or when there's a body or when there's a this and that like and people saying

1711
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:06,760
well what if they're so advanced why are they crashing well hold on what what which which

1712
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:11,560
version are we looking at we're not saying there's one thing that's visiting us if there's one thing

1713
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:15,640
that's visiting us and we know where this one thing is we could say oh well that thing it deals

1714
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:19,640
with a completely different solar system that's not as vulnerable it doesn't have asteroid clouds

1715
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:23,720
it doesn't have all these different things where it's like it doesn't have a planet that has super

1716
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:29,400
volcanoes maybe life evolved in a more stable environment and it allowed it to get to a far

1717
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:36,840
greater technological level but not the ultimate yeah we might be testing the extent of their

1718
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:43,240
adaptability and like i said are they crashing by accident right mission failure or on purpose

1719
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:49,800
right so and then of course with the far distances and everything i mean if they're traveling here

1720
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:56,040
through some kind of space time metric engineering construct you know the distances are not as vast

1721
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:59,880
as you think right it could be going through some kind of you know traversable wormhole or

1722
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:03,880
something like that where it's like a walk down the street for them it's not you know a thousand

1723
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:09,160
light years well just think about communication just our communication used to be you had to get

1724
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:13,480
in front of someone and they had to talk to them so you had to know their language you had to

1725
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:18,360
either non-verbal or verbal communication you had to figure out a way to say things to them yeah

1726
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:23,000
that's no longer the case obviously with this new android operating system it translates but

1727
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:29,400
also the fact that you could have a fucking face time call with someone in japan right now

1728
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:35,160
and you instantaneously can communicate back and forth which is insane that's a vast distance but

1729
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:41,560
for us it's like stupid it's like yeah easy vast distance and we're tunneling yeah yeah i mean uh

1730
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:47,560
i was just in scotland and i was facetiming my daughter back home yeah fucking crazy you're

1731
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:52,680
nine hours by plane and you're having instantaneous communication which is wild

1732
02:17:52,680 --> 02:18:02,440
shit but that's just that's fucking that that's like pong you know that's uh that's morse code

1733
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:08,120
that's like it's very primitive in terms of what if you physically can be in these places

1734
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:13,720
instantaneous yeah and why why would we assume that that's not eventually going to be on the menu

1735
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:19,640
yeah it's just like the conventional propulsion stuff we're not using an ilama starship to get

1736
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:23,800
here it's like they're doing something else we talked to someone from the 1800s and he said

1737
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:28,760
you're going to go to nevada jesus christ you know how far that is on a wagon you know that's months

1738
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:35,000
man right no you fly to vegas it's two hours yeah it's fucking easy you know like we know that now

1739
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:41,480
so why would we assume that there's a limitation to that advancement i don't think yeah and of

1740
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:48,120
course a friend of mine eric weinstein certainly exposes we don't even have the right theoretical

1741
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:52,920
frameworks right now he's you know he get he he has his own geometric unity theory and yeah he's

1742
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:58,600
way smarter than he's too smart but uh he's confusing yeah he starts talking to you like

1743
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:03,480
i so funny if he calls me i'm like you got to call me in the morning after my 24 ounce monster

1744
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:09,720
energy drink or or i can't even keep up man it's like uh so yeah he's he's on another level he has

1745
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:16,040
he's got some unique theories himself about where all this stuff is coming from and uh it's it's all

1746
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:23,400
very very very interesting and intriguing but also makes sense all of it makes sense including

1747
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:27,160
being visited you know i had this conversation with neil degrasse tyson like why would they be

1748
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:31,720
interested in us i'm like what the fuck are you talking we're super interested yeah neil i mean

1749
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:36,680
obviously he's a fine science communicator kind of the success and of successor of kind of the

1750
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:42,600
uh carl sagan kind of i think carl sagan was a little bit more open-minded yeah i like carl

1751
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:47,640
better yeah i'm more of a fan yeah i wish he was still alive i'd love to smoke weed with that guy

1752
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:52,760
he was really into weed oh really yeah really really into it i remember my my aunt gave me

1753
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:56,920
cosmos by carl sagan when i was in middle school and it was that book was from the 80s but that

1754
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:02,920
book tripped me out yeah and i was like i want to study science and i read it was brief history of

1755
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:07,720
time by steven hawking and i read those two books when i was like in eighth grade and i was like

1756
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:13,960
this is trippy i want to study astronomy this is insane but i ultimately use kind of my technical

1757
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:19,560
background to be a spook you know for the government but i still observe i have a big

1758
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:25,880
telescope and i live like super dark skies in colorado and i still have that boyhood fascination

1759
02:20:25,880 --> 02:20:32,120
of the cosmos now ironically i found out something else that kind of confirms that the cosmos is

1760
02:20:33,480 --> 02:20:38,600
not lifeless and you know god paints with a broad brush as like the vatican has expoused a couple

1761
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:43,640
years ago when they said this is okay with their theology i have a theory that the universe itself

1762
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:50,120
is god i think that's like what i was talking about with the you know multi-dimensional creator

1763
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:55,880
creating universes yeah i think we have a very limited idea of when we say god when god created

1764
02:20:55,880 --> 02:21:01,240
the heavens and they're like right right but what is what are we saying i think it's the universe

1765
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:10,280
itself i think it's one thing and that this one thing it seeks to create these things that

1766
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:16,680
continually push the envelope and maybe gods themselves eventually i think if you extrapolate

1767
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:23,000
from our ability versus the ability of an amoeba and you continue to move that along what does that

1768
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:28,600
do well it's going to be able to create universes there's already been like theoretical papers that

1769
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:35,800
have been written about the creation of other things like black holes other things like a

1770
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:40,440
universe so the like what what is involved in the creation of a universe what is involved in the

1771
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:50,520
big bang can that be replicated well not now but if ai becomes sentient and ai eventually makes

1772
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:56,360
far greater versions of itself if it keeps doing that like what what what are the limits of its

1773
02:21:56,360 --> 02:22:02,200
potential create creates the matrix literally literally literally creates a simulated environment

1774
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:07,080
that's in detect indiscernible you you can't tell the difference between that and regular life

1775
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:12,600
well maybe because there is no difference maybe that is what i mean that's the theory of simulation

1776
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:18,360
theater yeah simulation theory yeah familiar and that that is a possibility because uh the universe

1777
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:25,320
seems like a little too perfect it's a little strange very created to me so just like we're in

1778
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:31,800
the goldilocks zone right perfect temperature like it's just real how about the big bang itself

1779
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:39,640
yeah what what happened something smaller than the head of a pin for for no known reason becomes

1780
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:44,920
everything yeah okay and what's the universe expanding into right it's like a quantum foam

1781
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:50,680
or whatever the heck the latest theory is that's like beyond me and then it perhaps just retracts

1782
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:56,360
back down to that infinitely small thing and then expands again yeah and that this is an endless

1783
02:22:56,360 --> 02:23:01,800
cycle and that we're just so limited because of our biological limitations or our life and death

1784
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:10,520
is such a small little tiny blip it's so minuscule in terms of just the overall known life of the

1785
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:15,960
universe and then you have the james webb telescope that's you know there's people that question the

1786
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:22,440
actual length of time that occurred between the big bang and now that maybe it might be far longer

1787
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:25,720
and there's people like brian keating they say that's not that's not correct it's just a

1788
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:32,280
a lack of understanding of what we understand currently about the creation of galaxies yeah

1789
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:35,960
because i mean obviously the length of the age of the universe keeps on getting older and older and

1790
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:40,920
a lot of that's because of the the doppler fit doppler shift right the red shift as the galaxies

1791
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:47,880
are accelerating away you know we can calculate what the what their origin point probably was

1792
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:52,440
and how long it took for them to speed up like that right so it only based on our current

1793
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:58,440
understanding yes which is obviously at least fairly limited in terms of what its potential is

1794
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:03,080
well yeah like we still don't quite understand the origin of the moon the moon is at the right

1795
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:10,040
location that causes solar and lunar eclipses it's like the right apparent size to block out the sun

1796
02:24:10,040 --> 02:24:15,800
it's like super weird same thing with like mars we're not sure like what happened near where mars

1797
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:21,880
you know had some probable life on it either a proto planet hit it or there was some kind of

1798
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:28,760
impact that vaporized stuff and like who knows yeah who knows and this is just this little tiny

1799
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:34,760
neighborhood that we're looking at it's like we are in our backyard looking for evidence of like

1800
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:40,280
life in africa you know i mean like you're not going to figure it out here there's so there's

1801
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:46,680
just we're just looking at it such a small scale in terms of what we could potentially discover or

1802
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:54,440
potentially observe yeah yeah i i often wonder you know when we're seeing especially with the idea of

1803
02:24:54,440 --> 02:25:01,800
uaps ufo crafts if we're seeing a version of what we will become or something like us becomes if

1804
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:08,040
given enough time well that that is i mean there's like a dr mike masters at montana state he

1805
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:13,720
literally postulates you know he says time travelers we could debate time travel but

1806
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:18,760
like he thinks it might be like a advanced form of homo sapien is what we're seeing coming back

1807
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:23,320
yeah like a breakaway civilization or coming back to see an older version of ourselves that was left

1808
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:28,040
on earth or something like well the way we would visit like north sentinel island and and visit

1809
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:33,000
those people that are trapped on that island that are yeah uncontacted yeah yeah exactly and

1810
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:37,560
then a lot of uh you know there's also like cargo cult religions and stuff you know the

1811
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:44,280
south pacific and world war ii they worshiped the p51 and stuff like they thought those were ufos

1812
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:49,000
but really they were just us you know yeah and i think we were probably alien to them i mean oh

1813
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:55,320
yeah i mean just look at how cortez looked uh to the the people that you know had no idea that

1814
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:59,880
people could ride horses like what the fuck is going on these guys are riding horses yeah like

1815
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:05,720
these are gods these white guys coming in what the heck they come on a ship in the ocean and

1816
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:12,120
they ride horses yeah yeah exactly yeah it's it's all based on our limited understanding and

1817
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:18,120
for someone whether it's the federal government or whether it's military contractors for someone

1818
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:25,240
to have key elements that could give us a better understanding of this whole picture

1819
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:35,720
it's it's really inexcusable to not relay that to all of humanity so this is too much information

1820
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:45,000
to be secret it's too important if it is real it's too important for someone to have access to

1821
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:50,040
just because they have power and money and influence yeah it seems insane i mean that's

1822
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:56,360
the whole primer for what i did i mean it's uh i i you know i think i'm a pretty more unethical

1823
02:26:56,360 --> 02:27:00,280
person i just could not live with myself if i didn't try to like make a difference even though

1824
02:27:00,280 --> 02:27:06,040
it was very uncomfortable personal privacy and you know professional and personal health was at

1825
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:11,400
risk you know so it also seems like the public understanding and appreciation of these things

1826
02:27:11,480 --> 02:27:16,680
particularly after the 2017 article in the new york times has changed there's been a shift

1827
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:21,800
whereas before if you would talk about ufos or the idea of extraterrestrial life you are

1828
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:26,520
automatically lumped into this group of people that believes in bigfoot you know it's like you're in

1829
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:30,920
you're in the Loch Ness monster you're kind of a loon who likes fringe things because

1830
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:34,440
probably got problems in your own life you're not addressing and so you're distracted it's like

1831
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:39,400
a gambler or something like that you're just like distracting yourself with this craziness

1832
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:44,520
in order to ignore the the reality of existence itself which is so complicated and difficult to

1833
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:53,320
manage and then i think that if we had a better understanding of the the overall scale of the

1834
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:59,800
potential of life in the universe based on what we know like physical evidence undeniable physical

1835
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:07,960
evidence that shows us that we're not alone that would be a massive change in just the overall

1836
02:28:07,960 --> 02:28:14,440
shift of consciousness on earth if we could understand that these territorial disputes

1837
02:28:14,440 --> 02:28:20,440
that we have which are almost always over resources or over land or over religions and

1838
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:27,640
ideologies if we could understand that these are nonsense in the vast scope of the universe itself

1839
02:28:27,640 --> 02:28:34,040
and this is the uh the what's that effect that the people that get into the space station have

1840
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:41,320
oh the uh overview effect yes the William Shatner had that when he went up in the uh blue origin

1841
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:45,960
yeah i'm sure i'm sure everybody has it i mean i'm sure it's just like you go like oh my god like

1842
02:28:45,960 --> 02:28:51,240
what are we doing like this is one and that's how i felt i mean like after i found all this stuff i

1843
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:55,640
could have continued my career you know made lieutenant colonel here this winter made senior

1844
02:28:55,640 --> 02:29:00,280
executive service in a year or two did national security stuff but i'm like sitting in my office

1845
02:29:00,920 --> 02:29:08,280
and i'm like there's better things for me to care about than russian troop movements like

1846
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:14,680
we're not alone right this is insane like i i have to like blow the whistle on this is insane

1847
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:21,320
because certainly the people who we talked to are not lying and the documents i meticulously went

1848
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:26,120
through they were not forgeries they were not deception material so it's just like i have to

1849
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:30,760
do something i'm sure you've seen those uh freedom of information act disclosure

1850
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:37,640
papers from the cia from god it was like the 1950s where they're detailing all the various forms of

1851
02:29:37,640 --> 02:29:45,080
life and that that we know are currently that currently exist and you remember that jamie we

1852
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:51,960
pulled up that document do you think you can find it jamie will find it but it's like 1950 something

1853
02:29:51,960 --> 02:29:55,240
where they were discussing these things interesting yeah i'm not sure which ones you're talking about

1854
02:29:55,240 --> 02:30:00,520
i'd have to see them so it's pretty weird stuff because like if they knew about this in the 1950s

1855
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:05,560
like how do they know well there was like cia docs about consciousness and like weird remote

1856
02:30:05,560 --> 02:30:11,640
viewing stuff i mean besides the stargate program uh that were released in the foya reading room on

1857
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:16,360
cia's website too that are pretty trippy we're like wow cia is looking into some really interesting

1858
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:22,360
stuff i mean they're a hardcore intel agency uh what's going on there but it makes sense that

1859
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:27,320
they would kind of have to find out if that's bullshit or not like you can't ignore that if

1860
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:32,200
you're really doing your job if your job is intelligence like okay like let's look at this

1861
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:37,640
it's an aspect of the phenomenon because it's like a reach out from the crash retrieval program

1862
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:41,960
like hey i need you to look into some weird stuff because it might be the key unlock for

1863
02:30:41,960 --> 02:30:49,400
something that we got in a warehouse you know so whoa yeah yeah so as it stands right now

1864
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:56,200
what what's the future for this stuff what's the future for these disclosures and and what yeah

1865
02:30:56,200 --> 02:31:00,920
what are the bottlenecks well i mean certainly from the governmental process you know as long

1866
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:05,720
as the house doesn't kill the schumer amendment and i'm you know that's why i'm discussing it here

1867
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:10,920
with you because if they they don't pass it it's going to be the greatest setback to humankind

1868
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:18,680
in u.s history literally that so the presidential panel gets and paneled about 90 days or so after

1869
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:25,800
the passage of the bill so by by christmas as long as it doesn't get killed will be in the national

1870
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:34,520
defense authorization act panel will be formed um say february march then they have a 300 day

1871
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:40,440
process to develop a initial plan for the president and i don't know if uh chuck schumer

1872
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:46,120
and his staff are being kind of as crafty or whatever but the 300 days if you actually do it

1873
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:52,280
out it's like the election so so i don't know if they want to make it an election issue which

1874
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:56,200
certainly if this act doesn't pass i think it needs to be an election issue because the senior

1875
02:31:56,200 --> 02:32:00,840
executive needs to rule on this if congress can't get their shit together to be quite honest

1876
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:08,120
and we have a plan out the 2030 where this stuff starts getting rolled out knock on wood perfect

1877
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:14,440
storm things could get delayed but then in parallel and that's kind of why i helped found

1878
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:19,480
the soul foundation with gary nolan and dr peter scafe who's an anthropologist uh as well

1879
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:25,400
is we wanted to figure out the stem outreach we wanted to figure out the public policy national

1880
02:32:25,400 --> 02:32:31,800
policy to advise the u.s and its allies on this issue you know and we're happy like i said i'm

1881
02:32:31,800 --> 02:32:36,520
not here to slap the government in its entirety and admonish everybody like i think there needs

1882
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:41,000
to be a truth and reconciliation process but i think our foundation we want to be like okay well

1883
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:47,240
bring us in as a think tank if you know based on my experience and experience of my colleagues

1884
02:32:47,240 --> 02:32:53,320
like you have an issue with x well let's figure out how to rule this out and how to you know

1885
02:32:53,320 --> 02:32:58,120
incentivize the national science foundation to look in this make this like you know it's dual

1886
02:32:58,120 --> 02:33:07,240
use right you might um develop a unique uh scientific uh process that actually works well

1887
02:33:07,240 --> 02:33:13,560
with nanobiology or something like that but also has dual use with uap so there's parallel tracks

1888
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:17,720
i mean there's public discovery there's like the galileo project with avi lobe right that they're

1889
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:24,440
trying to uh on their own collect techno signatures which is i applaud that i mean obviously the

1890
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:29,480
government knows a lot about that but we don't want to obviously rely on the u.s government to

1891
02:33:29,480 --> 02:33:36,120
do all the work for us and also to be honest so i think having a parallel track and you know

1892
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:42,440
galileo project soul foundation ryan graves has his own foundation as well for pilots and people

1893
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:48,120
who've seen unique things to provide that data to people so i think you got to have those dual

1894
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:53,320
tracks and you know hopefully we can create a tsunami event where the u.s government its allies

1895
02:33:53,320 --> 02:33:59,800
and maybe the our adversaries but really if the u.s government doesn't get their house in order

1896
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:05,480
here i mean you could have a uncontrolled disclosure events such that either maybe the

1897
02:34:05,480 --> 02:34:12,280
non-human intelligence is like yeah let's do it or what if one of our adversaries decides to

1898
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:18,440
disclose and they become the messiah figure on this and we lose sovereignty or national supremacy

1899
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:24,920
and then that regard from an open and honest civil society perspective so i but i think the

1900
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:30,840
governments were getting close i think as long as closer than we've ever been before yeah just the

1901
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:37,880
fact that they brought you in to have these conversations yeah no i'm i'm still advising

1902
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:43,880
the u.s government on this and and and i'm trying to carefully message this put all the broad

1903
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:49,160
things on the table and i'm not trying to be coy i'm not trying to be conceal anything but it's

1904
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:55,320
like there's real national security and collateral damage with just releasing this willy nilly and

1905
02:34:55,320 --> 02:35:00,040
i'm just trying to get the government to get a plan together here and and just be open and

1906
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:04,920
honest with the people of the world really so and there's still the bottleneck with these military

1907
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:10,680
contractors that allegedly have access to these things yeah and like to to those guys and i know

1908
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:17,400
some of them and the individuals that hold the keys like this is a boon like this is don't look

1909
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:23,800
at it like um you're going to lose money you this is a recruiting opportunity yes you're going to

1910
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:28,520
have to let other people in the cookie jar that's how a fair and free society works and they should

1911
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:33,480
be able to compete for work and because that was one of the main i talked to some individuals that

1912
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:37,560
were in an informal session for a previous administration on should we disclose or not

1913
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:43,480
for a certain former president and really insightful what they told me and one of the biggest

1914
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:49,080
impasses to disclosure wasn't the ontological shock from a socioeconomic or theological

1915
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:54,440
perspective it was well there's some white collar crime we violated the federal acquisition

1916
02:35:54,440 --> 02:36:00,760
regulations we sole source this work to some big companies for decades contractors are going to

1917
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:05,640
litigate this to the supreme court saying they lost billions of projected income because they

1918
02:36:05,640 --> 02:36:12,120
didn't get the bid on the work and it's going to be this like liability disaster for the u.s

1919
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:16,680
government and the problem with that is is like i understand that but like that's why you need

1920
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:21,400
to have a truth and reconciliation process it's almost like uh the truth and reconciliation

1921
02:36:21,400 --> 02:36:27,240
commission and post-apartheid south africa where people who committed like murder came in and was

1922
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:32,120
like this is what happened here you go and you know they don't get convicted of those crimes and

1923
02:36:32,120 --> 02:36:35,880
i'm not saying i mean people who've committed murder as it relates to the subject okay we should

1924
02:36:35,880 --> 02:36:41,000
probably hold them accountable but for some of this stuff there needs to be a process where we

1925
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:46,520
kind of mitigate some of those unfortunate legal issues but that was one of the main

1926
02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:54,520
issues a certain group for a reasonably recent administration came up with and advised that

1927
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:59,400
president hey look there's going to be a lot of supreme court stuff let's not be that makes me

1928
02:36:59,400 --> 02:37:06,040
that guy so it's like the like that's the barrier that's the reason come on well it's so ridiculous

1929
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:10,040
it makes sense though that they would think that way because i do believe that lawsuits would

1930
02:37:10,040 --> 02:37:15,480
emerge from something like that oh certainly and it's and also it's like the government admitting

1931
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:21,240
that we can't protect its citizenry you know uh you know these non-human intelligences you know

1932
02:37:21,240 --> 02:37:25,080
want to do something to you sorry we don't have any countermeasures to that you know it's like this

1933
02:37:25,080 --> 02:37:29,400
you know there's a social contract between the citizens and the government right we can protect

1934
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:35,080
you etc and like in this case it's like it's an enigma but i think this is almost like uh you

1935
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:39,720
remember like after 9-eleven i was in high school and 9-eleven happened and you know people were

1936
02:37:39,720 --> 02:37:44,120
afraid of dirty bombs terrorists we didn't we didn't know what was going to happen next we lived

1937
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:50,360
in fear but like you know we banded together in the presence of fear and apprehension and

1938
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:55,240
unknowing what the world was going to be and we made made it through it now i mean that's a

1939
02:37:55,240 --> 02:38:01,080
coarse analogy to this but i uh people just have to think in that mindset like it's going to be a

1940
02:38:01,080 --> 02:38:05,560
little scary it's not going to be like kumbaya let's let's uh move the shit to the masonian and

1941
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:12,120
check it out it's going to be this you know awkward and uh things we're going to have to address

1942
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:19,640
sociologically i guess are you optimistic about how all this lays out i am i mean it's kind of

1943
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:26,360
like when i was testifying in the public hearing oddly bipartisan in a good way i had aoc and matt

1944
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:30,760
gates like agreeing on something and they were like smiling at each other that's crazy this is

1945
02:38:30,760 --> 02:38:35,400
crazy you know i'm like look at there's aoc there's matt gates there's timber shat i mean

1946
02:38:35,400 --> 02:38:39,560
there's like people uh garcia like people that wouldn't see eye to eye on most subjects such a

1947
02:38:39,560 --> 02:38:44,760
human issue because they they want to know the truth too and i don't think the the leaders in

1948
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:50,120
congress want to be told that they're second-class citizens i mean a lot of presidents weren't briefed

1949
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:54,600
to everything some presidents knew a lot more than others and i have a pretty good beat on that

1950
02:38:55,560 --> 02:39:01,720
and it's like wait the chief executive that also forms foreign policy you don't tell them about a

1951
02:39:01,720 --> 02:39:07,720
ostensibly a foreign element so how do they as chief of state how do they form foreign policy

1952
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:12,360
when you don't fully brief them on a foreign elements like classifying the existence of russia

1953
02:39:13,240 --> 02:39:19,560
right right so you're actually you know non-constitutional by not allowing our

1954
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:26,760
commander in chief all information sometimes you know and i don't know what harry reid talked to

1955
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:32,040
joe biden i mean it was certainly the substance that i mentioned here uh and i i hope that joe

1956
