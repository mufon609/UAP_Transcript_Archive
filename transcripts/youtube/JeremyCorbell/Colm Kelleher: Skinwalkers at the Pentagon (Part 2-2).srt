00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hello everybody, welcome to the second part of my conversation with Colm Kelleher,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,080
author of Brain Trust, Hunt for the Skinwalker and Skinwalkers at the Pentagon. We're now

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,480
segueing from our conversation on the connection between Alzheimer's, mad cow disease, and cow

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,880
mutilations to discuss the topic of the paranormal and of course the paranormal investigations my

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:37,040
guest was involved with at a remote ranch in Utah's Uinta Basin. On with the conversation.

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:01:09,040
The scientific method,

7
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,400
and I had initially asked you about it on the email too, because it doesn't seem like a lot of

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,240
what went down there and what happens with other in other places is it doesn't really lend itself

9
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,720
to repeats and it seems like with SETI for example they want the wow signal to repeat for

10
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,640
it to matter and right now so far the wow signal hasn't repeated and so it does certain concessions

11
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,000
need to be made for this subject matter to be investigated? Yeah that's a very good point

12
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,800
and that is something we wrestled with you know throughout this whole program

13
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:59,840
and you know it was an exercise in frustration trying to get repeatability and reproducibility

14
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:08,480
because whatever was doing this and we still to this day have really no firm idea of what was

15
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,960
behind all of these cattle mutilations, cattle disappearances, UFO activity,

16
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,720
discarnate voices, poltergeist activity, bizarre creatures showing up. I mean the list goes on and

17
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:31,040
on but we had no fixed idea on who was behind this or what was behind this so we were tasked

18
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:39,040
with sticking to scientific methodology and we deployed a lot of sophisticated sensors

19
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:47,200
in different areas of the property and one example is we would have a whole bunch of sensors

20
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,760
deployed around a specific area that had activity in the previous nights or the previous weeks

21
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,840
and then we would deploy a lot of focus and then find the next day or two that a whole bunch of

22
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,080
activity had happened on the very end of the the opposite end of the ranch outside the sphere of

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,040
where the humans and the people were focused so it was almost like we were playing cat and mouse

24
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,560
with something that knew what we were doing and that was very evasive and very deceptive and very

25
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,680
sort of very well skilled in being able to camouflage itself and if it didn't want to be

26
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,520
discovered it wouldn't be discovered but there was quite a lot of occasions when we actually

27
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,680
came face to face with stuff that we couldn't explain so you know I mean but that was always

28
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,800
outside our control and also outside our ability to repeat things usually happen very quickly

29
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:58,480
unexpectedly and in areas that we you know we were not sort of prepared at all times and

30
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,880
we did you know train to be more prepared as time went on it was kind of like

31
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,920
scientific method was shown to be sort of inadequate in terms of fully describing what

32
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,480
was on the property I mean one of the things that I had done in my previous career in mainstream

33
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,880
science was publish a lot of papers and peer-reviewed scientific journals so I knew

34
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,800
how the system worked and you know you gathered the data you reproduce it you get the the best

35
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,040
possible data and then you present it to a peer-reviewed journal and they critique it

36
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,920
and you resubmit and then the paper is published well there was nothing that we got

37
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,400
in the sort of six years of boots on the ground on skin marker ranch that could have been

38
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,720
gone through the process of peer-reviewed publication in a refereed scientific journal

39
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,680
it just that the data were too sporadic they were not reproducible so we were kind of left

40
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:16,800
with a lot of sporadic data but nothing that could be published well I feel like there's

41
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,880
some instances and all across all these texts where I feel like

42
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:33,040
you could apply some level of reason and say okay well if this many people who are unrelated are

43
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,560
seeing this certainly there's something to that so for example going all the way back to the

44
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
Gorman family and that crazy wolf

45
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,720
it's reminiscent of something I read you know in a more recent in the more recent text where

46
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,840
a hitchhiker made its way onto someone's property and I think it was described also as a wolf

47
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,600
or having little flight features exactly I mean that's that's the sort of strange part of this

48
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,640
whole thing I mean what really separated skinwalkers at the Pentagon from the previous

49
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,960
studies we've done was that here we had an official United States government program

50
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,480
the Department of Defense Defense Intelligence Agency 22 million dollars were allocated through

51
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,960
the Defense Intelligence Agency for this program so we had a lot of resources and we were we were

52
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:41,200
able to hire a lot of people and some of the people that were on this skinwalker ranch were

53
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:50,320
actually sent from the Defense Intelligence Agencies kind of like a field trip in order

54
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,960
to investigate to see if this you know what this was going on in this ranch had any validity if it

55
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,640
had any intelligence value or if there was anything you know properly associated with it

56
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:09,920
it was kind of like standard operating procedure for the United States government is is to deploy

57
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:17,360
people to the area so you know to to look into what was actually going on so on during the

58
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,800
the program which was a two-year contract with the Defense Intelligence Agency there were five

59
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,920
separate United States government people who were deployed onto the property from different

60
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,000
different departments somewhere from the Navy somewhere from the Marine Corps

61
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,840
somewhere were from the intelligence agencies but what was remarkable about this was that

62
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:52,480
all five people who were deployed on Skinwalker Ranch had really bizarre in-your-face phenomena

63
00:07:52,480 --> 00:08:00,720
happening to them right on the property and secondly as you allude to all five of them brought

64
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,760
weird stuff home to their families so what happened was they you know they would have

65
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,760
a an experience on the property and then fly back to Maryland or Washington or somewhere on the East

66
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,920
Coast from which they from whence they are originally deployed and then a couple of weeks

67
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:25,040
later their wives or their spouses or their kids would suddenly start encountering these black

68
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:32,000
human-eyed shadows that would would would appear over their beds in their bedrooms there would be

69
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,880
orbs of light sort of you know moving through the walls and moving into their their bedrooms

70
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,520
sometimes blue sometimes red sometimes white these things were the size of of baseballs

71
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,640
they moved silently and sometimes you know they caused injuries on on people you know they actually

72
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:02,080
caused injuries but part of this effect that these people seem to have brought back to their families

73
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,880
included sightings of these bizarre creatures and remember we're talking about what are called

74
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,240
TSSCI cleared and these are top secret special compartmented information cleared people who

75
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,680
were high level people in the United States government and in the military these were very

76
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,400
very highly qualified people who had been in Afghanistan who had been in Iraq who were used to

77
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:38,560
confronting fear and so some of the the stuff that erupted in their homes caused them to really

78
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:47,200
fear of what was going on one example was you know after that the guy who we call Axelrod in

79
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,320
the book in in in Skinwalkers at the Pentagon book went home to his family a few weeks later

80
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,040
his wife was just shutting up shutting the all the lights down it was like 11 30 at night

81
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,760
and she was just about to turn the lights in the backyard down when she saw this creature

82
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,800
that was standing beside a tree looking at her and she looked at it closely she kind of leaned

83
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,480
forward and focused on it and this thing was looked like a wolf standing on two legs leaning

84
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,080
against the the tree and it was like she just couldn't believe her eyes I mean this was in

85
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:34,720
suburban Virginia and you know she didn't say anything about it it completely freaked her out

86
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,280
it unnerved her she looked away and then she looked back and the the creature was still there

87
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:49,600
and it was obviously staring at her in a unfriendly way so at that stage it turned around

88
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,160
and just walked back into the tree line and vanished and she just literally couldn't believe

89
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,880
her eyes didn't say anything to the rest of our family she did not want to freak them out

90
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:06,000
but then three days later her two teenage sons were in the in the living room

91
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,720
of their same house when one of them noticed movement out the backyard this was on a Saturday

92
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,920
morning 10 a.m broad daylight and standing in the backyard was this bizarre looking wolf like

93
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,000
creature again standing on two legs staring at the at the kids and the other kids sort of

94
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,680
also saw it and once they locked eyes again this creature looked very unfriendly hostile

95
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,520
it began running towards the tree line on two legs which is anatomically impossible I mean

96
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:48,400
if you look if you put a German shepherd on two legs it can at best totter one or two steps

97
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:56,320
so it's anatomically impossible for a large wolf like creature to run on two legs but that's

98
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,360
exactly what this creature did and not only that it blew up a whole bunch of leaves that were on

99
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,240
the ground so this was not sort of some kind of you know sort of apparition it was having a

100
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,320
physical effect on the leaves on the ground and so it ran towards the tree the tree line and vanished

101
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,280
so the teenagers called out to the family you know they were kind of panicked they didn't know

102
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:29,920
what to make of what this was and so the mother came in and you know what they described was very

103
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,640
very similar to what she had seen three nights before so they the family then walked out into

104
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:43,440
the backyard down to where the she showed exactly where this creature was standing by the tree

105
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,240
and on the tree bark there were these obvious claw marks on the bark of the tree I mean the

106
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,440
the implication was that this creature had made you know strong deep claw marks on the tree so

107
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,280
again this was evidence that this wasn't sort of some kind of weird human perception thing

108
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,600
it wasn't an apparition there was something physical about what had happened in their

109
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,960
backyard and so this was one of dozens of examples that this family and this this guy who was

110
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,560
you know promoted up the ranks because obviously he didn't talk about any of this stuff

111
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:31,360
at work because it was so bizarre and so so outside what had happened but this guy was very high level

112
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,480
in the in the navy department of the navy you know we're not talking about somebody who was

113
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,520
I mean he was very high level had top secret security clearances all five out of five people

114
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,600
who were on the skinwalker ranch property during that government program they all had dramatic

115
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:59,600
effects and they all brought this quote-unquote hitchhiker behind to their homes and so not only

116
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,520
the kids saw it but also neighbors of this family started reporting weird stuff happening all these

117
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,840
blue orbs flying around their their house and even school kids who were friends with these two kids

118
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,560
who did not talk about what they had seen but their school friends started talking about that

119
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,040
they were starting to see your see weird stuff outside their homes so we speculate in the book

120
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,800
in skinwalkers at the pentagon that you know this thing is behaving like some kind of an infectious

121
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:38,160
entity the the guy you know gets infected on the property brings it home to his family his family

122
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,080
starts seeing weird stuff and then their neighbors start seeing weird stuff and then the the school

123
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,760
kids start seeing weird stuff so it's almost like an infectious organism is moving out into the

124
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:57,040
neighborhoods and that's not the only time we saw that we saw that multiple times of of this infectious

125
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,360
behavior of something that originated on skinwalker wrench and then moving out into the into the

126
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,880
neighborhoods can you talk about the black triangles for a little bit because

127
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,960
i gotta tell you bro i have been obsessed with these things since i was in high school

128
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,040
actually probably middle school is when the unsolved mysteries episode came out about it

129
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:29,920
it was in the 90s yeah and sometimes they're depending on the source that

130
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,320
the they're different from the chevrons that were seen in the hudson river valley but some people

131
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,600
say they're the same things and i was one i just wanted to get your take on it because

132
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,520
you have a whole chapter dedicated to the black triangles right there's a whole chapter in the

133
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,040
skinwalkers of the pentagon devoted to the black triangles yeah well you know the organization that

134
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,600
i was talking about that looked into anomalies that looked into calumni relations nids we also

135
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:08,080
looked at black triangles and you know we were very very fortunate that um you know in 2001

136
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:16,000
we we had this sort of illinois it was a very famous case of of four separate police officers

137
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,560
had witnessed this black black triangle going over their their heads so some of them took

138
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,800
photographs and the photographs weren't weren't particularly good but we deployed a team of

139
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,880
including a a retired fbi agent a retired air force office of special investigations agent

140
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,880
out to illinois we interviewed all the witnesses and there were over a dozen witnesses that had

141
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:50,720
seen the progress of this low-flying black triangle that had appeared um and then actually

142
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,480
it was about 4 a.m that it started and then the last sighting was after 6 a.m so it was it was

143
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,960
in the air for over two hours different police precincts there were four different police

144
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:09,040
precincts who had seen it had tracked it had had driven their vehicles in pursuit of it

145
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,640
so this was a really good case and and it became kind of legendary in the in the black triangle

146
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,640
sort of investigations um but you know so nids became a sort of a central

147
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,520
data clearing house for this whole phenomenon we got literally hundreds of cases and reports

148
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,760
of these black triangles from all over the country from the united states and also from europe there

149
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:43,920
was a a lot of famous cases that had erupted in in europe particularly in belgium and in in

150
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:52,160
in france so we were privy to a lot of this data and the the sort of the central feature of this

151
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,000
this phenomenon was that these enormous triangular shaped objects that were silent

152
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,160
usually brightly lit would be flying at very very low speed sometimes 30 40 miles an hour

153
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:15,760
very low over these populated neighborhoods over interstate highways and when i say low altitude

154
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,680
we're talking sometimes just over treetop level i mean we're not talking sort of a couple thousand

155
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:28,480
feet up talking about really low i mean we had multiple witnesses who told us that this thing

156
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,640
was so low as it was coming towards them that they started running because they were sure it was so

157
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,520
low it was going to crash into you know the neighborhood they thought it was it was just

158
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:48,080
so so bizarre so over the years we accumulated like i said hundreds of these cases they were

159
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:56,800
all very very similar and they were all sort of overload the populated neighborhoods flying

160
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,520
dangerously low silent and and then they would be capable of extreme levels of acceleration

161
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,520
where they could accelerate from a practically standing position to vanish within a second or two

162
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,880
so they had these really high level performance characteristics and so that you know the big

163
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:28,080
question was always in everybody's minds from the start of the 1980s all the way through to about

164
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:35,280
2010 when these triangles were flying everywhere was this a united states special access program

165
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,480
or was this some sort of you know was this from somewhere else quote unquote and you know throughout

166
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:50,000
all of the the time that we investigated these cases and all of the we literally interviewed

167
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,520
hundreds of witnesses to these these things we came to the conclusion that there was really

168
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:05,440
very little chance that the united states government would be so foolhardy as to you know

169
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:14,560
fly these extremely large experimental aircraft very low very brightly lit over highly populated

170
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:21,120
neighborhoods and highly highly populated interstate highways for what purpose i mean there was i mean

171
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,600
this this was not a single flight of a of a top secret aircraft this was hundreds of different

172
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,520
flights all over the united states and over europe so we came to the conclusion that these were not

173
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,880
ours you know these were these were not ours and one of the chapters in skinwalkers of the pentagon

174
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,240
we specifically specifically talk about this case where you know guys in in a small town in

175
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,760
georgia rural georgia comes out because his son and their friends are are are sleeping in a tent

176
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:03,840
overnight he has a 10 year old son and friends and you know the dog is barking crazily so he

177
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,560
walks out and he sees one of these huge triangular things that that's literally parked over his

178
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,880
his property and it's moving very very slowly but it's gigantic it's the size of a football field

179
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,800
and so he tries taking you know video camera of using a cell phone

180
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,880
his cell phone doesn't work all of the electronics die in the in the cell phone which is very

181
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:42,320
usual behavior for this stuff bottom line is he he goes inside grabs a high-powered flashlight

182
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,200
runs back out of it and illuminates that the the object with the flashlight

183
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,040
instantly he turns on the flashlight he gets this beam from the underside of the of this gigantic

184
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:04,080
craft hits him with this blue light he feels burning on his skin almost immediately turns around

185
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,480
crouches to get away from the thing he feels the back of his neck burning so he he ducks inside it

186
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,560
i mean he he you know he's really scared but whatever this blue beam that comes from this

187
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:24,080
object is really hurting him so you know he uh he he spent the rest of the the time in his house

188
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:32,560
this this object then eventually took off at a fantastic speed but you know he he woke up the

189
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:40,160
following day with a really severe headache and he had burns on the back of his neck sunburn on the

190
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:48,640
back of his neck he started losing his hair over time we our organization with the defense

191
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:56,080
intelligence agency contract had two contract physician scientists who were md phd so they were

192
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,200
well versed in investigation of medical injuries so we dispatched one of these guys

193
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,720
who spent a lot of time with interviewing this guy this guy had metallic taste in his mouth

194
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:18,160
his hair started falling out he you know the physician scientist took photographs of him

195
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,080
we had other investigators take photographs of him i mean he was losing his hair he had multiple

196
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:31,120
blood tests at at the local hospital he had really low red cell counts and white cell counts

197
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,160
um you know if we didn't know better he was suffering from some kind of radiation injury

198
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:44,880
non-ionizing radiation industry injuries so we had the the fortune to have these medical people

199
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:52,080
md phd's were able to follow this kind of medical injury case over weeks and months over the weeks

200
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,440
and months this guy developed a whole bunch of weird tumors he got really sick and then slowly

201
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,600
after about a year he started recovering but we were able to take multiple blood samples over time

202
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:13,120
and we were able to document in extensive detail and all of this you know all this medical data was

203
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,960
protected by the HIPAA laws which is you know the privacy laws and our our physician scientists

204
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,960
operated strictly under HIPAA so this guy's identity can never be revealed but you know the

205
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,840
fact is we were able to track his the health status and his health deteriorated dramatically

206
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:41,360
after this encounter with this huge triangle over his house when he got hit by this weird blue beam

207
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,160
now again was this one of ours or was it you know one of theirs i mean why would a united states

208
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:58,000
um experimental aircraft be radiating a united states citizen on their own property for no other

209
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,040
reason than they shone a flashlight at it i mean what's the purpose of that there was you know

210
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:10,800
again we went through this whole exercise of what is the agenda of of something like this and again

211
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:17,520
we concluded that the chances are united states government deployed aircraft would never be as

212
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:26,320
foolhardy as to deploy something like this over some guy's property irradiate cause a medical injury

213
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,840
you know non-ionizing radiation the guy's hair falls out and he eventually recovers but he gets

214
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,760
very sick for a long time as a result of this encounter so again that's sort of a codex to the

215
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,280
black triangle phenomenon it's not always healthy you know it's not always good for

216
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:53,520
your health when you have encounters like this well you know well i mean the the thing about the

217
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,840
it seems and i i can't buy into the idea that it's government either because it just seems

218
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:08,320
overkill for pointing a flashlight yeah you know it's just like that's something that somebody who

219
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:16,160
doesn't think on our level would do exactly i mean if if you had a drone or a robot that was

220
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:23,280
programmed to react a certain way maybe you could you know maybe you could sort of get your head

221
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:31,120
around that that that kind of dramatic overreaction that it was some sort of pre-programmed response

222
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:39,040
but it makes absolutely no sense it defies common sense for somebody if that was a manned

223
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,320
aircraft and it was an experimental aircraft from the united states government

224
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,320
to react in that way is just it's just defies common sense blue seems to be a recurring

225
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,360
horrible color for people encountering these things whether it's an orb or a beam

226
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:06,160
i mean those blue orbs that that people encounter and we have several instances

227
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,080
in in skin markers of the pentagon where we describe these encounters with blue orbs

228
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,920
pretty well universally they are not good for your health i mean if you know if you see a blue orb i

229
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:26,080
would say run the other way because we we document a number of times in in the book where

230
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:35,200
um blue orbs cause medical injuries you know if they get too close and we've we've had instances

231
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:42,800
of blue orbs going all the way back to skinwalker wrench where they injured you know killed killed

232
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:50,400
three three dogs um that were getting too close to them we also had instances at you know skin

233
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,800
worker of the pentagon where we described this biotechnologist who was driving with his daughter

234
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:04,960
towards bend oregon and sees these three blue ufos in the field next to next to them as they're

235
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,440
driving and they start moving towards the car pretty quickly two of them actually come into the

236
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:18,000
car one of them goes right across the dashboard in front of of the two of them but one of them

237
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,200
comes in through the window and enters this guy's left shoulder as he's driving goes through the top

238
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,560
of his body and exits his right shoulder right in front of his daughter his daughter is in the

239
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,720
passenger seat and it goes right out the window but you know it goes right through this guy's

240
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:44,880
body and and and exits the right shoulder and so again we have this sort of uh we we deployed the

241
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:52,320
mdphd medical investigators that we had on on this case too and they you know these these two

242
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,080
were followed for several months and actually the main person the main guy was followed for years

243
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,600
medically we had serial blood samples but bottom line is this this guy almost immediately

244
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,480
after this event you know when he got got got to his place in bend oregon started having these

245
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:20,320
symptoms and um you know his uh the left side of his uh of his face had had this sunburn effect

246
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,040
uh he lost the use of his eye it started watering and his eye left eye started going bad his left

247
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:33,120
ear started going bad uh hair started falling out from the left side of his head after this

248
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,960
thing had gone through his body he came down with a rare form of ductile cancer which luckily did

249
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:46,080
not metastasize but you know within a few months this guy was really sick so we were able to monitor

250
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:53,280
him with the the aid of his uh with the these medical positions and we collaborated with the

251
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:00,960
physicians that were treating him you know in in oregon and we documented sort of a vast amount of

252
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:08,080
changes in the immune system uh changes in the and the guy's physical health eventually recovered

253
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,720
from the ductile form of cancer luckily it was not metastatic and so um you know a few years later

254
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,400
was feeling a lot better but the weird thing about his daughter who had you know had a close

255
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,160
encounter she did not have any ill effects but you know she was in college and then she went back to

256
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:34,640
the east coast to um you know to be with uh her her roommates and the same kind of hitchhiker effect

257
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,320
erupted in her household she had never been anywhere close to skinwalker ranch but all she

258
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,040
had was this close encounter with these weird blue orbs but um all of her roommates back in

259
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,160
on the east coast in connecticut where she was going to college uh started reporting you know

260
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,640
waking up with these creatures that were standing over them in their bedrooms and sort of these loud

261
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,320
footsteps on the stairs outside their rooms uh orbs of light sort of moving through the house

262
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:11,200
again the same kind of thing the so-called hitchhiker effect um she went back from oregon

263
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,240
to the east coast and brought something with her but it was nothing to do with skinwalker ranch so

264
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,480
we figured out eventually that in terms of methodology you've got to follow these people

265
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:28,640
for months or years in order to really document what the effects of these phenomena are

266
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,320
as opposed to you know you go out you take their testimony for a weekend and then you move on to

267
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:41,040
the next case you'll miss all of that those kinds of effects and so we were lucky to have the

268
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:48,080
22 million dollars through the defense intelligence agency to investigate all of this uh all of these

269
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,880
phenomena because we were able to deploy these kinds of resources for a couple of years

270
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,080
and so that made a huge effect i think on the on the overall program

271
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,640
yeah it sounds a lot like um i mean i've heard for years that uh people who have

272
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,720
experiences as as young people will often have them again as adults and

273
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,760
it's almost as if they get the sense that they're recognized like they know who saw what at what

274
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:28,160
point in their life and return and it's almost feels like it's the same i mean you use the word

275
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:35,360
methodology that whatever this is has the same mechanism or methodology to be able to track

276
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,200
who's who and who are they related to and who are their friends away where they go and

277
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,960
who are they related to and who are their friends away where they go and it's so spooky

278
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:52,000
yeah i agree with that i mean i i think there's lots of evidence for people having these kinds

279
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,200
of experiences as kids and then yeah they they they also have experiences during their teens and

280
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,560
all the way into adulthood and it's almost um in a lot of cases it seems to occur in families too

281
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,840
you know the grandparents have you know have these strange activities in their lives their

282
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:21,360
their offspring have same kinds of phenomena and then attracts even into a third generation and

283
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,880
you can see that the same thing happened in the grant in the grandkids that has been documented

284
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:34,320
lots of different times it's it's almost like as you say um you know some kind of tracking

285
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,600
mechanism is happening where people who have these effects seem to be predisposed to have more

286
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,160
more of them and also their family members seem to have um it's almost like it transmits genetically

287
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,720
yeah and i'm predisposed to that uh idea because um

288
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:04,400
um me plus two other people in my family tend to have pre-cognitive dreams

289
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,400
and i've made a conscious effort to track how the hell that has ended up in our our family and

290
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:20,000
unfortunately i don't have a solid uh sort of family tree to lean in on but i know it comes from

291
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,480
my mother's side and i find that interesting and i think there's something to that too

292
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,640
yeah um i i definitely think that um a lot of a lot of what we've come across

293
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:41,920
is maternally transferred from grand grandmother to uh daughter you know granddaughter or daughter

294
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:49,120
granddaughter so um it does seem to to transmit maternally not always but but um it's very common

295
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,720
for a long time i thought there were rules it seemed like it was okay for these things to kill

296
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,440
animals they could mess with humans all they want they could destroy their economic system they could

297
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,400
destroy their psycho their psychology but then i i read about the brazilian black boxes

298
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:18,960
and now i'm i no longer comfortable in in these sort of false rules i had for myself

299
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,520
so that i could sleep at night uh and i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about

300
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,760
what do you think that there are rules or do you think that like maybe the black boxes aren't

301
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,240
i mean i've never even heard of the black boxes till i read one of your books

302
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,280
the the black boxes you're referring to were called chupas um by the the local hunters and

303
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,080
a lot of this activity happened in in calaris island off the northeast coast of brazil

304
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:55,200
back in the late 1970s um but and and i would say there were people who died as a result of

305
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,760
these interactions getting zapped by these uh beams from from craft that used to show up

306
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,680
um tremendously frequently but if you look at the entire sort of scope of this phenomenon this ufo

307
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,960
phenomena if you want to use that word um since say 1947 when kenneth kenneth arnold first saw

308
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,880
these things um and it became sort of into public awareness so 75 years it's been going on

309
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:33,200
um out of out of that 75 years um it's really the exception rather than the rule that people are

310
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:40,800
killed um people are killed uh there are a lot of people who get too close to these things

311
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:48,560
and have medical injuries but you rarely come across except for that calaris island series

312
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,120
of incidents where people are so badly injured they get killed um and you know the question is

313
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:03,440
over time um is is uh we we have a lot of data on what the performance characteristics

314
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:11,040
of these objects are we've accumulated a lot of data in the last 75 years everything from radar

315
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:20,080
tracks to ground traces performances but we have almost no data in terms of what their agenda or

316
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:27,680
intent is and you know it may be that if people get too close to these objects for example the

317
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,480
the guys the guy and his daughter that i just talked about in oregon um and they medical injuries

318
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,480
happen is that as a result of them being in the wrong place at the wrong time or is there some

319
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:48,720
kind of intent there and um i don't think there's enough data even in 75 years to say that these are

320
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:58,000
deliberately attacking people i i would tend to say um that we don't have enough data on the agenda

321
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,680
quote unquote of these objects it's it's so i think it's an open question i think it may be that a lot

322
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,680
of these people are in the wrong place at the wrong time and that you know whatever is interacting

323
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:19,920
with humanity may not mean it harm necessarily um it's just that you know people who get too

324
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:27,360
close to some of these things um end up injured yeah that's that's the impression i guess so like

325
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,920
the black boxes i think it was it was a sentence in there about how maybe the he was too close to

326
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:41,040
a beam that was set for stun or something like that yeah or um there was one instance i remember

327
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,520
reading about i don't remember which one it was in where some woman was driving on on a road and

328
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,400
it looked like the ship was malfunctioning and she thought jesus was going to come out of the light

329
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,600
so she stayed and looked at it and um they could don't jesus isn't coming out don't stay and look

330
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:04,000
at it and uh she ended up with cancer right yeah that's right that was that happened in texas

331
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:12,240
yeah so and i think also with that i forget his name it was a very famous case they made a movie

332
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:19,280
on with the logger who got abducted uh travels walton he later came to the conclusion that um

333
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,880
they were trying to help him because he was too close to the ship so even though it was

334
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,320
horrifying for him he now thinks that they were trying to restore his health

335
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:36,560
yeah and and i i think there are a lot of instances um of that kind of um you know where

336
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:43,440
where there's there's evidence that you know the upshot of some of these people you know they

337
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,240
they have healings for example um as a result of interacting with uh with some of these things so

338
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:58,400
it's not all doom and gloom and and so it there seems to be a variety of interactions with these

339
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:07,920
objects that uh can cause you know people's life lives to change in sometimes a good way you know

340
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,800
sometimes that you know people are so overcome by shock and horror at sort of experiencing something

341
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,200
that should never never be real um that you know they can't handle it and that that's obviously

342
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:29,200
another set of um you know occurrences and consequences that happen but you know i don't

343
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:37,600
see any evidence that there's a deliberate attempt to harm humans um in any consistent way how

344
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,760
important are stories in all this um what what do they play any kind of role in

345
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:54,480
creating your own methodologies uh for example the skinwalker goes all the way back to

346
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,040
to legend uh and then then you have your local local myths oh well i heard that you know this

347
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,360
thing happened on this property at that time or whatever are stories an important role in helping

348
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:14,800
you figure out kind of a what's going on um in terms of a continuity there's a a guy called

349
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,080
Jacques Ballet who has written some very influential books in this um in this field and by by this

350
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:29,920
field i mean the general topic of anomalies and ufos and sort of things that should not happen

351
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,080
you know the sort of uh what jeffrey crypal from rice university calls the impossible

352
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,760
you know the impossible happens but you know one of the books that Jacques Ballet wrote was was

353
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,880
one called messengers of deception was written in the 1970s was pretty influential and essentially

354
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:59,040
his whole um premise was that the ufo topic does operate at the cultural level and it operates

355
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:07,920
via um you know having having dramatic effects on people's lives in different ways you've got

356
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,200
different manifestations of these objects you've even got people who are claiming to be

357
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:23,520
contactees quote unquote who can um have charisma and form you know religious cults and so um i you

358
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:31,920
know to use your terminology the stories of these sort of encounters can permeate into um you know

359
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,480
small groups of people and then ever larger groups of people like the raelian the so-called raelian

360
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,120
movement that happened in france from this guy who originally was um contacted by quote unquote

361
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:50,400
aliens i mean there are thousands of people in the raelian movement and it's a global movement

362
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,480
but it's a quasi religious movement that's based on the original contact experience of

363
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:07,680
of a single person um so these kinds of stories do generate myths and um they can transmit to

364
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:14,160
through populations and one of the premises of valet's books is is that you know you can form

365
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,640
you can have new religions formed as a result of contact experiences and the the way these

366
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:28,400
experiences are promulgated is mostly verbally and it is through through stories you know

367
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:36,800
there was a famous um for instance fatima portugal where where these kids who allegedly

368
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:45,440
saw the virgin mary repetitively the crowds got bigger every time they reported seeing these

369
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,840
uh that these visions of the virgin mary and so the final episode sort of the culmination of

370
00:43:51,840 --> 00:44:00,320
many many weeks of this thing was this gigantic crowd formed in fatima portugal and um you know

371
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:10,080
a ufo appeared and this object it was like sort of it looked like um a gigantic disc and it was

372
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:16,560
brightly lit and that all sorts of weird light phenomena happened but like five to ten thousand

373
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:25,040
people were witness to this in 1917 and you know it all got mixed in with the appearance of of the

374
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:33,360
blessed virgin mary and so there was a sort of a religious connotation i mean the fatima um fatima

375
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:41,280
you know visions were were sort of i think they were um counted as miracles in the uh in the in

376
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,520
the catholic church but this is an example of a of a sort of a borderline phenomenon that looks

377
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:55,360
like a ufo that was sort of layered over a religious visitation and so promulgation of that

378
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:04,240
i mean for the fatima 1970 sightings were seen as a you know a dramatic occurrence of um a quasi

379
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,240
religious phenomenon and you can see you know a lot of that of the original biblical stories

380
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:17,520
have been you know interpreted by some people as as you know the original contact experience

381
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:25,200
had some sort of narratives that were very very parallel to what people see now

382
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,840
i have some closing questions for you

383
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,760
i meant to write just a few and i ended up with the whole page really

384
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:45,520
um have you been following the current proceedings on the ranch after the acquisition by brandon

385
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:53,360
fugal yeah to an extent um yeah i've interacted with brandon fugal quite a few times and and

386
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:59,120
you know it's interesting the team that he deployed on the on the property were extremely

387
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:07,280
skeptical at the very beginning and this is in march of 2016 they took over so it's been five

388
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,840
years now there's been at least two seasons of the secrets of skinwalker ranch on the history

389
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:23,440
channel tv but much of what was experienced by the uh the original gorman family back in the early

390
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:31,360
90s subsequently experienced by all of the nids investigators they're technical people

391
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:39,680
and all of the people who visited the ranch followed by the government investigators that

392
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:46,000
were deployed as part of the ossoff program in in skinwalkers of the pentagon and then finally

393
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:54,000
brandon fugal's team on the skinwalker ranch the the reproducibility of of all of these phenomena

394
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:02,560
is staggering over a 25 year year period i mean there it's almost like um instead of getting

395
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:10,480
reproducibility in the short term the kinds of phenomena that have been seen um by brandon

396
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:18,480
fugal's team is are similar to what have been seen by the defense intelligence agency investigators

397
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:25,280
and also by the national institute for discovery science investigators and also by the the gorman

398
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:32,960
family back in the 1994 period and you know we we've tracked the previous owners of the property

399
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:40,160
that that had skinwalker ranch before the gorman family was was on the property and there's a lot

400
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,760
of evidence that these same phenomena go all the way back into the 50s the 40s and it goes all the

401
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:53,120
way back even into the 1930s so you know we're looking at sort of something that has happened

402
00:47:53,120 --> 00:48:00,560
continuously brandon fugal's team you know have have been pretty innovative and pretty uh you know

403
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:08,560
pretty um i would say they've deployed a lot of new technology they've been creative um and but

404
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:14,880
they're they're experiencing some very very similar phenomena they have not got explanations

405
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,800
for those phenomena there's a lot of hypotheses just like the allsoft program under the defense

406
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:27,600
intelligence agency generated a number of hypotheses nids generated a number of hypotheses but you know

407
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:34,480
in terms of testability um nothing is definitive you know but they are consistent i mean there's

408
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:41,840
been a 25 year documented history on skin marker ranch that is reproducible and consistent

409
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:50,720
prior to buying it he was warned that um the government wouldn't release some of their findings

410
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,720
to him and as there's some some of it's still classified and

411
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,160
for aspects of the studies that are still classified why why do you think this is and

412
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:13,840
what is the purpose of withholding information about about this well you know that the original

413
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:20,720
contract with the defense intelligence agency that started in 2008 and terminated in 2010

414
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:28,000
i mean that there are really three aspects to this that are that are sort of make it more

415
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:34,480
difficult to release the information you know just automatically and that is number one the

416
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:41,760
um the defense intelligence agency contracted a um a private contractor to do this this work

417
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:48,880
private contractor delivered you know over a hundred reports to the defense intelligence agency

418
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,760
on the activity and not only on skin marker ranch but also elsewhere

419
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:04,000
um and so all of that is subject to contractor um proprietary contractor language in the in the

420
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,560
original contract that's item number one item number two is that in order to release all of

421
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:18,160
this data especially the databases that were accumulated you would have to go through them

422
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:25,200
and remove all of the medically sensitive information the HIPAA related uh information

423
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:32,160
the personal identity protection protected information that's item number three so um you

424
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:42,080
know prior to us uh releasing the book uh skin walkers of the pentagon um we had to submit this

425
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:49,440
to the pentagon for review so four separate agencies within the pentagon reviewed it

426
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:56,800
including intelligence agencies and they um stipulated that a lot of these names of active

427
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:05,120
duty military people active duty government people had to be changed there were offices that the

428
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,640
names of offices had to be removed so the department of the defense of defense

429
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,400
went through a line-by-line review of skin walkers of the pentagon before it was released

430
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:25,040
so they stipulated a lot of removals a lot of information that was sensitive and or classified

431
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:31,520
was removed from the from the book prior to its publication so those same stipulations also

432
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:41,040
um hold for release of this information um you know provided a team of people went through every

433
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:48,400
one of those hundred reports many of which are over 100 pages and also the uh the large database

434
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,080
went through every case in that database again all of the personally protected information

435
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,240
uh would have to be removed all of the medically sensitive information would have to be removed

436
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:08,240
um but if that was done which would be a long process but if that was done then that information

437
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:14,000
probably could be released as a taxpayer i 100 support going through this process and releasing

438
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,400
it's difficult but it's doable yeah someday

439
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:31,760
okay okay so i posted on my facebook hey i'm going to be interviewing author of these books

440
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,440
who was on skinwalker ranch and if anybody has any questions and some people had some questions

441
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:48,000
and so one of them is um it's about disclosure some say full disclosure on the ufo matter has begun

442
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:55,200
so do you think it's a big it's begun or do you think that the the release of that navy video is

443
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:02,400
just a fluke and if it has begun what are the socio-political and economic ramifications

444
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:12,720
of this becoming a normally accepted thing in our culture well i i think you know june 25th 2021

445
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,800
when the office of of department national intelligence odni

446
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:31,040
released this report to the public involving 144 cases of interactions between military pilots and

447
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:38,480
f-18 pilots and and also their carrier strike groups on either end of the both east coast and

448
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:45,520
west coast that was a a turning point in the history of how the united states government

449
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:51,440
treats this phenomenon because before that i mean they basically said in that report that

450
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:58,960
number one ufos are real they're not fantasies they're not people who are on drugs or mentally

451
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:08,240
ill they are real number two they constitute an air air safety concern that was new and three

452
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,920
they they potentially constitute a national security issue so the fact that the united

453
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:22,160
states government came forward and and said this to the public was a complete departure from the

454
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:30,800
previous 75 years where witnesses were regularly sort of labeled as drunks and mental incompetence

455
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:37,200
and sort of people have to be crazy to you know talk about ufos the other thing is that the united

456
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:44,080
states government admitted that they had been studying ufos even though um the the standard

457
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:49,840
line from the united states air force and from other departments had been we lost interest in

458
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:58,320
ufos in 1969 when we stopped project blue book and the um you know the the condon ufo report

459
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:04,880
put an end to all of our interest in ufos that was not true i mean they've been studying ufos

460
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:12,880
all along and the program the 22 million dollar program that we were part of is one of those

461
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:20,160
programs and so the fact that they actually released for the public record that ufos are real

462
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:27,200
is a form of confirmation i wouldn't call it disclosure but it was confirmation that what a

463
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:34,480
lot of people are seeing and have been seeing for 75 years plus um is real so it's not a it's not

464
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:41,920
some kind of fantasy and they're not mentally ill but it's real so that's about as far i think as

465
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:49,440
the united states government is going to go i don't see them going beyond that because um you know

466
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:58,640
what are they going to disclose um that they've already disclosed sort of a short version that

467
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:06,880
ufos are real um they have no idea who these are what these are who these are or they have no idea

468
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:14,240
of a lot of the details of what would follow in quote on quote disclosure plus there's uh there's

469
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:24,960
an enormous body of classified work behind which this whole topic has hidden for decades that is

470
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,480
never going to see the light of day and so the united states government coming forward and saying

471
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:37,360
ufos are real i think that is probably you know as far as they will go

472
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,480
sorry about the cat by the way i know you can be distracting

473
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,040
yeah i'm allergic to cats so that's probably why i'm coughing he just keeps

474
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:51,200
i'm just psychological psychological yeah that's right um the hypothetical part the part of your

475
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,680
brain that comes up with you know could hypothetically be this or that has that

476
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:02,720
changed in any kind of ways from before you were with nids to after i guess i guess the person

477
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:08,720
wants to know if you're more open-minded that's the impression i get from the question you know

478
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:19,600
i i think my um my view on this phenomenon has evolved over time i think when i first sort of

479
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:28,320
started with nids and this is 25 years ago um back in 1996 i guess i had a pretty simplistic

480
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:35,440
view that you know extraterrestrials were flying in spaceships to um to earth they were taking

481
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:43,120
samples and they were conducting scientific expeditions um i think the ufo phenomenon is

482
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:52,880
way more complex than that and i think um my view at this time is that there is um there's a lot more

483
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:02,000
to be done in in investigating the ufo phenomenon than i had realized because i think what what we

484
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:11,520
really sort of pioneered during the um the defense intelligence agency funded program was the idea

485
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:20,080
that um not only could you just look at ufo performance you could also look at ufo effects

486
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:26,400
on humans and you could you could document physiological effects you could document medical

487
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,960
injuries you could document psychological effects and then all the way out to paranormal effects so

488
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:39,760
that was a departure that had never been done before and so that has really opened the doors

489
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:47,440
because um that you know i mean sporadic data had been taken but nothing as comprehensive

490
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:53,920
and as meticulous as had happened under that government program and they have all the data

491
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:01,280
on this they own over 100 reports some of which were over 100 pages so thousands upon

492
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:07,920
thousands of pages of reports are owned by the defense intelligence agency on these not only the

493
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:16,800
ufo performance and how electromagnetic spectra were monitored magnetic fields were changed and

494
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:24,640
electromagnetic effects but also medical injuries and physiological psychological paranormal effects

495
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:32,880
so it's a very rich information source that was begun with this program and you may be aware that

496
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:39,840
um the national defense authorization act just got past the senate and there's a particular

497
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:50,160
amendment in that ndaa written by new york senator christian gilibrand which is almost a carbon copy

498
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:56,400
of the uh the ossa program uh the defense intelligence agency program in other words

499
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,880
it's whoever wrote that language i don't know if it was senator gilibrand or one of her staffers

500
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:10,320
i think there was a lot of in the of what's in our book skin workers of the pentagon that showed up

501
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:16,160
in the in the gilibrand amendment it makes me think that they want to get serious about ufos

502
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:22,720
and they also want to go beyond just sort of documenting um the physics and the engineering

503
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:28,320
behind the ufos they're also interested in documenting effects on humans because they

504
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:33,760
specifically use the language in the amendment like monitoring adverse physical effects

505
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:40,400
we're going to deploy feel the field investigation teams we're going to have

506
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:49,120
you know effects on on medic medical injuries so it makes me think that you know and obviously

507
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:55,200
the devil is going to be in the details if it actually turns out that the gilibrand amendment

508
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:02,560
becomes law and is actually adopted within the pentagon then it stands a good chance

509
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:10,080
that some kind of repeat of the ossa program is possible and that's that's something that would

510
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:16,880
that i would never have imagined 25 years ago in terms of my thinking the idea that the united

511
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:24,320
states government in 20 june 25 2021 would actually say to the public ufos are real

512
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,240
i mean that's something i would never have imagined 25 years ago

513
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:35,680
some part of me was this past year even i was just like i wish heineck was alive to see this

514
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:42,560
shit yeah i mean i mean he would have really he would have celebrated i think i mean again

515
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,840
nobody would have expected this do you think that we're this is another facebook question

516
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,800
this is the last facebook question and then i'll have one more for you from me

517
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,920
are humans interfered with or are we just interacted with

518
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:08,640
well interference and interaction is in the eye of the beholder right i mean there there's an

519
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:15,680
there's still a lot of people who are having a lot of very intense experiences

520
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:25,360
with ufo phenomena and with so-called entities associated with ufo phenomena if you ask those

521
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:34,400
people their answer is we're being interfered with if you ask the people who are having interactions

522
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:42,320
with ufos from say 100 yards away they see a brightly lit craft they you know they may or

523
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:47,840
may not have physiological effects i would say they would answer interacted with but i

524
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:55,200
i guess that the short answer to that question is all of the above i think there are people who are

525
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:05,360
being profoundly affected you know john mack who was a harvard psychiatry you know head of the

526
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:12,000
psychiatry department at harvard who spent a lot of time looking at these quote-unquote abductions

527
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,560
and came to the conclusion that these people were not mentally ill they were actually reporting

528
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:23,680
something real in their lives well if you believe those people and he looked at hundreds of people

529
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:33,920
you know people are undergoing intrusive procedures that are extracting you know

530
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:41,360
sperm and eggs from their from their physical bodies against their will so these people are

531
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:49,280
definitely having intrusive procedures performed on them so that's beyond interaction interactions

532
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:56,240
if you believe those people you know i mean it's a very intense interaction

533
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,800
what do you what would you like to see from people in the ufo community it and the reason

534
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:08,720
i'm asking this is the final question is because it seems to me like people are just waiting for

535
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:14,480
more document releases or somebody somebody else to make a four-year request you know people in the

536
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:21,120
ufo community have had a long it's been a long time and i think it's almost like the dam has

537
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:29,520
broken now as of june 25th 2021 we're now in a different era and i guess their expectations

538
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:37,360
are a lot higher than they were you know a few years ago especially you know prior to the new

539
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,960
york times article that broke the history on our program

540
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:50,880
you know their expectations are a lot higher so i think a lot of them are wanting the release

541
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,560
of a lot of information but you know you've got to realize that or they have got to realize that

542
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:05,200
the government works very slowly it is very very careful and beyond releasing non-classified

543
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:13,440
unclassified versions of some of the interactions with that are ongoing and and activity that's

544
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:19,200
ongoing but on the eastern west coast and all over the world actually with these objects

545
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,440
there's not a lot that the united states government is probably going to release

546
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:34,320
so i i i think expectations are very very high i think what needs to happen is that the also

547
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:40,560
program instead of being a two-year program needs to be reinvigorated into a five-year program

548
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:48,160
because uh when when when the department of defense program was terminated after two years

549
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:55,920
we had 50 full-time people that are working on this on this program and out of nowhere this

550
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:02,480
this project was terminated because of political reasons and because people were realizing that

551
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,200
this data is gonna you know they were afraid it was going to show up on the front pages of the

552
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,880
new york times sometime and that's exactly what happened eight years later so it was shut down

553
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,760
very abruptly this program needs to be uh reinvigorated data needs to be collected for

554
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:28,480
at least five years and then there needs to be a sort of a a release of all possible information

555
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:34,400
to the public that's not classified and doesn't interact with you know the national security

556
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,760
situation i would agree with that that's the only way the taxpayers are gonna be okay continuing to

557
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:49,440
finance it i agree um let's say they reinvigorate this thing uh and it's five years and this question

558
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:55,120
also applies to i guess the formation of nids it could be any one of these organizations how do

559
01:06:55,120 --> 01:07:00,480
you go about recruiting for something like this like what are you looking for kind of people

560
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:10,960
it's uh it is a very good question um you know i i personally interviewed um both by phone

561
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:19,040
by telephone and face-to-face in about a four and a half month period in 2008 about 300 people

562
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:27,200
when we were doing this massive recruitment drive to populate uh we we we recruited phd level

563
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:37,840
scientists we recruited um md phds we recruited technicians uh translators data analysts military

564
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:45,200
intelligence people security officers retired police officers we recruited 50 people in about

565
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,240
four and a half months we trained them and we then we started conducting field research

566
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:57,520
and probably and we got them security clearances probably in in the space of what would normally

567
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:03,840
take a contractor two to three years to accomplish we accomplished in about five months because we

568
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:10,720
had to get this program up and running and get start getting data um in order to deliver what

569
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:18,080
we were we had promised so it was a really i mean it was a rocket ship um taking off in terms of

570
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:26,560
but the recruitment process was um luckily that the program itself was not compromised because

571
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:33,680
we recruited the the normal channels but we were looking for professional people and during the

572
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:40,160
interviews we had a sort of a weeding out process where we weeded out people who were you know this

573
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:46,160
was against their religion this was against their their belief system they were they thought all

574
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:52,480
this was fantasy and this kind of thing so we we we had a screening process that we went through

575
01:08:53,760 --> 01:09:01,440
and out of the over 300 people i interviewed we hired about 50 people and uh i mean we were like

576
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:08,000
a well-oiled machine after 24 months we were really rocking and rolling on this program

577
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,480
and suddenly it was terminated like i said out of nowhere so the same kind of recruitment process

578
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:21,280
the same kind of professionals recruit people if possible with security clearances because

579
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:30,080
that saves a lot of time in terms of um you know reinventing the wheel so um that's what we did

580
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:36,160
and i think that's what should be done again all right okay thanks it was great and uh you're

581
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:47,920
welcome back anytime i love the way you talk thank you i appreciate it i enjoyed it too
