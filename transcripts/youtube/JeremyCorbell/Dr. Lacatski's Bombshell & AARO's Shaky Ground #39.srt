1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
It's like we have different species of humans on this planet, I'm quite certain there's

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,560
different species of alien life forms.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,260
So we could run into mental evidence, in fact President Reagan on several occasions alerted

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,120
concern about the potential hostilities from outer space.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,240
We know for a fact that the U.S. government has solid information about negative health

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,640
effects from being in the proximity of UAP UFOs.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,440
And people, Congress individuals will be speaking with the Department of Defense Inspector General.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,680
Now when they have this, it only took a couple of years to get this meeting to go to place,

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,040
but the idea is that the DODIG, they're going to work with Congress and kind of let them

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,760
know about some of the stuff going on.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,520
Secrets, cover-ups, and strange phenomena.

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,400
UFOs and ideas that challenge reality itself.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,600
All these mysteries, all this time, are we ever going to get to the bottom of these?

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,400
My name is George Knapp, I dig into news stories that others can't or won't.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,240
I'm Jeremy Corbell, and for some reason people tell me things they probably shouldn't.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,240
And this is Weaponize.

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Hey Jeremy, how you doing?

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
Good man, how you doing?

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Busy.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,200
Busy week in UFO world.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,240
Arrow came out with its long anticipated second report.

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
Did you read it?

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,840
Oh yeah, I read it, man.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
You know, it's the same thing.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,400
Oh, my little puppy's, my little boy's crying about the Arrow report.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,200
Everybody's crying about it.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Oh, okay.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,960
So yeah, man, it was kind of towing the line.

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,960
They use all these things, like during our investigation timeframe, we didn't find any

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,200
negative biological effects on people.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,560
It's like, it's really frustrating to people like you and me and people that know a broader

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
scope of the UFO history.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,960
You've got Sean Kirkpatrick, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, kind of like tallying up the recent, you know,

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,080
things that they've seen that the military has been able to film or document.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,840
But isn't the whole point of Arrow that there are these illegal programs that we have been

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:24,080
reverse engineering, that we have these things within private defense contractors, and they're

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
just playing around with things they see in the sky?

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,080
I mean, if we have these things on the ground and they've been notified of that, which we

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,520
know they have, what game are they playing?

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
I don't get it.

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,480
Well, it's a game that we've seen many times before.

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,180
I mean, we've seen this movie.

43
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,460
We saw it with Project Sign, which, you know, was the first really big Air Force study of

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,460
UFOs.

45
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,020
The staff members came up with what they thought was a compelling case that these were possibly

46
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,260
extraterrestrial, but they knew that they weren't ours.

47
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,660
And the guy who was the head of the Air Force at the time put the kibosh on it.

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,400
He wouldn't allow that report to be made public.

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,040
So then you have Projects Grudge and a blue book that came out that basically did their

50
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:11,340
to explain away UFO cases, even when the explanations were more outrageous than the possibility

51
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,140
that these are from somewhere else, some non-human intelligence.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,860
You know, Project Blue Book was a public relations exercise.

53
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,640
It's starting to feel like Arrow is the same thing.

54
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,980
You know, they're ostensibly supposed to investigate these sightings, and it sounds like they are.

55
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,420
I mean, in terms of the good news of what we heard this week, it's that Sean Kirkpatrick

56
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,700
saying that they've received dozens of reports per month.

57
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,580
So at least there is a flow of reports.

58
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,700
Some of the stigma has decreased to the point where military pilots and military witnesses

59
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,060
and some commercial pilots will go ahead and file reports.

60
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,380
That's a good thing.

61
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,540
It's good that they've got a total of 800 or so, which is up from 650 the last time.

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,320
You know, but you start to feel the creep of what we've seen before.

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,600
Half of these are easily explained.

64
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,520
They're balloons and drones.

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,560
Only two to 4% are truly anomalous, I think Kirkpatrick said, and require further investigation.

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,580
Only a very small percentage display, quote, unusual characteristics.

67
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,300
But it was interesting to me that Kirkpatrick gets out in front of this report.

68
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,720
He goes on CNN to spin it before the report is actually released.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,680
Were you, did that catch your attention?

70
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
It sure did.

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
I just have to say.

73
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
He's a little boy.

74
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
He's really crying about the error report.

75
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Right.

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
So there's nothing I can do.

77
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,560
He's going to do a little crime.

78
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,680
So yeah, that was something that really struck me was that we see immediately before this

79
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,840
report comes out, Dr. Kirkpatrick, you know, he straight up gives an interview to CNN to

80
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,280
absolutely try to spin it, try to put it in his favor.

81
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
And they were compliant.

82
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,080
They were like, oh, cool, great.

83
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,840
So it was really bizarre.

84
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,400
I just, you know, here's the deal.

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,640
You have always said that with Arrow, they have to earn our trust.

86
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
They haven't done that.

87
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,360
There have been lies for decades.

88
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
And I was like fighting for them.

89
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,400
I'm like, come on, man, this is really cool.

90
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,200
It's going to be okay.

91
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,640
But I do see what you're saying now, which is that the way everything is worded, it is

92
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,440
absolutely a whitewash.

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,480
And that's not even what we know.

94
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,600
They've been told and have not investigated or have covered up.

95
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,880
So when it comes to just reports coming in from the military, they go above and beyond

96
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,480
to try to dismiss and try to show us cases that are already resolved as if we need a

97
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,160
lesson on what that looks like when things are resolved.

98
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Right.

99
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,560
So, yeah, man, it's really, it's really annoying.

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:52,600
At the same time, I think the real frustration I have is that we know for sure David Grush

101
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:59,120
says we have the locations, I know the program names, I've got hostile and non-hostile witnesses,

102
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,640
but we know that Arrow is not pursuing that in a public way.

103
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,640
And they're even throwing it back in the face of the people that we know, some of whom we've

104
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,000
sent to testify to Arrow.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm never doing that again, by the way.

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,720
So yeah, man, it's really frustrating if people go read the Arrow report.

107
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,360
It's like this little bait and switch thing.

108
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,240
It makes you think that they're doing something legitimate, but then they're edging towards,

109
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,760
oh, we can verify everything.

110
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,220
This might be adversarial tech.

111
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,880
Did we have this adversarial tech before our military even existed?

112
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
I mean, come on.

113
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Yeah.

114
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,040
I thought Kirkpatrick's comments to CNN about Grush and other whistleblowers were pretty

115
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,180
telling in that he said something like he dismissed the sensational claims saying, quote,

116
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,460
He has no evidence that suggests anything is extraterrestrial in nature.

117
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,580
And I'm not sure that Dave Grush ever used the word extraterrestrial.

118
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,280
It was non-human intelligence.

119
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,740
And then he said, if anybody thinks they know what these things are, they should be coming

120
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,060
to talk to us.

121
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,500
That's why we've set up this entire architecture for people to securely come in and talk with

122
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
us.

123
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Well, you and I know people who have come in to talk to him, and they don't seem to

124
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,180
be taking their testimony very seriously.

125
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,380
We know people who have provided information to other alarms of the US government.

126
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,540
Arrow either hasn't paid attention to it or hasn't gone after it or hasn't read it.

127
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:28,980
And then, lastly, I guess, we know people who have been invited to speak with Arrow,

128
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,500
but are not going to get within 10 feet of that office.

129
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
They don't trust them.

130
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,340
They don't believe that they're doing an honest investigation.

131
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,700
And there's no way that they're going to come up and cough up what they know to Sean

132
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Kirkpatrick or his staff.

133
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:47,600
I mean, I would actually argue that they've taken very seriously the testimony, but they've

134
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,980
completely locked that in to not allow that to be part of public disclosure.

135
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,740
When people go and talk with Arrow, there's this new thing.

136
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,860
When they submit, it becomes part of an investigation.

137
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,500
They can no longer talk about it.

138
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
So they become silenced just because they went to Arrow.

139
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,340
That's what I'm hearing from people that did actually go and testify.

140
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,780
So it's kind of this catch-22 where I think they are taking things very seriously when

141
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,300
people say, I was in this program.

142
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
This was the name.

143
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
This is what we did.

144
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,580
It was exploitation of non-terrestrial, NHI, non-human intelligent craft.

145
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,900
And then they just lock it up.

146
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,700
So I think it's more diabolical than they're just not taking it seriously.

147
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,140
I think this is a positioned organization like Blue Book, like Project Sign, Project

148
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:36,420
Grudge, where they're trying to get as much information, oh, come tell us the information

149
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,580
and then lock that shit down.

150
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,500
That's the fear and the understanding of a lot of people that have come forward to them.

151
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:51,340
I am hopeful though, because we do know that on the 26th of next week, we do know that

152
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,980
Representative Burchett and people, Congress individuals will be speaking with the Department

153
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,700
of Defense Inspector General.

154
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,940
Now when they have this, it only took a couple of years to get this meeting to go to place.

155
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,340
The idea is that the DODIG, they're going to work with Congress and kind of let them

156
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,180
know about some of the stuff going on.

157
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,100
Now, I don't know how that meeting is going to go, but I'm hopeful that that meeting

158
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,460
is happening actually this week when people are listening to it.

159
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,260
It would be this week.

160
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,660
A couple of other things that Kirkpatrick has said or the report said that jumped out

161
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,540
at me, and this was the one that both of you and I reacted to off camera, offline, is that

162
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:42,300
they have found no evidence of adverse health effects documented to date, which is maybe

163
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,780
they haven't.

164
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,500
Maybe the cases they're getting mostly come from pilots and they're not getting close

165
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,300
up to these UFOs, whatever these objects are.

166
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,820
But we know for a fact that the US government has solid information about negative health

167
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,300
effects from being in the proximity of UAP UFOs.

168
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:07,580
There's a, Shanker Patrick could walk across the street to DIA and get the DIRD that was

169
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,100
part of the OSAP program.

170
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,500
Sorry for all the acronyms, but there was a report compiled that the guy who was in

171
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,100
charge of it is Kit Green, who worked for CIA for a number of years.

172
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,660
He's a neuroscientist, a medical doctor, and he cataloged all these hundreds, hundreds

173
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,860
of cases where there have been deleterious health effects caused by being in the proximity

174
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,900
to UFOs.

175
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:37,100
Burns and body marks and serious really weird diseases that pop up when people get too

176
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,300
close to these things.

177
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,580
It's hundreds of cases.

178
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,140
It's a DIRD that is now public information.

179
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,580
We posted on a mystery wire a couple of years ago.

180
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,100
You and I have talked about it before.

181
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,700
So the fact that Shanker Patrick seems blissfully unaware that this report exists is telling,

182
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,100
I think.

183
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,380
Right.

184
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,140
So I think they hide behind language because when you read it, it's like within the

185
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,420
reporting period.

186
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:05,820
How do you even have time to really look at the brain scans of individuals who had an

187
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,220
experience within that reporting time?

188
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,140
So they kind of hide behind language.

189
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,820
He is very well aware that there are negative impacts to human biology, including the brain,

190
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,020
when it comes to close proximity to UAP.

191
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,300
I don't know if he's read the great work of OSAP and these reports, the ones that you

192
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,500
released to the public showing that human beings have these really devastating biological

193
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,900
effects.

194
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,780
But remember when you asked Dr.

195
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,580
Colin Kelleher to come on Weaponize a number of episodes ago, he really brought this up.

196
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,700
He talked about this.

197
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,940
Now, remember, this is a, for our audience, this is the government's acknowledged biggest

198
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,540
ever acknowledged UFO program run through the DIA, but it was the one that was funded

199
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:56,540
for 22 million called OSAP, Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program.

200
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,220
And one of the DIRDs, the Defense Intelligence Reference documents that you released to the

201
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:11,820
public shows a really intense knowledge, a very studied knowledge of what UAP or UFOs

202
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,060
can do to the human body when people come into close proximity.

203
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,740
Not that they're actively targeting human beings in general, but just that close proximity

204
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,780
to that power source.

205
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,740
Although there are other cases like in Cholaris, which in this new episode we talked about.

206
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,060
So yeah, man, it's super frustrating.

207
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,940
An aspect of the UFO phenomenon is human health effects.

208
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,420
And Dr.

209
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,100
Kirkpatrick damn well knows that.

210
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,260
I think, yeah, we had some great comments from Colin Kelleher, a biochemist who was

211
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,540
directly involved with OSAP.

212
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,700
He was one of the program managers.

213
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,820
He oversaw a lot of the research into the health effects.

214
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,340
He was directly involved with it.

215
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,740
He told us about that months ago.

216
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,580
Somehow that information has never got to the Aero folks.

217
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,540
I'm not sure.

218
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,500
I know that Kirkpatrick said they have almost 40 people on staff for Aero now,

219
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,620
which is a great thing.

220
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,420
They need to ramp it up and maybe they'll be adding more.

221
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,340
I wonder how many of them are medical doctors or have some kind of medical experience where

222
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,660
they could actually have the expertise to investigate the possible health effects.

223
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,980
As we have said on this program before, they've been well documented for a long time.

224
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,540
One of them, I mean, there's John Burroughs, that guy who got too close to the Bentwaters UFO.

225
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,420
His injuries were severe enough that Senator John McCain authorized,

226
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,380
got him authorized to have federal health benefits because his injuries were directly

227
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,860
related to his service during the military.

228
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,500
That's right.

229
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,980
So I remember that because when I was with Ruben Langdon and he was putting on the citizen

230
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:52,460
hearing on disclosure, which everybody should watch, it's 40 witnesses and a week of testimony

231
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:59,900
in front of five Congress people and one Senator, John Burroughs was part of the Rendlesham Forest

232
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,780
UFO encounters and he had a heart problem.

233
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,780
They wouldn't admit that he was even there because it was a UFO incident.

234
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,340
It was all classified.

235
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,700
So when he testified at that panel that we all set up there, they couldn't believe it.

236
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,700
They wouldn't give him health benefits because of an injury he received because

237
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,300
of close proximity to UFOs.

238
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,300
So you're right.

239
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,740
John McCain jumped in.

240
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,060
That was a letter that everybody signed that was there.

241
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,020
We documented that signing and it worked.

242
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,020
They gave him full medical benefits.

243
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,500
He had a life-saving surgery on his heart.

244
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,820
Very weird thing happened, though, when he was in surgery.

245
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,820
The doctor got a call from a military individual telling them exactly what to do to repair this

246
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:51,020
issue that was caused by UAP and that showed knowledge of our military and exactly what UAP

247
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,420
does to the heart in that situation.

248
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,540
He then came forward and I have this also documented where he's thanking everybody for

249
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,300
putting this pressure on during the citizen hearing because it did save his life.

250
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,060
It gave him full benefits.

251
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,780
It's a really neat piece of footage, but it's part of history.

252
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,580
It's true.

253
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:13,340
So look, yeah, the investigations into leaks is an essential part of the way intelligence

254
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,060
agencies work.

255
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,540
I get that.

256
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,900
I take no offense on that.

257
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,540
You and I as journalists, no one's coming at us.

258
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,980
We're obtaining information.

259
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,460
We're releasing it for public good as long as we vetted it and we do our best.

260
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,700
So I do understand why these investigations are going.

261
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,180
Maybe you have a different opinion, but I understand it.

262
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,420
No, yeah, no, I agree.

263
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,460
Yeah, totally agree.

264
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:34,860
Sure.

265
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,140
Because I mean, there might be foreign agents involved in this stuff.

266
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,020
They're very interested in our UFO programs and what we know about this issue for sure.

267
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,980
Yeah, and you and I have been notified by numerous agencies at different times when

268
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,780
there's a new hack to signal or that kind of thing so we can shore up our security.

269
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,420
Because agencies know that we have people leaking to us all the time information

270
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,780
and they're more concerned that a foreign nation will get it than impeding upon the

271
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,580
work of journalists.

272
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,580
So I kind of admire that if it actually stays that way, but that's what you and I have

273
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,300
experienced.

274
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,020
So I don't know.

275
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:15,260
Hopefully we find you and I find the time during this season, which I know we will have

276
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:21,340
weaponized to put out information that we vetted and we think is worthy of public discourse.

277
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,100
Is that what you call a tease, Jeremy?

278
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,740
I'm just saying, man.

279
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,940
I'm just saying it's hard.

280
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,180
We got to make sure it's worthy.

281
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,300
What do they say?

282
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,820
The juice is worth the squeeze.

283
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,220
That's what you and I have been kind of wrestling with for some of it.

284
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,340
So Sean Kirkpatrick has now said they have around 40 people working for Arrow.

285
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:39,900
That's great.

286
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,260
We haven't known how many people they had working.

287
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,060
They wouldn't even tell Congress what kind of budget they had or anything or how many

288
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,100
staff members they had.

289
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,300
40 people working for Arrow.

290
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,780
That's great.

291
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,940
We'd like to hear from some of them, maybe.

292
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,420
I mean, I wonder how those folks go to work every day trying to figure out these UFO

293
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,820
cases, UAP incidents, and then they have Kirkpatrick saying, you know, we've explained

294
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,180
pretty much all of them.

295
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,300
I wonder if those folks go along with that, if they're frustrated.

296
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,020
But whatever, we're not bashing their work.

297
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,900
We're just asking questions about their boss and what he is sharing with the public.

298
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:14,780
Right.

299
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,140
And I think you and I are asking that because we have a little bit of insight into the

300
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,740
inner mechanics of how stuff is being portrayed publicly compared to, you know, whatever

301
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,820
information they may be getting.

302
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,180
So look, bottom line, let's bottom line it because we're about to talk about what

303
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,820
happened last week, which is really interesting with Dr.

304
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,180
Lukatsky and Dr.

305
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,980
Colin Kelleher.

306
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,700
I think people need to hear how we took that interview that we did last week.

307
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:44,460
But, you know, before that, I think just looking at the idea that, okay, great, you're

308
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,700
looking at military cases trying to discern what shape is this?

309
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,220
Is this a UFO?

310
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,340
What's going on here?

311
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,700
Hold on.

312
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,620
Hold on.

313
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:02,860
If we have craft and we are exploiting those craft and they are UFOs, this is a charade,

314
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,820
an absolute total charade.

315
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,980
Arrow is a charade.

316
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,140
And if that's the case, it's really frustrating.

317
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,340
And unfortunately, I believe that to be the case.

318
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,780
And there's a reason why.

319
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,460
So last week, you asked your pal, Dr.

320
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:25,980
James Lukatsky, who is a career DIA intelligence individual who ran the UFO program for the

321
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,300
United States government with Dr.

322
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,980
Colin Kelleher, who is the project manager when they got the contract for this DIA program.

323
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,860
And we had him on.

324
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,540
Only you could get guys like this on.

325
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,540
Dr. Lukatsky doesn't do a bunch of interviews.

326
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,140
He's a buy the book kind of guy.

327
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,900
So there he is.

328
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,260
And we're reading through his book.

329
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,940
And you show me a certain paragraph.

330
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,660
And in there, he straight admits it.

331
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,220
He admits that our government has a UFO in their possession.

332
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,020
He admits that they're trying to open it up, that they have an exploitation program

333
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,740
with the idea of reverse engineering.

334
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,340
And then he admits they were able to breach the hole.

335
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,900
And you just fly by it in the book.

336
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,940
But it's so frustrating.

337
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,820
I wanted to really look, they're friends of ours in a way.

338
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,780
We're not against them.

339
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,700
We understand they have to hold secrecy.

340
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,220
That's why they have these positions of power within the DIA because they're trustworthy.

341
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
But they done did set it.

342
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,580
They wrote it in the book.

343
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,860
So you and I pushed.

344
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,420
We pushed really damn hard and it was frustrating for us.

345
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,660
And sure enough, we get them to say, yes, those events happened.

346
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,100
What I said is true.

347
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,780
And that's as far as I can go.

348
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:40,860
I understand why many of our listeners expressed frustration with the interview

349
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,860
because there's only so far that Dr.

350
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,100
Lukatsky and Colin Kelleher were willing to go.

351
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,140
And beyond that, they're just not going to talk about it.

352
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,900
That approach has served Dr.

353
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,700
Lukatsky well.

354
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,820
I mean, he was a career intelligence analyst.

355
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,940
He worked for DIA for a couple of decades in the defense warning office.

356
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,460
He's walked the walk and talked the talk.

357
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:06,620
And he does not really support full disclosure of everything right away.

358
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,060
He's done it a bit at a time what he can get away with.

359
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,540
So, you know, we had skinwalkers at the Pentagon where we revealed a lot about OSAP.

360
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,220
If not for Dr. Lukatsky coming forward to me and Harry Reid in 2018,

361
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,500
we wouldn't know anything about it.

362
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,540
We would have still had the New York Times story about ATIP as being the only record

363
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,580
about that period of history, of UFO history.

364
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,740
But we met with him in Washington on St. Patrick's Day in 2018, and he laid it out

365
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,180
about the OSAP program that had received $22 million, what they did with the money,

366
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,580
showed me a variety of documentation that backed up what he had to say.

367
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:53,260
And if he had not come forward at that point and in subsequent releases and interviews,

368
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,700
we wouldn't know anything about this stuff.

369
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,780
So I understand people's frustration, but we've already learned a heck of a lot

370
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,580
from Dr. Lukatsky about what the government knew.

371
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:07,260
And he has done it incrementally as he could get away with it with permission from

372
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,820
the Dobser process for the books, the two books.

373
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,300
The Dobser approved this new book back in April.

374
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,780
And it approved basically the manuscript back in April.

375
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,820
We've tinkered with it, and I'm a co-author.

376
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,180
We tinkered with some of the content since then.

377
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,620
But Lukatsky wanted to include the fact that, yeah, it's true.

378
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,900
We do have a craft.

379
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,980
This is, I think, before Grush's big revelations before Congress.

380
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,100
And he was acknowledging that we've got one, that we gained access to the middle.

381
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,940
He could not say where it is.

382
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,780
He could not say who has it.

383
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,700
He couldn't say who exactly got into the craft itself.

384
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,540
But he shared with us what he could.

385
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,780
That's what he could do without going to prison.

386
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,700
Right.

387
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,940
So look, it's like stepping back a second.

388
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,860
Dr. Lukatsky admittedly, so the negative that I've heard about him is that he's glib

389
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,100
and he likes holding these secrets.

390
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,020
I don't see it that way at all.

391
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,380
He's a patriot.

392
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,220
He's worked in the DIA.

393
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,060
He ran this UFO program.

394
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,340
That's heroic of him to get that through the Dobser process where they look at what can

395
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,900
you say publicly and print it in a book.

396
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,060
He's just a buy the book kind of guy, which you've said is the kind of guy you want in

397
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,460
our intelligence agencies.

398
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,420
But it sounds like you've had a lot of interaction.

399
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,140
I know you've been a fly on a wall in a lot of places.

400
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,420
You have a little extra information that I think is public so you can kind of push a

401
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,540
little bit and I can push a little bit to try to get more out.

402
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,860
But I think don't let that be lost on you.

403
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:44,540
So if you watch that whole last episode of Weaponized again, it's not that you see

404
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,300
somebody trying to hide anything.

405
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,940
The guy is on our podcast for God's sake.

406
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,220
I mean, he's coming out trying to tell you something.

407
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,020
But he just has confines of which he can do that.

408
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,220
One news station did pick it up.

409
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,780
News Nation is really like on this UFO thing now and they really picked it up.

410
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,420
When they saw that episode, they're like, wait a second.

411
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,780
Wait a second.

412
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:13,180
You're saying the head of the DIA UFO program straight up admitted that we have a UFO.

413
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,060
The government does.

414
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,180
We've been exploiting it.

415
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,140
We got inside the hall.

416
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,700
I'm like, yep.

417
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,140
They're like, come on the news.

418
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,820
So I did that yesterday.

419
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,260
It was also to promote, by the way.

420
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,700
I just want to say there's a two-part special on George Knapp.

421
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,380
They released part one last week.

422
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,700
And by the time you hear this, part two will have been released and look it up.

423
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,900
It's so cool, George.

424
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,100
I just got to take a second.

425
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,460
It shows your reporting from the mob to politics to UFOs.

426
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,420
It shows how you got on this weird and wild path into UFO investigating with

427
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:48,380
the Bob Lazar interview as kind of like the thing that happened right after you interviewed

428
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,860
John Lear.

429
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,900
And he laid out this hypothesis of what's going on with the government covering up UFOs.

430
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,340
It was just such a cool thing.

431
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,020
I know you hate that kind of stuff.

432
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,660
But as a fan of this topic, it's cool to see how we got to where we are.

433
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:07,980
You were saying things 37 years ago that now we know are true.

434
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,820
And I know you didn't believe it back then.

435
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,420
You were investigating it.

436
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,820
But man, that's got to be kind of weird, George, to see your whole life out on display

437
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,700
when it comes to your investigations on another news network.

438
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,020
Yeah, it's weird.

439
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,660
It's odd.

440
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,900
And I have not seen that part one yet.

441
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,140
I just saw the first 10 minutes of it because Sunday night I have a radio show.

442
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,820
So I'm prepping for that.

443
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,780
I've got it recorded and I'll probably watch it later today or something.

444
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,220
But I have not seen part two.

445
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,500
But yeah, it is weird to see all that unfold.

446
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,180
And thank God they haven't got my whole life to show on television because there's

447
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,020
chunks of it that would not be pretty.

448
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:53,100
But yeah, it's interesting that the ideas and concepts that we pursued 36 or 37 years ago

449
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,140
and that people had a hard time swallowing back then are now almost mainstream.

450
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,580
I mean, we've come a long way.

451
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:07,100
But it's the same stuff that Lazar and others said back then is coming to fruition now.

452
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,900
And hopefully it keeps marching forward.

453
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:16,380
Yeah, that news, the guy, Brian, who did the news report that I was on yesterday,

454
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,220
he was like, look, for most people, this is kind of new information.

455
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,260
I was like frustrated.

456
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,460
I was like, this is like the movie.

457
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,580
Don't look up.

458
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,860
It's been so obvious.

459
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,100
This has been said, you know, for so long.

460
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,420
And he's like, but for most people who were not as educated on this.

461
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,180
And I was kind of set back.

462
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,300
I'm like, okay, no, I get it.

463
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,780
You're right.

464
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,740
You're right.

465
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,300
Let's start, you know, at level one here.

466
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
Yeah, I think it's a lot to process, though, Jeremy.

467
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,140
I mean, you interview people every day.

468
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,740
This is sort of your specialty.

469
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,740
For guys like me, mostly on the outside, you know, it's a lot to take in.

470
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,180
But what's interesting, since I've been interviewing and studying George Knapp,

471
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,020
your sort of partner in crime who's been doing this for almost 40 years,

472
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,220
you know, a lot of the stuff that you're breaking now

473
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,500
and the things that people are saying now,

474
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,980
he was reporting, you know, decades ago, like with Bob Lazar,

475
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:10,460
another person who worked out at Area 51, saw things and then first spoke with

476
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,220
George decades ago.

477
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,580
I want to play you a clip from the special on Sunday with Bob Lazar.

478
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,620
What's going on up there could be the most important event in history.

479
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:28,700
You're talking about contact, physical contact and proof from another system,

480
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,460
another planet, another intelligence.

481
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,820
That's got to be the biggest event in history.

482
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,380
Period.

483
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,020
And it's real.

484
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,860
And it's real and it's there.

485
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,540
But I want to bring us into so this idea that Dr. Lukatsky came on our show

486
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,060
and he verbally and on camera made this admission.

487
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,460
It was a huge deal.

488
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,100
Is you're officially allowed to tell us

489
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,020
that the United States government has in its possession a craft of unknown origin

490
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,820
and you were able to access the inside.

491
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,700
Is that correct?

492
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,740
The wording that you read is correct.

493
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,700
Ah, you're going beyond the wording.

494
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,260
No, I'm not.

495
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm not.

496
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,580
I'm asking you, did that happen?

497
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,900
And is it true?

498
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,540
And it's true.

499
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,300
Okay, you're telling us you told us because you were allowed to tell us

500
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,340
that our government has a UFO in its possession

501
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,900
and has been able to access the inside of it, right?

502
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,580
Yes.

503
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,860
It made me kind of go back and look at the archives.

504
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,620
And one of the things that I found was this guy,

505
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,380
this researcher, this UFO researcher named Bob Exler.

506
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,580
And he had this, I kind of famously in my mind,

507
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,620
he had this interview with Admiral Bobby Ray Inman.

508
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:51,980
And Admiral Inman was, I mean, this guy was, his career was incredible.

509
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,580
So let me break this down real quick.

510
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,220
I want to play some clips and get your thoughts, George.

511
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,060
So Bob Exler was a national mission specialist.

512
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,500
A serious guy from what I understand from looking through his history,

513
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,580
he interviewed Admiral Inman.

514
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,020
And that was once Inman was out of the military.

515
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,340
But Admiral Inman, just check this out.

516
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:17,420
This guy in military and intelligence, he was the director of the DNI,

517
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,420
the Naval Intelligence until 1976, which is the role,

518
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:26,220
the same role that Scott Bray now holds from what I understand.

519
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,660
So Scott Bray was one of the guys that was kind of like nothing to see here,

520
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,140
move along in that first UFO hearing.

521
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,300
So that's Inman held that role back in 1976.

522
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,260
Then he was the vice director of the DIA until 1977.

523
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,420
Then he was the director of the NSA until 1981.

524
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,060
Then the deputy director of the CIA until 1982.

525
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:56,220
So 1981 and 82, he was both the director of the NSA and the CIA simultaneously,

526
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,340
which is crazy because he'd write one thing that he wanted authorized

527
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,500
and he'd approve it himself from what I hear.

528
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,660
So it was a lot of power this guy had.

529
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,740
So this is a guy in position to know.

530
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,100
With that said, oh, by the way, and then private industry.

531
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,460
So after his military career, he went on the board of SAIC,

532
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,340
Science, Applications, International Corporation.

533
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,020
What is SAIC, George?

534
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,220
Well, that's one of those big Pentagon contractors.

535
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,140
Those two of us who believe there is UFO information

536
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,420
and craft and materials stashed suspect that SAIC would be one of the likely candidates

537
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,220
to get that stuff.

538
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,140
It's right in the heart of the larger conspiracy lore.

539
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,180
You can't prove it for sure, but there are a lot of arrows

540
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,220
pointing toward SAIC as being directly involved with this.

541
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,740
So when he leaves all those multi-letter agencies and then goes to SAIC, another acronym,

542
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,500
a lot of eyebrows were raised and suspicions.

543
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,300
Bob Exler, as you mentioned, he was a UFO guy.

544
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,860
He got into the UFO field in the late 80s,

545
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,580
right around the time that I joined the cause, the investigation,

546
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,740
and stayed into it in the mid-90s.

547
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,740
He played a role in the Bob Lazar investigation that we can talk about later,

548
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:19,900
but he knew enough of the lingo to talk his way into a phone call with Bobby Ray Inman.

549
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,220
Wow, the stuff that came out and what Inman thought was an off-the-record conversation

550
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,940
is pretty amazing.

551
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,700
Yeah, so we're talking about an admission from a DIA official when it comes to Dr.

552
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,700
Lukaski, but he was authorized to admit the three things he did.

553
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,260
Our government has at least one UFO that we've been exploiting it,

554
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,060
trying to get inside of it, and then we did that we got inside the hall.

555
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,820
So that's one thing that we learned.

556
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,220
But going back to this Exler interview that I found, I want to see what you think about it.

557
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,780
So the first clip is just him kind of giving us a basic understanding of where he's coming from.

558
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,260
Talks about the paper trail, and I think that is how you got involved with this too,

559
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:03,100
is that our government is hiding something from us, and that pissed you off.

560
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,540
So let me play this first clip with Bob Exler.

561
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,220
What is it?

562
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,100
24 seconds.

563
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,780
I just want you to hear what he said.

564
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,060
And this is probably 1997, just for context.

565
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,660
Let's hear what he has to say.

566
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,260
I started out extremely skeptical about this whole thing.

567
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,340
I thought this was just rubbish from the tabloids,

568
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:27,340
but I was surprised to find thousands of U.S. government documents from intelligence agencies

569
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,580
that tended to indicate that there was a little bit more to this than met the eye.

570
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,740
So I went to seek guidance from the various highest levels of the United States intelligence

571
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,420
community, and I was quite alarmed at what I was able to learn.

572
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,340
Does that sound familiar to you?

573
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:52,220
I think we met Exler in 1989 at the MUFON conference and then stayed in touch with him

574
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,140
over the next couple of years, until up to that point.

575
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,700
And yeah, his voice rings a bell with me, sure.

576
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,020
Yeah, but I mean, also just like getting hooked on it because you realize there's all these

577
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,660
documents that are leading towards we're studying UFOs.

578
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,020
We take it very seriously.

579
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,620
He got hooked and he had access.

580
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,140
That's kind of what happened to you.

581
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,020
Yeah, exactly.

582
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,540
That's exactly the path I followed.

583
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,780
All right, so let's now listen.

584
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,620
There's just a 58 second thing, a new thing from that same interview.

585
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,940
I want to lead us into this interview that he had with Admiral Inman,

586
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,140
who made an absolute astonishing admission.

587
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,980
So let's hear him set it up again.

588
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:34,060
This is Bob Exler, who was investigating this, a NASA specialist who really got

589
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,460
bit by the UFO bug and was like, I want to find out what's going on.

590
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,820
Here's his next little clip.

591
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,500
I had contacted Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security Agency

592
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,460
in the United States, Deputy Director at CIA, Director of Naval Intelligence and a variety

593
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,980
of intelligence posts, a technologist and clearly someone that if this was really

594
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,660
accurate, that there really were UFOs and non-human intelligence around,

595
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,500
this is a man who had to know.

596
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,060
So I was able to contact him thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton

597
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:13,340
here in the UK, and this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that

598
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,340
these issues were covered under national secrecy laws, but that the United States

599
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,260
government did in fact have possession of the hardware associated with this.

600
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,420
In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon as a craft, a spaceship, several

601
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:30,060
of them, and they were in operational condition, which I assume suggested that they had been

602
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,660
in contact, that they had been given these craft for some reason or another, because

603
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,500
they certainly weren't crashed vehicles.

604
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,220
Wow. So here's a guy, he's a UFO investigator, he's got high credibility, he's got some

605
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,380
insight in the intelligence community because of his role at NASA, and he's like, I'm going

606
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,620
to call this guy, Admiral Inman, and I'm going to get through to him.

607
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,500
Now, I don't think he legally recorded this recording you're about to hear,

608
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,420
but it was an admission. He said, we have craft. They're not just crashed, almost as

609
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,700
like they're given to us, which would mean we have some sort of communication.

610
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,220
Where have we heard this before?

611
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:09,500
Bob Lazar, maybe. Yeah, yeah, and a lot. And now, now where we are now with that, there's

612
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,860
multiple craft, not just one, like Lukatsky, Dr. Lukatsky was able to admit, but like multiple

613
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,860
craft. So let's play this audio and again, understand the gravity, who he's talking with,

614
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:27,100
this former head of the CIA, DNI, I mean, NSA, this guy was involved in every intelligence

615
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:33,180
agency. He was a really respected and really trusted guy. I don't think he knew he was

616
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,580
being recorded. He was talking with a colleague is what he thought. But wow, let me play this

617
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:45,420
for you 25 seconds. Just hear what he said. Do you anticipate that any of the recovered

618
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:53,820
vehicles would ever be become available for technological research outside of the military

619
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:11,020
circles? So 10 years ago, he says the answer would have been no, none of this is coming

620
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,100
out. It's not going to get out to this broader scientific community. So that would have made

621
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:22,220
it about 1987. No way. But he's saying maybe now, maybe now this stuff is going to be able to leak

622
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:29,100
out. Again, this is in 97. Here we are in 2024. We're just starting to see maybe some of this

623
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,700
kind of coming out. Maybe, maybe this big mystery is going to crack open a little bit.

624
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:40,940
Yeah, 26 years later, we're finally seeing little glimpses of it. I don't think that the leaks,

625
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,420
what we're getting right now is part of some master plan, though. I think that the hand of those

626
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:51,020
folks keeping the secrets has been forced on this. And we know right now that the pushback is

627
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:57,180
underway in Washington at the Pentagon and other places. They're trying to plug the leaks right now.

628
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,580
Right. And so another thing that happened this week that's really interesting, or last week,

629
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:10,300
is that they got a skiff for David Grush to be able to go into or the documents that he has,

630
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:16,220
the reports that he has go into and inform people like Representative Burchett and others who have

631
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:21,100
the authority. So finally they got that skiff. Do you remember that? It was so weird. You and I have

632
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:28,540
been in skiffs. That's no problem for us. Why wouldn't they let a decorated intelligence officer

633
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:34,780
tell Congress for oversight what they need to know? Well, luckily we're there and we saw a post by

634
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,580
Representative Luna that they got the skiff. And I confirmed that with

635
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:46,060
Representative Burchett. So they're going to be able to hear what David Grush couldn't say

636
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,500
in the congressional hearing. Are you optimistic about that?

637
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,260
I'll believe it when I see it. I mean, they've already run into substantial opposition from

638
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,460
within their own party in the House. And, you know, I suspect that there's the hand of some

639
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,900
Pentagon folks and defense contractors who's been pressuring senior members of the House,

640
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:11,660
the Republican leadership to stop this, which is why there's been a problem in getting a skiff

641
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,380
approved, which is ridiculous. They should have had that as soon as they wanted it, asked for it.

642
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm hopeful that they get to hear it. I'm hopeful the public gets to learn some of what they

643
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,740
are shared with, but it might be a test case, you know, where they're going to give them little

644
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:31,340
breadcrumbs and see who leaks what to see how much further information they'll get down the line.

645
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,060
And for our audience that's listening or watching, if you don't know what a skiff is,

646
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:41,340
it's just a secure facility where you can transmit classified information if everybody in that skiff,

647
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,420
you know, has the proper clearance. So it's one thing to get a skiff, but it's another thing to

648
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,780
make sure that everybody has proper clearance. But from what I understand, David Grush is going

649
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:58,780
to be able to tell them not only the program names for these exploitation or reverse engineering

650
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:04,860
programs for UFOs, but he's also going to be able to tell them a list of hostile and non-hostile

651
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:09,420
witnesses, people that want to talk and tell you that they've been working on these craft, first

652
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:17,820
direct firsthand individuals working on non-human intelligence craft, but also from program names

653
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,620
to, you know, this direct testimony of people working on the crafts, that kind of thing.

654
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:30,620
But also the locations, the locations, the holding locations of these non-human intelligence craft.

655
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:36,380
Look, man, that will be huge. If you got somebody like Representative Burchett in there,

656
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:42,140
and he hears this information, like he'll keep it confident, but he will push even harder to

657
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:48,380
get that information out. And with that meeting coming up with the DOD Inspector General, man,

658
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:54,380
it feels to me like it's colliding, like everything's colliding. Like I am optimistic

659
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:59,180
because we have rogue individuals trying to do it right, like David Grush. I feel like we're

660
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:05,020
going to make progress. I really hope so. I'm optimistic. Well, I am too. I mean, you know,

661
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:10,300
we've talked about it before on this program and elsewhere that national security implications are

662
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:15,340
inherent in this topic. You can't get around it because the technology, if you could figure out

663
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:21,420
how to reverse engineer it, how it works, it'd be an incredible boon to our defense establishment,

664
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,860
to the Pentagon, DOD, intelligence agencies, everybody. I mean, the weapons potential alone

665
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,420
would be tremendous. We're worried that our adversaries are doing the same thing, that Russia

666
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,380
and China and maybe some other countries are investigating this and trying to get a leap

667
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:42,220
forward in technology as an advantage over us. So national security is baked into this,

668
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:47,260
which is one reason that James Lukatsky has been reluctant to spill all the beans that he might

669
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:53,980
know. He worries that appearing before Congress, even behind closed doors, would lead to leaks.

670
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,620
And it would be the equivalent of telling Congress would almost be like telling Red

671
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:03,420
China in some words that I have heard. So, you know, I know people are mad at him because he

672
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,940
didn't tell everything he knew at once. But of course, you know, in UFO world, people are

673
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,460
always mad about something. But he told us what he could, what he was authorized to say,

674
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:21,420
and didn't want to go beyond it. But he's hoping to push the topic forward in coming months and

675
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,700
years. So I know people are mad at James Lukatsky right now, but I think he went as far as he can.

676
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:32,140
And as he has told us, there are national security implications baked into this topic,

677
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,180
and that will apply to Tim Burchett and Luna and other members of Congress who want to push the

678
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:42,700
ball forward. Yeah, I'm really glad you brought that up. And people are kind of like pissed. They

679
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,580
watched last weaponized. They think he's being evasive and Dr. Callum Keller her too. But I'm

680
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:53,260
going to remind everybody. So Dr. Lukatsky made it clear. He says national security is the number

681
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:59,100
one most important thing. This is the kind of guy we trust in the DIA. You know, he's doing his best.

682
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:04,620
He says, I'm not for disclosure when it hurts national security. But you know, obviously he

683
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:09,020
is to some degree because he's trying. He's making an effort to get this information out.

684
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:15,580
I will remind people that when we interviewed Dr. Keller her on our show, that was the first

685
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:21,500
time we had somebody running the as the program manager for the acknowledged UFO program called

686
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:28,940
awesome. He admitted that we had UFOs in government possession. He just came right up to that line.

687
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:34,620
And when I asked him, he said, yes. And that was a that was a bombshell back then. There were no

688
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:41,260
details before this this new book. There were no details. He just says, yes, we have them. And I'm

689
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:46,140
like, oh, cool. So that was something that we were able to break back then. But now there's more meat

690
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:50,300
on the bone with Dr. Lukatsky giving a little bit more information that we were exploiting it,

691
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,660
trying to get inside the hole. And we did. So look, there's another thing I want to play for you.

692
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,580
There's this little clip. There's this guy named Tom King who was in Admiral Inman's office.

693
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:08,140
So after Exler made this announcement on television or maybe just before that,

694
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:13,020
he's like, can I go public with this? And they were like, nope, it would be a big problem.

695
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:17,180
And it was just a cool little audio. They left it on his voicemail. And I thought we should play

696
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,780
it because this is the kind of call you and I have got. This is the kind of call we're like,

697
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,580
no, don't do that. So I just want to play this real quick. It's 17 seconds. But listen to this

698
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:31,340
guy, Tom King from Admiral Inman's office, kind of tell Exler, don't go public with this. Check this

699
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:38,380
out. Mr. Exler, this is Tom King in Admiral Inman's office. Yes, you would be breaching

700
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:45,020
confidence and or a violation. Discussing his involvement in any matter.

701
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:52,300
Right. So you would be breaching not only confidence, but it would be a violation of laws

702
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:58,620
in discussing, you know, Admiral Inman's involvement in any manner. I mean, man,

703
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:05,100
that kind of call is really, it sucks to get. Yeah, I love that mood music that was playing

704
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,460
in the background there. I don't know whether he said a hookah lounge or what was that?

705
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,420
That was just, I grabbed something online where I got the audio and it had like dramatic music

706
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,460
from a TV show. Well, I would just say that there are, you know, the pushback is real.

707
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:23,260
There are people that do not want this to come forward. That was 1997 when those exchanges

708
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:29,740
happened. We're still waiting for that crowd to come forward with what they know. I would

709
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,940
remind people that Lukatsky and Kelleher and Bigelow, when they were involved with OSAP,

710
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:40,060
they were trying to track this stuff down. In Skinwalkers at the Pentagon, we had a section

711
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:45,020
where we described one reason for the demise of OSAP is they went knocking on the doors

712
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:50,380
of people who were the keepers of the secrets, trying to access what they thought was a reverse

713
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,340
engineering program and the doors were slammed in their face and then the knives were out for OSAP

714
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:00,540
and that was the beginning of the end for the program. I noticed, so there's two more clips

715
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:08,140
I want to play where Bob Exler kind of goes big picture, like why the secrecy? Because everybody

716
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:13,820
wants to know this. Why the secrecy? Why no great photographs? Like why the secrecy? But before I

717
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,540
do that, I remember in our last episode of Weaponize, I mean, you were getting pretty annoyed

718
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:23,260
too. You're getting pretty heated and you asked them because you felt like, gosh, let's just say

719
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:29,020
it. But one of the things you really focused in on is, look, you guys went, so Dr. Colin Kelleher and

720
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,900
Dr. Lukatsky were trying to figure out where the good, as you say, the goodies are held, where the

721
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,700
UFOs, where the saucers are held and you were really pushing them on that. Can you explain that

722
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:46,540
a little bit? Well, you could sense that I've had these conversations before with those guys in

723
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,980
private and it has gone a little bit further, well, much further than what we're allowed to say in

724
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:58,220
public. So I was trying to encourage Dr. Lukatsky to use the platform available to go ahead and say

725
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:03,660
more about it and I wasn't getting anywhere with either one of them. They're my friends, they're my

726
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,980
co-authors. I know them really well and you do too. So we wanted to get what we could while the

727
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:17,660
moment was available to us. So we tried and we're still in good terms with those guys, but

728
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:23,820
that's our job, is to try to push a little bit further. Yeah, and they respect it and I'm sure

729
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:30,140
in some way they want to be pushed further. And I think we definitely got Lukatsky just that one

730
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,860
millimeter further when he says, yes, it's true. Yes, it happened or whatever. I was like, whoa.

731
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:41,020
So, but yeah, it's got to be frustrating to you all these years. Again, looking back, if you watch

732
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:46,700
the new special, you see that you've been on this case from the beginning. I mean, everything John

733
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:52,780
Lear was saying to you sounded so crazy back in the day in 1987 or wherever you first interviewed

734
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:58,300
him. But along the way, we've learned so much of this is real. So I want to think big picture now.

735
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:04,060
I want to think about the same interview with Exler. He kind of said some really profound

736
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:08,780
things. Let me play you a clip. It's about it's a minute and a half and it's just kind of how he

737
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:15,820
threw down. And I believe it's 1997 when this was done, this interview, but just hear what he had

738
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:20,220
to say a minute and a half. And I want to get your response. Check this out. His governments,

739
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:25,020
the Canadian government, the American government, if they are in possession of spacecraft, if they

740
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:31,740
have made contact with aliens, why don't they tell us? What I was able to learn is that the

741
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:39,100
issue of secrecy dates back into the early 1950s. And in 1959, actually, NASA had a study

742
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,980
conducted by the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., addressing the issue of whether

743
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,780
this alarming issue of a confrontation with an extraterrestrial culture should be released to

744
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:56,700
the public, this information. It was determined that there would be grave consequences for just

745
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:02,460
an overt public pronouncement by government officials. What does that mean? We would all

746
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:09,260
panic. Well, not necessarily just panic, but the issues that it presented, not only theology,

747
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:16,620
but issues involving economics, standards of monetary concerns. If you acknowledge a type

748
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,420
of technology that renders fossil fuel-related industries obsolete, for example, you have

749
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,660
grave consequences economically all the way around the world. All our values are rendered.

750
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:31,420
So the determination was made that the only way to avoid this chaos would be through a slow

751
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:37,660
indoctrination process over a matter of decades. The decisions to maintain secrecy regarding this

752
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:45,740
center more around not upsetting the economic apple cart, religion, theology issues that come

753
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:50,620
into play, and quite a number of issues that essentially center around science and technology.

754
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,100
How does that hold up now, all these years later, what he was saying?

755
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:01,100
Well, I think some of those concerns are still a reason to keep this stuff secret.

756
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:06,300
There would be disruption of the world's economy, the fossil fuel industry. At a time when our

757
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:12,060
planet is baking and climate change is real and we're seeing the consequences all over,

758
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:17,500
maybe it is time to reevaluate our reliance on fossil fuels. Do we just keep going with that

759
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:23,340
and cook the planet even though it's as dire consequences for the future of humanity?

760
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:30,220
There would be repercussions if we released this stuff. But as Exler says, and as many people have

761
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:35,180
said, and as the Brookings report said, you'd have to do this over time. Well, it's been a long time.

762
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:40,460
That Brookings report came out in 1960. We're a long way down the road. We're 63 years

763
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:48,140
since then. I think the public is ready for it. I think we have been conditioned to accept it,

764
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:53,980
and I don't think there would be tremendous turmoil in religious circles or social institutions would

765
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:59,100
necessarily collapse, depending on what the ultimate truth really is. We don't know what it is yet.

766
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:05,180
Yeah, and just to kind of affirm and confirm to people, like, look, you and I were interested

767
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,900
in this. You've been doing this for so long. We're not part of some government conspiracy. I mean,

768
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,220
look, that would be super fun if we were leaked stuff so we could put it out, just, you know,

769
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:19,980
Machiavellian messing with the consciousness of humanity across the globe about UFOs. I wish my

770
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,780
life was that exciting. We're hungry for the information, too. This is not an organized

771
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:31,020
attempt. In fact, we've had to fight for every millimeter when it comes to confirmation of this

772
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:35,900
information. But just hearing Exler talk about that, look, this has been something that we have

773
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,940
been kind of fighting for for a long time. It's been so obvious, again, like that movie, Don't

774
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:46,780
Look Up. It's so obvious if you really get in there and start looking. And now that we know a

775
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:51,980
lot of the people involved, they're not coming forward willingly. We're having to pull teeth.

776
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:58,380
Now, the next thing is the legislation. This has not been finally decided yet,

777
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:04,060
but we are in a good place. If this legislation goes through as powerfully, the UFO legislation

778
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,940
right now and the National Defense Authorization Act and the Intelligence Authorization Act,

779
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:15,500
man, it's going to put pressure on private industry where this technology that you and I know has been

780
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:21,500
sequestered to, to say, what do you got? You can keep it. You know, us as the government can't

781
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,540
directly work on it. We want you to keep it, but you got to admit it. We have to have oversight.

782
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:32,620
So I'm hopeful, fingers crossed, it will be a huge day if that legislation, Schumer's legislation,

783
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:38,380
if that gets passed and President Biden signs it, it's going to have major impact.

784
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:43,660
Closest thing we'll ever get to confirmation is right now. Yeah, I mean, I'm almost hopeful,

785
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,660
which is incredible because I'm usually pessimistic. I'm also hopeful, almost hopeful

786
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:54,060
that that legislation will pass. But as we have discussed here many times, you know, it's always

787
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:59,100
unpredictable. UFOs have been on the front burner in the past. There's peaks and valleys of public

788
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:05,180
interest and congressional interest. And something always comes along that trumps UFOs. Right now,

789
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:09,260
Congress is a mess. You know, the House of Representatives can't pick its next leader.

790
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:15,820
They're shut down, in essence. There's no going forward on budgets. There's still the looming

791
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,900
possibility that there will shut down the U.S. government. There's impeachment proceedings

792
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:24,540
against President Biden. There's war in the Ukraine. There's terror in the Middle East.

793
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:30,540
There's always something more important and more pressing than UFOs. So I'd like to say that I am

794
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:37,820
hopeful. I am a little bit, but I'll believe it when I see it. So let me play this last part.

795
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:44,220
It's a minute and 11 seconds. And this is again, Bob Exler. And he's kind of summarizing kind of

796
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,860
what's going on, this idea that we might not be the top of the food chain. I just want to give it

797
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:54,060
as food for thought as we end this episode of Weaponize. So check this out. We do have to come

798
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:59,260
to grips with the reality that perhaps human beings aren't the only intelligence in the

799
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:05,580
universe and that they have in fact been here to visit in spite of projects like the NASA SETI

800
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:10,540
project, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in deep space. There are serious

801
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:16,060
issues associated with this. And we have a mentality where we like to kind of poke fun at

802
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,860
the issue through tabloids and so forth. You know, if there's one that comes, there's obviously going

803
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,940
to be more. And just like we have different species of humans on this planet, I'm quite certain

804
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:30,460
there's different species of alien life forms. So we could run into mental evidence. In fact,

805
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:36,460
President Reagan on several occasions alerted concern about the potential hostilities from

806
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:41,820
outer space and why it would be important for us to work together on this planet with superpowers

807
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:47,580
and so on uniting. Clearly the problem that we're confronted with here is that although

808
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:52,940
technologically these beings may be more intelligent than us, we appear to be more

809
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:58,860
advanced in areas of civility. We have emotions and things like that. We have concern for our

810
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:04,140
fellow man, whereas that doesn't seem to be the case necessarily in some of these other cultures.

811
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:10,300
What do you think of that? Well, it raises the kind of big questions that we tackle all the time.

812
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:15,500
I mean, the fact is we don't know the ultimate truth. I don't know, we don't know anybody who

813
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:21,500
knows all of it. David Grush, Jim Lakatsky, Callum Kelleher, Robert Bigelow, Bob Lazar,

814
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:27,820
all those guys know more than we do maybe, but we're not quite sure what the ultimate truth is.

815
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:32,860
So it's hard to predict what the effect on society will be, what the effect on the planet will be,

816
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:37,740
and we don't know what it is that's going to be disclosed. We have a long way to go on this,

817
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:43,100
and there are legitimate concerns both for national security and how the public handles

818
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,940
whatever the disclosure might be. The best we can do is keep plugging away at it.

819
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:54,060
Yeah, it reminds me, I saw this thing recently where President Gorbachev, where he came out

820
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:58,940
way later, and there was this meeting that he had with Reagan where they were walking alone,

821
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:03,180
and they dismissed all of their individuals surrounding them. And I think Reagan was in

822
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:08,460
Russia at the time, and they were taking a walk. And Gorbachev admitted that what Reagan said to

823
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:13,100
him, and this is like, he admitted it, like this video of this, he says, you know, look,

824
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:18,140
if we were, if the United States was attacked by an extraterrestrial species, would you guys defend

825
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:24,060
us? Would you guys have our back? And Gorbachev said, absolutely. And so did Reagan. So at that

826
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:29,020
time, when you see him at the UN making those big statements about if we were attacked by somebody

827
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:34,860
else, you know, that came from something, that came from the idea that we don't know what this is.

828
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:41,980
And I do believe now it appears that we have technology of unknown origin from what appears

829
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:47,180
to be non-human intelligence. Was that given to us? Or is that something that we got from a crash

830
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,460
retrieval? These are big questions. We just don't know. But David Grush says that he has the holding

831
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:59,260
locations. I know he actually does. So the holding locations of these crap, full on UFOs. We are this

832
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:05,660
close if we keep pushing within the next year or so to get more information on this. So I will

833
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:11,740
kind of remain optimistic until proven otherwise. It's an exciting time to study the UFO topic.

834
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,980
It's got to be exciting for you to see all this coming out.

835
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,060
Oh, very much so. Yeah. After all these years. You know, there was the late Stan Friedman used to say

836
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:24,700
one reason for the cover-up could be that when the people of Earth start thinking of themselves as

837
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:29,820
Earthlings rather than as Americans or Russians. Well, no government in the world wants that.

838
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:35,340
They don't want us to think on a global scale. They like the idea of us being nationalistic and

839
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:40,700
provincial. So that might be a reason why it's been so hard to get some of them to cough up what they

840
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:45,660
know. We'll see. We'll see where it goes. All right, man. Well, thanks so much. And I know

841
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:50,860
that with the remaining episodes of Weaponized for this season, I hope that we can put some

842
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:54,460
really great stuff into those episodes. Everybody stay tuned and thanks so much,

843
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,060
George. Talk to you later.
