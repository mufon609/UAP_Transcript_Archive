00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hello everybody, welcome back to the podcast. Before I begin, I just wanted to

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,960
talk to you about the subject matters of this episode. This episode isn't about

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,600
finding answers, but about having conversations that can establish new

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,400
pathways to thinking about subjects that don't have easy answers. My guest is the

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,760
author of three books, Hunt for the Skinwalker, Skinwalkers at the Pentagon,

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,880
and Brain Trust. All three of these books tackle difficult subject matters. My goal

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,800
going into this is to have a transparent open-minded discourse, not disrupted by

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,720
dogmatic narratives or corrupted by mainstream expectations, and to do so

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,200
without worrying about stigma on the subjects herein. I desire to embrace a

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,200
truth of reality that doesn't conform to our natural desires for a well-defined

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,160
binary reality, and to accept the truth that actual reality is gray. It is blurred

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,640
and existing in a quantum field of information that we don't yet fully

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,560
understand. On the podcast and in my life, I do not doubt the experiences of others,

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,280
and I urge you to adopt a similar philosophy. It is in this that we will be

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,400
able to truly listen and maybe eventually find the answers we so

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,480
desperately desire. When I talk about the paranormal in this episode, it's the

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,320
full spectrum. Ghosts, cryptids, UFOs, precognition, whatever isn't normal to

18
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,400
our everyday lives. Some of the descriptions of paranormal anomalies will

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,600
overlap with stories that exist in some religious beliefs, but it's important to

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,200
view these concepts as part of the natural world and not concepts to fear

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,680
out of religious taboo. If we're going to get an accurate idea of what it is

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,080
we're actually looking at, experiencing, and responding to, then we must grow up

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,200
and out of our fear-based preconceptions of what is or isn't off-limits to

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,560
scientific study. Due to the complexity of the subject matters herein, I decided

25
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,600
to separate the conversation into two episodes. The first part goes live

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,360
January 3rd, and the second part goes live January 10th. With that said, please

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,040
share this conversation with your friends who might be interested in the

28
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,280
subject. Additionally, I'll be clipping the episode and including these clips on

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,080
my YouTube channel, so if there are specific parts of the conversation you

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,080
prefer to share, please consider sharing the clips. And please, don't forget to

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,640
subscribe and participate in the discourse by leaving a comment on the

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,720
YouTube version of this episode or any of the clips. Thanks, and on with the

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,280
conversation.

34
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:31,560
I reached out to you because I had never made the hypothetical connection between

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,520
mutilations and our food supply, and so I was thinking maybe we could have a

36
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,520
conversation where we kind of start with your book from 2004, Brain Trust, right,

37
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:53,360
and then progress to mutilations and then go into the Pentagon. Yeah, yeah,

38
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,160
Skinwalkers. Well, you know, the name is unfortunate. Well, it's not really

39
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:07,800
unfortunate because, you know, the Skinwalker legend was totally

40
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,600
non-existent until the publication of that first book, Hunt for the Skinwalker,

41
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,640
and sort of put the whole thing on the map. And the idea that Department of

42
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,720
Defense officials were actually getting face-to-face with a lot of weird stuff,

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,960
that's where the title came from. But I think outside the small UFO community,

44
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,080
it's almost meaningless to a lot of people, but actually a lot of people have

45
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,040
been affected at the Department of Defense. That's interesting. And yeah, I

46
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,200
definitely want to go there. And I'm thinking, too, like, some of my questions

47
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,920
you might not have a direct experience with, but certainly you probably have

48
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,880
thoughts on. You probably heard some of the same stuff. And so I figured, you

49
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,200
know, you just let me know. Or if you want to skip them, that's fine, too.

50
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,960
But yeah, I just kind of take a loosey-goosey conversational approach.

51
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,800
And I am being informed that I have to talk to you now. I'm gonna shut my phone

52
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:16,960
off. Yeah, this is, uh, this is my annotations for Hunt.

53
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:24,640
Wow. That's Hunt for the Skinwalker. That's not even the recent one.

54
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,320
Yeah, I do all of them. And I did, Brain Traps was only available through Kindle,

55
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,280
so I can't show that to you. I think we should do a one-on-one, if that's okay

56
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:46,680
with you, on kind of how you got your research into Alzheimer's going and just

57
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:54,560
making some of those basic connections between cows, Alzheimer's. People aren't

58
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,240
going to know what prions are or prions. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right,

59
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,600
but I think it's protein, right? Yeah, they're essentially infectious proteins,

60
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:14,800
which is a real kind of strange anomaly, because all infectious organisms usually

61
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,080
are associated with either viruses or bacteria or some kind of combination of

62
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:31,920
both. But the fact that proteins can display infectious behavior really came

63
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:42,080
out of Stanley Prusner's research, who got a Nobel Prize. And the previous sort of

64
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,160
assumptions about this infectious entity that was associated with transmission of

65
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,800
these weird neurodegenerative diseases that became known as mad cow disease in cows

66
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,360
and chronic wasting disease in deer. Well, there was a sort of an assumption that there was some

67
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,160
kind of virus involved. I mean, that was the original assumption until sort of Stanley

68
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,720
Prusner really started putting the idea of infectious proteins on the map. And I mean,

69
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,200
everybody carries prions. And when prions are in a particular conformation shape,

70
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:30,680
then they do a lot of good in the cell. But it's when they flip to this alternative conformation

71
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:39,240
is when they start really wreaking havoc on the cell. And then as time goes on, on the larger

72
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,160
tissue, which is the brain. And the standard way of looking at the brain after

73
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:54,280
infectious prions is almost like Swiss cheese. I mean, there's big holes punched in the brain

74
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,200
over a few years of this alternative conformation working its way through.

75
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:07,000
Just so that we're getting the vocabulary down. Can you describe the difference between a downer

76
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:17,320
and a walker? In terms of cows? Yeah, it's a downer cow is basically a cow who has lost the use

77
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:26,280
of his or her nervous system and muscles. In other words, they can't get up and walk.

78
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:35,560
A walker is a cow that is displaying preliminary symptoms, but is not actually

79
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:44,120
sort of at the stage where it's becoming terminal. And the downer cows are usually

80
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:51,320
well on the way to death. And walkers, they may be staggering, they may be shaking, they may have

81
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:58,680
sort of uncontrollable twitches and all of that, but they're still able to walk. So it's just a

82
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:06,840
kind of a progression of symptoms. In some of the old interviews I saw of you,

83
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:19,480
you had talked a little bit about how the research didn't include walkers or the testing

84
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,880
didn't include walkers. Do you know if the USDA has changed their approach in testing?

85
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:34,040
Well, you know, brain trust was written back in 2003 when the whole mad cow was sort of a real

86
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,040
issue because the first case had been discovered in Washington state and multiple cases had been

87
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,440
discovered in Canada. And we were just at the sort of the latter end of a wave of

88
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:55,880
cases of mad cow disease in the United Kingdom and Europe. And people had eaten infected,

89
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,920
tainted meat in the United Kingdom and Europe and a lot of young people had died. So,

90
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:10,200
you know, brain trust was written in 2003. So USDA really slammed on the brakes in terms of testing

91
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,920
with the idea being that, you know, they were doing quote unquote statistical sampling.

92
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,400
But actually what they were doing was a lot less testing than they should have been. And in fact,

93
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:30,040
there was a famous case that might be in the brain trust book where a private company decided to go

94
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:43,560
ahead and do testing. Sorry, my cell phone just went off there. So they decided to do testing

95
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:51,160
and the USDA shut them down because they were testing outside of what the USDA considered

96
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,160
acceptable. And the idea was that they were opening their doors towards private ranchers

97
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:05,800
who wanted to know whether or not this infectious entity was in their cattle. So a lot of people

98
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:13,720
wanted testing to accelerate, but the USDA slammed on the brakes. So in the interim period,

99
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,640
there has not been an increase in testing. There's actually been a decrease in testing over time.

100
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:29,480
So if there was sort of low levels of this, you know, mad cow disease, BSE,

101
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,840
being transmitted in the United States cattle herds, then the chances are it would not be

102
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:46,440
detected these days. Oh, interesting. I was hoping for better news.

103
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,720
Yeah, well, you know, it's kind of gone off the radar for a lot of people. And, you know,

104
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:04,360
since brain trust was written, the science has progressed tremendously. And, you know,

105
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:13,000
after the National Institute for Discovery Science program ended in 2003, 2004, I actually

106
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,520
took a job in San Francisco, California. I was working as a laboratory director at a biotechnology

107
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:28,600
company in San Francisco. And just by sort of coincidence, actually, one of the research arms

108
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:38,120
that was being conducted at this company was looking exactly at the kinds of alternative

109
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:49,240
prion confirmations that were possible. And, you know, the sort of the, I guess, the Holy Grail of

110
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,760
this research or part of the Holy Grail of this research was to develop really good monoclonal

111
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,000
antibodies that were directed against the alternative confirmations, because that would

112
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,640
have been a very good way of being able to distinguish preferentially between the different

113
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,480
confirmations of the prions. And by analogy, the pathology, you could actually investigate the

114
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:22,040
pathology. So I was part of this biotechnology company in San Francisco that was doing this kind

115
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:30,600
of prion research. And one of the things that has come out in the interim is that a lot of these

116
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,480
so-called neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, and a lot of the dementias

117
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,360
also have these prion-like characteristics. They're not prion proteins, but some of the

118
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,720
proteins that are involved in Alzheimer's disease display prion-like characteristics. In other words,

119
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,880
they can change confirmations. And once those confirmations are changed, they can induce other

120
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:05,640
proteins to change confirmations. So there is that sort of large scale umbrella effect where

121
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:13,320
all of the dementias and the neurodegenerative diseases share this characteristic in common.

122
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,760
When I wrote Brain Trust back in 2003, none of that was known. All of the research that was

123
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:27,240
being done or has been done on that has really been done in the last 10, 12 years. So it's got

124
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:36,360
to the stage now where there is a lot of overlap in the thinking with the large Alzheimer's epidemic

125
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:47,320
that we're in the middle of. And the fact that the proteins in Alzheimer's display prion-like

126
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:54,840
characteristics in terms of quote unquote infectious behavior. So that's a dimension that was not there

127
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,240
12 years ago. Well, I know I can't even hear a conversation about Alzheimer's now without

128
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,480
somebody mentioning beef. So I would like to think that you get the credit for that.

129
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,800
Well, I know that there's a lot of people that are involved in the research. And

130
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,400
it is surprising. A lot of people have sort of come up to me in the interim and talked about

131
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:28,280
Brain Trust. So quite a few people seem to have read the book, which kind of surprised me because

132
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:37,000
the book is bad news. I mean, there's not a lot of joy and happiness in that book. So

133
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,240
I was not expecting a large number of people to be sort of reading it. But for example,

134
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:52,840
South Korea, there was a lot of interest in South Korea because they had an uptick in BSC

135
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,560
maybe 10 years ago. So a lot of people in South Korea bought the book. And I believe actually

136
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:07,880
Brain Trust was translated into Korean. Well, I think a lot of people,

137
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,120
despite what some powers that be think, they want the truth even if it's painful.

138
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:23,000
People want to know how to be healthy. Yeah, I agree. I mean, that especially these days,

139
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,840
I think is becoming more and more the case. I think a lot of young people do tend to

140
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,160
be much more focused on what they eat than, say, the older generations.

141
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,720
You'd suggested, I think it might have been on a podcast you did with George where it might be

142
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,840
that there are others who are interested in our food supply. And I think that that's fascinating.

143
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,160
And I was wondering if you could talk about why you think that is.

144
00:16:52,760 --> 00:17:03,480
Yeah. So the whole cattle mutilation thing came out. I joined an organization in 1996,

145
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,840
which is way back in history, called the National Institute for Discovery Science. And the purpose

146
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:15,720
of that organization was a privately funded organization by billionaire Robert Bigelow,

147
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,200
who tends to put a lot of money into areas that are controversial and anomalies. So

148
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:29,080
one of the anomalies that the National Institute for Discovery Science was tasked with investigating

149
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:35,640
was this so-called cattle mutilation phenomenon that really erupted in the late 1960s

150
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,960
throughout the western part of the United States. Pretty well every state was hit. And

151
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:50,440
even in the 1970s, 1980s, there was hundreds if not thousands of cattle that were

152
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:58,040
found by farmers and ranchers and veterinarians. They were perfectly healthy the day before,

153
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,600
and they would be found dead with these weird incisions that happened where the lips

154
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,920
were cut out. Sometimes the genitals were cut out. Sometimes there were holes that were made

155
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:23,320
in the abdomen of the cattle. Sometimes there were holes in the head. But it all looked like

156
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:30,200
somebody had killed these animals, and it was definitely not the work of predators or coyotes

157
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:40,360
or whatever. So this was a mystery. And actually in late 1979, 1980, the FBI actually got involved

158
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:47,880
with investigating these phenomena because the entire western part of the United States was

159
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,840
suffering an epidemic of these cattle mutilations. And essentially nobody has been ever caught or

160
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,800
charged with a crime in terms of killing thousands of these cattle. So the National Institute for

161
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:08,360
Discovery Science was formed. We had a full-time veterinarian on staff. My background is biological

162
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:15,640
sciences. So we formed sort of a task force within NIDS, which is the acronym for National

163
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,440
Institute for Discovery Science. And we connected with a lot of veterinarians in the western part

164
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:29,400
of the United States and also law enforcement, sheriff's departments throughout the Montana and

165
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:37,880
Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado. So we established a network so that we could get

166
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:46,600
a call when these animals went down. And so we were able to get our act together so that we would have

167
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:54,520
veterinarian, a qualified veterinarian on the spot within 24 hours of the animal dying.

168
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,360
The rancher would find the animal and would immediately know who to call because we sent a

169
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:09,080
lot of these telephone numbers out. We had a toll-free telephone number. So we would get calls. We

170
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:16,040
would dispatch a team to these cattle mutilations. And we looked at several, probably 50, 60 cattle

171
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:23,400
mutilations in different states over a period of maybe four or five years. So it was a really

172
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:30,600
successful sort of endeavor. And the idea was that we would be on the spot. The veterinarian

173
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,400
would do what's called a necropsy, which is the equivalent of an autopsy on these animals. It

174
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,520
would take samples. If there did look like there were cuts around the hide, samples were taken

175
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:52,200
from and we would dispatch those samples to a variety of labs for histopathology and for

176
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,640
biochemical analysis, blood analysis and all of that. So we did have the resources because

177
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,280
Robert Bigelow was funding all of this out of his own pocket. So the way we approached this was a

178
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:11,320
very sort of forensic sort of scientific approach as opposed to kind of standing over the animal

179
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:18,840
and taking photographs and sort of speculating. So what ended up happening was that we accumulated

180
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:27,240
a lot of data over four or five years. And it became obvious that there were really two sort of

181
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:37,160
separate patterns of cattle mutilations. One was the most common and that was that the lips or the

182
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:49,000
eyes or the reproductive organs were usually removed in some kind of a really well-orchestrated

183
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,840
surgical manner. It was obviously, whoever was doing this had some sort of surgical skill.

184
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,960
In fact, some of the veterinarians that we talked to because we also enlisted

185
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,160
local veterinarians in this whole thing, some of these people that we talked to actually said,

186
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:11,640
you know, this is really skillful. What's being done here is not sort of some hack arriving with

187
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,720
a scalpel. It's somebody who knows what they're doing. So there was that sort of series of

188
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,120
mutilations but there was a small number of mutilations including one or two that we looked

189
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:33,080
at on Skinwalker Ranch which were obviously much weirder and much more difficult to explain. In

190
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:40,440
other words, you know, it was beyond somebody with surgical expertise. You know, one example of that

191
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:50,760
is we came upon a mutilated animal in Northern California and the intact eye of the animal had

192
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:58,440
been removed and it had been placed on the grass. I mean, with the vitreous fluid in the eye, all

193
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,800
the fluid in the eye was still intact and it was looking at the animal. I mean, this was sort of

194
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:14,200
weird. It was not the sort of business-like, you know, the standard pattern was pretty business-like.

195
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:21,240
It looked like a sampling exercise. So there was this small number that we sort of labelled as

196
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:28,040
quote-unquote paranormal linked calculations but the majority of them looked like a business-like

197
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,400
sampling exercise that was going on. Now layered on top of that, over the course of

198
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,040
the several years that we looked into it, there were medical devices sometimes found

199
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:51,800
either beneath these animals or on these animals. I'm talking about hypodermic syringes. Some of the

200
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,960
chemical analysis that we conducted on these animals seemed to show that there were levels of

201
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:06,200
sedatives in the animals. So it began to look like some kind of a sampling exercise

202
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:19,240
and it was around this time that the whole prion protein was sort of gaining prominence

203
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:28,040
as a sort of a really lethal disease. So we put out the hypothesis that this may have been a

204
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:34,760
food supply sampling exercise by a small expert team that may have been contracted by,

205
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,680
you know, might have been contracted by a pharmaceutical company, might have been

206
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:45,480
contracted by one of the arms of the United States government. We didn't know but it would not be

207
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:53,560
a very, very sort of sophisticated exercise to have a helicopter, a couple of trained

208
00:24:53,560 --> 00:25:00,680
veterinarian surgeons, a couple of technicians to land at night and start sampling animals in the

209
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:07,720
wild. Now why would this be necessary? The reason it's necessary is that if you try to do the same

210
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:15,000
thing in a sort of a slaughterhouse, if you go to a slaughterhouse and you try to get samples of

211
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,240
animals, people start talking and you do not have the same sort of freedom of movement or latitude

212
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,960
than if you're sampling the food supply in the field in the wild. And if you're tracking

213
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,840
movement of an infectious organism or an infectious prion across a food supply,

214
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:41,160
you want to do it in multiple states, multiple herds, multiple locations and that's the kind

215
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:47,560
of pattern that we began to see. So it's the result of all of the above that we started

216
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:55,080
formulating this hypothesis that, you know, there was the majority of these sample, you know,

217
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:03,960
samples were being taken from cattle, probably legally, but it was a sampling of the food supply

218
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,640
as opposed to, you know, UFOs coming down and mutilating cattle, this kind of thing. But,

219
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,520
you know, the beauty of this whole thing was that there was enough legend and enough lore out in the

220
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:23,160
sort of the newspapers and all of that, all talked about mutilations sort of being associated with

221
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:30,280
aliens. So that means that no self-respecting veterinarian would waste a lot of time doing

222
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:36,920
this. No serious scientific study would ever happen. A law enforcement would usually not touch

223
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:45,320
it. So, you know, we also hypothesized that this organization, whoever it was, that was sampling

224
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:52,280
the food supply, was doing it on the undercover of the so-called UFO alien thing. So they knew

225
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:58,440
they would never get caught because nobody would essentially bother to get into such a controversial

226
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:05,240
investigation. And so, you know, this thing went on for decades. There are very, very occasional

227
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:14,680
cases now, but there were, you know, countries in South America had a lot of this cattle mutilation

228
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:21,400
phenomenon occurring in the same way. You know, I mean, if I had to speculate, I would say the same

229
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,640
group that was doing it in the United States also probably got a contract to go down to Argentina

230
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,800
because Argentina were obviously very concerned about the quality of their beef, especially with

231
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:39,800
the export markets. They were exporting a lot to the United States and Europe. So they were very

232
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:46,360
concerned about making sure that the food supply in Argentina was not contaminated.

233
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,160
Hmm. Is there, have you ever attempted to figure out, like, based on the parts that have been

234
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,880
removed, what sort of information they were looking for, like with the tongue or whatever?

235
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:08,200
Well, again, one of the reasons that we started looking at the, you know, at the prion as a

236
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:18,200
possibility is that, you know, there were primarily prions, once they infect, they do

237
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:26,280
replicate very rapidly in the tongue and in the lymph nodes around the neck of the animal.

238
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:35,880
So, and in the brain and the spinal cord tends to also get a lot of activity. The eye, there's a lot

239
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:43,160
of prion activity in the eye of an infected animal. So a lot of the organs that were being

240
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,880
removed and the tongue is a very good example because of the high levels of replication

241
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:54,680
of prions in the tongue that we kind of put two and two together and we formulated this. Now,

242
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:01,800
I emphasize this is not a fact. This was a testable hypothesis. So, you know, NIDS was

243
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:10,360
disbanded in 2004. After that, I'm not aware of any organization that through the kind of resources

244
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,600
at this problem that Robert Bigelow and National Institute for Discovery Science

245
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,160
and our teams that were on the ground, I'm not aware of anything that has been done

246
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:28,040
since 2004 on this problem. I think things have actually regressed back to the original situation

247
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:35,640
where you get people who are sort of they quote unquote investigate calumelations by going there,

248
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:42,840
taking photographs and then posting them online. But, you know, in terms of actual information,

249
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,360
analytical information, forensic analysis, I'm not aware of anything that's been done since 2004.

250
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,240
Well, later on, I'm going to ask you about

251
00:29:51,480 --> 00:30:00,600
investigations and what people should be doing. But I have a couple more questions about the

252
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,600
calumelations. You had said something earlier about how there was sort of almost a parallel

253
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,360
between the discovery of the prions and when they started. And I was wondering if

254
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,520
there's also a correlation. I don't know how far back Alzheimer's research goes into, but

255
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,360
was there an increase in Alzheimer's at around the time that this started as well?

256
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:36,360
Well, you know, the timing Alzheimer's obviously is known that there were some cases of dementia

257
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:44,840
documented all the way back in the early 1900s. In fact, the guy all was Alzheimer was operating

258
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:51,640
back in those days and the disease, you know, got his name. But it's not really until the 1970s

259
00:30:52,760 --> 00:31:00,360
that the numbers of Alzheimer's cases started to really escalate. I mean, you can actually track

260
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:09,720
it because the CDC has a lot of data now in terms of the escalation of Alzheimer's that really

261
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:17,560
started. The curve started going up and it got steeper and steeper by the late 1970s, 1980s,

262
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:26,760
1990s. So it has continued going very, very sharply up. But pre 1970, Alzheimer's disease

263
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,000
was not that common. I mean, it was common. Now, you know, if you talk to somebody at the CDC,

264
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,640
they'll say, OK, well, we did change the definition of what constitutes Alzheimer's

265
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,680
around that time. You know, that possibly is one of the reasons. But it goes way,

266
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,800
way beyond that because we're talking, you know, hundreds and hundreds of percent increases

267
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:57,240
and escalating over time. Also, the aging of the population, you'll hear these explanations that

268
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:05,560
aging of the population, people are living older, longer now. But that's still, even if you factor

269
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:12,760
all of those factors in, you still get dramatic increases of this phenomenon,

270
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:21,240
Alzheimer's phenomenon, starting the 1970s. Now, I should mention that, you know, one of the things

271
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,320
that I tracked in brain trust was that there was really sort of some remarkable

272
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:34,040
experiments being done by the National Institutes of Health in the 1950s. And

273
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,760
there was a guy called Carlton Gajuszek, who actually won the Nobel Prize for his discoveries.

274
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:47,480
But what he figured out was that there was a tribe in Papua New Guinea called the Foray.

275
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:57,160
They were cannibals. And one of the ways they sort of marked the rituals that they marked the death

276
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:06,440
of one of their tribe's people was by eating them. And Carlton Gajuszek discovered that there was,

277
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,880
this tribe had come down with a bizarre brain disease that they call kuru. And so he actually

278
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,160
was kind of like a cowboy out there. I mean, nobody was regulating or overseeing him,

279
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:27,560
but he was an NIH scientist. So he started carving up these people and essentially getting their

280
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:36,520
brains of these cannibals who were dying from this mysterious disease, shipping the brains back to

281
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,880
the National Institutes of Health. And actually, the brains were shipped to Fort Detrick in

282
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:50,360
Maryland, which is still the center of biological warfare investigations in the United States.

283
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,800
And so these brains were accumulating in Fort Detrick. So throughout the, this all happened

284
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,880
in the late 1950s. So throughout the 1960s, they were trying to figure out what this infectious

285
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,920
entity that was killing these tribe's people, because it was obvious something infectious.

286
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:13,000
They were eating and the people, the cannibals who ate the dead people would all in turn come

287
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,440
down with this mysterious brain degenerative disease that we now know as mad cow disease.

288
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:29,800
But bottom line is the scientists at the NIH, they got this facility in Patuxent, Maryland,

289
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,760
and began injecting a whole bunch of different animals, chimpanzees, deer, cattle, mice,

290
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:44,520
rats, you name it, to see if this disease was transmissible. So bottom line is that over time,

291
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:54,040
to put it mildly, all of the security, all of the sort of biosafety level, none of that existed back

292
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,960
in the early 60s. So a lot of these animals escaped. And so one of the hypothesis is by the

293
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:08,920
sort of late 1960s, early 1970s, these prions had transmitted through the food chain,

294
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,400
especially to deer, because chronic wasting disease in deer is a highly infectious form of

295
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:21,720
this aberrant protein that goes right through the herds. So bottom line is that it transmitted

296
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,880
through the country. And so the escalation of all of this stuff, including cannabinoidations

297
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,680
beginning in the late 1960s, the rise of dementia that happened in North America

298
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:42,040
in the 1970s, all of these kind of co-located in time around the same time. So again, we were,

299
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:49,400
we went through the exercise of joining the dots. One of the parts I found interesting in Brain Trust

300
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,480
is this sort of recurring, it seemed like a scene that recurred again and again and again, where

301
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,560
some authority with the state would go and investigate the cannabinoidation, be like,

302
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:07,960
it's a predator, see ya. And do you think that, and this could just be your opinion based on

303
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,960
all the time you spent up there doing that. Do you think they knew better?

304
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:26,680
This is a pretty complex, you know, it's a pretty complex research program. And I think some people

305
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:32,040
may have known better. I think the people who contracted, who may have contracted this small

306
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:39,480
outfit to do some food source sampling throughout the western part of the United States may have

307
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,280
known better. But the vast majority of the people who were working at the state level,

308
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:54,440
you know, sort of who were aligned with the CDC or the USDA, I really don't think that those people

309
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:02,440
were privy to what was going on. I think it was kind of like they didn't have the full picture

310
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:12,200
and there was too many separate data points in different areas. I don't think, you know,

311
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:19,240
necessarily people had the full picture. And the other thing is, you know, I've worked with

312
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:26,280
a lot of state governments, but particularly federal government in the last 25 years,

313
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:36,760
including Department of Defense and NASA and other organizations and multiple departments in the

314
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:43,560
Department of Defense. And so what some people may ascribe to, you know, some kind of a conspiracy,

315
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,680
I think usually can be explained by people making mistakes or some sort of incompetence going on.

316
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:59,080
I would tend to put that out as the first explanation as opposed to some kind of organized

317
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:04,840
cabal doing some something nefarious, because again and again, I've seen these sort of mistakes

318
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:11,320
being made. You know, people get transferred out of departments and all of their expertise

319
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,920
goes with them. And this new person has no idea what to do with this whole thing. That happens

320
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,840
with incredible regularity in the federal government. I would agree with that. When I

321
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:29,240
was in my early 20s, before I moved to New York, I used to be a conspiracy theorist. Then I came

322
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,680
here and I started meeting people. And I changed my mind. Once you start having

323
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:42,200
dinner with a congressman, you realize nobody can keep a secret. Exactly. And yeah.

324
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:53,000
So the business as usual mutilations, then there's the other ones. Can you talk about the other ones?

325
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:01,400
The other ones, I'll give you an example of the other ones. There was a ranch in Northeastern Utah,

326
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:09,000
which has since become known as Skinwalker Ranch. That National Institute for Discovery Science was

327
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:17,240
kind of, it owned the property. And it was like a living laboratory, because one of the reasons

328
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:24,200
the property was purchased was that this property had a history of cattle mutilations going back

329
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:31,960
into the 60s and 50s. So the property was purchased and there was a herd of cattle on the property.

330
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:39,640
And so we had surveillance on the property. We had sensors on the property to detect anything

331
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:49,560
weird. But I was sitting in Las Vegas in 1997 when we got a call from the ranch manager

332
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:58,040
of Skinwalker Ranch saying that one of their calves had gone down and they had just found it.

333
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:06,040
And the weird thing was this was calving season. It was March of 1997. All these newborn calves were

334
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:13,640
you know, getting born around the property. And the rancher and his wife, the ranch manager and

335
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,720
his wife had gone through the process of putting ear tags, these bright yellow plastic ear tags on

336
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:27,880
the cattle, on the calves after they've been born. So this was happening, but sort of 10 o'clock

337
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:36,440
in the morning, they had just tagged this newborn calf. It weighed about 84 pounds.

338
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:43,640
And they had walked about 100 yards down to the next one where they were proceeding to tag the

339
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:52,760
next one when the dog next to them started freaking out. And it was obviously focused on

340
00:40:52,760 --> 00:41:00,280
where they had just come from before. So they went back to figure out what was going on and

341
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:07,000
they found this calf that they had tagged like 45 minutes earlier. And this was like 10 o'clock

342
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,240
in the morning, bright sunny morning in March. And they found the calf completely spread eagle

343
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:21,960
on the ground. All of its internal organs were gone. It was open as if it had been sort of

344
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:28,440
spread-eagled and carefully spread on the ground. And the really spooky part of this thing was that

345
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:35,240
there was not a drop of blood on the animal, in the animal. So it's not like a coyote came out

346
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:43,400
from the tree line and attacked the calf. This calf had been completely stripped of all internal

347
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:51,320
organs. And so I got a call when I was in Las Vegas and we had our veterinarian on staff,

348
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:57,640
we had a couple of people. So luckily Robert Bigelow had a private jet. So we jumped on the

349
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,080
private jet. We were standing over the animal about two and a half, three hours after the call.

350
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:09,880
And I mean, this was one of the weirdest things I've ever seen. I mean, this calf was lying on

351
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:18,040
its back in the pasture. All four legs are spread-eagled and the flesh was pink. The ribs were

352
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:25,640
just jutting up. All of the hide had been cut away. And like the rancher had talked to us,

353
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:32,360
there was not a drop of blood on the animal. So we actually did this experiment to see if maybe

354
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,320
a whole bunch of blood had sort of seeped from the animal onto the ground and disappear that way.

355
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:45,400
So we actually did that experiment, went to the local slaughterhouse, got a couple of litres of

356
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,360
blood and poured it on the grass in different locations and photographed it over time. The fact

357
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:57,000
is, if any of that blood had been spilled from the calf, it would have stained the grass badly.

358
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:05,320
But this animal in broad daylight with the two people no more than sort of 100 yards,

359
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:11,640
maybe 150 yards away, they never heard anything. They never saw anything. The only thing that

360
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:18,440
alerted them was their dog went crazy at this particular time and alerted them that something

361
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,280
was happening over there. But this happened essentially in broad daylight under their noses.

362
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:32,680
So that's an example of the kind of spooky sort of quote unquote paranormal associated because we

363
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:40,680
actually got a tracker, a professional tracker, to start looking around the animal and he kind

364
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:47,880
of boarded the area for several days looking for tracks, looking for any tracks of any perpetrators

365
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:55,000
that could have done this. We had all of these gaming exercises. We wargamed the whole thing of

366
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:04,680
a group of special forces people that had broken cover from the fence line and done it. But the

367
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:10,120
fact is there were no tracks. There was no blood at all. There was no sign of the organs.

368
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:17,800
And this animal, the bright yellow ear tag from the ear of the animal had been really

369
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:24,680
cleanly sliced off by what looked like a scalpel very, very cleanly. So this was not a coyote attack.

370
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:32,440
It was not somebody or something had done this using sharp instruments. So we took a necropsy

371
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:40,760
of the animal. We sampled the animal and from two independent labs we got, forensically,

372
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,440
we got that sharp instruments had definitively been used on this animal.

373
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,240
It was not sort of a predator attack. It was not a coyote attack. So that was an example of the kind

374
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:58,120
of the spooky and this was not characteristic of the animals that we investigated. Your involvement

375
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:06,120
with the ranch pretty much started with the mutilations? It started with, it was a combination

376
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:13,800
of the cattle mutilations plus a lot of unusual activity including these quote unquote nuts and

377
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:21,560
bolts, UFOs that used to reportedly fly over the property. So that was one of the reasons that the

378
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:30,120
ranch was purchased. It's a 500-acre ranch in Northeastern Utah, about 40, 50 miles from the

379
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:38,920
Colorado border. It's along the Wasatch Front, pretty out of the way place. But that was the

380
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:46,920
reason it was purchased because of these, we were tasked with investigating all of these anomalies

381
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:53,640
utilizing the scientific method. I mean, that's the bottom line. We had PhD-level scientists on

382
00:45:53,640 --> 00:46:01,080
staff. We actually had a science advisory board that were pretty, they held our feet to the fire

383
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:07,640
and they made sure that nothing that we did was deviated from the scientific method. And these

384
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:14,040
people were sort of world-class scientists from national laboratories, from universities. We

385
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:20,200
actually had two scientists or two astronauts who had walked on the moon on the board of National

386
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:26,280
Institute for Discovery Science. That's like Harrison Schmidt and Edgar Mitchell. So two out

387
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,240
of the 12 people in history that walked on the moon, they were part of our National Institute

388
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:36,600
for Discovery Science, science advisory board. So it was a pretty prestigious board and they were

389
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:44,360
not into sloppiness or methodology that was outside the scientific method. So I mean,

390
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:50,600
I think it was a good thing because it really kept us really focused on trying to apply the

391
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:58,680
scientific method to these anomalies. But one of the problems was we were constantly one foot behind

392
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,000
whatever was doing this, we were always behind the curve.

393
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,080
And that was the first part of my conversation with Colin Kelleher. Please tune in next week

394
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:15,080
for the second part in which we discussed almost exclusively his work at Skinwonka Ranch. Thanks,

395
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,840
everybody.
