1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hmm.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Secrets, cover-ups, and strange phenomena.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
UFOs and ideas that challenge reality itself.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All these mysteries, all this time.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Are we ever going to get to the bottom of these?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is George Knapp.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I dig into news stories that others can't or won't.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm Jeremy Korbel.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And for some reason, people tell me things they probably shouldn't.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And this is Weapon Eyes.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is round two, Dr. Colin Kelleher.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is Weapon Eyes.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We have a special guest, a longtime friend of ours, Dr. Colin Kelleher,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
an eminent scientist and investigator.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And we got a lot of ground to cover.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
One of the reasons why I'm stoked you're talking with us like openly here like this.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Man, I've heard you guys talk.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I know what's going on to a high degree is that you ran.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Like you ran.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Like you ran the largest acknowledged UFO program in the history of our military

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that's acknowledged.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And that was called OSAP, hired through the DIA contract.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But you were the principal who ran the day-to-day, the investigations.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Is that correct?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You oversaw it all?

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, the OSAP was the acronym for the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Application Program, which was a 24 that morphed into 27-month program,

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
run through DIA, funded with $22 million.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Robert Bigelow formed an organization called BAS to execute the OSAP contract.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I was the program manager for the OSAP contract in Las Vegas.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I had a counterpart on the East Coast, a guy called Dr. James Lakatsky,

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
who was a ballistic or is a ballistic missile physicist and engineer.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So he was running things from the East Coast.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I was the coordinator project manager in Las Vegas.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We hired about 50 different people within a space of seven months of activating

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
the OSAP contract, which was activated in September of 2008.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So the idea was we were hustling to start hiring people with security clearances,

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
if possible.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We hired PhD and master's degree scientists.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We hired engineers.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We hired database analysts, counterintelligence people, security officers,

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
translators to translate documents.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So within seven months of starting this program, it started in September of 2008.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Within seven months, we had a team of 50 full-time people.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
These people were not doing this part-time on their spare time.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
These were tasked 40 hours a week plus to execute the OSAP program.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The OSAP program, its only remit was to investigate UFO activity and specifically

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
to assess whether or not there was a threat associated with the UFO.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Right.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So I want you to take us there because this is how I understand it.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to see how you go from NIDS, at that point, National Institute for Discovery

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Science, and you're working on all this, to an official DIA request to study UFOs,

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
building out this whole thing.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I understand that Dr. Lakatsky was from the DIA, and he's your counterpart there.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And then you're running the show here under the contract.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're the head guy.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And now you can talk about all of this, which is interesting.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So, George, can you set us up to where he goes from?

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, there's a big chunk of the story we're missing.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So we went from NIDS 96 and Bigelow buying Skinwalker Ranch to the creation of OSAP.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
In between, there was this long study by the NIDS team at the ranch.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They set up shop there.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They had a command center.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They put cameras all over the ranch.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it was primarily interested in the high level of UFO activity that had been reported there,

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
but a lot of other stuff too, animal mutilations that have been happening.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And as you were later to learn, a lot of other weird things.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That wasn't why you were there, but that's what you learned about it, right?

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Right. Yeah.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think that's a pretty good summary.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And as you also mentioned, you and I wrote a book at the very end of that whole procedure that came out in 2004, 2005.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And the purpose for writing that book was to see what other ranches were around the country and around the world.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What other UFO hotspots might exist?

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And we actually have had a lot of feedback.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That book came out, what, 2005, which is, what, I don't know, 17 going on, 18 years.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We're showing our age here.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But the really interesting thing was that when this book came out, it attracted the attention of people on the East Coast.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We know that Jim Lakatsky, who was a ballistic missile physicist working for the Defense Intelligence Agency,

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and the other guy we call in the book Axelrod, who was also at the time seconded to Defense Intelligence Agency.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Both of those guys read Hunt for the Skinwalker back in 2007.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Lakatsky, which was a stroke of genius on his part, and obviously he had permission from the Defense Intelligence Agency.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He writes a letter to Robert Bigelow saying, you know, that as an official Defense Intelligence Agency matter, he would like to visit the Skinwalker Ranch.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And so in July of 2007, Robert Bigelow immediately agreed after checking out that this was a real deal.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This was not some guy sort of masquerading as a Defense Intelligence Agency guy.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He was real.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And so Lakatsky and Bigelow arrived on the ranch in July of 2007.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And they were talking with the ranch manager and his wife in their small little, what we call Homestead 1 on the ranch,

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
which is a small homestead that is very close to the entrance of the ranch.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Bigelow was talking to the two ranch people, and Lakatsky is standing in the kitchen behind Bigelow and the ranch manager and his wife.

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This metallic looking twisted object suddenly appears in the kitchen right in front of Lakatsky and it's shrouded in this yellowish mist.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And, you know, it's a sort of curved cylindrical metallic looking object, but it appears out of nowhere in thin air in the kitchen.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And Lakatsky is sort of a physicist, an engineer, and he's looking at this apparition, wondering what the hell is going on.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He looks away, looks back, still there. So it's not sort of a trick of his eyes or whatever.

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And then it starts dissolving. It basically vanished in front of his eyes.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But he didn't say anything. I mean, he was absolutely in shock because this was for his eyes only.

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Neither Robert Bigelow or the two ranch managers had seen this because it was right behind them.

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And Lakatsky didn't say anything. He was silent on the way back to the airport, and then he went back to the East Coast.

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But that single event changed. I mean, it was a game changer for Lakatsky.

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And out of that event, he eventually connected with Robert Bigelow.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And between Robert Bigelow and Lakatsky and Senator Reid, which, you know, George can talk about, you know,

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:23,000
they essentially got this incredibly innovative program to study UFOs funded through the Defense Intelligence Agency,

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
an official program that began in September of 2008.

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But, you know, the genesis of this, this would not have happened if Lakatsky and Axelrod,

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
because Axelrod was very much a part of sort of setting up the operations for the original program.

106
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If they had not read that book, I'm pretty damn sure that this program would never exist.

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, you guys are saying Axelrod, eventually people are going to understand that that's a person.

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're quoting a name that's in your book because you have promised to keep people's identities.

109
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If those people decide to come forward about their identities, that's on them.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, it'll happen this year. We're skipping part of the story, of course.

111
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A big gigantic chunk is what happens between 1996 and when the book gets published, and that is there are hundreds of incidents.

112
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You know, I've seen the experts, the social media experts and debunkers who now say nothing ever happened on that property until Bigelow arrived.

113
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's all made up. The rancher, the Gorman family, they weren't contacted about the book.

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
They're not supporting it, and the neighbors don't support it.

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It was all made up by Bigelow so that he can get his buddy Harry Reid to give him money.

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And there's really nothing that happened in there now.

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, you know, that's not true. There were hundreds of incidents.

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
These guys basically lived on the property, and it wasn't just them seeing it.

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You went to Basin for seeing this stuff.

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So the online trolls and the people that don't actually know anybody directly involved and they're just kind of commenting.

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So the idea would be that all these scientists and people in government, everybody would make this all up in perfect coordination and that they're all drinking the same Kool-Aid.

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's the kind of theory that people come up with.

123
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So the cops are making it up, police officers, the Mormon church officials, Junior Hicks,

124
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
who had a catalog of several hundred cases that he'd investigated from the 50s, 60s and 70s, UFO incidents and other weird stuff.

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The Ute tribe who lived there, all the neighbors, the ranchers, hundreds and hundreds of people who've seen these weird things,

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
not just UFOs of different shapes and sizes, but also creatures.

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And there had been cattle mutilations. All this stuff has been going on.

128
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's still going on, although it is it is a challenge from the beginning.

129
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a challenge because it's always changing. It's never quite the same.

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, no two incidents happen exactly alike. All the same.

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They it seems to know what people are going to do before they do it.

132
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It will give you a glimpse of something and then but doesn't make it easy to document it.

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So these I'm hearing these stories from my friends, my colleagues.

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'd get bits and pieces that they would throw me a bread crumb now and then.

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And it's driving me crazy from 96 on.

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And I was I started bugging them. Hey, when do I get to go?

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I guess there had been enough of a downturn in the level of activity that they figured, well, what the heck?

138
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Maybe we can have this guy come there and either I would stimulate some activity myself

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
or I could help them publicize the idea that maybe they need to find other ranches, other hot spots.

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, they were using you as bait, man.

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, that is true. That first visit.

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I think the first time I went there was column.

143
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He did use me as bait, stuck me on a chair and left me that left me there.

144
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let me ask you a question. So, I mean, this is something I think lost on people because it just hadn't been said properly.

145
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I know it to be true. And you guys know it to be true.

146
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The DIA's interest in in Skinwalker Ranch.

147
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And as you said, you have the problem.

148
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The program was about UFOs with all set advanced aerospace weapon system applications program.

149
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Right. The idea was to see what phenomenon is causing this.

150
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
They knew it's not a lot of people making stuff up.

151
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I mean, they can't say that Dr. Katsky saw what he saw.

152
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Only he saw that they're not reproducible, all that stuff.

153
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But the point of the program was to look if there is foreign adversaries with the technology the U.S.

154
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
doesn't have implementing those on American soil.

155
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That was a big part of why the DIA was involved. Absolutely.

156
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The phenomenon, what's going on, these events are happening.

157
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We have evidence. There's evidence.

158
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There's proof this is happening with some things.

159
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But the point was protect America.

160
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Look for disruptive technologies of known foreign nations.

161
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And if we can't and then we that had to be excluded, although there was some meddling for other nations.

162
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Right. It had to be excluded.

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And that's what's interesting.

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The point was to look for disruptive technologies from known adversarial foreign nations.

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Is that correct?

166
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes. I mean, the primary remit of this program was threat analysis.

167
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And so the genesis of what really intrigued Katsky when he read Hunt for the Skinwalker was that,

168
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you know, objects of unknown origin were flying with impunity around Skinwalker Ranch,

169
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
around the Uinta Basin, and nobody seems to give a damn.

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So his idea was, are we talking about foreign adversaries?

171
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Because that's a very big element of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

172
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Or are we talking about something else?

173
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But we should be damn well investigating it because otherwise...

174
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's somebody's tech. Somebody's doing that.

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah. I mean, is it coming from Hill Air Force Base in Utah?

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Are they testing out new toys?

177
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Unlikely, because like Katsky and Defense Intelligence Agency would be able to eliminate that as a possibility pretty easily.

178
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But the fact is that there were legions over the decades of unusual aircraft that were looking solid and metallic to a lot of witnesses that were flying with impunity.

179
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There were no fighter jets being launched from nearby Air Force bases to intercept them.

180
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And somehow this was happening in the middle of the United States.

181
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You guys in your government program, you might have had ways to pick up certain types of data that might not be public.

182
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But as far as like, why don't we have a great picture of something?

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is the thing everybody asks. And it's a great question.

184
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What do you guys, both of you, why don't we have like the great money shot?

185
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Not that they don't exist, not that things haven't passed by our eyes, but technologies from governments.

186
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But why don't we, why don't at the ranch, why don't we have that?

187
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You've seen people, the kind of juvenile criticism that pops up that people say this can't be real, therefore it isn't.

188
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You guys are making it up.

189
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I've seen people, the same people who complain nothing in the OSAP documents that we've seen so far says this is a UFO program.

190
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And then the same people will complain it's only supposed to be a UFO program.

191
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Why is it studying werewolves and cattle mutilations and things of that sort?

192
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
People can't make up their mind what the reason is for them to not like it.

193
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But the fact is, stuff has been going on there, strange phenomena, UFOs of different shapes and sizes for decades, maybe longer.

194
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That it had been seen throughout the Uinta Basin.

195
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Strange phenomena, strange cryptid creatures, animals that probably shouldn't exist.

196
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And that whatever was there was an intelligence, that it was elusive, that it would always stay one step ahead, that it was probably smarter than us.

197
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The idea that there is an intelligence, something higher up on the food chain, people have a hard time accepting that.

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And they can't accept that something could be smarter than us.

199
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And then it would show us glimpses for whatever reason, but not enough to definitively prove anything.

200
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah, I think that's a very good summary of what is actually happening out there.

201
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We have transient phenomena that are happening all the time, what was happening all the time on Skinwalker Ranch.

202
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I think we're now at probably at least 50 separate people, witnesses who have personally experienced stuff on Skinwalker Ranch.

203
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's probably closer to 100, I don't know what the exact number is, but it began in 1994, it's continuing, here we are in 2023.

204
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And it's still happening, it's still being observed, it's still being measured.

205
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's the longest running UFO study probably in history, arguably.

206
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Known. What?

207
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Known UFOs, publicly known UFOs.

208
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean, there is a project in Norway that may be sort of parallel.

209
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But the bottom line is that the attempts to measure this phenomenon and to capture data were somewhat successful with NIDS.

210
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And I've seen a lot of criticism that NIDS never gave out any information.

211
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And the fact is we had a website that was replete with scientific reports.

212
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We had dozens and dozens of scientific reports on various aspects of our investigations.

213
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And it was for the public to see.

214
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I mean, the public was extremely interested in that website.

215
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It came down in 2004 when NIDS went on ice.

216
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But the fact is the criticism that NIDS never gave out any information is completely erroneous.

217
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Well, as with ASAP, George Uncovered Revealed to the World some of these, what they call DIRDs, Defense Intelligence Reference Documents,

218
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
which was part of the initial thrust, which is, what is the threat 50 years from now?

219
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Put all stigma aside, what are we seeing? What is being reported? What is this technology?

220
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What could that threat be? And you had all these, was it 22 of these DIRDs?

221
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
38.

222
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
38 of these papers, some of which are public.

223
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And that's pretty valuable to be putting out to the public.

224
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I just got a personal question.

225
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Being a scientist and being thrown into these uninvestigated realms where you have to kind of pioneer methodologies and really figure out how to do this.

226
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Have you had a, can you name a moment where conceptually you went from kind of like, I'm a scientist, I'm skeptical, but this sounds interesting.

227
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Let's look into some of this weird language you read in an advertisement.

228
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Has there been a moment that just solidified for you where you no longer have the luxury of disbelief that there is a phenomenon going on that it includes UFOs?

229
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Was there one thing that you can put your finger on that says that did something to my way of looking at it?

230
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, there were probably two events that happened very, very quickly.

231
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Right after Robert Bigelow purchased Skinwalker Ranch in 1996, it was around August of 1996,

232
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I and Eric Davis and to some extent other people were deployed up on the property for five day tours, ten day tours, whatever.

233
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But, you know, in 1996, I remember standing outside the Homestead One near this newly built command and control center that we had just installed on the property.

234
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I was standing there with, I believe it was Eric Davis, when coming from over Skinwalker Ridge, which is the cliff that borders the northern edge of Skinwalker Ranch,

235
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:20,000
right over the cliff comes this very brightly lit low flying object that was completely silent.

236
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And it came from, you know, came from the north, flew right over myself and Eric Davis and did a perfect hairpin turn right above us, silent.

237
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And it was it was low enough that we, you know, it's very difficult to estimate altitude at night.

238
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But this was a fast moving, it was moving probably as fast as you see a lot of F-18s flying around Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas.

239
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It was flying at least as fast as that.

240
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But what really caught my eye was this incredibly sharp 180 degree turn and then just kind of went back and followed this exact track, disappeared north over Skinwalker Ridge.

241
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And it was low enough that we should have heard something.

242
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I mean, we could see it very, very brightly lit and there was a spooky silence associated with it.

243
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And I knew sort of deep in my sort of gut that this was something else.

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I mean, it was very, very it was a perfectly executed hairpin turn.

245
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I think the G-forces that would have been sort of imparted to a pilot on this thing, and this was 1996, would have been absolutely enormous.

246
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You know, I mean, we're talking strawberry jam around the cockpit.

247
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So you see this with your own eyes?

248
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, I mean, I was standing looking at this thing as it executed this perfect turn right above my head.

249
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So that that gave you a personal huh?

250
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah.

251
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
OK.

252
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah.

253
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What's going on here?

254
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Something different, because I mean, we had seen stuff that we couldn't really sort of get our teeth into.

255
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
This was really kind of in your face, you know, and that that happened within two months of being deployed on the property.

256
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The second major thing happened a few months later.

257
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We were standing and again, Eric Davis was there.

258
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We were standing out in this small pasture near Homestead 2, what's called Homestead 2 on or used to be called Homestead 2 on Skinwalker Ranch.

259
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And we had two dogs with us and probably 100 feet to my left, maybe 50 yards to my left.

260
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Suddenly out of nowhere, this basketball sized object appeared about 15 feet above the ground.

261
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It was brightly lit, silent, and it just moved around.

262
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Both myself and Eric Davis were looking at it and then it maintained.

263
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The dogs were very silent.

264
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
They were right beside us when this was happening.

265
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But then it vanished.

266
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I mean, it just kind of disappeared.

267
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So this is Dr. Eric Davis, who has worked in these government UFO programs, right?

268
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Who's a brilliant scientist.

269
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So you guys are standing there and this is the second thing that really kind of shows you in your face.

270
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You're seeing basketball sized at a relatively close distance.

271
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah, it was probably 15 feet off the ground and probably 50 yards to our south.

272
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Now, this is a very small pasture bounded by trees on either side.

273
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And pitch black night, like dark.

274
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I mean, yeah, we're talking close to midnight here.

275
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We were on a night watch.

276
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We were actually there to check out a report from another investigator who had seen weird lights around this Homestead 2.

277
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So we were there the following night to see if we could see anything.

278
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
OK, so where are your cameras?

279
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Where are your video cameras?

280
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Well, Eric Davis had a pair of night vision binoculars.

281
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I had a pair.

282
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I mean, this was 1996.

283
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So I had a camera with infrared film back in the old days when we used to use film, infrared film in the camera.

284
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So this happened probably three to four or five seconds.

285
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So this was not a thing where we we sort of set up the camera on a tripod and start filming kind of thing.

286
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
This was boom.

287
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And then it was gone.

288
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But we did have long these incredibly powerful flashlights that law enforcement used.

289
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I mean, there were this massive batteries, I mean, these 20 pound batteries that you would carry.

290
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And we lit up the pasture within a second of this thing disappearing.

291
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I mean, we lit up everything.

292
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And, you know, first hypothesis is that somebody was playing a trick with us or, you know, somebody was projecting something from somewhere.

293
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But we could find no evidence whatsoever of.

294
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Anybody except us in this past year.

295
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's dangerous to go like going to skin walk around and also live in rural myself.

296
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Like, it's dangerous to walk on people's property.

297
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I mean, it is like a major thing to be sneaking around there.

298
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And you've got an investigative investigative team, government led on that property.

299
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I know there have been some very serious security that was going on at that time during some of the time you were working, too.

300
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So it's just it's wild to me that you get these two displays and that that does change.

301
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
How does it change the way that you look at what you're doing now?

302
00:25:46,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Well, you you know that my personal experience encompasses now as of 1996, 1997, objects that are very difficult to explain that I personally experienced.

303
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So, I mean, do I write a scientific paper about this?

304
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
No, there's it's not reproducible.

305
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
There's not enough evidence. These are transient phenomena.

306
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But the in your face nature of both of these events and the the way they happened and how they happened changed my perspective.

307
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Because now, you know, I've personally seen something that I can't explain.

308
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And he saw things that were way more spectacular after that.

309
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Those are just the first ones.

310
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I mean, some of the things that we reported in the book for the skinwalker were just mind bogglingly weird.

311
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And then, you know, always the stories that kind of got under my skin because the goosebumps were the what you call poltergeist.

312
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Now, we don't know if it's poltergeist, but it's just mind games that are played on.

313
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But the ranching family and I think on you guys, you know, things disappearing, a frying pan and up in the freezer or the wife brings home all the groceries, puts it away, comes back in the room and it's all back in the bags.

314
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That kind of weird stuff. Did those kind of things happen to you?

315
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And what was going on there?

316
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Much, much less.

317
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:43,000
There were definitely two phases of activity on Skinwalker Ranch when when the Gorman's what we call the Gorman's and we're going to stick with that name, even though, you know, it's out when they moved on in 1994 all the way through 1996 when Robert Bigelow purchased the property.

318
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I mean, they had gone through a litany of poltergeist activity and essentially mind games.

319
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,000
They were victims of of of a series of mind games that seemed to be escalating over time.

320
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I mean, when when we first encountered them on the property, they were all sleeping in the front room of the house.

321
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I mean, they were huddled together. They had, you know, they were they were sort of stressed, to put it mildly, because they couldn't figure out what was happening.

322
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Many of their cattle had died for under mysterious circumstances, either through mutilations that happened on their property or disappearance.

323
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And these were very, very expensive high end cattle.

324
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I mean, the normal attrition rate for an 80 herd cattle had to be less than one percent to make economic sense.

325
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And we were talking 20 percent attrition over a period of almost two years.

326
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So, you know, the Gorman family essentially were put out of business by what was going on on the property.

327
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So we met a very, very stressed family that had been victimized by something that they could not understand.

328
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But once we got on the property, you know, suddenly we were hunting this.

329
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I mean, the whole mindset changed on the property beginning in September of 1996.

330
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The hunter or the hunted became, you know, the hunters.

331
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So we were deployed on the property specifically to seek out what was on the property to try to measure it.

332
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
We started incorporating sensors on the property.

333
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But the whole attitude, mental attitude changed dramatically overnight from this family who were being victimized in this sort of, you know,

334
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:44,000
relentless way to the point where they had to sell to get off the property to suddenly we were equipped.

335
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
We were there. We were not victimized.

336
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
We were hunting this thing.

337
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
What was on the property, which is why we turned the book on to the skinwalker.

338
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We were we were hunting this and it was a very, very different mindset.

339
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Let's talk about this idea, because the other aspect of it that gets a lot of attention now,

340
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
including from critics and debunkers, are creatures, column cryptids, animals that don't really exist.

341
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You guys saw those things. The rancher saw them.

342
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Other people who live in that area saw these things, animals that should not be there.

343
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Remember, one of the stories we told in the book was about a big hyena, muscular hyena thing with a tail of what looked like a fox,

344
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
a big bushy tail that was attacking a horse.

345
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It actually wounded the horse's calves with these scratches and it disappeared.

346
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
There were the rancher who shot two creatures out of a tree.

347
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
One great big realm thing. He shot it and it vanished.

348
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
He shot something else out of a tree and it was like a dinosaur.

349
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It left these two really weird tracks in the snow and you guys go in and chase it.

350
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
There were other animals, other creatures that were seen, exotic birds, things that don't belong there.

351
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
They're not native. It was as if they're from another reality.

352
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It was as if they're from another time.

353
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It was almost as if you were being shown this stuff.

354
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It was so ridiculous that no one could possibly believe it.

355
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
These things don't exist and yet there they are.

356
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah. I think Jacques Vallee coined this term.

357
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:27,000
There's a level of absurdity associated with these kinds of reports and sightings that you know that if you report this kind of stuff,

358
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
you're going to be ridiculed.

359
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But the fact is, during the OSAP program, we did start investigating activity with these sightings around the ranch,

360
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
all of the neighbors and within a two mile radius or so, we interviewed a lot of different people.

361
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And we accumulated a ridiculous number of anecdotal stories of people reporting creatures, everything from these kind of,

362
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
the gargoyles that are on top of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,

363
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
you know, sort of these types of creatures that were seen within a mile of the ranch.

364
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We also had sort of various iterations of two-legged or four-legged creatures that were walking on two legs

365
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,000
that are anatomically impossible for these kinds of wolves or coyotes to be able to walk on two legs.

366
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
We had many, many stories of those.

367
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So what we actually did towards the end of the OSAP program was that we constructed a Google map version of the Skinwalker Ranch

368
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and we overlaid all of the eyewitness locations who had seen these.

369
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And we're talking dozens of different people who had seen these creatures.

370
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And so then we asked part of the interview process was we asked what direction these creatures were moving when they were seen.

371
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And we mapped all of that stuff on a Google map and we looked at it.

372
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And lo and behold, there was a very striking pattern.

373
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,000
All of these creatures were starting off in the southeast and they were moving in a northwesterly direction.

374
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So you could see on the Google map a series of lines that crisscrossed the ranch, but they were all moving from southeast to northwest.

375
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
There's a story that we told in Hunt for the Skinwalker and Colin and I debated about it.

376
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Geez, do we include this one? Because it's pretty crazy.

377
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The witnesses are police officers. They're cops, tribal police.

378
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And they come around a corner at night up on the paved road near the dirt road that you take into the ranch.

379
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And they see these figures standing in trench coats smoking cigarettes.

380
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And they shine a light on them and they're dogs.

381
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And we had to debate, do we put this in that these two dogs are smoking cigarettes?

382
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We figured, well, what the heck, let's just throw it out there.

383
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Look, I mean, yeah, you guys get so much shit for that for including what you're told by the law enforcement there.

384
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And I've also experienced like when we earned the trust and we're allowed to be the first to film with certain youth tribe members and law enforcement members, some off camera, some on camera.

385
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:35,000
There's a big difference of someone just telling you a tall tale and then just seeing the fear in their eyes and hearing what happened to them after that event and the impact it had on their families.

386
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
They're they're telling you a serious as a heart attack.

387
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm just taking the stance of like even I have an allergy to these stories that someone tells you something.

388
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Fine. I'm just saying that that's what happens.

389
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's too big. It's too outrageous.

390
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm glad you did put in the book. You're reporting the news.

391
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That's what you're supposed to do.

392
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But you you actually saw in a tree.

393
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I mean, you had a personal experience and I know you and I know the way your mind works.

394
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And I know that there's how serious some of your responsibilities are.

395
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You're going to tell you're going to shoot me straight.

396
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So when we call them, when you tell me what you saw, you know, and then it means more to me because I'm one degree from somebody that I know and trust and go have a beer with.

397
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So I'm just saying it.

398
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah. You know what we hear?

399
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
We've seen it a bunch of times. If you don't have a photo, it didn't happen.

400
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, you know how it would work is if you did have a photo, the photo is not real.

401
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But, you know, whatever the level of evidence is, it wouldn't ever be enough for people who don't want to believe it.

402
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
But as you said, some of it seems to be ridiculous by design, so preposterous that nobody could believe it.

403
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And it's so imaginative. But, you know, Bottle Hollow, for example, we haven't talked about that on any podcast or interviews that you and I have done, but we we did include a little bit of it in your film, Jeremy.

404
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Bottle Hollow is not Loch Ness.

405
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's not thousands of years old.

406
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's a reservoir created less than 200 years ago.

407
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And yet it's got stories of creatures that sound much like the creatures you'd see in lakes around the world that are much, much older.

408
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Not only creatures, but lights and things that come out of the sky.

409
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You and I interviewed some witnesses right on the on the shores of Bottle Hollow.

410
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
What do you make of that?

411
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah, I mean, as you say, this is not sort of thousands of years old.

412
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But it also happens to be right beside Skinwalker Ranch and within almost shouting distance of Skinwalker Ranch.

413
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So all of the interviews that we did are consistent with this sort of Skinwalker Ranch is not anything exceptional.

414
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It just happens to have been studied intensively since 1994 or slash 1996.

415
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,000
But, you know, all of the all of the areas around Skinwalker Ranch are privy to this.

416
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Observed level of activity that includes paranormal phenomena includes poltergeist phenomena and also includes metallic objects that seem seem to be co-located and appearing and disappearing at the same time.

417
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Now, the question is, are these completely unrelated phenomena or should they not be reported alongside these creature type activities?

418
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Should they not be reported alongside the metallic objects that are seen and reported?

419
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Or should all of this all of these phenomena be reported?

420
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That's kind of the central question that preoccupies people.

421
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And it certainly preoccupied us when we were initiating the OSAP program because we knew we would run into this discrepancy between what is acceptable versus what is not acceptable.

422
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Right, like nuts and bolts, UFO comparison.

423
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Right.

424
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So, of course, you should report everything.

425
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
What you're talking about is you have this DIA government program to look at high end technology, maybe by a foreign adversary.

426
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Should we tell them that a lot of this is associated with these absolutely bizarre things?

427
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
That's the discrepancy.

428
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
As reporters, we're going to report the news like you did about the story from the cops of the smoking dog, that whole thing.

429
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But, you know, this idea that the entire Uinta Basin is homogeneously having these experiences and it's not just a cultural thing from a different generation.

430
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That was what's so interesting to me.

431
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You bring people into that area who are like you, scientists, and you bring every kind of person from every kind of culture, given enough time, not one day on the ranch, not two days,

432
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
hundreds and hundreds of 24 hour surveillance days under unique circumstances.

433
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Damn, it's not a cultural thing in that area.

434
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That really dawned on me when we did a bunch of our interviews.

435
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You know, so that's interesting.

436
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I don't get why this one area, although there's others, why an area would have more of this, unless it's some advanced technology from a nation that wants to like try out the beta test their stuff or even our own.

437
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Why this area?

438
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
There's no answer to that, right?

439
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That we know of?

440
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:36,000
All of the different hotspots around the United States and around Europe, there's really no obvious explanation of why these hotspots exist.

441
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But they definitely exist.

442
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The Uinta Basin is the obvious example.

443
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
We've got another one.

444
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
We spent a lot of time in Dulce, New Mexico.

445
00:39:46,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So the overlap between the sort of bizarre, you know, nuts and bolts craft and then bizarre creatures is the same in northern New Mexico as it was in the Uinta Basin.

446
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I think the all of the legends that came out of the San Luis Valley in Colorado, for example, that Chris O'Brien and others have reported on, you've got sort of the black triangle phenomenon.

447
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Various UFOs, metallic objects.

448
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Bigfoot.

449
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Overlaid exactly with Bigfoot and with a lot of different anomalies and paranormal effects.

450
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So, you know, Jacques Vallée coined this term that the hilltop effect, you know, that if you go in to investigate a UFO phenomenon, the first layer of interviewing of the witnesses, you get all of the reports about the anecdotal sort of metallic craft that appeared and disappeared.

451
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It did right angle turns of the sky.

452
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It was flashing bright red and bright, bright blue colors, that kind of thing.

453
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But, you know, his whole thing was that if you keep on going back time after time after time, the witnesses start trusting you.

454
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And when they start trusting you, they start opening up.

455
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Tell you the rest of the story.

456
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And then they start talking about the weird stuff that they wouldn't dream of telling a stranger.

457
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So you've got a lot of these investigations that happen and you've only got the left hand part of the hilltop curve.

458
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And it's kind of like this Gaussian curve that is as you go further and further, you've got a lot of activity, a lot of reports.

459
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But the weirder things become, the less reporting happens.

460
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah, people come to us all the time.

461
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Very serious people that work in, you know, really, you know, secure jobs, security jobs, that kind of thing for our nation.

462
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And they'll be like, just want you to know.

463
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And it is a nuts and bolts story and explanation.

464
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Just nuts and bolts from a very serious engineers, that kind of thing.

465
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Just using an example.

466
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
After a couple of weeks, maybe a month, it'll be like, there's one other thing.

467
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I don't know if it's associated specifically with what I told you.

468
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I saw that I know for sure is right.

469
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And then I'm like, here it comes.

470
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:29,000
There's there's oftentimes this other element to it that transcends the physical nuts and bolts aspect of UFOs.

471
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Maybe it's a consciousness effect.

472
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Maybe it's I don't know what to name it.

473
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I can't deny that that is often not always at all.

474
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Right. But a lot.

475
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
A lot. And it's there and it's in your face sometimes.

476
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It goes to the heart of what OSAP was supposed to be.

477
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And people who only have read a little bit about it, who think that experts say the ones who will say it was supposed to be a UFO program or the ones who criticize there's no language about UFOs in any of the documents.

478
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And you did that on purpose.

479
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And then those who will say it was killed because it looked at all this crazy, weird stuff.

480
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
The fact is you are never going to solve this mystery without including the weird stuff.

481
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You're talking about the hilltop effect.

482
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Right. I wanted you to continue your metaphor there about why that works.

483
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
If you only look at the hilltops, you don't look at all.

484
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah, I mean, it is like imagine that you're starting off on a new program to map out the topography of an unknown area that has never been mapped before.

485
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And sort of you assemble a team to start doing that whole process of mapping it out.

486
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And then you've got some guy from the back of the who's probably associated with USDA, Office of Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, who suddenly pipes up and say, OK, we're only going to look at the tops of the mountains or the hills.

487
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Because that's what's useful in his mind.

488
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Well, this is only the Department of Defense only remit is to look at the mountain tops.

489
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
We're going to ignore the sides of the mountains.

490
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
We're going to ignore the canyons.

491
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
We're going to ignore the valleys because that's outside the remit of the Department of Defense.

492
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The only thing the Department of Defense is interested in is in the mountain tops.

493
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And so this program then proceeds to spend enormous amounts of time and energy analyzing the mountain tops.

494
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And then suddenly, we're we're put into a war situation where we have to encounter this this topography.

495
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And we have no idea of what the sides of the mountains look like.

496
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
We have no idea what the canyons look like.

497
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
We have no idea what the valleys look like.

498
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
All you study was the because the only thing we know anything about is the mountain tops.

499
00:44:51,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So I'm using this as a metaphor for the sort of the tendency to lock away, you know, what also originally was going to be studying,

500
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:09,000
which would be only sensor driven data and only sort of the metallic craft you're missing.

501
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You're missing the great underbelly of what actually may be important to study.

502
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And so, you know, it's a metaphor that that could be used.

503
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:36,000
But it's certainly during the OSAP program we discussed many, many times and long and long discussions between the Defense Intelligence Agency and the OSAP people in Las Vegas.

504
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And the intent was to leave no stone unturned that we would database everything that we came across.

505
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And then we would decide to include or not include it later after sufficient analysis had been done to decide, OK, these are probably separate phenomena.

506
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Let's eliminate these from the database.

507
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:07,000
But we don't just go in and focus only on the nuts and bolts phenomena and to the exclusion of everything else,

508
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:15,000
because we don't know if that all of that sort of weird extra stuff is associated with the phenomena.

509
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
We don't have enough data to make that judgment.

510
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I should point out there's a story that you shared with some other people about Kenneth Arnold.

511
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So it's been 75 years since Kenneth Arnold's sighting started the modern UFO era.

512
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And people, they remember the flying saucer part of it, even though that's not what he described, but the nuts and bolts craft that he supposedly saw and nothing else.

513
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
But high strangeness goes back to the beginning of the modern UFO era.

514
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You can't just have a UFO incident by itself.

515
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
There's often a lot of other stuff, including his case, right?

516
00:46:47,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yeah, because I remember several, several years ago, Kenneth Arnold's daughter, Kim Arnold, began writing a book and she started putting out feelers.

517
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
She went on radio shows.

518
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:11,000
So Kenneth Arnold, it's one of the most famous UFO cases of all time because it was said to have coined the flying saucer term.

519
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
June of 1947.

520
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
However, that's not how he described the craft.

521
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It was just a reporter like two saucers on top.

522
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
What he was saying is it skipped like that.

523
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So like as if you threw a saucer.

524
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
That's just so everybody knows the Kenneth Arnold story.

525
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That's how the term flying saucer, right?

526
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Saucers have been seen for a long time prior to that.

527
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And that's not what he saw.

528
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But go on.

529
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Correct.

530
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So Kim Arnold describes something very, very different than what her father had experienced.

531
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Number one, Kenneth Arnold's original description was that these objects were reflecting the sunlight as they moved down the Cascade Mountains as they were going from north to south.

532
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What Kim Arnold put out was that after a lot of thought, Kenneth Arnold decided that these objects were actually emanating light.

533
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Self-luminous.

534
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
They were pulsating these.

535
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
He called them bluish white light.

536
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
These were not reflecting sunlight.

537
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So these things were actually pulsing light.

538
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Secondly, Kim Arnold reported that they started having these inexplicable paranormal effects in their home.

539
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Kenneth Arnold, after his sighting, I mean, she described an orb that sort of suddenly appeared in their home and went past the two daughters, Kim and her sister, and then went down into the kitchen past Kenneth in their home.

540
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Also weird noises and sort of some poltergeist activity.

541
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:01,000
She also described that Kenneth Arnold had changed his mind about what these objects that he had originally seen.

542
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And she described things like he thought that they might have some sort of biological content and they might be alive.

543
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:19,000
He also associated these objects with somehow being associated with humans after they die in the afterlife.

544
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So there was a lot of very weird activity associated with the original nuts and bolts Kenneth Arnold story that nobody heard about for decades.

545
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And the sort of the whole sort of flying saucer meme took a hold in the press, both in the United States and globally.

546
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And suddenly we had all these nuts and bolts phenomena being described as flying saucers, even though Kenneth Arnold never had any intent on reporting flying saucers.

547
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But all of the paranormal stuff was completely ignored.

548
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And, you know, I've speculated to myself and to others that what would have happened if Kenneth Arnold had come right out and said, you know, these objects may have been biological.

549
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:24,000
They were probably self-luminous. They were emanating these sort of flashes of light, may have been biological, may have been associated with the afterlife, quote unquote.

550
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Can you imagine what the legend of UFOs would look like now if that had been promulgated with a lot of force in the media in the in the late 1940s?

551
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Nobody. It would it would be totally different in the sense that that is so far beyond what a human being is ready to hear.

552
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It's like it would be completely different because we wouldn't have heard about it in the same way.

553
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
You've got this hardcore pilot. He sees crap. I can see him thinking, oh, it's glinting because that's the natural thing.

554
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You think that's the light source, the sun. But after some thought, it didn't quite look like that, huh?

555
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So I can see that transformation going. The public? Nah, man, that's not going to fly. That's too far for me.

556
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:12,000
That's what we learned at the ranch. You know, the paradigm when I entered the topic was the standard ET craft from other planets visiting Earth, checking us out.

557
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That was the dominant paradigm then. It's probably the dominant paradigm now.

558
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
It's the dominant sort of focus of the new UFO program. They don't call it UFOs anymore, but they're going to study flying saucers.

559
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
They're going to study sensor data, lights in the sky, radar returns.

560
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And that's going to get them to the bottom of the mystery when in fact they're only studying the mountaintop.

561
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
There's so much more that that is intrinsically linked to this.

562
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
The overall message that how my attitude changed was from the ranch.

563
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:51,000
This is way more complicated, may more wondrous and more interesting and mysterious than just lights in the sky flying around.

564
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So because we've gone there, because we're in the uncomfortable territory for me of all of this stuff,

565
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I do want you to talk about a term that you guys really coined that is so interesting to me because of your background

566
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:15,000
as a scientist, the hitchhiker effect, the idea that when people have these experiences that many report,

567
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
that there is some sort of after effect or an effect that follows them for some time.

568
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And we're not just talking lore, talking over a campfire.

569
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:35,000
We're talking very serious life consequences physically and mentally to people who are heroic for our country and have had problems.

570
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And you have studied this. People say they want to study different things about UFOs.

571
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'm always calling UFOs UAP cool, but UFOs just looks cooler.

572
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So UFOs that there are trackable, traceable biological implications to being in close proximity to the UAP or UFO.

573
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And you guys did a lot of study that also did extensive study on the biological negative even within the brain of human beings.

574
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I don't know if it goes as far as into the genetics or DNA, but there were things you could trace and track that you could talk about.

575
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
So the hitchhiker effect. Break it down for me, you guys. What is that?

576
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Well, I guess the poster child for the hitchhiker effect is the guy we call Axelrod.

577
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And as George has said, maybe his name is going to change in the next 12 or come out is what you mean.

578
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
The book is Axelrod. His name is going to come out.

579
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So I remember sort of being right beside Axelrod on the Skinwalker Ranch in July of 2009.

580
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I was standing right beside him and he was talking to his wife and his wife was sort of saying that there was weird stuff happening in the house.

581
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
This was right after Axelrod's experience on the on the property.

582
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:08,000
But to cut a very long story short, what happened was when Axelrod and his two compadres who were on the property,

583
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
they had these very intense experiences on the property.

584
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
They flew back home to the East Coast and they went to their homes.

585
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And Axelrod's family started experiencing all these paranormal events.

586
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You know, their teenage sons would wake up and these black shadows would be standing hovering over their beds sort of in a very threatening way.

587
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:42,000
They would wake up to go to the bathroom and they'd see these sort of black objects that would be in the hallways that were obviously black objects.

588
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
They weren't sort of a trick of the light.

589
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And then one night, sort of after this whole thing started erupting, Axelrod's wife was just turning off the lights in the kitchen that was overlooking their backyard.

590
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And out of the corner of her eyes, she caught a movement down in the backyard.

591
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And she saw this ridiculous mythic semi mythical creature of what looked like a wolf standing on its hind legs leaning against a tree in the in her backyard.

592
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And she was looking and she looked away.

593
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
She looked back. It was still there.

594
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I mean, it was it was like something out of mythology that she was looking at.

595
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And she I mean, she just turned off the light and went to bed.

596
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I mean, she was freaked out to the extent that she never said anything to her family about this.

597
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
So there's just tons of this, right?

598
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Tons of this idea of a hitchhiker effect that it comes and like a virus infects your family and loved ones and it follows you after like you go to the ranch or whatever.

599
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
The bigger picture people encounter close encounters UFOs this hitchhiker effect.

600
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
OK, but like, OK, ghost stories.

601
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I don't know these people. I don't believe it.

602
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Let's just say that's that's my perspective.

603
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Right. Right. I'm like ghost stories.

604
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Cool story. Don't care.

605
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But you had actually physical traceable biological things that could be directly linked to these UFO or UAP encounters.

606
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Can you talk about any of that, the things that you know you can trace?

607
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Yeah, just to kind of finish off that primary kind of example, the two sons were in the in the room near the backyard on the Saturday morning following her sighting.

608
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And one of them looks out and they see this upright creature.

609
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Wolf man.

610
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Wolf, wolf creature running quickly.

611
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Well, actually, it was standing still looking at them in a threatening way.

612
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And then it took off heading for the treeline, kicking up leaves as it went on two legs, on two legs, anatomically impossible.

613
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:04,000
So the whole idea that, you know, a dog, I mean, you see dogs in the circus getting up on their two legs and sort of tottering around.

614
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,000
This thing was moving fluidly at speed, kicking up leaves as it went.

615
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
The family went out into the into the yard afterwards and they went over to the treeline where they had seen this.

616
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And there were these obvious large claw marks on the tree trunk.

617
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:25,000
OK, so was this a sort of a trick of the mind or was it picking up the leaves?

618
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Or an intelligence agency playing some sort of MKUltra mind game on our intelligence agency folks.

619
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I mean, whatever it was, it was leaving physical traces in the environment.

620
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And that's sort of a key part of this whole thing.

621
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
So we studied this this so-called hitchhiker effect.

622
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And it was so common over time.

623
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
You know, we started tracking back to the original needs days.

624
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And we found that in some cases, you know, I remember, you know, my wife remarking that, you know, there were people in the bedroom that sort of walking,

625
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
walking around the bedroom. Robert Bigelow reported a lot of activity in his household.

626
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
George Knapp had been on the property.

627
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And I'm not going to deny weird shit.

628
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You know, look, weird shit always happens rather than sitting with you guys.

629
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:20,000
So the bottom line is that that we we investigated a lot of these people who had had the hitchhiker effect.

630
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And we found a small number of them were coming down with autoimmune diseases.

631
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Hashimoto's, thyroiditis, Sogren syndrome, lupus.

632
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
There was Graves disease.

633
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
There were there were other autoimmune diseases.

634
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And from a relatively small cluster of people who had endured this hitchhiker effect, there was a an interesting spike or cluster.

635
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It was disproportionate.

636
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
N is very small.

637
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So the N is pretty small.

638
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,000
So I would hesitate from publishing a scientific paper about this.

639
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:19,000
But the observations were that the hitchhiker effect in many cases was associated with a flare up of autoimmune diseases in one or more people in that household.

640
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Now, one one other thing about the about the hitchhiker effect is that it was not confined to Skinwalker Ranch.

641
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:40,000
We had other UFO close encounter experiencers who had family and who had exactly the same kind of thing.

642
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:52,000
They went back to the East Coast after experiencing very dramatic effects and say Oregon is one example that we put in the book Skinwalkers of the Pentagon.

643
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And they went back to the East Coast and paranormal stuff flared up in the house.

644
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So it's not only a Skinwalker Ranch specific phenomenon.

645
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
It's specific to certain intense close encounter effects.

646
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And by the way, that family, the hitchhiker family that he was talking about, the kids would see orbs floating around in the in their rooms inside the house.

647
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
There were tricks where the dog ends up on the roof.

648
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I mean, it was a lot of really strange stuff, original stuff from Skinwalker Ranch, the same people, same and 13 years later, it's still going on for that family.

649
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,000
You have so many examples of this that I'm aware of that that you've tracked it.

650
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
You've kind of named it this term because it's just something you couldn't ignore.

651
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
You know, even if my mind can't accept it, you can't ignore it.

652
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
As a reporter, as a scientist, that's happening.

653
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So but there's more right there.

654
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:59,000
There's specific things known about the negative biological effects on the human body if they get into close proximity, often cases with with an actual UFO.

655
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Let me let me preface this, too, because we just had this new report come out a couple of weeks ago from ODNI in which they said we haven't found any cases where anybody was been harmed by being in proximity to a UFO,

656
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
which suggests maybe they should get in their car, drive to the DIA and look because you guys found a lot of cases.

657
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Yeah, and and and within the database of we call it the data warehouse because Jacques Vallee designed this Capella data warehouse to house multiple subsets of databases.

658
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So there were 11 separate databases within this data warehouse that was transmitted to the Defense Intelligence Agency in late 2010 as a specific deliverable of the ASAP program.

659
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:54,000
But within that database, there is a subset of medical injury cases that ASAP slash bass investigated.

660
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,000
You know, there are two examples that I can think of right off of the book.

661
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Number one is a guy in Georgia whose son was outside playing outside.

662
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,000
He was staying in the tent sort of with with some neighbors and the dog started barking outside.

663
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,000
He went outside to check it out and he saw this large triangular object hovering above the house.

664
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And he was, you know, kind of really intrigued.

665
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It was silent. It was low.

666
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And it was a classic black triangle, sort of a hundred.

667
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It was like a hundred yards, a hundred yards, a hundred yards.

668
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So very, very large object.

669
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And it was it had lights on it like flat, flat or like pyramid in shape triangle.

670
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Well, it was a from his perspective, it was all he could see was the underneath the triangle from angle of observation, we would say.

671
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I mean, it was it was difficult to tell that from from his angle.

672
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:07,000
But anyway, he tried taking taking some photographs of it with his cell phone.

673
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And I mean, it was black against a black background.

674
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
So it was obviously not going to come out very well.

675
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
So he decided to light up the bottom of it with the flashlight that he had.

676
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
So he had a powerful flashlight.

677
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So he went in into his house, grabbed it.

678
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And the thing was still there when he came out and he lit up the bottom of it with with a pretty powerful flashlight.

679
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And almost instantly, this blue, intense blue light came from one of the apex of the triangles and blinded him to the extent that he turned around and crouched and sort of, you know, to protect himself.

680
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It blinded him completely.

681
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
But even when he was crouching, he felt this burning on his neck.

682
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
So he ran inside and sort of watched it from the vantage point of the house.

683
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:06,000
And the blue this blue beam that had hit him was he he described it as I think a foot or a couple of foot in diameter.

684
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
But it was a very intense light.

685
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
So, you know, he watched it.

686
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And then this object took off really quickly.

687
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
There were other objects associated with it.

688
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
He felt not good.

689
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
He woke up.

690
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
His whole neck was really badly sunburned.

691
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
His back was badly sunburned.

692
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
He had a metallic taste in his mouth, had a severe headache, felt nauseous.

693
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
He was interviewed by by people from OSAP.

694
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
OK, so the DIA actually got to interview this guy and get into some of his medical records.

695
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
We took photographs of a sunburn and took a lot of blood samples.

696
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
You were right there.

697
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Yeah.

698
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Well, we had two MD, PhD physicians who were on call basically that were able to

699
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:56,000
luckily travel to different places in the United States to investigate these kind of medical injuries.

700
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
You got to get the report.

701
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
It's got to get to you.

702
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
You got to get there quick where he still got the sunburn.

703
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And then follow it.

704
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And then follow it over long term.

705
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And and wow.

706
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,000
And he was followed over multiple blood samples over over many, many months.

707
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:19,000
He came down with a litany of different medical issues, including a phenomenon called Castleman's disease,

708
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:25,000
which which involves sort of these spontaneous eruptions of tumors.

709
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
But they were not malignant tumors.

710
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
But eventually, you know, he sort of began to recover.

711
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And so he was followed over many, many months over a year.

712
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
But the fact is, he was his health went really downhill after this event.

713
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:50,000
There were other cases in our database that were even more so where people had came down with cancer.

714
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
They had, you know, after these close encounters with UFOs.

715
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So the idea that, you know, there's no physical or pathological or medical injury cases associated with UFOs

716
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:13,000
is counteracted by the database that's sitting on the shelves at the Defense Intelligence Agency as we speak.

717
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Yeah, unbelievable.

718
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,000
The statements we're seeing now from a national security standpoint and some of the data is already there.

719
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I really hope this is handled well.

720
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
People hate the threat narrative.

721
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
But until you know, intent and capability and opportunity.

722
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Right. So, OK, I guess where I'm at with this right now is, you know, I want to know, you know, where does this go?

723
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
And what do you know?

724
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
You know, we're talking about UFOs, talking about all this stuff.

725
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You know, what do you know about UFOs?

726
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
What do you know about UFOs?

727
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
This phenomenon, we'll call it the phenomenon that includes UFOs.

728
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
What do you know?

729
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
And where does this go?

730
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Well, I guess the short answer to this is that UFO effects on people can be profound.

731
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:11,000
And it can be profound at various levels ranging from the superficial to the catastrophic.

732
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And so, you know, you have people reporting life changing experiences after close encounters with UFOs.

733
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I mean, we interviewed quite a quite a panoply of different people, positive experiences, too.

734
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Yeah. Yeah.

735
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I mean, some some people had, you know, changes, changes in their worldview.

736
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Some people had, you know, we we database everything, which was good.

737
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:47,000
We database psychological effects, you know, people, people having sort of really bizarre dreams and this kind of thing afterwards.

738
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:53,000
We had physiological effects, you know, the sort of metallic taste in the mouth was not uncommon.

739
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
People having sunburn was not uncommon.

740
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
You know, sometimes people lost hair.

741
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:10,000
This guy who had been zapped by the triangle over his house in Georgia lost lost hair in the back, back area of his of his head.

742
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Physiological effects, pathological effects, medical injuries.

743
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
So effects on people are not to be neglected.

744
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So going forward, Arrow is the new organization.

745
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:32,000
And, you know, Arrow will be taking up the mantle of, I guess, where OSAP left off.

746
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Headed right now by Sean Kirkpatrick, is that correct?

747
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yes.

748
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Arrow. That's the new UFO program.

749
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yes. And and so obviously it's early days yet in order to sort of assess what's going on, because we're only looking at the unclassified reports that are coming out.

750
01:08:50,000 --> 01:09:10,000
You know, Sean Fitzpatrick or Kirkpatrick also released or somebody released on his behalf an eight slide PowerPoint presentation that sort of summarizes what Arrow intent and mission statement and vision statement and what the next steps are.

751
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:22,000
And I was very encouraged to see that slide number seven, there's a focus on effects on the observer, you know, psychological effects, physiological effects.

752
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
It's right out of the OSAP playbook.

753
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And so when I saw that, as opposed to when I saw the report, the report was pretty, it was, you know, unclassified.

754
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Let's say lean.

755
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
It was lean on details.

756
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
It's a report on a report, right?

757
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It's a report on a classified report.

758
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
It'll be interesting.

759
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:47,000
It will be interesting or would be interesting to to view what exact sensors were used.

760
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:54,000
You know, and obviously you can't report that, you know, sources and methods in an unclassified framework.

761
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:03,000
So but the fact is that the accompanying PowerPoint presentation gave me some optimism.

762
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:13,000
If they only look at UFO data, sensor data, military cases, just kind of what ATIP did, you know, after OSAP was gone,

763
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
they look at a very smaller subset of cases and phenomena.

764
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Are they ever going to solve this?

765
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I mean, play what F for us if OSAP had been allowed to continue.

766
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:33,000
How what you guys did in that short 27 month period versus the 18 months that Arrow in one form or another has been in existing.

767
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
We don't know how many staff they have versus what you guys were able to do.

768
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So describe the setup of OSAP, how it worked, what you accomplished, what the lasting value of the data is that the world still hasn't seen versus your understanding of what this study is now.

769
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Because in a sense, we still have silos, right? Arrow has classified stuff.

770
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
They won't share it with NASA, which is doing its own study.

771
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
They don't share it with Abby Loeb and his private scientist group.

772
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Everybody is looking for their own piece of this pie, but nobody is getting the whole thing.

773
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So your hopes, your dreams, your fears for Arrow versus what you did with OSAP.

774
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Well, it is interesting to note that the the cutoff point for the first ODNI report, which happened on June 25th of 2021, was about March of 2021.

775
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:33,000
So here we are in January of 2023, about 20 months after after that cutoff point.

776
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:42,000
So the data gathering has been happening for probably a minimum of two years, which was about the lifetime of the OSAP program.

777
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:50,000
So during that program in the first seven to eight months, we did hire 50 full time investigators.

778
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:58,000
We have no idea right now beyond Sean Kirkpatrick, how many full time staff that Arrow has.

779
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
We don't know. I mean, they may have 50.

780
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:17,000
We don't know. But I know that OSAP had hired 50 and had trained and deployed right through the United States in rapid reaction teams to investigate these instances of UFO phenomena.

781
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
We also deployed teams to Brazil in that first 24 months.

782
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Looking at the at the sort of the unclassified reports that first one came out in June 25th of 2021.

783
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:41,000
The second one came out on what was it? January the 12th of 2023.

784
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,000
So the span was about 18 months.

785
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Looking at the unclassified version, I mean, we're looking at an organization that's still setting itself up.

786
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It's still getting its methodologies together.

787
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:03,000
At that stage, OSAP had, you know, had compiled 11 separate databases.

788
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It had it had, you know, delivered pretty well everything that it had initially promised that the Defense Intelligence Agency to deliver.

789
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Whether or not Arrow have a large classified section, we don't know.

790
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Is OSAP the model that should be followed, do you think?

791
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Because looking at can Arrow look into all the phenomena that you guys were able to look at?

792
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:37,000
You know, you did it in secrecy. You weren't writing publishing papers to be printed in in journals or anything like that.

793
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
You need some kind of, you know.

794
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I think there's a phase, you know, that the first phase, if I were starting this, would be that that you do focus on the, you know, nuts and bolts.

795
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Yeah. Well, what the the current level of sensors that are out there and that can be deployed that already are up and running within the Department of Defense.

796
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I would use those and then phase two and phase three would come down later where you start looking at the effects on people.

797
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:19,000
As I said, Sean Kirkpatrick's slide number seven is pretty encouraging from that perspective.

798
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
So there is an intent there. Yeah, they are not excluding your guys findings.

799
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
They're just not quite putting it in an unclassified report on a report.

800
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I haven't found it yet. They could get a copy of the book, though.

801
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,000
But so check it out. I mean, you've got the National Reconnaissance Office and all of the great technology that the United States has.

802
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
We have, you know, the analysis through the Geospatial Intelligence Agency.

803
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:51,000
We have other agencies that can collect high fidelity, great data regarding the nuts and bolts of UFOs.

804
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And if I'm not mistaken, Arrow is reporting to the director of national intelligence.

805
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Right. That is part of where that's going.

806
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,000
The Secretary of Defense, I'm sorry, all the way to the Secretary of Defense.

807
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Right. So if that's if that's where this is going, for sure, focus on the immediate possible foreign threat.

808
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Yeah. Dealing with technology to see what we can glean.

809
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I get that. So I've got high hopes in that one line in there that you found that it could go further.

810
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I guess kind of to start wrapping up, I just what do you know about the phenomenon about UFOs?

811
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
What can you say for sure? Maybe it's nothing, you know, but what do we know about UFOs?

812
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And where does this go? As I said, what we know is what we gleaned from all of the data that has been discussed.

813
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And, you know, that the UFOs are real.

814
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Well, I mean, tell me. Yes, UFOs are technologically sophisticated.

815
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:01,000
They have performance characteristics that are, you know, the five observables are sort of well documented.

816
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:10,000
But they also have very profound effects on some people or they have superficial effects on other people.

817
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
But they do have effects on people.

818
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:20,000
So going forward is to combine both of those, is to study UFO performance.

819
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And, you know, the hope is that out of UFO performance can come theoretical physics,

820
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
which will eventually translate into engineering.

821
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Does our government have downed UFOs from unknown origin that they've been trying and are trying to reverse engineer

822
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,000
and exploit those technologies, understand the physics and understand that technology?

823
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Do we have that to work with?

824
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I can't talk about that, but the answer is yes.

825
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Let me put it, let me ask it this way.

826
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
So there are a number of whistleblowers who are who have new protections. They're lining up.

827
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
We've heard we know some of them and that we know generally what they're prepared to say.

828
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Let's say they tell this to Congress and Congress authorizes Arrow, hey, the stuff is over here, go get it.

829
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,000
How does that change the world if we suddenly acknowledge or at least the government finds and locates

830
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:23,000
and tests somewhat in the open these metamaterials created by someone else, they're not ours,

831
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
or entire craft that were built by someone else and we can't figure out how they fly.

832
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
How does that change the dynamic of this?

833
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And does that does that answer actually answer the big questions?

834
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Who they who built them, where they're from, why they're here?

835
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Well, it certainly answers the sort of sneaking suspicion that people have had over many, many, many decades

836
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:54,000
that the United States government is not coming out with the full truth of what has happened behind closed doors.

837
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
In terms of the questions that you're asking about, though,

838
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,000
technical performance and performance characteristics are fundamental.

839
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:12,000
If if the analysis, the level of analysis that has happened on these objects is sufficient to generate,

840
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:18,000
you know, as I said, physics and engineering, that is a major breakthrough.

841
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And that would be a fundamental departure point for humanity because humanity would be able to answer that question.

842
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Are we alone or not alone in the universe?

843
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:38,000
We wouldn't be able to answer from that just from the raw materials or the metamaterials where they're from or what their interest is.

844
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
The bigger question is, why are they here? Where are they from? What's their interest in us?

845
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Right. We get it. But at least that if you had that confirmed, yes, there is somebody else here.

846
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Here it is. Here's the stuff. Then you could go on and at least address the other questions.

847
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Well, and not only that, but you could get, you know, the Galileo project has got a lot of different

848
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
scientific talent and expertise associated with.

849
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So you could start really sort of co-opting scientific organizations.

850
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
That's already happening, actually. But I think you could really accelerate that.

851
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Once the certainty was there that there was technology of unknown origin in existence,

852
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:31,000
that it had been, you know, it had been really discovered and that it was unequivocal.

853
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
If that was that message was put out to humanity, it would be a game changer.

854
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Is that true? And the message hasn't been put out?

855
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
The message hasn't been put out.

856
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
But is that true? What you said? That there's technology of unknown origin?

857
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Well, like I said, I can't talk about it, but the answer is yes.

858
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:59,000
So why? Why would a buddy of mine, a really funny buddy of mine, you know, I was arguing with him like,

859
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I don't get it. I said, I don't get it. Why so much contact, so many UFOs for so long?

860
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Is there a program? What are they doing?

861
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,000
You know, the Tic Tac UFO wasn't performing for flavor until it noticed them. It was doing a job.

862
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:20,000
So the question I have is why so much activity? What is the UFO presence?

863
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
What are they doing here?

864
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
It brings us back to where we started, that word consciousness.

865
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I think Colum has some theories about that, right?

866
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
It brings it full circle to where we started our conversation.

867
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Yeah, I mean, I guess it's like the old metaphor.

868
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:43,000
If the tree in the forest falls and nobody is there to hear it, is the tree really falling in the forest?

869
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,000
So the idea that UFOs are interacting with planet Earth,

870
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:55,000
the sort of most likely scenario is that the reason for that is that humans are on the planet.

871
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I mean, it's unlikely that they're focusing only on marsupials or trees or trees.

872
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So you don't think they'd be here if it wasn't for the human presence here,

873
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,000
that somehow the humanity itself is the focus of the interaction between these unknowns that we call UFOs,

874
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
this other intelligence that are operating?

875
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
That's a working hypothesis.

876
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:27,000
It could be that they're not just focusing on humanity,

877
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:34,000
but the astounding number of sightings that hundreds of thousands, if not more,

878
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:43,000
globally that are personalized interactions between individuals or groups, small groups and UFOs

879
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:52,000
that have life changing effects in some cases and mentality changing in many cases,

880
01:21:52,000 --> 01:22:00,000
leads me to think that one of the agendas of the UFO phenomenon is to interact with humans,

881
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:06,000
but not interact with the White House, but interact with individuals.

882
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And there's maybe a process where individuals are affected in a positive way, ultimately.

883
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
That they're changing us one person at a time?

884
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I mean, that's a possibility.

885
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I can't think that the alternative of these hundreds of thousands or millions of sightings that have happened

886
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
in the last, just for the sake of argument, 77 years since 1945,

887
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:44,000
would be completely random events that are passing through and just being in the right place at the right time.

888
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I think there's more to it than that because the vast number of sightings to me imply

889
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:04,000
that interactions with humans is somehow important and somehow produces something that is viable.

890
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Something that they need? Something that interests them, certainly, but something they need from us?

891
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Or is it symbiotic?

892
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I feel that maybe one of the agendas is human consciousness,

893
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:27,000
that an interaction with UFOs may provoke changes in human consciousness.

894
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And we are back to the original discussion point,

895
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:38,000
but one of the incidents that happened on the Skinwalker Ranch is emblematic of this whole thing,

896
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and that is that we had six people on the ranch.

897
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Suddenly, all six of them had night vision binoculars.

898
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And this light object popped up just from behind Skinwalker Ridge.

899
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Popped up, it was sort of just over the ridge.

900
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
And so it just happened that all six people had night vision binoculars.

901
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
They exactly the same make and model.

902
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
All six of them looked at this object and through night vision binoculars,

903
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
it was greatly magnified.

904
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
The light was magnified tremendously through this low vision amplification.

905
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:28,000
And so there was a sort of a debriefing that occurred later that evening after that evening had passed.

906
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:36,000
And it turned out that all six individuals saw completely different things through the night vision binoculars.

907
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:50,000
So, I mean, I'm using that as a metaphor for saying that human perception is altered in many cases as a result or during UFO interaction.

908
01:24:50,000 --> 01:25:05,000
So maybe human perception as it pertains to human consciousness is one of the objectives where the UFO phenomenon is somehow interacting with human consciousness for a purpose.

909
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I don't know what that purpose is.

910
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:15,000
A lot of people, they have UFO experiences and then just to add to how weird things are for them, they start seeing dead people.

911
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
That's a very good point.

912
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's sort of, you know, in your day job, and we're not really talking about your job now, but you work on consciousness issues all the time.

913
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It goes right back to the beginning of NIDS.

914
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
NIDS is remembered today as a UFO organization, but it wasn't.

915
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
There were two main parts of NIDS.

916
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
One was, are we alone in the universe investigating UFOs and related phenomena?

917
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And the other was, does human consciousness survive physical death?

918
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Do we go on? Is there a soul or something that goes on?

919
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Now, it's kind of come full circle for you and you're focusing more on that side, survival of death.

920
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Do we go on?

921
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Which is also a form of consciousness studies.

922
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
And it all fits together.

923
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
It's interesting, you know, I was at a conference there recently with Whitley Strieber.

924
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:14,000
You know, Whitley Strieber has told many, many people about the story was during this very traumatic abduction event that happened in the 1980s with him.

925
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:24,000
During the abduction event, he actually saw a friend of his, you know, human, in the middle of this abduction event.

926
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
And he was thinking, what is this guy?

927
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,000
This guy was actually a CIA agent during the time that Whitley saw him.

928
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And Whitley couldn't understand why, in retrospect, why this guy suddenly showed up in the middle of a pretty traumatic abduction phenomenon.

929
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Whitley followed it up after his abduction had, you know, subsided in the weeks afterwards.

930
01:26:51,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And he discovered that this guy had died unbeknownst to him, you know, a couple of weeks before Whitley's abduction.

931
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And so this guy was dead when he showed up in the middle of Whitley's abduction.

932
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:14,000
So, you know, there's numerous different overlaps between what, you know, people call the afterlife.

933
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:23,000
People, you know, part of the hitchhiker effect with Axelrod's family is that one of his kids started seeing dead people.

934
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:30,000
You know, I mean, suddenly your perception is open and you can see dead people, whereas other people can't see them.

935
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:47,000
So there is this kind of mysterious overlap between human consciousness as it pertains to survival after death versus, you know, the close encounter effect of UFOs.

936
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And that's a phenomenon that people like Dr. Jeffrey Kreipel and Rice University is very interested in.

937
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:00,000
And there are other people who are starting to get involved in that sort of concept.

938
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
But it's fundamentally about human consciousness.

939
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So, yeah, this is not stranger than you think.

940
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
This is stranger than I can think.

941
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I mean, that's kind of where I'm at.

942
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Look, it's so cool to hear you guys, you know, kind of be able to just freely and openly talk where it doesn't feel so confined.

943
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
It's neat to be able to be part of that and to allow other people to.

944
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Just thank you so much for coming and talking with us.

945
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
One last question.

946
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
So we don't know who they are, where they're from.

947
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Maybe they are from the place where we go when we die, whatever that is.

948
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Not from other planets, although I guess they have technology.

949
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:43,000
They could be from other planets, but they live here in some other kind of version of reality.

950
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
And they're interested in what happens to us when we go on.

951
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
That's a possibility.

952
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I mean, this whole sort of phenomena where UFOs suddenly appear and then they can just disappear.

953
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Where do they go when that happens?

954
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:12,000
We know that there's literature associated with the so-called afterlife where people can see living people from where they are, but we can't see them.

955
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:22,000
So there's a sort of a there's an overlap between where is this place or is it a state of mind where UFOs come from?

956
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Colin, you've been at this a long time. Is it solvable?

957
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Do you solve these mysteries? Do you get some answers while you're still on this side of the mortal plane?

958
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:41,000
I think the more people that start thinking about this and the more data that's available, I think the better the chances are that we are capable of solving this.

959
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I don't know the answer to that, but I think it's certainly fun trying.

960
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Before we wrap it up, every day I see a new story about ATIP, how ATIP got the $22 million.

961
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I also at the same time, and of course, it drives me a little bit crazy because I mean, we've we've told the story of the 22 million went to OSAP, that program.

962
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
And although ATIP was real, it came afterward. It was had a much smaller focus.

963
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,000
The idea that OSAP was somehow discredited because it looked at the bigger picture.

964
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
You need to look at the bigger picture, don't you?

965
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Yeah, I really I think the main lesson learned from walking away from OSAP, even though it was truncated at two years instead of the projected five years that it was originally intended for,

966
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:43,000
was that if you can have the capability of studying both the UFO as a technology, study UFO performance and also study effects of UFO on humans.

967
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I think that is the best combination of a scientific program that will yield results.

968
01:30:50,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And if you can do that relentlessly for five or ten years, as opposed to 18 months, two years, you know, I think that is the best chance for going forward.

969
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I think there's a possibility of getting getting real bona fide results after five, ten years.

970
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:17,000
This is not a short term program, though. You know, any hope of sort of having answers after two years, I think is an illusion.

971
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Well, look, man, there's only one direction to move, and that's forward.

972
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
So just thanks for having the conversation with us. And man, that was fun. And we'll do it again.

973
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Thank you very much. It's been really great spending time with both of you. It's wonderful.

974
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
So much to tell, but could say so little.

975
01:31:51,000 --> 01:32:01,000
