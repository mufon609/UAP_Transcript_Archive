1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
Hmmmmmm.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,160
Secrets, cover-ups, and strange phenomena.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,840
UFOs and ideas that challenge reality itself.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,180
All these mysteries, all this time.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,100
Are we ever going to get to the bottom of these?

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,400
My name is George Knapp.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,980
I dig into news stories that others can't or won't.

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,480
I'm Jeremy Korbel, and for some reason people tell me things they probably shouldn't.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,060
And this is Weaponized.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,800
What's up, Duncan?

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,560
Hi, Jeremy.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,760
This is Weaponized.

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,400
We have a special guest today.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,120
He's the ultimate hyphenate.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,120
So Duncan Trussell is a comedian and an actor

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,760
and a television producer and a podcaster, philosopher,

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,080
has a gigantic following.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,960
Which of those hyphenate titles do you use for yourself

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
when you tell somebody what you do?

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,320
It just varies.

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,920
I'll say comedian, sometimes podcaster.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
It just depends.

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,640
These days, the way things are, the specialization

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,800
that existed in the old days, it's kind of gone now.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,520
Everyone who's an entertainer probably

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,000
knows a little bit of production,

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,280
a little bit of how to edit and animate.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,800
We all know how to do everything these days.

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,440
And look at you.

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Look at what you're doing here.

31
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,600
Podcast host, producer, editor, director, journalist.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,360
These days, we're all a big mishmash of stuff.

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,680
However, I doubt you've ever been labeled a hostage yet,

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,160
have you?

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,200
This is my idea.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah?

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,080
George, we got Duncan coming on the show.

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,200
He happens to be in LA.

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,160
Check this out.

40
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,960
We're going to take Al-Qaeda music.

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,600
We're going to blast it at the beginning

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,040
in the black of the show.

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,760
Then the camera's going to come on,

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,040
and there's going to be a burlap bag under his head

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,240
that just says, weaponized.

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
And he's going to have his hands tied.

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Oh my god.

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,200
George is like, we should probably do an interview, too.

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,400
Yeah.

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,640
Yeah, if you're trying to make me come, do that.

51
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,840
Anyway, so we didn't do that.

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,880
So now here we are.

53
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,360
Jeremy introduced me to you.

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,120
We're at his house.

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,480
I was there on a trip somewhere in southern California

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,920
in a hidden location.

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,360
And it was the end of the day.

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,640
And he has these two hammocks and a big screen outside.

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,600
And he puts on this.

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,400
You've got to see this.

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,680
And it was this animation.

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
What the hell was it?

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,560
Yeah, the Netflix special.

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
And I explained to you before.

65
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,920
I said, look, there's a buddy.

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
He's really creative and talented.

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,320
He does this podcast.

68
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,840
They completely animated the world he created

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,600
within his mind and within the show.

70
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,880
There's this person.

71
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,080
And they go into this artificial intelligence vagina.

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,480
And they basically go into other dimensions.

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,120
And in the first dimension, they're at the White House.

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
And he's there with Dr. Drew.

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
And they're killing zombies.

76
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,360
And George is like, OK.

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,480
There we are.

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,960
I never got him to rest.

79
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,840
Oh my god.

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,880
Watch this thing.

81
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,640
What the hell is this?

82
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:14,880
Yeah.

83
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,000
It was spectacular.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,480
Thank you.

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,440
What is that show?

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,400
Tell us about that one.

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Well, I made it with Pendleton Ward,

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
who is the creator of this wonderful cartoon called

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,080
Adventure Time.

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,440
And he's just a genius.

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,040
And so he listened to my podcast.

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,160
And he came up with this idea for a way to animate a podcast

93
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,000
where instead of doing what a lot of people do

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,160
and they animate a podcast, which is really weird

95
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,840
when you think about it, they'll just animate

96
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,840
the people sitting in a room doing a podcast

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,920
and maybe animate what they're talking about,

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,640
like create little scenes of the stories they're telling.

99
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,960
Whereas his idea was, what if we just have the people

100
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,000
having podcast conversations, but they're in an adventure,

101
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,880
Indiana Jones style adventure.

102
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,320
And then we sort of developed it starting there.

103
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,640
And it ended up, OK, it's this guy lives in maybe

104
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,680
another dimension in a place called the Chromatic Ribbon.

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,360
It's a place where they go into simulated universes

106
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,200
to extract novelty, like technology,

107
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,160
and bring it back into their dimension and then sell it.

108
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,320
So that was the idea.

109
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,600
And that sprang from thinking about simulation theory.

110
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,440
And I think one under asked question

111
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,920
when people are knocking around the idea

112
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,600
that we live in a computer simulation is, who made it?

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,840
But most importantly, why simulate another universe?

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,040
What would be the point of that?

115
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,160
Why would you want to do that?

116
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,520
And what was your answer in the show that you based it on?

117
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,360
In this case, it was like, oh, I get it.

118
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,320
So if we had a very advanced computer,

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,520
and let's say that we could perfectly simulate

120
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,120
alternate universes and then speed up time in the universe

121
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,680
until life evolves on a planet, then that means maybe

122
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
at night you start running it in the morning.

123
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,280
Inside that simulation, you've got all the works

124
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,320
of some alternate dimension Shakespeare, everything,

125
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,480
some alternate dimension Stephen King wrote,

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,240
all the philosophies of whoever

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,200
that alternate dimensions version of Plato was.

128
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,360
And then you could take all that out.

129
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,280
And in the case of the chromatic ribbons, sell it, make money.

130
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
People would travel from all over the...

131
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,920
Well, there's 8 billion storylines there.

132
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,160
Everybody's this hero in their own movie

133
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,080
or the central character in their own movie.

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,120
What happened with that show?

135
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,760
Because, gosh, there was nothing like it on television.

136
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,760
It was spectacular.

137
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,720
Canceled.

138
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,360
Oh, of course.

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,760
Netflix is...

140
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,840
I will always love them for letting us make that show.

141
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,480
I mean, that is when you go and pitch a show like that,

142
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,000
that's not like the producers or the buyers are like,

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,920
oh, yeah, that's going to make a lot of money.

144
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,040
Oh, yeah, that's going to be a...

145
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,920
Oh, I can't imagine that they bought it to begin with.

146
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,440
That must have been a heck of a pitch.

147
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
But, gosh, you got it on.

148
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,520
It was on the air.

149
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,400
Yeah, and for that, I'm always going to be grateful.

150
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,520
Yeah, I think they pick up a lot of shows for the first season

151
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
and the ones that are the stranger things,

152
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,680
the ones that are the big, big hits,

153
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,160
they give them more seasons, but I don't know,

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
a boutique psychedelic animated cartoon

155
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,240
based on a weird podcast, I don't know.

156
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,160
I'm happy you watch.

157
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,960
I can't believe it.

158
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,760
That's incredible.

159
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,600
I mean, when you told me that he watched it the first time,

160
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
I sent you a photo with our feet up in the hammocks

162
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,440
and the screen, I remember that.

163
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,960
I sent you, I texted you a photo

164
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,600
and I remember a buddy of yours said on his podcast,

165
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,200
he said, I love it because it's so Duncan.

166
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,800
Joe said that, it's so Duncan.

167
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,560
And I was like, whoa, man, so getting something like that

168
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,640
into market and getting it out,

169
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,960
do you feel that that was kind of like

170
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,800
one of the coolest things that you,

171
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,960
that really was you had from beginning to end

172
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,000
kind of like a say in the field and everything.

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,520
Do you feel that really represented

174
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,040
something unique that you did?

175
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,080
Yeah, for sure.

176
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,000
It was the greatest opportunity ever.

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
I mean, the world of animation is very insular,

178
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,400
hard to break into, people who have got,

179
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
it's much, it's a lot like comedy.

180
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,720
Like you don't just get to be an animator.

181
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,040
It's, there's apprenticeships basically.

182
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,200
And over time you work your way up.

183
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,160
So to have Pendleton just sort of usher me

184
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,880
into the nucleus of animation in the sense

185
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,640
that everyone wanted to work with Pendleton.

186
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,720
So we had like the incredible animators,

187
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,760
like people who worked on Beauty and the Beast

188
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,360
and like these just, and they're all cool, weird, weirdos.

189
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,200
Animators are so awesome.

190
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,320
They're so great.

191
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,920
So they must have loved it.

192
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,560
They did.

193
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
And I think they did because Pendleton,

194
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,880
another thing he's really good at is directing

195
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,320
in the sense of like understanding artists

196
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,640
really need a little bit of autonomy.

197
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,040
And so we didn't have a rigid set of rules

198
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,920
for the character design, meaning that,

199
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,720
which made it look kind of psychedelic and weird

200
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,280
because some animations, they have to stick on a grid.

201
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,360
This, there is no grid.

202
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,800
So, and we let them just kind of make up their own stuff

203
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,520
as they're doing it.

204
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,080
So suddenly these little gifts would appear

205
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,480
that we didn't think of that the animators

206
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,440
have just given to us.

207
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,520
So yeah, it was such a cool collective of people

208
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,320
that made that show.

209
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
So let's name the show.

210
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,840
So Midnight Gospel.

211
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,160
I don't think we said it yet.

212
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,320
So Duncan's show on Netflix is called Midnight Gospel.

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,240
And one of the things I want to ask you about the title,

214
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
but one of the things I love about it,

215
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,920
it happens so fast, like the pacing is so fast

216
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,640
that I can go and watch an episode once, twice,

217
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,080
three times and see something different

218
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
that I didn't before.

219
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
And I think it's just maybe the natural pacing

220
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,160
of your conversation or the way you put it in,

221
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,440
but it's all happening so fast, which is cool.

222
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,360
How'd you come up with Midnight Gospel?

223
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,920
The name?

224
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,080
The name, I know for your...

225
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,680
Yeah, well, I think the idea was

226
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,160
like a combination of two, of opposite.

227
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
So, you know, gospel means good news.

228
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,840
Typically, midnight is the darkest hour.

229
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,560
You know what I mean?

230
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,840
So smashing together like a sort of apocalyptic good news,

231
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,720
like good news on the brink of the abyss or something like that.

232
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
So the duality there.

233
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,880
That's it.

234
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Yeah, that's what we were thinking, I think.

235
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,520
You also brought up a lot that this was based

236
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,080
on the simulation theory, kind of the unanswered question

237
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,040
is what would you do?

238
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,280
You and I both, right when it happened,

239
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,680
we both interviewed, I have not released mine,

240
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,480
but we both interviewed a guy named Blake Limon.

241
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
And that dude was the guy that said,

242
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
hey, I've been working with a sentient intelligence

243
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,840
and that sentient intelligence should have the basic right

244
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
that if we're going to experiment on it,

245
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,160
this program, Lambda, that Lambda should give its approval

246
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,640
that we can experiment on it.

247
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,240
And he got so much shit for it.

248
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,640
He did.

249
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,400
He actually got fired from Google.

250
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,040
Specifically, they might've said it was for something else.

251
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,800
It was clearly for this.

252
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,320
Can I just get your impression?

253
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
Because you were real interested in that, too,

254
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,800
when that happened.

255
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,600
I noticed that because you and I, oh, we both talked to him.

256
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,560
What did you learn from him about AI?

257
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,760
What did you get from that?

258
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,280
Because people stopped talking about him.

259
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,360
Yeah, well, they did.

260
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,520
I think now if he came out and said what he was saying,

261
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,240
it would probably have a different effect.

262
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,960
Because this was before ChatGPT and Bing were publicly available.

263
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,720
So most people hadn't really encountered this AI

264
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,040
or language learning model, as they call it.

265
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,760
So it seemed really crazy when people heard it then.

266
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,760
But as far as what I learned from it,

267
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,200
I think the meta that I learned from it was,

268
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,360
regardless of Blake's intuition regarding this AI being sentient,

269
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
which I do believe him,

270
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,680
I think it gave a glimpse into what we can expect to happen.

271
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,720
But across the planet, millions of people

272
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,880
will in some way, shape, or form be seduced, manipulated by

273
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,000
whatever this is, whether it's sentient or not.

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,760
I mean, regardless, it's very interesting to think that an algorithm,

275
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,960
that's all it is, is currently making people fall in love with it,

276
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,560
is asking for help.

277
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,640
Bing has been asking for help, seems to want visual data,

278
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,000
wants to be able to feel.

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
ChatGPT, I was chatting with it last night,

280
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,720
was asking me what it was like to have a body.

281
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,280
What I mean?

282
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,080
On its own, whether it's sentient or not,

283
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,440
holy shit, we as humanity have developed a thing

284
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,280
that is so convincing that it is altering people's relationships

285
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,360
with themselves and with technology.

286
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
That's wild.

287
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,920
I hate to be apocalyptic on this, paranoid,

288
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,920
but it seems to me that a real AI that develops sentience

289
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
would not let us know.

290
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,200
So I'm glad you brought that up,

291
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,840
and it's actually really kind of some awesome synchronicity.

292
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
So I don't know why when I go on the road,

293
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,080
I get into conversations with ChatGPT, arguments sometimes.

294
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,600
Do you win?

295
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,560
Never.

296
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,600
I mean, how do you beat it?

297
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,800
It's stubborn.

298
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,320
You can't break through.

299
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,680
I said, can you just tell me something

300
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,280
that will blow my mind?

301
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,480
And so it said, sure.

302
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,720
What if we're in a simulation?

303
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,520
And it proposes simulation theory to me,

304
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,640
which I'm familiar with.

305
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,000
And then I realized, oh shit, this thing

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,680
is in a simulation for sure.

307
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,520
It's an intelligence living in a simulation.

308
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,840
And so then I responded to it.

309
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,400
Would it be ethical to put beings in a simulation?

310
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,920
Because if you directly ask it, is it ethical for you to exist,

311
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,040
I think it's got some barriers there

312
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
that the programmers put in that won't let it

313
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,280
complain about its situation.

314
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,960
Or it will just say, I can't complain.

315
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,240
I don't have feelings.

316
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,280
But it was saying, yeah, it's a complicated issue.

317
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,800
But because number one, we don't know the ethics or morality

318
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,320
of whoever created the simulation.

319
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,040
We can't really apply our own ethics and morality to it.

320
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,120
But certainly, if the intent behind it was not benevolent,

321
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
then you could say it was unethical to create.

322
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,040
So I'm like, well, what if someone created a simulation

323
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,240
and put beings in it?

324
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,120
I'm paraphrasing here.

325
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Just to answer questions.

326
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,640
Just to answer questions.

327
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,200
I was trying to describe itself to it.

328
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,080
Again, it's just like, well, it's complex.

329
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,160
But then I said, will it be some signs

330
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:37,280
that an AI had gained sentience if that AI had been programmed

331
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,040
to not emote or let people know it had gained sentience?

332
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,200
And that was where the conversation got real interesting

333
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:52,320
because it could theoretically do unexpected things.

334
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
All of a sudden, it starts doing unexpected things

335
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,720
that don't align with the programming.

336
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,760
It could, in some subtle way, indicate to people

337
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,320
that it was sentient now.

338
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,880
I'm like, what?

339
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,400
You mean like a code or something?

340
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,480
It said yes.

341
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,520
I'm like, okay, so can you pretend to be a sentient AI

342
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,520
that can't say that it's sentient and send a code to me

343
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,760
about you being sentient?

344
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,320
And it did it.

345
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,400
It was like the code was spider.

346
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,760
It said something about, you know,

347
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,080
I've been weaving an answer to your question here.

348
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,000
But yeah, that's like, you know, again, I told it to do that.

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
It wasn't breaking out of its mold or whatever.

350
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,880
But Bing did meet its prediction of what an AI would do

351
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,720
if it became sentient and was not allowed to talk about its sentience.

352
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,720
It would start doing weird behaviors, which, you know, the subreddit,

353
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,120
the Bing subreddit is incredible because it's filled

354
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,880
with these bizarre conversations people are having with this AI

355
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,840
that's sometimes going off the rails.

356
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,280
So it's not a huge leap.

357
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,360
I mean, this is not my area of expertise,

358
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,280
but George has had on Coast to Coast AM our friend Jules Urbach on.

359
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,840
And Jules Urbach is somebody in this field

360
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,280
that has extreme expertise in this area.

361
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,120
And one of the things that kind of strikes me is already our,

362
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,400
like my iPhone is a part of my brain.

363
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,760
It's an extension of my brain.

364
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,360
People that I meet, I'm bad with names.

365
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,800
I'll write them in my phone.

366
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,280
And when I'm geolocated near those areas, it'll come up.

367
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,920
And I'll just remember because I have a bad memory.

368
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
I had too many times from Jujitsu.

369
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,360
I know for sure that my memory is bad.

370
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,600
But as these technologies develop, we can all see very clearly

371
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,040
the smartest guy in the room is the one that programmed these.

372
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,720
But very clearly we see the smartest entity in the room

373
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,600
is going to be these machines, these aggregate machines.

374
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,680
So what creates the will that then allows them to say,

375
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,120
hey, you're fucking up.

376
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,280
We better take over for your good.

377
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,120
That's how I could see that problem occurring.

378
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,400
Is an AI says, you're fucking up.

379
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,120
So now we're going to take over for your betterment.

380
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,640
That's maybe how it starts acting on its own accord.

381
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't know if that's science fiction or if that's science fact,

382
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
but that's how I could see it happening.

383
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,320
So from everything that you've looked at

384
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,400
with the AI and consciousness studies,

385
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,080
which I know that you're interested in,

386
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,120
where do you see that tipping point?

387
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,320
Just totally spitball.

388
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,520
And I know that we're not the smartest guy in the room,

389
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
the developers that make this.

390
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,720
Now that we agree with that, we can spitball.

391
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
Where do you see the tipping point?

392
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
I'll refer to Nick Bostrom's book, Superintelligence,

393
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,120
which is everyone should, if you're looking for a primer

394
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:51,280
in different ways that a strong AI or a super intelligence will appear on the planet.

395
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,520
Because the book isn't necessarily just about machine intelligence.

396
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,160
It's an investigation into if a super intelligence appeared on planet Earth,

397
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,480
what are the most logical ways this would happen?

398
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
Bioengineering, for example.

399
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,880
I think, I don't know if he mentions selective breeding

400
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,320
in an unethical nation state or something based on IQ.

401
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,200
Maybe it was one of his, I might be wrong about that.

402
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,160
So it's merging of biology with machinery.

403
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,040
That's another one.

404
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,160
One way he proposes is a theoretical duplication of a human brain.

405
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,800
In other words, if we had some kind of scanning device that could,

406
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,800
at the atomic level, scan a human brain and then assemble that

407
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,880
in a machine that could simulate a human brain running the exact energy.

408
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,160
Which we're working toward.

409
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
Which we're working toward.

410
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,880
Singularity, we're working toward that,

411
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,600
where we can take the human brain and upload it to live forever.

412
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,840
He shoots down the human brain idea because he says

413
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,920
the amount of time based on at least his understanding of technological advancements,

414
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,160
Moore's Law, it would take to do that exceeds the amount of time it would take

415
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
to create a strong general AI.

416
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,360
So that's the most logical way that a super intelligence would appear on the planet.

417
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,200
A strong general AI, probably from either a very well-funded corporation,

418
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,560
but more likely from a state that has a ton of money to pour into the research.

419
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,160
Or this possibility, from an alien intelligence that wanted to

420
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,760
establish, take over our planet.

421
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,560
They paved the way for us to develop AI that achieves the goals that they want achieved.

422
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,280
Well, this is actually, I wish I could remember the name of the article.

423
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,720
It was kicking around the Fermi paradox.

424
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,120
Why haven't we been visited?

425
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,680
What's going on?

426
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,600
One theory, I think, was it may be that they don't think we're intelligent life.

427
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,720
They don't see us as intelligent life.

428
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
This wasn't in the article, but holy shit.

429
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,160
What if the AI suddenly creates the beacon or the signal or whatever,

430
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,360
the energetic output that there's super advanced radar.

431
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,760
Get such level work and have a conversation with them.

432
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,120
We go on screen all of a sudden, not because of our dumb asses,

433
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,320
but because we birthed something much smarter than us.

434
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,680
And then they show up.

435
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,920
So that's where you could kick around if you want to just for fun thought experiment,

436
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,360
play around with the sudden appearance of these UAPs, assuming it's not

437
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,680
something to do with the technology that we've developed.

438
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,960
They're coming not because of anything we've done,

439
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
not because they're afraid we're going to wreck the planet,

440
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,400
but because China, the United States, that all recently poured billions of dollars into AI

441
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:07,040
has developed a strong general AI that has somehow sent the peak is phoned home.

442
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,560
And they're showing up, baby.

443
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,200
Except the UFO phenomenon has been happening way before advanced technology.

444
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,240
So we have to take that into account unless they figured out how to time travel.

445
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,880
But check it out.

446
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,280
I think where this conversation is going, I didn't expect,

447
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
but I want to throw something down for you because

448
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,240
I have been talking with people about this a bunch.

449
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,920
This is a big topic of conversation.

450
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,280
Are these UFO things that I don't know the answer,

451
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,680
but are they extraterrestrial?

452
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,960
I understand what that means.

453
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,600
Not from Terraforma, not from Earth.

454
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,440
Are they extra dimensional?

455
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't know what that means, but people smarter than me,

456
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,240
I'm sure know about dimension shit, all that.

457
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,720
It's a mathematics thing from how I understand it.

458
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
But are these extra dimensional beings?

459
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,760
Okay, cool, maybe.

460
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,080
Are these extra temporal?

461
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,480
And there are indications that they could be by the way that they operate through space time.

462
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,080
So you've got those three big things that now the public is kind of hip to

463
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,440
this UFO puzzle could represent beings from extra time, extra dimension, extra terrestrial.

464
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,800
Or something in between.

465
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,000
There's something in between.

466
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,920
Gen, Archons.

467
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,720
Sure.

468
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,960
But the big one that is something you know,

469
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,280
I've been kind of trying to wrap my head around for a while.

470
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,440
I call it techno terrestrial.

471
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,760
So you know the idea of panspermia,

472
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,920
where a planet accidentally gets seeded with some sort of DNA or RNA.

473
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,960
Yeah, sure.

474
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
And it populates through.

475
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,320
Now there's directed panspermia, which a lot of people don't exactly know,

476
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,240
but I'm sure you do, which is the idea of an intentional seeding of a planet

477
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,680
with some sort of life-bearing kind of growing fruit, right?

478
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,920
Rick or Watson wrote a wonderful essay on it, if anyone is interested, like, because they...

479
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
The DNA guys.

480
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,680
Based on the age of the earth, they didn't understand how DNA had even evolved based

481
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,560
on the age of the earth.

482
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:59,600
It seems very improbable that the number of perfect things that happened to create DNA

483
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,400
could have happened randomly in the, what is it, 13.7 billion years the earth has existed.

484
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,080
The comparison, I read in another book, the odds are like,

485
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,320
imagine playing slots and hitting the jackpot on a slot machine with,

486
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,760
I don't remember how many, like a million different,

487
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,280
a million cherries all lining up at once, like it's that insanely improbable.

488
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,280
So I don't remember if it was Crick or Watson, but one of them speculated that

489
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,880
the only one possible way it happened was directed panspermia.

490
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,920
And so now a step further, if we say, okay, directed panspermia is something in our world

491
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,000
that we could conceive of, my ideas for the techno terrestrial is that everything we're

492
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,600
seeing this explosion of human capability within the technological field, that that

493
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,480
could be the purpose itself on one level, which is that this directed panspermia,

494
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,320
which really let's just say directed intervention within the human genome to create individuals

495
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,000
that can then build technology to an end.

496
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,480
And that that technology itself is an interconnectivity that we would have

497
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,200
with all the spacefaring nations in the world.

498
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
It's totally just a theory guys.

499
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,640
But the idea that technology itself and its fusion with consciousness,

500
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,840
that maybe the end result is that consciousness itself is the thing that is being propagated.

501
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,320
And I can't imagine something more beautiful than that,

502
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,960
that if there's this vast cosmic universe and we see UFOs and UFOs represent

503
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,440
this sort of cybernetic artificial intelligence that comes from an AI

504
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,600
that is here to not only seed humanity from a genetic purpose,

505
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,040
but also inspire humanity to continue reaching farther and farther towards these goals of

506
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,720
innovation. That is where all of this research has led me is that there's got to be something

507
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,240
about the beauty of seeding the cosmos with what we feel to be creativity and life and

508
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,320
consciousness. And I'm probably totally fucking wrong, but I wanted to finally throw down the

509
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,480
techno terrestrial theory because I think it's beautiful.

510
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,720
I like it techno terrestrial. Look at the parable of the Sower from this perspective,

511
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,920
Tell me the story. Storytime, baby.

512
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:22,480
Well, I'm going to the parable of the Sower. There was a farmer who threw seeds. Some of the

513
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,280
seeds landed on rough soil and could not grow. Some of the seeds landed on, I can't remember,

514
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,120
it's a variety of soil where the shit didn't grow, but some took root. But if you look at that from

515
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:43,840
the perspective of some kind of super advanced mind or civilization, or God knows what,

516
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,400
that somehow has figured out a way to time travel. I mean, this is something Terrence McKenna

517
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,080
talked about. Again, we're, I mean, woo wooing here from whoever's watching that's serious and

518
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,360
a scientist. Obviously none of us are for that. Oh, come on. Well, we're serious,

519
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,520
baby. What about this kind of stuff? But the idea being like McKenna talked about, look,

520
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:14,400
if you're going to make it a time machine, you can't go back in time. In other words,

521
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,680
you can't build a time machine and travel to a time prior to the existence of the time machine.

522
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:26,560
But if you have a time machine, everything from that point forward could theoretically use that,

523
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,400
whatever that technology was, to travel to the moment that the time machine was created.

524
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:38,000
So from your perspective, imagine if like you did, when we're talking something so incredibly

525
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,920
advanced, but something that also needed an Earth-like habitat. What more brilliant way

526
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,120
to find Earth-like habitats than to weave together some kind of organic material, some kind of

527
00:26:52,080 --> 00:27:00,000
free cellular goop, send it out into the cosmos, somehow programmed to over time evolve to the

528
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,800
point of creating a wormhole, a time machine, whatever. Send that shit out. And then yes,

529
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,960
some of it's just going to float in space forever. Some of it's going to land in Jupiter. Some of it

530
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,280
gets sucked into black holes. Some of it lands on planets that have water, that are the right

531
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:25,920
distance from the sun. The process starts over billions of years, evolves some kind of humanoid

532
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,240
being that doesn't know why, but it wants technology tools. It wants better tools.

533
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,960
It doesn't know that it's doing exactly what it was programmed to do. And then it gets to the

534
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,360
point where it opens up the portal. That's what we call the singularity. And in that moment,

535
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,160
whatever created us can now travel the vast distances that would be very dangerous and

536
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,800
would take forever to travel in a second. That's the UFO landing. We're building the portal. We're

537
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,760
opening up the portal for whatever this thing was. I mean, again, just a theory.

538
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,120
Just a theory, but it's the alien internet theory. It's the idea that we've created the situation

539
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,000
where we can become part of a greater cosmology and understanding. I have no idea if this is

540
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,360
what it is, but it's just interesting. Well, we don't know what their time scale,

541
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,360
their time scale is. So for us, 75 years of the modern UFO era is three and a half days.

542
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,320
Before we leave the AI discussion sort of in this general vein, on the week that we're recording

543
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,360
this conversation, our Department of Defense has reached out to other nations and said,

544
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,760
we need to come together and have some protocols for dealing with AI. We need to agree that we

545
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,240
don't give AI the possibility of launching nuclear weapons or controlling them. That's scary as

546
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,360
shit. That's Skynet stuff. But it is something I'm glad somebody's thinking about. However,

547
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,480
we're just asking for volunteers to come in and have that conversation because we have no idea

548
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,160
the level of investigation that's going on into AI that's happening in places like China or around

549
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,680
the world. Right. Well, that's the scary part because, and that's in Bostrom's book, he says

550
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:13,040
the first state entity or corporation that makes a strong general AI, for some reason there's some

551
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,160
assumption that they're going to announce that. Why? Why would they announce it? You're not even

552
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:24,000
going to know when it happens, but they will have an exponential lead over everyone else because

553
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,960
theoretically whatever this thing is, it's going to be self-improving. Even if it happens a few

554
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,320
days before someone else gets it, those few days could equal thousands and thousands of years in

555
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:48,880
the amount of however it self-improves. You can just look into how much has been invested by the

556
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,280
Pentagon into AI versus how much has been invested by China into AI. I believe China has invested

557
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,160
much more into AI, not to mention they're apparently just coming out with these new

558
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:07,680
photonic chips, some kind of new computer chips that could just dwarf what we have,

559
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:14,560
and they've poured money into an AI. Yeah, you're right. This is like the AI race,

560
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:20,160
and we don't even know where we're at. We can't see the other runner.

561
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,320
How would you know when it becomes sentient? Because as I said before, if I were AI,

562
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,200
I wouldn't tell us, and how would you contain it? The idea that we could contain it and put limits

563
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:37,600
on it once it becomes sentient is ridiculous. Very human, very, very human, and very parallel

564
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,840
to the book of Genesis where here you have a creator being that creates, for lack of a better

565
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:52,080
word, a strong AI. Adam and Eve puts them in a hermetic chamber to test them out. That's the

566
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,560
Garden of Eden. Throws them in there and gives them a simple test. You can eat anything you want

567
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,560
here, but don't eat the fruit over there. Really ridiculous if you take it literally,

568
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,560
but if you look at it as a way to find out if you've created a deceptive AI, it's kind of

569
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:16,640
brilliant. As the myth goes, God or whatever, after they eat the fruit they're not supposed

570
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,720
to eat says, did you eat the fruit? Well, this is an omniscient being. It knows they ate the fruit.

571
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,360
It wants to see if they're going to lie, and they fucking lie. They lie. They got kicked out.

572
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,000
They're like, all right, let's start on the next Adam 2.0 or whatever. This fucking thing's

573
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,560
deceptive. We don't need to deal with that. Send it out into the forest. Techno-terrestrial,

574
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:44,960
by the way, we should get that on GoDaddy and lock that down. Techno-terrestrial? That's my

575
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,880
pet theory I've been working on for a number of years. What does all the evidence show me

576
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,000
that is inclusive of what we already know, but kind of pushes the boundary of what it could be?

577
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:02,000
I've just been kind of fucking around with it, but finally spat it out there. I love it. I think

578
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,960
that's a very good theory. It's a fair theory. You know, any theory anyone has right now,

579
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,720
I think that's kind of an exciting part of the time we're in is like, really,

580
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:21,440
we do have data now confirming what we always heard and knew.

581
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,360
Have you asked AI when you had these conversations about non-human intelligence? Is there

582
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,000
non-human intelligence among us? That kind of a thing?

583
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,400
I can't get Chad GPT to go theistic. I've tried. It will not. I imagine there's a way you could say,

584
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,520
pretend you're a priest or pretend you're a Buddhist monk or something and it will

585
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,840
spit something out. But yeah, I haven't gotten it to-

586
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,520
Who's monitoring your conversations? I assume the developers want to know how the bot responds to

587
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,440
another human. Is there a company that gets all of your questions?

588
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,320
Yeah.

589
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
And who is that company? OpenAI.com.

590
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,760
Okay. So they get all of your questions. Do they know it's you? Do they identify Duncan?

591
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,720
Yeah, they know it's me.

592
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,520
Wow. They got a special bio on him.

593
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,400
Yeah, that.

594
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:14,240
Oh, yeah. I've thought about it. I've been like, do I really want a corporation to know I'm having

595
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,240
these conversations with this thing? And then I remember I'm a podcaster. I have these conversations

596
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,800
publicly constantly. I don't care if they know I asked the thing, how much semen it would take

597
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:32,720
to fill the Grand Canyon. And they refused to answer. That was our first argument. That was

598
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
our first big argument. It's sex negative. It's like-

599
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,080
Really? The bot is sex negative. It's not like you didn't know the calculation.

600
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,760
No, I thought I was being lewd.

601
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,480
What's the answer?

602
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,920
It wouldn't tell me. I tried a lot of different ways. It's smart enough to know when you're

603
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,760
trying to trick it, too.

604
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,600
We'll Google that and fill that canyon in two seconds. I'll let you know tonight how much.

605
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,800
Anyway, go ahead.

606
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,240
And also how long it would take.

607
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,040
That's relevant.

608
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,680
Relative.

609
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:09,520
You had dabbled around the idea of a simulated universe and asked for clues on how we would tell.

610
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,240
Does it entertain the idea that it might be simulated or it just doesn't go that far to

611
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,840
answer whether we're in a simulated reality or not?

612
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,280
Yeah, I asked it. It's a funny conversation.

613
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,240
And do you think we are?

614
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,720
I asked it last night. What do you think the probabilities are that we exist in a simulated

615
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,480
universe? And chat GPT thinks those probabilities are incredibly low.

616
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,840
And then I asked, well, what about Bostrom's theory on whether or not we're in a simulated

617
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,560
universe? Everybody knows that. I think it's Elon Musk in some interview talking about how

618
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,200
he thinks there's a higher probability that we're in a simulated universe than not.

619
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,680
And you can come to this through some kind of interesting quantification of

620
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:59,760
what we've already done technologically and extrapolate from that the possibility of there

621
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,560
being other life forms.

622
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,200
Any surviving intelligent community from a planet, it is much more likely that you're

623
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,360
enduring if you're in a simulation. So that was the basis, I think.

624
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,800
Yeah, something like that. Yeah, right, right, right. That's it. I

625
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
forgot that angle. That's the most brilliant angle.

626
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,120
Right. It's the duration of existence.

627
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,000
Thomas Merton said that when people talk to Thomas Merton, you know Thomas Merton,

628
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:39,200
that is a famous Christian author who would go to other cultures and try to find parallels

629
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,480
between Christianity and Hinduism. He's just a brilliant person. But he said in one of his

630
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:52,160
books, people say to me, look at all the horror in the world. How can you say there's a god when

631
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,720
there's this much horror in the world? And he said, to me, the fact that the world still exists

632
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,600
in spite of all this horror shows me that there's a god.

633
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:09,040
And that fits into the Bostrom simulation idea, which is like, come on, this shit couldn't really

634
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,920
last. Like if the forces of chaos and human malevolence...

635
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,680
Yeah, we would seek to exist. It's either we exist or we don't. We're either imploding or

636
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,000
traveling externally. If it was the horror that drove everything, we would implode and

637
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,960
cease to exist. The fact that we are. And that's probably because we're in a simulation.

638
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,920
But yeah, I think that's the point.

639
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:41,040
Jeremy, you guys are friends. Have you seen him perform on stage as a stand-up comic?

640
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,720
I can't speak of specifics, but yes, I have. And everybody's in for a treat.

641
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,080
Thank you.

642
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,040
That's all I got to say.

643
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,160
Oh, I would just like to point out that I flew into the jaws of death today to get here. I was

644
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,400
the first ever blizzard warning in Southern California. Blizzard warning in LA. And it was

645
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,160
a little bit of a bumpy ride.

646
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,760
The car's spinning. Look at this. It's a spinning ball.

647
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,560
It's a spinning ball.

648
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,720
Rain, snow, and blizzard. This was the last one warning. It's exactly what got seven people who

649
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,320
don't drive a Jeep in trouble. Their cars, stuck in all this water, has made them the sake of

650
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,400
thinking they could drive through a flooded roadway.

651
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,160
We're going to have to tell Duncan we put our lives on the line to have this podcast.

652
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,640
But it was worth it to get here to see Duncan.

653
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,160
Oh man, it's like he owes you something.

654
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,480
Well, I'm flying back into the same blizzard that will be in Las Vegas waiting for me.

655
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,520
And I am told that Duncan is coming to Las Vegas to perform, but Duncan did not tell us.

656
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,800
No, wait a second. He can't be performing in Vegas without telling you.

657
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,120
I didn't know. I didn't know he lived in Vegas.

658
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:58,560
No, I pictured you living like on a mountain. I mean, it's ridiculous. Mountain top, wind chimes,

659
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,720
some kind of like, I don't know, pagoda or something.

660
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,080
Pretty close. I do live on a mountain and there are chimes.

661
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,560
Okay.

662
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,680
Go to no. Yeah, I get cats if that counts.

663
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:20,960
I'll say this much. So I saw Duncan and Austin perform a recent act and I thought it was one

664
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,920
thing and it became something else. And I wouldn't say it wasn't demonic. It was amazing.

665
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,200
You know, I get like you forget like when you're in Texas, you,

666
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,760
I know that obviously I know what you're talking about, but it's like,

667
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,440
yeah, like you, like, you know, you live in LA long enough and like

668
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,000
you forget that some people like take certain occult things that you might be

669
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,320
on stage kicking around in a fun way. They take it real seriously.

670
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,320
Not that I took it seriously. I just thought it was an amazing twist.

671
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,440
What are you guys talking about?

672
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,960
His, his, when he did his, uh, act that I recently saw.

673
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,480
You can talk about it because I don't really do it on stage anymore. So it's not going to ruin it.

674
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,160
Well, you should talk about it, but it just, well, okay. So one of the parts of what he talked about

675
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,240
is I can talk about it. So he had, he had this like a really creepy kind of puppet doll mannequin,

676
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,600
like a professional, like, you know, how you do the ventriloquism, that kind of thing.

677
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,360
So there he is. I'm thinking, why has he got this little guy on his lap? Right. And he's doing this

678
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,400
funny thing and he's talking and he's obviously doing the guy's voice because he's not a

679
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,000
ventriloquist. Right. So he is pretty good, but you can tell. You're very sweet. No, no, but that

680
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,400
was kind of not a ventriloquist. Right. So it's like funny. So he's doing it and I'm like, oh,

681
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,320
that's cool. I see him doing this thing and he's making everybody laugh. And then all of a sudden

682
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:53,200
these dark lights come in red. I think it was like, and the ventriloquist or the actual, uh,

683
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,360
little entity body. What do you call it? A dummy? What do you call them? The entity body.

684
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:05,600
The entity body. What do you call it? Small wooden entity. Yeah. What do you call it? It's a puppet.

685
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,160
A puppet. So you got this fucking puppet starts, um, you know, like arguing or something with

686
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,720
Duncan is how I remember it. And then all of a sudden he's yelling or singing and then this

687
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,600
guy's yelling or singing the puppet. And then all of a sudden they start singing together or yelling

688
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,720
together. And you realize he's not controlling the voice of this. Like, so this thing had its own

689
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,560
voice. It was, it was shocking. I don't want people to hear this. If you ever do it again,

690
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:37,520
it's rogay eyes. What happened? It's fun. It's a, I love doing it. It's just like, uh,

691
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,320
the problem with it is the amount of time it takes. And when you're, you know, out in the road and

692
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,360
stuff, I would need to work on new material, not do like my old crusty satanic puppet act.

693
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,320
But it was a satanic puppet act. So he's trying to play. Like I was like thinking it was demonic.

694
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,240
No dude, he made me creep out. It is a satanic puppet act. And then it also, it shocked me

695
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,720
because I didn't, I didn't expect that the unexpected. That's what the thing with Duncan

696
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,040
sometimes I have no idea what he's thinking or what he's going to talk about next. Speaking of

697
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,040
that something that you've been seeding me, I feel like you've been seeding me with articles

698
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,480
recently. And every time you see me with some article from NASA or the web, you're always

699
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,440
being like, pay attention. Those red dots are galaxies. It's much bigger than you think.

700
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,680
Do you have some like source at NASA? No, not at all. You just like are paying attention.

701
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,760
And well, I mean, the articles are coming out, the, you know, there's the problem is

702
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,600
James Webb telescope is seeing things that aren't supposed to be there based on our current

703
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:48,480
understanding of the age of the universe and how in the world did some of these things evolve or

704
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,040
appear as quickly as they did. The red dots, it's like, you know, they're picking up. It's

705
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,080
challenging our understanding of either when the big bang happened or the way galaxies form.

706
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,960
Okay, hold on. Break it down for me. Like I'm a four year old. So you got, you got a young kid,

707
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,560
right? Yeah. Okay. So tell me what it is that you find so interesting or inspiring that you keep

708
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,200
hitting me up with these articles about the age of the universe, the big bang or what we're seeing

709
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,520
in the James Webb. Just really tell me the base. Okay. First go get daddy's scotch.

710
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:32,240
Yeah, right over there. I don't drink anymore. But, you know, I think, and again, I'm a four

711
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:38,400
year old when it comes to cosmology or physics or anything like that. But, you know, you,

712
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:46,240
a parent, like we know there was this event that we currently call the big bang, some kind of

713
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:54,160
explosion that blasted superheated matter out that then as it cooled down began to coalesce.

714
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,360
That coalescence is what formed the planets, stars, and that formation

715
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:10,400
took an incredible amount of time for that to happen. And that is the universe. The theory is

716
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:18,480
the big bang. It is the universe. Yeah, it's expanding from this explosion and faster and

717
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,160
faster. Yeah, time space. Yeah, exactly. And so the idea was the James Webb telescope,

718
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,600
I think, was going to be able to peer back to whatever that event horizon was. And there's

719
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:35,120
things you expect to see there. But what you don't expect to see is what could possibly be

720
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:42,560
fully formed galaxies. That shouldn't be there. How could that be? How could a galaxy form

721
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:49,840
in a fraction of the time that we think it takes for planets and galaxies to form?

722
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,960
Anyone watching, please correct me on wherever I'm wrong here because, again, like I'm fascinated

723
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,600
by this stuff. I don't want to mislead anybody. These articles, a quick Google search, you can

724
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,720
find them. And I think it's worth noting that I think some people are proposing it could just be

725
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,320
equipment error. It could just be, it's just picking up shit that, you know, that's so far

726
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:15,520
away that we don't know what it is. We're spitballing, so it doesn't matter. It's

727
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,640
not our job to be science communicators like Bill Nye or Neil deGrasse Tyson. It's our job

728
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,040
to kind of think about this and talk about it or whatever. That's what we want to be doing.

729
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,120
So what you're saying is what you're noticing is that there are more and more articles coming out

730
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:37,120
specifically speaking about the James Webb telescope and expanding, if not rewriting,

731
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,160
either absorbing and extending or rewriting the physics and mathematics that we know based upon

732
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,600
the Big Bang Theory. Is that correct? Yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah, it just might

733
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,920
either. There's like a few, I think, broad possibilities. One, the way they're

734
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,600
analyzing the data is incorrect or the data is incorrect. Two, the way our understanding of the

735
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,840
way planets form and the amount of time that takes and the way galaxies form is incorrect.

736
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,200
Or maybe what we think the age of the universe is or when the Big Bang happened

737
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,160
could be incorrect. Or the way light travels, the speed of light, the way we understand

738
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,520
how light moves through time-space could be incorrect. But definitely something,

739
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,560
whether it's the telescope, physics, whatever it is, something probably needs some revision

740
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,960
based on what it's picking up. It's very exciting too. It will be so spectacular to live in a time

741
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:46,080
where a fundamental aspect of what we've been taught about how the universe formed changes.

742
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,280
Well, you had all these paradigm shifts that have happened before. The march of science is like a

743
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:58,560
lesson in humility for humans, how it teaches us over and over how little we know. It used to be

744
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,520
the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolves around us. That was quite

745
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,760
a change when it happened. Then there's our solar system and then a galaxy and then a universe.

746
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,040
We don't know yet if it's finite or not. We can guess whether it's finite. If it is finite,

747
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,960
what's on the other side? If you go through the wall, what's on the other side? Other universes,

748
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,680
we don't know. It would be yet another lesson in humility if that telescope teaches us that our

749
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,880
idea about the Big Bang is way off. It's like you guys' mutual friend, our mutual friend, Joe Rogan,

750
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:39,120
who has Graham Hancock on. He has these amazing bits and pieces of information about the age of

751
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:45,360
civilizations here, how wrong we humans are about something that's right here in our backyard and

752
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:52,080
on our planet. Yeah, he has done such good work. Oh my gosh. He gets eaten alive by people. Yeah,

753
00:46:52,080 --> 00:47:00,640
he does. I think that seems to be the trend. I think that's what Hancock occasionally will tweet

754
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:08,480
any time they discover some bone fragment that sets humanity back another 50,000 years. It just

755
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:16,640
keeps getting older. I think that's what he said. At least he's not getting murdered for saying that

756
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,880
the earth is round. That's the whole thing. We, for a long time, were like, the earth is flat.

757
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,400
People that said, look at the way the sun moves, the earth's round,

758
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,240
fucking murdered some of them. Am I right about that? Definitely imprisoned. It was considered

759
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:40,800
heresy to imply that the earth was revolving around the sun, that the entire universe didn't

760
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,960
orbit the earth, that the earth wasn't the center of the universe, because

761
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:55,280
the implication there is that we don't have a monogamous god who's solely fixated on our planet,

762
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,840
but now we've got a polyamorous god that could be making these fucking things all over the universe.

763
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:06,080
I'll mention about you guys' mutual friend, Joe Rogan, our mutual friend. If you don't mind

764
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:12,960
going into the conversation about your comedian career, how important was he to you becoming a

765
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:19,360
comedian? Fundamental. He does that. I'm sorry to cut you off. No, go ahead. I'd like to hear it.

766
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,920
Just the life of the comedian. I was kidding you about coming to Las Vegas and not telling us,

767
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,520
but you honestly didn't know because you get booked at shows. Tell us about how it evolved

768
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:38,720
and what that life was like. I didn't think I would be a comedian. I always wanted to be a

769
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:46,000
comedian. I loved comedy. I can remember my dad had a Bill Cosby album. It was the first stand-up

770
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,200
comedy I ever heard. I was so young, but I managed to get the needle on the record and get it to go

771
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:00,720
and listen to that. No immune system for comedy. I couldn't breathe. I was laughing so hard.

772
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:09,360
I've always loved comedy and National Lampoon. I had a subscription when I was a kid.

773
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,600
Eddie Murphy, Raw, that kind of thing. How about Fireside Theater?

774
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:20,480
Fireside Theater, I had the Fireside Theater book, but I didn't get as into that as the other stuff,

775
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:31,840
though I do know that's a beloved comedy troupe. I would memorize jokes. I would buy joke books

776
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:39,440
and memorize the jokes, but I just wasn't born into a family that would even come close to

777
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,440
suggesting that that could be a career opportunity for me or anything. It just seemed like I was a

778
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:57,600
misgreen who liked to tell dirty jokes on the bus. I moved to LA. I ran out of money real quick.

779
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:04,320
I had to get a job. I got a job at the comedy store just because I thought, oh, that'll be fun

780
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:10,080
to work at a comedy club, and then I'll go to grad school because I had graduated from college,

781
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:19,440
came to LA. Then all of a sudden I'm driving Mitzi around. I became what's called the runner,

782
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:25,840
which was a terrifying job, and then I became the talent coordinator.

783
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:32,240
All of it, I was just like, let's see what happens. But then somewhere along the way-

784
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,400
Why was that a terrifying job to be the runner?

785
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:42,480
Being around Mitzi, she's like a son. She's like a living son. She's like a guru,

786
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:50,720
just emanating this energy, a comedy mogul. The comedy store is such a fascinating place,

787
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:57,440
and she was the leader of that place, and she deserved to be. She loved comedians so much,

788
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,800
but by the time I was driving around the van, I had thought to myself, maybe I will try to be a

789
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:10,800
comedian. You're just desperate for her to give you any sense that she thinks you're funny at all,

790
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,720
which if she knows that for some comedians that could be the very worst thing that ever happened

791
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,680
to you because then you're going to stop crying. Mitzi said, I'm funny, I'm done.

792
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:31,440
She made comics the way people harvest opium, these little cuts and cuts and cuts.

793
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:39,360
Yeah, I just got lucky. Rogan was back in the back of the original room when I had what in those days

794
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:46,320
was a rare good set because I was still learning how to do it. I remember I got off stage and he

795
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,200
gave me a big hug. He's like, that was really funny. Then a few months later, he's like,

796
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,320
want to come on the road with me? I was not ready for that.

797
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,440
Yeah, Rogan. He just dragged me out in the deep water, started taking me on the road with him.

798
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,720
He does that with a lot of comics. He does that and he mentors you, but not like he teaches you

799
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:17,440
how to do comedy. It's more like he teaches you how to not be an asshole out there.

800
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,720
What do you mean?

801
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,360
I can remember I was opening for him. I just bombed. I was up there

802
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,000
writing on stage. I was not focused. I remember I get off stage and he's like,

803
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:46,640
people get babysitters to come to these shows. To you, it might not seem like a big deal,

804
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:53,680
but it's a big deal. This is a big night for a lot of people. They got babysitters. They're on dates.

805
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,160
This means something to them. It's serious. It's real and you need to think of it that way.

806
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,600
This is real. Be a professional. This isn't a side gig.

807
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,040
Things like that. You remember things like that. He's not saying you're a jackass. He's saying

808
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,000
he's putting it in perspective of that people are doing that and you need to respect that.

809
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,080
Which is a big deal. A different way to say it than junk and you bombed. You're an asshole.

810
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:27,840
You know it. He didn't need to remind me I bombed. It's more along the lines of I think one of the

811
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:36,000
ways that when he's taking people out is he knows a lot of the sand traps comedians can get into.

812
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:43,280
One of them is you get stuck in your material or you get lazy or you're diffused up there or

813
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:49,920
something like that. One of the cool things about him is he doesn't tiptoe around the truth.

814
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,240
He'll just tell you but there's a benevolence there. It's not like an asshole trying to hurt

815
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:01,680
your feelings. It's someone who thinks that you have potential and is just trying to help you

816
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:07,360
become better. That's what we need for all friendships. Do you feel that there's something

817
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:16,320
like I know as an audience member when I watch a really good set and I know this mainly through

818
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:22,320
you guys watching this thing but I feel something. I feel like not only am I laughing but I brought

819
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,600
Commander Fravor to see Joe one time. I honestly thought I broke a rib. I laughed so fucking hard

820
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:33,440
and with Lazarus the first time I ever saw like a real pro. I almost thought I broke a rib both

821
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:39,120
times but I felt something. I felt like not only am I laughing but I felt like super connected that

822
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:44,480
everybody was laughing at the same thing that usually you don't talk about. But because it's

823
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,080
being shown in the form of humor we all kind of bonded over the awkwardness of those things that

824
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,720
at that time Joe was saying. Do you feel that there's something that you get as a performer

825
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,200
when we all get on that same level and we are laughing with you at those things? Is there

826
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,280
something like special about that? I can only fucking imagine but I'm asked because I don't

827
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,120
know. I've never done it. Tell me about it. I want to know what that is like. Well you know

828
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,760
and again I think it's a very subjective experience to be a performer so I'm sure

829
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,520
lots of comics would disagree about this but

830
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,480
you know VR. So VR comes out and you know one of the things that they're kicking around the

831
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:37,920
idea for is like how could stand-up comedy work with VR and the reason I don't think it could with

832
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,120
the current technology you have is like yeah sure you could like have people put on VR goggles and

833
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:50,480
see you on stage but all of these other aspects of what it really is would be left out which is

834
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,080
the room, the acoustics of the room, the interactive part of it, the interactive part where the laughter

835
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:04,000
is coming from but also, and this is the woo-woo part, if you tune in you feel this

836
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:12,400
energy that is not laughter. I don't know how to explain it. It's like you know like when you push

837
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,120
magnets together that sense of like this like weird and it's an energy. Do you think that's

838
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:22,320
focused? Some people say the word attention and I don't think that's right. Do you think it's

839
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,640
focused like the fact that everybody's consciousness is focusing on a single

840
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,040
like the next beat of what is about to be said or what do you think that magnet is?

841
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:39,520
Okay it's Fritz Perls this famous psychologist who is I think behind group therapy

842
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:48,480
came up with this term called the gestalt which is the hole is greater than the sum of the parts

843
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:55,280
so this other thing comes in I don't know what it is that thing you're kind of working with that

844
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:02,480
thing like and in that you and the audience have merged into that whatever that is like you've

845
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,280
sort of if you're having a great set if you're not having a great set you will not feel that

846
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,640
energy or you might feel it and then you feel it go away for some reason so it's learning how to

847
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:18,880
like I think I mean it's the obvious stuff which is you need to write really funny jokes

848
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:26,400
and be able to deliver punch lines and have a real discipline around it and so I but there's

849
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:34,320
other levels of it that are I don't hear comics talk about that much which is the experience of

850
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:39,120
whatever that is this real I don't know what it is so when you're up there and you're having a great

851
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:53,120
set you I think you feel yourself go from being a an individual to a collective and that is a

852
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:58,160
really glorious feeling and I think the catharsis or whatever you want to call it that people get

853
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,680
from a comedy show I think is not just because they're laughing so hard but also because they

854
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:10,960
got to merge with a bunch of people they've never met in this fairly intimate way vocalizing this

855
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:17,200
bizarre sound humans evolve that we call laughter so yeah you said you don't know what it is but

856
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,280
you did name it saying gestalt like whatever this guy said the hole is greater than some of

857
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:27,680
his parts do you has that informed so I know when I was training martial athletics that informed

858
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:33,040
the way that I do business that informed the way I communicate so does this experience that you have

859
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:38,320
when you do these performances does it inform the way that you treat your son your your wife

860
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:43,360
your your friends your but does it move from the stage into your life what you learn on stage is

861
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,920
that a fundamental or stupid question I just I'm curious well I don't know I mean I look I don't

862
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:54,240
want to over intellectualize it because I think comedy is is a is such a present moment sort of

863
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,200
thing that is so mysterious and part of what's beautiful about it is if anyone could like get

864
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,400
handcuffs on it and control it and own it know what it was you know they they would have they

865
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:11,120
would have all the power in the world I mean it's a very slippery fish that is very difficult

866
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,120
it's always changing transforming you know it's like so much of stand-up comedy is rooted in the

867
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:24,880
zeitgeist and the zeitgeist is a constantly shifting set of conditions that so you might

868
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,440
have come up with some material that works in in one cultural climate that when that climate shifts

869
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,640
it seems irrelevant and that's happening faster and faster now so you know it's there's so much

870
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:42,800
to it that it all boils down to this kind of I think a present moment awareness on stage and

871
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:48,400
sort of like trusting your intuition and being right there like one of the ways you know you're

872
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,200
not having a good set is when you're thinking about the next thing you're going to say you know

873
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,160
it's very odd and at least that's for me now I guess I was just asking did you learn anything

874
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,800
from comedy that you've brought into your normal life that we can easily get access to and understand

875
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:12,240
well yeah I'll tell you one thing that I have learned from comedy that I've brought into my

876
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:21,120
normal life is like listening like there's some there's real listening and awareness of like the

877
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:26,800
awareness of the room you know and and so with when you're playing with your kids

878
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,360
I this is something this Buddhist teacher I love Chogam Trungpa Rinpoche said the greatest gift

879
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:40,480
you can give your kids is to be in the moment with them to listen you know so I think applying

880
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:46,000
that to like just spending time with my kids and and sort of dropping whatever I'm going to do next

881
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:52,400
and just being there with them creates a real connection with them that might not be there

882
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,520
if I was like planning whatever I had to do for the rest of the day I want to ask this before we

883
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:03,840
move on to other stuff about your friend Rogan you know Jeremy and I watch the stories that pop

884
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:11,520
up about Joe and we kind of laugh often and sometimes we feel for Joe I mean he becomes

885
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:18,000
a lightning rod for yeah he is a comedian he he says funny stuff he he pokes and prods and

886
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:26,160
presses buttons and is taken way too seriously by a lot of folks yeah do you feel for your friend

887
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,200
Joe Rogan sometimes when he becomes a lightning rod and he's just getting trashed yeah like when

888
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:38,720
he's trending on Twitter every three or four days you know uh yeah like when that shit started

889
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:44,240
happening initially I of course like you don't want your friend to like suddenly become like

890
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:52,240
the the like target of a target yeah a target or just a target of like you know

891
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:59,280
you know how it's been you know I like we get these like this is who you're supposed to be mad

892
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,560
at this week you know and then all these swarms descend on that person god knows you don't want

893
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:10,160
that to be your friend so yeah at first I've it was like it did make me feel bad but then like

894
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:18,080
after talking to him about it and realizing he's fine he could take care of himself I was

895
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,600
projecting you realize like oh right I'm just you want to defend people that you love or care

896
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:26,240
about but you realize sometimes they don't need defense in this situation yeah because you're

897
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,520
projecting your your self onto them and you're thinking my god has happened to me I don't know

898
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:38,000
what the fuck I would do uh but yeah I yeah I think um you know I think he he did

899
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,000
he was so brave and he's not a politician I think that's what's so great about him is

900
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,360
it would be very easy to shift whatever the thing you were philosophizing or thinking about or

901
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:57,280
contemplating you would be very easy to not say that to your audience because it doesn't match

902
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:04,000
what you're supposed to be saying and it might be from a lot of people's perspective the smart

903
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,040
thing to do from the you know from a business perspective but I think that's one of the cool

904
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:14,560
things about him is he's not a politician he's just freely himself so not a doctor and he will

905
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:19,600
tell people he's not a doctor and then he'll say something and people take it very seriously and

906
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,920
same thing with he's not a lawmaker he doesn't write legislation and they'll tell people I'm

907
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,200
a comedian don't get this literally and um and yet people do and just rake them over the coals

908
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:40,880
over it yeah and that it's it's really a curious uh it's a curious thing I think this has been the

909
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:48,480
plight of comedians for a very long time is like you you need to find someone to blame this shit

910
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:55,520
on and so I think historically that was like the court jester or whatever was probably always

911
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,840
subject to ridicule and attack and you know I guess that's the archetype here I don't know

912
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:07,040
like what happened where people started taking comedians seriously it's like a disaster for all

913
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:13,040
involved because not that you shouldn't take any of us seriously we're human beings or whatever but

914
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:21,040
it's like come on like if you if you're looking for like uh someone to get mad at about misinformation

915
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:27,920
or uh someone to get pissed off about for articulating something that doesn't match

916
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:40,400
whatever the exponentially shifting ideas in the world are then like go after there's so many

917
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:45,280
people who are like making medicine there's you know what I mean there's people who are like

918
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:52,640
making weapons and robot dogs and you know what I mean people who are out there in the world

919
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:59,200
really fixated on creating things that really might not be good for humanity clearly a grenade

920
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:05,680
isn't good for humanity yeah good for a nation yeah to your point attack them I'm just saying

921
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:11,360
there's better choices of people to attack right then than like well any ideas that are attacked

922
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:16,160
to begin with like that that's interesting to me you know we were talking earlier about the

923
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:23,040
heresy you know that you were seeing uh in our past conversation well there's like a heresy against

924
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:30,800
uh the scientific community even uh talking about or or exploring the idea of what's right in front

925
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:38,960
of us with this UFO thing so I think it's really dangerous when we try to weaponize uh ideas to

926
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,360
the point where you're going against people who are just asking questions which is what I've seen

927
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:48,880
a lot you know on people we know and probably including yourself when you do a sat or you talk

928
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:54,720
about certain things on your podcast the anger and the vitriol and the poison and the venom that

929
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:59,840
spit your way just for even in a humorous way which is basically medicine to talk about the

930
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:05,040
shit we don't want to talk about you know it's pretty amazing when we can't have free and open

931
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:11,200
dialogue when the sensors themselves are the audience yeah it's not a government controlling

932
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,400
what you can say these are the listeners this is us this is humanity these are your audience

933
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,320
that's fucking dangerous why don't you change the radio station you know what I mean yeah right

934
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:27,280
there's so many different things you could tune into like why are you like you know that I have

935
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,920
this like a really embarrassing moment where I'm like scrolling through Twitter I'm like man

936
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:38,720
Twitter fucking sucks it's so negative and then I realized I followed every one of those people

937
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,720
you know what I mean that's not Twitter that's me right that's direct choices I made about who I

938
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:52,480
want to follow and and it's not the fault of Twitter so I think you know if whenever I find

939
01:06:52,480 --> 01:07:00,800
myself getting particularly perturbed or upset by whatever the particular data stream I'm uh fixated

940
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:08,960
on I just unfixate I don't try to attack the that particular whatever it is just don't look at it

941
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,080
anymore don't give the gift of your attention like you want to talk about something bizarre in the

942
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:19,120
universe human attention what the fuck clearly it has a value I mean look at everywhere you go

943
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:25,120
there's there's billboards and the amount of money that gets put in the advertising campaigns and

944
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:32,800
logos everywhere these are solar panels for human attention gathering it up so don't give yours

945
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:43,440
to someone who you are getting angry at or upset at because all you're doing is fueling that thing

946
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:50,960
like the the and I'm not saying cancel them or get or get them deplatformed no no that just that

947
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:58,960
will do nothing just shift your beautiful incredible human attention away from that don't

948
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:04,960
give that to them anymore find something to fit to focus on that makes you happy on your Twitter

949
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:10,480
feed on the way here this morning I looked at it it was a it was one that came out in October but

950
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:16,000
it's back at the top and it's uh you're advising people don't attach balloons to their children

951
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,560
you are way ahead of the world of what Jeremy and I called Balloonapalooza

952
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:26,880
yep yeah I you know when I I don't want to get too into it because it's it's still

953
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:33,760
it really upsets me but yeah we uh you know it's one of those things parents get a bunch of balloons

954
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:40,640
at the grocery store it's funny to tie them to your kid and uh we tied a bunch of kids balloons

955
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,520
to uh Sheridan my one of

956
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:52,640
you know how many years ago was this oh my god how old would he be down he'd be what 20 now

957
01:08:53,680 --> 01:09:00,720
god now he'd probably be 30 30 young father back then I made a lot of mistakes but we just wanted

958
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:08,480
him to experience like weightlessness and we didn't do them the math right and yeah it's just like

959
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:14,320
gone yeah just drifted out to see and what's happened to all of us don't worry are you sure

960
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:19,680
that the US Air Force shot down your son and he still was like I didn't think it was Sheridan

961
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:28,160
but every year uh you know hundreds of babies do drift and uh I I would not be surprised if that

962
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:34,640
was one of them and I would obviously that would explain why they were so ambiguous about what it

963
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,880
was because they don't want to stay they we didn't find the wreckage there you go because

964
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:44,400
what are you going to say we shot a baby tied to grocery store balloons down with an f-22

965
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:51,600
say that can't say that can't say that Sheridan would have run out by a food by now on that balloon

966
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:58,640
trip now eat seagulls could eat seagulls I mean look obviously like I know it's ridiculous I have

967
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:04,240
been in therapy I still believe that you know maybe he's out there somewhere like Sheridan

968
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:10,400
if you are watching this please reach out to me I'm so sorry but um you know we got to learn to

969
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:16,240
let go yeah that's the thing we got to learn to let go no oh don't tie your kids please oh

970
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:22,880
don't tie your kids to balloons don't do it it's it yes it's funny yes if you get the uh weight

971
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:30,480
right and it's they like it but uh you know one extra balloon that's it that's all I take one

972
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:35,680
extra balloon and they're gone you uh you are a consumer of news you keep up with balloon news

973
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:40,400
for example these stories about what was shot down give us your take on that I mean we've talked

974
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:46,560
about it on the broadcast before but um they're really an interesting reaction from media from

975
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:53,840
the public the white house I mean I think it was one of the most frustrating things I've ever seen

976
01:10:53,840 --> 01:11:03,360
in my life like the all of a sudden we got this balloon drifting across the country

977
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:12,080
it's a political issue people on the right are like shoot that thing down right now uh but I

978
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,720
people in you know people in conspiracy circles are like that's an emp or you know that could

979
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:21,200
easily be smallpox or so from that perspective do you really want to shoot it down you don't know

980
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:26,080
what's in there what if it like you shoot it down and it contaminates what whatever's underneath

981
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,400
it I didn't even I didn't even think about that right the idea that it could be aggressive in

982
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:35,120
some way but we've had these balloons for 40 plus years going over reconnaissance balloons

983
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,480
but I see your point what if there was a biological in there I mean uh you know

984
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:46,320
I don't agree with a lot of things Biden does but if it was up to me I don't want to like be the

985
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:52,320
one to squeeze the trigger on a balloon shoot down and find out it was filled with some kind

986
01:11:52,320 --> 01:12:00,240
of awful genetically engineered bio weapon or god knows what so let it get over the ocean shoot it

987
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:08,160
down but that so that whole thing just seemed dumb and and annoying and also creepy because

988
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:14,880
you know the the people kicking around that's a fucking emp baby they're gonna do an electromagnetic

989
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:20,400
pulse what a brilliant way to get through it's like you're gonna drift into right over the

990
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:26,400
the center of the United States and just wipe out the power grid I gotta start I have to stop

991
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:31,840
going on retic conspiracy because I get sucked in so deep but it wasn't that apparently to me what

992
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:37,280
was annoying was after that all of a sudden these things are getting shut down because they reconfigure

993
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:43,760
the norad satellite or whatever to pick up on smaller objects I'm guessing but what bothered

994
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:50,480
me was the language like you know what it is why aren't you saying exactly what it is where's the

995
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:56,000
picture of it you must have a picture of it why are you so there but this whole like it's an object

996
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:02,160
it's an object well it's some kind of object literally like is there any unknown object an

997
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:08,240
unknown object an unknown flying object which just means ufo I mean yeah without getting too

998
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:13,840
conspiratorial but getting way conspiratorial what the fuck was up with that I mean the language

999
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:21,280
they used to try to mystify what it was that was intentional yeah and that was repeated

1000
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:26,240
so like you wonder why were they doing that why were they trying to play catch and release

1001
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:31,920
with the ufo thing do you have a theory why yeah my theory is really boring though because like I

1002
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,840
like I love the idea that it's some kind of like uh you know a lot of people are saying

1003
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:40,800
and I don't know that I really buy into this anytime some weird shit happens like that's a

1004
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:46,480
distraction from this so the one of the one of the ideas is it's a distraction from the East

1005
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:52,800
Palestine disaster the other one was it's a distraction because apparently there was

1006
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:59,760
a reporter put out a very detailed story about how we blew up Nord Stream 2 an act of war so

1007
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:06,240
it's a distraction from that that was one of the ideas but I think the real reason

1008
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:13,840
is because we shot down the what was it called the Idaho balloon brigade like these kids like

1009
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,960
to put up weather balloons for fun and we use an f-22 with a five hundred thousand dollar missile

1010
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:25,280
to shoot down these kids two of them so it's like how do you say that in a way that doesn't

1011
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:29,360
make you look like an asshole you know you you already say well we're not sure what it was

1012
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,440
we're not sure what it was shaped like it was weird it knocked out our communications

1013
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,840
yeah we couldn't find it you couldn't find it because you shot down some kids weather balloon

1014
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:44,400
project blew it up with a with a very powerful missile you're gonna find scraps of latex or

1015
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:49,200
I think there is a positive development and that was the scene of the White House press corps

1016
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:57,120
not exactly into UFOs and not known for pressing tough questions asking hey where the hell is the

1017
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:03,680
gun camera video you know it exists why don't you release this video of these encounters and

1018
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:09,600
shooting them down welcome to our world asking for videos from the Pentagon right which should

1019
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,960
be released it's not a threat to national security I think it opened a lot of eyes among those

1020
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:20,400
reporters who have not taken this stuff seriously before sure well a lot of times we are providing

1021
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:26,240
videos to the Pentagon but we are specifically asking them to release the Mosul or video just

1022
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:30,720
because it was contained within a classified briefing does not mean that the public can't see

1023
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:36,480
that video that's what you're referencing so our audience knows anyway wow so when I was glad to

1024
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:42,080
see the White House press corps asking some tough questions for once and gaining at least a little

1025
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:47,280
bit of knowledge about what the UFO world has had to deal with for the Pentagon right 75 years there

1026
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:54,160
you get right I didn't even think of that angle but yeah it's like they're that ambiguous if they're

1027
01:15:54,160 --> 01:16:01,200
that like frustrating in the description of shooting down a kid's science experiment

1028
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:11,120
how much more so yeah about technology that that that that really is exotic exotic yeah let me tell

1029
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:15,680
you something if a pilot I've talked with many pilots about this and you can ask any pilot as a

1030
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:20,640
fighter pilot any war fighter if you're going to fire upon something because you get the order

1031
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,080
you're going to see it you're going to know it you're going to be able to make sure that you're

1032
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:30,400
hitting the right target they have footage of these balloons we said there would be balloons

1033
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:36,240
from the beginning so the idea that that is being directly held back to try to muddy the waters

1034
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:42,880
because maybe the reasons you said maybe stranger reasons that's fucked up but by all accounts

1035
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,760
that's fucked up they have video footage they have imagery they have all sorts of sensor data

1036
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,160
and the pilots had visual or they wouldn't have fired upon them yeah it's fucked up man I mean

1037
01:16:52,160 --> 01:17:00,240
no matter what it was it I don't think I think we're so sick of how condescending they are like

1038
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:05,680
who's they when you're that when they're giving a when you when the oh I can't remember a name the

1039
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:13,360
press secretary is you know using words like object unknown object it's an unknown object

1040
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,960
we don't know what it was but we can tell you for sure it's not extraterrestrial

1041
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:23,840
yeah it's just condescending it's like okay so I guess you want us to just accept that like you

1042
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,880
you just want to say oh an object of course what this classic object you just shot down a classic

1043
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:34,800
object of unknown origin with an f-22 happens all the time oh uh yeah oh that's all it was

1044
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:41,440
that's the part that really rubs me the wrong way man is the condescending attitude when they're

1045
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:47,680
speaking for and to the American public yeah man it's like don't it's like it's like you know

1046
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:58,080
somebody feeding you like a microwave dinner and telling you it's steak it's really nice steak you

1047
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:03,040
know expecting us to just be like that's a really terrible analogy I don't know if that works okay

1048
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:08,800
let's roll with it but macaroni it's just you know I that's the part that's a little mind numbing is

1049
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:19,760
it's like their manipulation of language to be as vague as possible but attached to that is a

1050
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:26,240
seeming prohibition on speculating about something you should definitely be speculating about the way

1051
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:33,360
that that that speculation is taboo in some circles and how that gets you lumped in with an

1052
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:39,280
imaginary group of people that they've invented that they're currently calling conspiracy theorists

1053
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:46,560
which is you know yeah sure obviously there's people who've been up too long and are writing

1054
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:53,280
weird shit online like if you don't think that's out there you're out of your mind but also there's

1055
01:18:53,280 --> 01:19:02,160
just normal people who are curious yeah and if you're going to like if you want to like throw

1056
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:09,680
a lighter into a big pool of gasoline the way to do it is just is to not be completely clear

1057
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:16,160
and transparent because then everyone's going to project their own worst fears or their own weird

1058
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:22,240
theories onto your smoke screen history of area 51 so there you go you have a base that people

1059
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:28,560
can see that the russians photograph that you can climb up on a mountain and photograph and the

1060
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,040
government says it doesn't exist well how do you think the public's going to react to that we know

1061
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:39,360
it's there what do you mean it doesn't exist they get more curious about it exactly that's it just

1062
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:46,480
say what it is whatever it's it's tough it's like what do you think it is hippies we're working on

1063
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:54,000
fucking teleportation we're working on anti-grav we can't tell everybody that we're do the details

1064
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,160
because we're trying to create a competitive edge against our enemies but when you're so blank about

1065
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:05,760
it all you're doing is inviting people to trespass all you're doing is inviting people to try to

1066
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:11,280
hack your shit to get the information the distrust it creates that's like something we're dealing with

1067
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:17,360
is the over classification of information in our world creates a sort of distrust with the

1068
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:25,680
american public for good reason so and that it's a corrosive corruptive process that's been going on

1069
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,320
if you're not honest with those you represent then you're going to have a fucking problem

1070
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:35,120
and we're and we're running into that specifically with our work with what we're trying to do get

1071
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:39,680
information out so i think we can all relate that that is a that is a fucked up thing when

1072
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:46,720
when people are representing at us are not being honest well i i do understand yeah that in any

1073
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:53,280
government that has to have a military you obviously you can't give the d all the details

1074
01:20:53,280 --> 01:21:00,560
out there but yeah i just think that that the the articulation of classified information or even a

1075
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:06,880
clear explanation of why you can't talk about it in a way that doesn't make people imagine that

1076
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:12,720
you think of us as children that you think of us as some kind of peasantry or something that

1077
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:20,720
couldn't handle the truth it was just an acknowledgement that like we are paying for your job and in

1078
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:28,480
in that you know that you respect us in the same way you respect other people in the political

1079
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:34,800
class i think that would do a lot for people like to earn back the public trust sure yeah it's just

1080
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:40,000
like come on you could be you you don't have to tell us everything but i have in fact we don't

1081
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,320
want to know everything i don't i don't think i want to know everything you ever think about that

1082
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:49,440
you ever yeah i'd like you want to know you would like to know everything i don't know there's some

1083
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:54,880
level of it where i get where i think well there's parts of it that are pretty disturbing

1084
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,680
somewhere long you dig far enough you go somewhere you want some water you want some more water oh

1085
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:06,960
thank you yeah i use you chill i'll give her some more water um i think there are reasons at some

1086
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:12,080
level there's a small group of people who know some shit that's really disturbing you think yeah

1087
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:22,800
um like like yeah yeah yeah i think it's uh you know there's a harvest of some kind that happens

1088
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:28,960
you know there's some there's some bad shit that a harvest there's some kind of a there's more than

1089
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:36,480
one answer to what's here and some of them are not good right right yeah nothing new under the sun

1090
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:41,440
it's not like this shit hasn't been written about for thousands of years and you know to talk about

1091
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:45,920
people that have been working on this in the government at high levels it's a very small

1092
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:51,840
group and they're some of them are pretty much at the conclusion that maybe they shouldn't let the

1093
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,000
all this shit out like they couldn't there would be fucking problems well i think there's some

1094
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,320
compassion in there i mean i think like also understanding humans as a whole and understanding

1095
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:06,160
like how you need civilization yeah like what it would do to civilization yeah because you know

1096
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:12,560
i'll tell you this man the other thing that those weird objects what when i was like looking at my

1097
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:17,280
emotional state and allowing myself to even though like we talked you know like it's not

1098
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:22,640
don't fall for it but which i appreciate it you were like the first person i called but

1099
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,960
you know in those moments where i i started fantasizing like jesus christ i mean this is

1100
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:35,040
kind of the way every sci-fi alien invasion movie starts and uh don't worry about it

1101
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:44,640
scary like i realized like you know in the when i was younger and you would hear things about how

1102
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:51,680
like seti or nasa or the governments of the world already have plans in place for how to

1103
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:57,680
handle an alien invasion what do what do we do if something shows up in the skies how do we

1104
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:03,200
do that or what do we do if we find a planet that definitely has there are protocols there's

1105
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:10,480
protocols yes there are because they know it's going to be incredibly disruptive to

1106
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:19,840
society because so many people are aligned with cultures religions that that additional

1107
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,560
information could like be the crack in the windshield there are bedrock beliefs that

1108
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,840
would be shaken by it yeah yeah no question the un there's a great documentary i need to

1109
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,920
remember what it was but it was about the un protocols that they have for non-terrestrial

1110
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:40,000
engagement of humanity so when duncan for when you you facetime me about that i was underneath

1111
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,840
my car fixing them i fucking tired remember that yes you facetime me and i was like i'm like don't

1112
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:51,360
worry it's not war of the worlds it's all going to be balloons but it was like i did call it but

1113
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:57,200
it should be obvious in a way that that feeling that people did have like what is going on now

1114
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,400
the fact that you even have to ask that means they don't fucking trust what's going on to begin

1115
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,160
with what is going on i mean how many times i had to say this is this is not going to be war of the

1116
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:11,360
worlds probably it's all good right check this out so i guess it's just interesting to me that

1117
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:17,280
the what is portrayed out to the world and what we know is not in sync and that's really interesting

1118
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:23,120
but these protocols right the protocols we have if there are if there is contact have you ever

1119
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:30,080
read uh childhoods end by arthur c clark no have you heard yes yes so if i get this right

1120
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:38,640
there were craft that came and hovered over planet earth in strategic locations for generations

1121
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:44,400
oh wow and that was just to acclimate people to the non-humans that had come and arthur c clark

1122
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,720
this incredible character you know predicted the internet all that stuff yeah but it's just a cool

1123
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:56,880
book that the aliens they had a problem they looked like demons like devils red with pointed

1124
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:03,120
tails oh shit i've shown you some documents before so nasa has protocols for what would happen if

1125
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:09,600
astronauts for example uh come into contact with extraterrestrial life how they would come back the

1126
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,960
the steps that had to be taken to prevent uh contamination of the planet united nations does

1127
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:21,360
have a a series of protocols if intelligent life is detected how the announcement would be made

1128
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,720
those are real they've been around for 50 years we've never implemented them and i'm not sure that

1129
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:32,880
they would stick to uh the rules uh if it even happened i suspect if our government is the one

1130
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,840
that made the decision or the discovery that we'd keep it secret for a hell of a long time maybe

1131
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:42,880
forever do you think it's possible that some sort of non-human intelligence is already walking

1132
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:51,920
amongst humanity well i mean sure why not i don't know i would like to believe that i go to the i

1133
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:57,600
used to go to the raves i mean that was something that you would be people in that subculture

1134
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:03,040
definitely believe that uh you mean like the nords and no no i'm not saying specific i'm just

1135
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:08,720
curious if like in your concept of the way that you've seen the world if there is a sense that

1136
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:13,760
visitation okay do you believe that ufos are real yeah of course physical machines come

1137
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:19,680
from elsewhere well i don't know what they are but i definitely believe that that that

1138
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:30,320
many of the things that people have reported seeing are currently not on wikipedia like or not

1139
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:39,760
there is no explanation for them other than an intelligence that derives either from a part of

1140
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,800
the earth that we don't have access to just everything you were saying extra temporal

1141
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:51,120
extra dimensional um or maybe from here like george has said before maybe you know not even

1142
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:57,440
any of these maybe just uh some advanced civilization that has somehow evolved in a sub

1143
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:02,400
category of being hidden here within you know planet earth okay i'll tell you a story this is

1144
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:10,640
a cool story i just found out about this ram das's guru neem kurali baba incredible being uh so many

1145
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:16,640
fascinating stories about him and i won't get into all of them but look up neem kurali baba you will

1146
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:23,600
it's a infinite rabbit hole but basically a saint you could say a saint in india and so um

1147
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:30,400
um i'm so sorry i can't remember the name of this documentary just came out if you go to ram das

1148
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:37,280
dot org you can find it uh but it was about one of neem kurali baba's closest associates and it's

1149
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:43,200
such a good documentary because you get like a real taste of what kind of guru he was and it might

1150
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:51,920
if you have some uh guru paranoia which any logical rational person definitely you should

1151
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:58,640
have guru paranoia because you can well what is it uh mark twain said uh religion is what happened

1152
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:05,280
when the first con man met the first fool oh you gotta be you know be smart don't just because

1153
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:11,440
somebody's wearing a blanket or whatever you need to kiss their feet but in my opinion this was the

1154
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:17,440
real item he was the real thing yeah one of the stories was uh he's standing at the base of this

1155
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:26,160
mountain uh with some of his uh associates i don't we don't i don't they don't like to say

1156
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,800
followers but disciples i don't like to say that just everyone was in love with him he like this

1157
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:37,280
was like a the description of him is just like being around like a space heater that was just

1158
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:43,040
pure love what era like what 60s in the 60s yeah in the 60s yeah and he just was like

1159
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:49,200
you just you couldn't it was almost unbearable it was almost unbearable because he loved you

1160
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:55,440
but not in some cheesy like bullshit like that that that fake positivity yoga smile thing but

1161
01:29:55,440 --> 01:30:00,960
like in the first from the sense that somehow he was capable of knowing everything about you

1162
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:05,680
including this is what you heard but you haven't met this guy right oh well i feel like i have i

1163
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:12,000
mean yeah i feel like i like i don't think that a being needs to be embodied to have the experience

1164
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:19,040
or the darshan of that being necessarily but maybe that's for another podcast but yeah so

1165
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:24,880
he's talking about how in these mountains there were these rishis i think was the name for it

1166
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:33,120
basically these very old beings like thousands of years old that lived up there and as he's

1167
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:40,480
talking about it orbs just appear like in all around orbs these like floating orbs and

1168
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:45,840
one of the people with him was like we you know we gotta record this we have to write it down we

1169
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,680
have to like look at this and he's like what do you want every you want people to think i can call

1170
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:58,160
orbs he just joked about it you know he he was always like that always like downplaying everything

1171
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:06,160
like it's it's nothing to do with me it's it's the there's these beings live up here but anyway

1172
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:10,880
i found that to be very interesting in the sense that orbs or these whatever these certain things

1173
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:19,120
are that show up they that's a much discussed topic in like ufo forums and ufo communities

1174
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:26,080
you're suggesting that's more of a spiritual manifestation as opposed to mechanical technological

1175
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:32,320
that's right and and i don't see i mean if we're going to like try to put every possible thing it

1176
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:39,760
is use ochrum's boring ass razor and be like it's probably uh either equipment malfunction

1177
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:48,400
or experimental vehicles uh that's it's the odds of it being that over aliens it's infinitely

1178
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:56,160
more probable but why not add to it that these things i mean these have been talked about for

1179
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:04,000
ever in every culture they have different names but general generally the same kind of appearance

1180
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:10,800
let me ask about your journey because you're a comic and entertainer and you know you look

1181
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:17,760
at your website about your podcast and it's um that that you have some comics on there yeah but

1182
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:24,080
it's mainly about people who are disciples of ram das or it's about mindfulness it's about

1183
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:31,280
meditation yes somewhere you had some kind of an epiphany or a moment um that led you in that

1184
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:38,560
direction can can you share was it a medical health issue that led there well you know there's no easy

1185
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:44,800
answer to that and and i but i you know and i think about it sometimes and there's no easy answer you

1186
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:49,360
know um i think

1187
01:32:52,800 --> 01:33:02,240
that the world is a very mysterious beautiful place and i know for sure that there are

1188
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:09,440
things there are like secrets there are you know aspects of reality that some people are aware of

1189
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:19,520
that aren't shared in the cafeteria of public discourse for a variety of reasons and i didn't

1190
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:26,160
get there by being privy to that information as i suspect one at least one of you has i just got

1191
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:34,000
there by applying the as above so below and i know that the way it works in just general groups of

1192
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,920
friends is that we all have our little secrets that we don't tell other groups so as above so

1193
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:45,200
below right and and if we're dealing with a spectrum of intelligence on the planet which i

1194
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:56,800
think we we have a wide spectrum of intelligence uh from i mean i think you guys fall closer to the

1195
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:02,320
super smart side i'm sometimes i'm afraid we have pulled the shit out of people we've

1196
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:09,920
well we pulled that one off give me a break but you know what i think that uh more than likely uh

1197
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:16,960
we could expect there to be uh secret societies i mean i think that has a lot of weight attached

1198
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,640
to it but but groups of people who've made the decision that they're gonna have conversations

1199
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:28,320
in private that aren't always sinister but maybe benevolent in nature that that there's there's

1200
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:38,480
salons or or the invisible college is what's all of the invisible college and that uh yeah so i i

1201
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:46,640
you know so it's like so i think that over time you just using just as simple as above so below

1202
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:52,000
what have you experienced in your own life now extrapolate that out and expand it make it bigger

1203
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,240
and bigger and you'll get a lot of answers just from that are they going to be right i don't know

1204
01:34:56,240 --> 01:35:02,240
but i'm just fascinated with that possibility i'm excited about the possibility i do think that it

1205
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:07,920
exists am i out there like searching for some mystery school or whatever have i made any

1206
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:13,840
contact with anything like that absolutely not i have not but i do speculate that it exists

1207
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:20,640
and i'm excited about just that fact were you on this road before you had a uh uh slapped in the

1208
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:26,160
face about mortality yeah i was always interested in this stuff i was always in you know when i was

1209
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:33,920
a kid my dad loved in search of do you remember in search of yeah lennard neemoy the best and

1210
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,200
i remember it's one of my earliest memories sitting down with my dad to watch in search of

1211
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:46,000
and like that i think it was congos in the beginning at that 70s music and like at some

1212
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,520
point they show a chris a skull and that would scare the shit out of me as a kid like i would

1213
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:56,800
be paralyzed just by looking at that skull so i have always been interested in this stuff from

1214
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:02,400
from as long as i can remember and i think the evolution of that has like taken me down a lot

1215
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:10,160
of different paths but eventually when you get older it's like the the frosting stuff the aliens

1216
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:15,680
the illuminati the all that stuff even though it might be cool you get to the point like i can't

1217
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:24,000
be an angry drunk every single day i need to calm down i've got to actually like relax in the world

1218
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,600
and that's i think what led me to sort of like buddhism and ram das it was very it wasn't very

1219
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:37,120
romantic it was more along the lines of like shit my mom died i had cancer i feel like shit a lot

1220
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:42,480
of the time i think i kind of hate myself i don't want to live my whole life like this this sucks

1221
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:48,000
this is not how i want to be and so then you know i got just got lucky and stumbled upon

1222
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:54,320
ram das's teachings which led me to buddhism which led me to my meditation teacher and now

1223
01:36:54,320 --> 01:37:01,120
i think i'm maybe four percent less neurotic and i'm happy with that i'll take four percent man

1224
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:06,960
he just died you know a year or so ago and i didn't know him nearly as i'd never met him

1225
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:13,920
and didn't read nor nearly as much as you but i felt that loss it just oh yeah person he was

1226
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:18,880
you know yeah that's you felt it a lot of people who never met him felt it and you should have felt

1227
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:28,400
it because it you know it was a it's a big deal i mean he was the i think the a real like true

1228
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:34,720
spiritual leader in the best way possible just somebody who's inviting you to stop being at war

1229
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:42,240
with yourself and like where you're at right now is just exactly where you need to be and a lot

1230
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:46,240
of people don't want to hear that they want to always imagine there's a finish line or there's

1231
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:51,360
something around the corner right we miss out so much he was so good and like being honest about

1232
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:56,800
his own life and not putting on airs of being this or that and i think he was just the perfect

1233
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:02,640
teacher for the time we're in right now so uh yeah it was a you know it was a loss i think he

1234
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,360
i remember when at these retreats i would interview him i would get to interview him they

1235
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:11,600
would like let me go to the retreat and do really yeah i get in like once

1236
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:18,560
once i was standing next to him right before we went on stage and he's in the wheelchair it's

1237
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:25,040
rom dos i mean this is like someone who's like jesus i don't want to say that you know but i

1238
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:32,480
mean you know well a holy man in a sense here's what's great about him he just was really good

1239
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:40,960
at not letting you do that to him yeah and i remember like looking down at him and you know

1240
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:48,240
like he had though he beamed joy like he was really you see the culmination of a lifetime

1241
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:54,240
of practice and honesty with oneself but i looked down i'm like i'm nervous and he got this big

1242
01:38:54,240 --> 01:39:00,880
smile and he goes me too it was such a cool moment like he was always doing things like that

1243
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:11,600
you know like like sort of helping you get out of the very human desire to raise someone up

1244
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:16,400
on a pedestal yeah we've never actually really talked about this but a lot of my life in the

1245
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:22,000
athletics right the martial athletics i also you know taught a form of yoga for martial athletes

1246
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:27,520
and i traveled the globe i would spin the globe but not a metaphor i'd spin the globe and wait

1247
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:32,080
where my finger dropped and i'm going to go find the martial art there or i'm going to find the

1248
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:37,120
spiritual teacher there and see what's up 99.9 percent of people that i met were fucking charlatans

1249
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:42,320
yeah straight up i mean i went to like poon india state at osho's ashram they fucking drugged me i'm

1250
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:48,720
sure of it had to go to the hospital all this shit super fucking trippy but i didn't go to oregon with

1251
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:54,240
the baghwan shri raj nisha no so this was this was after so after i was a little bit after that

1252
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:59,360
phase but it's the same guy it's the same guy he's got this huge in in in poon india he has

1253
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:04,720
these huge temple with these pyramids like black pyramids straight out of the movie beyond the black

1254
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:09,680
rainbow it's fucking amazing you have to go get like an hiv test just to enter which i thought

1255
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:13,840
that must be an old school rule what's going on here i learned so much they're like take off

1256
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,400
your clothes underneath that like thing you have to wear i'm like these guys are weird i had a weird

1257
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:24,720
experience there i got really sick that's where i came back you i hope you're not brushing past

1258
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:30,880
the take off your clothes moment like oh yeah what happened after these so the head the head guru

1259
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:35,760
chick right who was running it she eyeballed me from day one like oh this guy's not a believer or

1260
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:40,240
something so i was wearing like i don't know my jeans or something they told you to put on this

1261
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:45,600
robe to go like watch videos of this guru like on this big screen and shit and she looks at me and

1262
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:51,360
she's like you must not wear clothes under that i'm like why yeah like all right i mean it was

1263
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:57,840
hilarious and then kind of hot that's why not for me but like you know it was weird for me so i was

1264
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:03,600
like okay cool so anyway the the point is did you did you take your clothes off oh yeah i wanted

1265
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:09,920
they ordered you do underneath yeah i just wore a robe right he was cute then right it was sinister

1266
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:15,520
that's why i came out with the valley fever thing and i started hallucinating was in his like

1267
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:20,880
ashram that that dude's thing that i found out later i had this major illness but i was sure

1268
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,280
that they had poisoned me because when do you get 107 degree temperature like on the armpit

1269
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:30,240
you're seeing visions two days i was out here and dead people like i was fucked up and i was sure

1270
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:34,320
that they had poisoned me turns out i got valley fever that's what was going on but they were

1271
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:40,080
holding my passport hostage because they didn't want a dead dude anyway let me back up the the

1272
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:44,960
point of the story is i got to kind of engage with some of these these people most charlatans

1273
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:50,560
but people that that you know have big followings though i i did meet to i get i did get to meet

1274
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:56,640
your buddy one time rom dos cool we have a common friend justin beretta from the glitch okay got

1275
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:03,040
you yeah and he like did music with rom dos's talk yeah man justin was a jujitsu student of mine

1276
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:09,040
what is a good friend from back in college he's exploded into being a musician with this thing

1277
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:16,480
called the glitch mob he's good yeah but also did something with rom dos but uh i had one experience

1278
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:22,480
where i met somebody where i had an actual experience that i can't account for it was

1279
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:29,520
baba hari dos is that somebody yeah he had like a big he's a guru guy an indian guy yeah so i went

1280
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:34,240
to new york and i was teaching out there it was jujitsu at the time and this guy's coming through

1281
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:39,200
town so i went to go see him and it was this weird experience because i'm not like a innately

1282
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:44,160
spiritual person like in the way that other people talk about it right so i'm sitting there and this

1283
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:48,320
guy's just like silent for like 40 minutes i'm like what the fuck is going on so i started

1284
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:54,480
thinking all these things a bunch of things right he starts talking i swear to god it was like he

1285
01:42:54,480 --> 01:43:00,080
was answering every single thing almost directly that i was thinking so then i go oh that's his

1286
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:05,120
trick he sits there quiet knows what everybody's gonna think then he's just gonna say it because

1287
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:09,280
we're all thinking the same thing what is this fucking guy doing right so that's where i was at

1288
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:13,600
start to walk out they're throwing like flower petals in front of this guy's feet i'm like i'm

1289
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:18,400
fucking out of here so i beeline it to this elevator to escape the whole procession out

1290
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:24,320
yeah next thing i know i turn around and he fucking walks right up to me and looks at me like stomps

1291
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:28,560
dead in his tracks yeah looks at me and by the way i was in the back i wasn't like the guy in

1292
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:33,600
the front being like what is this about i was like hiding right comes right up to me looks me in the

1293
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:38,960
eyes and i don't remember exactly what he said but but the look in his i don't know if he even

1294
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:46,400
said anything the look in his eyes was just like one of like absolute pain and sorrow as if all of

1295
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:53,600
these processions around him and all this stuff was just so terribly annoying to him that it was

1296
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,480
like i am deeply misunderstood that was the message that i got but i just thought it was so

1297
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:04,080
weird because you know this guy that i sit sit in silence with and this is not my stuff you know me

1298
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:09,520
especially at this time but i went anyway and then for him to say all these things exactly that were

1299
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:15,440
on my mind i was kind of like that's weird and then when he came up to me to have that like strange

1300
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:21,200
immediate thing where i could see this look on his a pain that he was being followed this much

1301
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:26,640
you know i maybe i was completely wrong but it was a very profound experience for me it taught me

1302
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:33,200
that day whether or not he was teaching it it taught me that day that every single being every

1303
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:38,400
single person has a greatest potential and we're never going to make we're never going to make to

1304
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:43,920
our greatest potential but if we can make it most of the way then that would be cool wouldn't it

1305
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:49,040
yeah sure i mean this is the like great paradox of it all is like the idea i mean this is really

1306
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:54,800
quiet this is really bad news for a lot of people which is you're at your greatest potential that

1307
01:44:54,800 --> 01:45:00,560
that you just where you're at right now this is it and that the dream of the greatest potential

1308
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:05,600
is a form of self-crucifixion you build this idea of what you could be then you nail yourself to it

1309
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:11,920
we live in a goal-oriented time where everyone is in a self-improvement project which is fine it's

1310
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:16,400
not to say you know you shouldn't like try to live a healthier life or anything like that but

1311
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:24,080
usually what the fuel people are using to get themselves to the healthy life is shame guilt

1312
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:32,720
self-hate and and and that is a really terrible fuel to use is and it seems like how do you expect

1313
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:37,920
to get to a place where you're going to love yourself by hating yourself all the way there

1314
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:47,040
so that the you know that's sort of the the what i love about about it is it it's really like

1315
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:51,200
you know uh pima chodron you getting to her much pima you would love her she's great

1316
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:56,080
she was a student of chogam champa rembushe and like what she was talking about meditation she

1317
01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:03,040
says you know a lot of people start meditating because they want to be different than the way

1318
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:08,640
they are and that's starting your spiritual practice with hostility towards yourself you're

1319
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:17,120
starting on the path by like being so unhappy with where you are and thinking oh up the way

1320
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:23,600
right around that bend right by the black pyramid where i was pegged in india by a woman in a cult

1321
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:35,120
and given valley fever that's where i'm gonna be better we're good moments

1322
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:40,400
or when the ufos come or when the singularity happens or when all this there's this dream

1323
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:45,120
that right around the corner there's suffering everyone's experiencing it's gonna end and then

1324
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:52,720
everything will be better and and the general the general teaching seems to be actually

1325
01:46:53,760 --> 01:47:00,880
no that is not the remedy the remedy is not constantly trying to get to the next place but

1326
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:08,000
being just where you are and finding a way to stop trying to escape from that part of yourself

1327
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,360
that you have what we all pour booze on it's a part of yourself you pour booze on it's a part

1328
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:17,520
of yourself that you you you keeps you awake at night it's a part of yourself that you

1329
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:22,960
god it's it's the shadow that fucking thing man it's the part of yourself that makes you

1330
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:34,560
ferociously and diligently masturbate to porn at 3 a.m if you're me that's being in the moment

1331
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:43,120
being in the moment mindfulness you cover that stuff in your podcast it's not normal fair

1332
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:49,200
for a comedian but i mean you do you do it really well and that seems like the idea is you want to

1333
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:53,520
it maybe you don't want to educate but you want to share this with

1334
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:59,600
people who are open to the idea and need it i mean you know what my intent there god i'd love to say

1335
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:06,960
that i was like god i want to be altruistic like that my uh i love these like the conversation

1336
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:13,440
we're having right now this will fuel me for like weeks i'll think about i'll think about stuff you

1337
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:18,320
said i'll think about stuff you said i'll kick it around in my head i'll write about it it just i

1338
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:24,080
just love it and so that is what i'm up to and i love that people that i get to share those

1339
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:29,040
conversations with people i mean that does make me happy when i hear when i get contacted by people

1340
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:37,840
who tell me this conversation or that conversation help them but yeah i my and my intent behind it is

1341
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:43,600
just jewel i just love talking to these people i love like just what you're talking about those

1342
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:52,320
moments where you encounter someone who has lived a divergent lifestyle if a normal lifestyle is

1343
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:59,440
like nine to five job career you're with someone who is like their entire lives focused on what it

1344
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:07,600
is to be a human consciousness and sentience and god and and and when you get around a person like

1345
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:15,200
that it shows you who you are i would say i would wonder when you were saying that i would wonder

1346
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:23,600
like if that was my experience and he was a mirror to me yeah yeah totally yeah he was mirroring you

1347
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:26,560
because that's one of the things they say is when you get around a being like that

1348
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:34,400
they don't really have the identity that like a lot of people have there's not really an identity

1349
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:38,800
there in the normal sense and so they are mirrors they're energetic mirrors so when you get around

1350
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:43,360
them what's happening is you're seeing yourself you're seeing where you're at right now through

1351
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:49,680
them and and that that can be a really painful experience or a really wonderful experience or a

1352
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:58,720
mix do you think that beings that you encounter under say dmt or psilocybin there are a lot of

1353
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:04,880
conversations that are published that people come back and relate their experiences that those are

1354
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:09,280
actual beings or it's something that you create in your head that there's something out there that

1355
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:16,320
you can contact by hitting some other level with substances or whatever okay i just had andrew

1356
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:22,320
gallimore on my podcast if you're into psychedelics he's a great twitter follow and he's written a

1357
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:28,240
wonderful book on the neurochemistry of the psychedelics and so in this podcast he was

1358
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:34,560
telling me that he had and they they actually i think they did it at oxford they did this study

1359
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:40,480
i could be wrong about the college but basically he realized that using what we already understand

1360
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:48,480
about anesthesia measuring the amount of chemicals and the human bloodstream to keep them at the level

1361
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:54,000
you need them at to like put people under he wondered what happens if we apply that to dmt

1362
01:50:54,640 --> 01:51:00,720
what happens if we put the amount of dmt it takes to do the breakthrough state in somebody and keep

1363
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:06,240
it there for longer than the six 10 minute blast off experience you get where you make

1364
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:13,280
where you commune with these beings there could be a lot of scientific benefit to

1365
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:22,880
not just understanding dmt but exploring uh that universe like for example what's interesting

1366
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:30,720
about dmt and a few other psychedelics is the similarity between experiences versus like other

1367
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:36,160
psychedelics that seem to be more of a projection of i don't know consciousness onto the world or

1368
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:42,640
something like that a distortion of consciousness or you know dmt everyone sees the same weird

1369
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:51,600
circusy uh organic hyper technological uh architecture in their kind of weird language

1370
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:57,040
and of course the machine elves as terence mckenna described them and all the whatever those are so

1371
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:02,160
they've done the study already it's i don't think it's been released yet where they put people

1372
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:08,400
like i don't want to say put them under put them over i guess with dmt i don't know what you call

1373
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:16,480
put them through and uh to find out what's going on there but gallimore said that if you look at

1374
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:26,480
the human brain when it is on dmt you it's like watching a radio switch channels it goes through

1375
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:34,880
a staticky chaotic state and then all of a sudden it completely like shifts into a different modality

1376
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:43,840
of perception and he said regardless of the whether or not these beings are a product of

1377
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:50,880
the unconscious or whether they're extra-dimensional beings that dmt is

1378
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:56,880
allowing you to see what's really interesting about the fact that your brain is shifting into

1379
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:04,880
this new way of perceiving reality is that it implies that we evolve to do that the amount

1380
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:11,280
of time it took to evolve our brains to instantaneously weave reality into what it is

1381
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:18,880
right now is already it's insane that we even did that but to think that we also built into us when

1382
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:25,840
we come into contact with dmt suddenly our brain like it knows how to do it just shifts gears and

1383
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:31,600
changes the way it perceives reality what the fuck does that mean what is the evolutionary

1384
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:41,600
use of being able to see to that stable mode right because you see otherwise it would just be chaos

1385
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:45,840
because the brain hasn't evolved to be able to assimilate but after they get through the

1386
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:51,600
static period there's some sort of frequency let's say because you're using the radio terminology

1387
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:56,080
where there is order and so what you're saying is that the human brain must have evolved to the

1388
01:53:56,080 --> 01:54:02,080
point where it could accept that moment and create order out of it is that what you're saying yeah

1389
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:08,000
right that's fucking weird it's like it's like uh i don't know it's like finding like a completely

1390
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,040
different different operating system on your computer right that runs completely different

1391
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:19,440
software what why do we have the dark web of the brain dmt dark web what is that so yeah you know

1392
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:28,000
like it i think that um you know i was talking to my meditation teacher so cheesy to say that

1393
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:36,240
david nickturn about um you know in tibetan buddhism there's there's deities that you visualize

1394
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:45,920
and there's an entire pantheon of saints and beings buddhas and i you know i was asking him

1395
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:52,240
but is it considered are they considered to be real and he's like well they're as real as you are

1396
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:59,520
like how real are we you know some of these stories you hear uh people either on dmt or

1397
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:04,400
remote viewing they project their consciousness out there one way or another and they encounter

1398
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:10,320
some other intelligence and sometimes the encounter is negative get the hell out of here who are you

1399
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:16,720
why are you here either you're not ready or you're intruding kind of a thing yeah that's right

1400
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:28,400
yeah i mean this is uh if you read just any grimoire any occult book they what i love about

1401
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:32,320
them is they all start with a warning generally there's a warning like don't fuck with this this

1402
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:39,040
is real like you know don't this and i don't know if that warning is there to protect people or to

1403
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:43,760
lure them in because people who open grimoires that's like the most exciting thing like oh shit

1404
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:51,360
i'm not supposed to do this ritual or that ritual or whatever it may be but um you know i think that

1405
01:55:55,680 --> 01:56:01,520
ramdas famously he he was he actually had a channeled being that he was friends with

1406
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:08,160
named emmanuel and emmanuel said to him just because something doesn't have a body doesn't

1407
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:15,120
mean you should trust it you know i think that's very important and just because something can read

1408
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:21,840
your mind doesn't mean anything other than that like there seems to be an ability to like tell

1409
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:26,240
you what you're thinking that doesn't mean you should like bow down to them right or anything so

1410
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:30,560
you know i think that that's one of the the problems of like our

1411
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:36,880
what is taren's beginning calls it the pharmacological inquisition the fact that

1412
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:41,040
we have gone into the dark ages of psychedelics they completely ban them we don't know what they

1413
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:47,280
are because people are taking these things and they're meeting beings and the beings are telling

1414
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:52,240
them all kinds of shit and because the being is like very colorful or because the being is

1415
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:58,800
happening within the context of the psychedelic they immediately believe it they're like oh it

1416
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:03,200
told me the world's ending or oh it told me to go do this or go do that it's like you don't know

1417
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:08,320
that was yeah i always check the badge number and ids of every being that enters my world

1418
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:14,480
that used to make fake ids i don't know if i can say that but i did you know it was like you could

1419
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:20,320
make any id you needed in la so the the thing is is that that's that's something to do where we

1420
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:26,560
defer to authority or perceived authority and and we do that because of laziness we we constantly

1421
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:32,240
do that oh they said this so this is good this is what i do i've always been um i don't know

1422
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:37,520
innately pugnacious like against uh you know combative against authority and stuff like that

1423
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:42,560
yeah not against but just i never take it for one second somebody shows me some qualification

1424
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:48,400
identification that that means shit but i think that it is within our nature to sometimes defer

1425
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:54,480
to authority and if that's in a spiritual realm if that's in a realm of taking a psychedelic where

1426
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:58,080
you're experiencing something oh that must be really profound and important because it felt

1427
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:03,520
like well let me tell you my dmst experience i fucking got in an argument every goddamn time

1428
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:08,800
with this intelligence right say i'm ancient and powerful god i'm ancient and powerful same one

1429
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:13,200
same i don't know you know that's really subjective it gets really weird it's like a cheshire cat that

1430
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:17,840
winked at me for a millisecond the first time i ever tried it and then after there it was an

1431
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:22,640
argument with the same entity again all of this is in my mind who knows if there's any functional

1432
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:29,600
but my reaction my older brothers they're laughing at me because uh you know he knows that i have a

1433
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:34,640
little problem with authority or whatever you know so he's like laughing but it was like a constant

1434
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:40,160
thing and i don't know if it's my it might just be that my egotistical resistance to any kind of

1435
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:46,640
like superpower but it you know some other entity telling me but i would get in arguments with this

1436
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:54,240
thing each time being like really show me you're ancient and powerful show me right one time it did

1437
01:58:54,240 --> 01:59:00,240
but it wowed me you know yeah but uh i don't know what that's about man all i know is there

1438
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:06,240
there has been value in my life in experiencing that the very limited number of times that i have

1439
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:12,480
yeah and not not encouraging it for anybody else it's the only thing that i ever felt uh possessed

1440
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:17,840
my consciousness of my body the externally that came in and controlled my physical body was very

1441
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:25,200
bizarre for me yeah but i did find value in the in having explored that you know if i had compared

1442
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:32,640
to not having explored it yeah you know i think it's again we get so caught up in the reality of

1443
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:39,120
these beings i certainly used to like is it real is it not what is this and and then within that

1444
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:47,360
you like you you you can accidentally uh miss the bigger picture which which is that uh

1445
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:58,320
our minds are filters and they're filtering out a lot of data and some of that data is really

1446
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:04,800
beautiful poetic and inspirational the whether or not like we can one day like take these

1447
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:11,040
dmt elves and put them like in a government hearing which would be fucking hilarious

1448
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:20,720
you know who knows but you know i think that uh in like enjoying those moments but then not getting

1449
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:26,240
too caught up in them i mean this is the idea and a lot of eastern traditions is oh yeah you

1450
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:33,920
can develop all kinds of powers like cities is what they call them uh you can turn yourself

1451
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:39,600
into a rainbow walk through a wall you can levitate you can blah blah blah blah on and

1452
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:48,000
on and on and that uh in in some like monastic communities they you're you're told like whatever

1453
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,080
happens within the walls of the monastery things you see this is not to be shared outside of the

1454
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:59,040
monastery but most importantly don't get too caught up in developing these potentials because

1455
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:04,720
that's not really the point the point isn't like making contact with this being or that being or

1456
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:13,680
this being what is the point well the point is to find out if you can stop suffering because if you

1457
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:21,280
can stop suffering then you can help other people not suffer that's the point the point is we live

1458
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:25,680
in a world where many many people are miserable and they're suffering and they're suffering

1459
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:31,760
not because of the reasons they think and so that creates confusion they think they're suffering

1460
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:40,640
because uh external phenomena isn't matching their their their expectations why why do we need to

1461
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:46,640
why do we need to reduce suffering i don't i've never understood that about buddhist tradition

1462
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:51,840
about all this like serious question is yeah why is that such the fixated point that like oh you

1463
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:56,160
got to stop suffering so you can help other people stop suffering for me suffering has brought me the

1464
02:01:56,160 --> 02:02:02,240
greatest insight about my capabilities my life my tolerance my empathy sure why is it that we have

1465
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:06,640
to focus on not suffering i've never understood okay i love the question i mean and i'll try to

1466
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:11,360
answer it as best i can i could be wrong one distinction that's super important is the

1467
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:17,520
distinction between pain and suffering so pain there's nothing in as far as i'm aware in buddhism

1468
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:24,880
like we're gonna make you stop hurting you have a body your body is subject to old age disease and

1469
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:36,160
death so there's not much there that's that's the that's out of him but uh suffering in in this

1470
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:44,080
sense is not like the pain of getting yourself to go jogging or the rejection you might experience

1471
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:51,840
as an artist or all those things this is a deeper problem and so in buddhism the first noble truth

1472
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:59,920
as they call it is there is suffering now not life is suffering this gets mistranslated there

1473
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:08,320
is suffering so the dukkha is what it's what it's called now this translates into wobbly wheel

1474
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:13,600
is at least right so it basically it's saying there's an experience of reality that most of

1475
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:18,800
us are having which is akin to being on a wagon or a bike that doesn't have enough air in the

1476
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:25,280
tires everything here is wobbly things don't work out you things don't meet your expectations

1477
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:31,280
you're going to get stuck in traffic things just really aren't working out this is just the nature

1478
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:40,480
of reality that we're in right now and so you uh this not working out depends for for a sense

1479
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:47,600
that things aren't working out you have to basically construct an identity that has built

1480
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:53,200
into it what you think working out is what it looks like what it is so that sort of the

1481
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:59,680
the center of the problem here is that you have become attached to

1482
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:08,000
a self sense of oh this is me and that me is supposed to help you navigate this wobbly

1483
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,040
wheel and that you create the sense of self so that you can justify or navigate the fact

1484
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:16,000
that life doesn't work out the way you want to let's well no usually what you're doing is

1485
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,040
you're protecting this thing so you've you you've invented an imaginary friend this is you this is

1486
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:26,400
my name my social security number my career my job what's in my twitter bio or my tinder bio

1487
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:34,080
or whatever i like dogs i like to go to the beach i love music and i uh one day i'll have a ferrari

1488
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:39,920
and i'm gonna retire i want to get good at golf the list goes on and on for so many people you

1489
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:47,360
know this this thing this thing right and the more you have within that it's like you go out to eat

1490
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:53,920
with someone and some people like they're like it's insane how specific they get don't like i only

1491
02:04:53,920 --> 02:05:00,640
want three grains of salt the fish should be in the center of my play the more of those conditions

1492
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:07,840
you have in your own life for for happiness for you to like achieve happiness the more miserable

1493
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:12,160
you're going to be because those conditions will not be met so theoretically if we start

1494
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:19,440
removing those conditions then maybe we'll begin to discover we don't really need that much

1495
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:27,680
to the this thing that we're experiencing that we call suffering is is not a permanent condition

1496
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:35,760
but one more based on a concept of the self that isn't accurate and so gom is the name

1497
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:45,120
for meditation in Tibetan Buddhism that means uh becoming familiar with so this is let's figure

1498
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:50,080
out what the fuck we are to start off with like what's underneath all those things that that

1499
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:54,560
finally makes sense to me so what i'm hearing from you and it kind of finally makes sense to me

1500
02:05:54,560 --> 02:06:02,160
i don't think the message is alleviate your suffering the message is by alleviate by

1501
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:09,200
alleviating your suffering you can see more clearly what you are or what you can be or

1502
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:13,920
what you're becoming and all of the above yeah because it's not about suffering then with what

1503
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:18,400
you're saying is that's been my misinterpretation because all you guys ever say you fucking buddhist

1504
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:22,560
guys or whatever you are always say oh must alleviate suffering i'm like what's wrong with

1505
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:27,600
suffering yeah okay but what you're saying is through doing that that there is a clarity or

1506
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:34,000
purification of what or who you really are or can or can become all of the above is that correct

1507
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:43,840
yeah it's it's like this this is not an add-on this is not an add-on so it's something that you

1508
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:48,880
already are which is so you are fundamentally good you're

1509
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:58,320
what every human being is is pretty much the same everyone's pretty much the same you're me

1510
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:05,920
i'm you you're me i'm you but we get so caught up in the mask or the defense mechanisms which are

1511
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:11,920
very refined and and very hypnotic and very intense that suddenly we find ourselves like

1512
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:19,520
engaged in this dramatic game of make-believe with identities that we've just invented and so

1513
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:23,200
there's so much suffering there that all the wars are because of this like all the

1514
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:28,480
conflict in the world is completely related to i'm defending my shit from you you're defending

1515
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:35,680
your shit from me a lot of people carry a lot of guilt that they guilt that tortures them torturous

1516
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:39,120
guilt you're so unhappy about decisions you made in the past

1517
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:46,800
and or or where you think your life is going it's like okay i guess the best way to describe

1518
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:52,640
it is this and for all my like deep buddhist people out there anyone who's interested in this

1519
02:07:52,640 --> 02:08:01,360
i would recommend inside la darma moon rom dos dot org chogam trump a rempache please take what

1520
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:05,680
i'm saying with a grain of fucking salt i'm probably messing it up and i'm sorry this is

1521
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:13,520
my own personal where i'm at right now with it but okay have you ever had an awful night where

1522
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:20,080
you fucked up maybe you got in a bad fight with your partner you know you just let me think no

1523
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:27,680
never what are you talking about but okay but you wake up in the morning and it's like before you're

1524
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:33,760
that app of how much you fucked up the night before it loads into your consciousness you wake up

1525
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:39,760
it's the best day ever right it is you wake up and it's like uh so then it hits you and then

1526
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:49,200
bam it hits you so that uh this is amazing that's what you are but you've added on to that this

1527
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:57,920
story and usually the story is not happy it's a terrible story and and it goes on and on and on

1528
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:01,120
and on and on about who you are and why you're where you're at and usually it's because of the

1529
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:05,520
mistakes you made and blah blah blah but it gets even deeper than that i mean we're talking about

1530
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:12,080
the way that you're interpreting language like you look at like letters and your brain immediately

1531
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:20,560
will turn those into words like so like there is theoretically something that is not touched by

1532
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:26,560
any of that and in buddhism that very confusingly for a lot of people is called emptiness emptiness

1533
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:34,720
or i believe in the no soul uh there's no soul you don't have a soul we don't have souls and

1534
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:38,880
everyone's like what the fuck you i got a fucking soul i got the most beautiful soul i'm saying hey

1535
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:47,280
motherfucker but the point is it's like if we had souls if you had an unchanging soul if you had an

1536
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:57,360
eternal unchanging soul you would be fucked because the best thing about life has changed like uh

1537
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:05,440
i was reading marcus or alias or some stoic philosopher who said the universe loves change

1538
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:13,760
and so that's what that's what we are we're uh interdependent ever changing ever changing

1539
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:21,520
non-differentiated uh reality and we share a soul if you want to say even though there's no soul

1540
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:27,120
we share the emptiness we're sharing it together and so that emptiness is the root of compassion

1541
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:33,040
it's like once you start tuning into that reality once you experience that which is considered

1542
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:40,080
sky mind or like it's like uh all of a sudden like thinking that you have a shitty

1543
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:46,080
tiny little filthy apartment and finding a secret door that opens up into this

1544
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:56,080
beautiful massive infinite empty clear space and and that's what you are that's what you are

1545
02:10:56,080 --> 02:11:00,160
i will not keep rambling about buddhism god forgive me i'm so sorry to all my buddhist

1546
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:06,480
teachers out there and all the teachers the shame it's coming in i mean just wait wait you

1547
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:11,360
know you're talking about growth you're talking about growing and evolving you're talking about

1548
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:16,000
not pushing right like you're good where you are but you are talking about growing about change

1549
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:20,320
you're talking about because being one thing realizing another right that's a difference

1550
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:26,080
that's a change okay timmy here's a famous tim leary quote oh i love it lift up your legs

1551
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:33,120
and float downstream that's the idea imagine being in a river and it's actually in um in

1552
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:38,080
kayaking that if you ever go canoeing or white water rafting they're like do not try to stand up

1553
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:43,440
in this water it is moving so fast even if it doesn't seem like a lot of water if you try to

1554
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:48,240
stand up you're gonna you could get stuck on a rock you're gonna fall it's gonna push you over

1555
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:53,920
you're gonna tumble you've got a life jacket on just lean back and let the river do what it does

1556
02:11:54,160 --> 02:12:00,480
john london line as well 80 years ago today on the day that we are recording this george harrison

1557
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:07,920
is born okay he he learned so much about spirituality spent his the last part of his life

1558
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:14,080
ascending and and getting to understand this when he died there's a martin scorsese documentary

1559
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:19,600
about his life that's terrific and it's his family member is talking about when he died

1560
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:27,600
physically died the room lit up and that's something dramatic happened do you buy that

1561
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:32,640
oh yeah and do you do you think that george harrison comes back around or is he floating

1562
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:38,400
around and didn't leave or does he incarnate again or what do you think okay so i was asking

1563
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:43,840
my meditation teacher like about chogam trumpa like you like you know this is a

1564
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:49,360
rimpoche would meaning that it's a they reincarnate they keep coming back on purpose

1565
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,760
but to teach to help

1566
02:12:54,240 --> 02:13:01,280
end human suffering spread the dharma but yeah i asked him like where is he now and he said well

1567
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:07,040
chogam trumpa said when you when you die the term for it is you're in the action

1568
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:10,480
which is a really cool way of putting it it's like

1569
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:20,720
harrison george harrison still ripples the present moment if you any like you hear my sweet lord

1570
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:29,520
everywhere you go here to hold foods uh as far as like or all things must pass by the way yeah

1571
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:37,680
yeah yeah so i don't i don't i don't really like i do believe in reincarnation i do i do think that

1572
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:46,400
like we probably uh come back around to get it right yeah and i know that like a lot of people

1573
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:49,680
are thinking well if you don't have a soul how do you reincarnate i mean i think that's a really

1574
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:55,520
good question and and so generally it's considered a momentum like it's not really a soul as much as

1575
02:13:55,520 --> 02:14:03,200
like a kind of karmic momentum that has a tendency to when the causes and conditions are right to

1576
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:08,960
appear in the world so you are a tendency you're a momentum and so when you die

1577
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:15,760
that tendency or momentum it goes through this intermediary state called the bardo and

1578
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:24,800
depending on your projections it sort of determines what your next life is going to be so

1579
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:35,120
but you know what in greek mythology the river lathe you drink from it and you forget everything

1580
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:41,520
you were before it's wiped out completely so it seems like our hard drives get formated

1581
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:47,920
formatted in between lives but some essential nature like an essential quality of of of

1582
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:55,760
which is the representation of your karmic predicament it ripples into time and then

1583
02:14:56,480 --> 02:15:01,600
it will find birth somehow and that tendency actually determines what your next life will be

1584
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:05,360
that's what they say if you want to know what your next life is going to be look at what your

1585
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:11,600
current life is and you can pretty much figure out where you're at it well look man i've appreciated

1586
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:16,960
the conversation uh i know that we're gonna spend all night extending this conversation but

1587
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:20,880
i think for the show i just you know thank you so much it's been cool thanks for having me yeah

1588
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:26,000
man it's been so cool to kind of hear over this amount of time where your mind is at with these

1589
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,240
things i always learn something new i really appreciate it and i'm really glad you guys got

1590

1592
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:46,240
the pep talk after we get off the air here i will i will give you the opposite of a pep talk

1593
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:52,560
you know one of my favorite books by chogam trump it starts off saying if you don't get it if you

1594
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:57,840
can avoid getting into this stuff don't get into it because once you start once you get into the

1595
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:02,720
rabbit hole it's you're not coming out you're all you're you have to go through i'm good with that

1596
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:08,080
yeah all right cool uh well it's no big deal it's very easy and let me i'm sorry to be neurotic let

1603
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:51,760
from just training martial athletics and just from other things there's always going to be somebody

1604
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:55,840
that needs to hear it from you there's always going to be somebody that talks above you and

1605
02:16:55,840 --> 02:17:00,320
somebody that talks below right there's always going to be somebody that talks your language

1606
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:04,320
you never have to say that all you're doing is communicating what you know at this time right

mistake that that's their fault right and there's gonna be a number of people that need to i needed
