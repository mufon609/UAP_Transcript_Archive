1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Secrets, cover-ups, and strange phenomena.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
UFOs and ideas that challenge reality itself.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All these mysteries, all this time.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Are we ever going to get to the bottom of these?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is George Knapp.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I dig into news stories that others can't or won't.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm Jeremy Korbel.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And for some reason, people tell me things they probably shouldn't.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And this is Weaponized.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Weaponized, we're back.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What's on your mind?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh my gosh, so much, man.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, I guess we should start with a number of weeks ago, the new anticipated UFO report,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
official UFO report came out from the government.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And, you know, there's been a lot of reactions from, you know, dismissals in opinion articles

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
in the New York Times to other people that got it right.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But this was anticipated.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It was supposed to come out on Halloween, right?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
2022.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Here we are in 2023 now.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And finally it's out.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But...

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So they call it the 2022 annual report on UAP, unidentified aerial phenomena.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's actually the 2023 report, since it did not come out in 2022.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And looking at it, you know, the first impression you get is nobody's going to wrench their

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
back picking this thing up.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's only a couple of pages.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
They got a title page and a table of contents page and a couple of index pages at the back

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and terminology, not much report here.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm reminded of...

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Remember when light beer first came out, the slogan was, taste great, less filling?

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's what comes to mind for this.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
In defense of the depth of the report, it is a report of a classified report.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a report that they did a classified report.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But there are some really sneaky things that you brought to my mind.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There are some really sneaky things that you brought to my attention that were kind of

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
done in this and I'd like kind of people to know about this from a news standpoint.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, you know, I think there is a difference between this report and the one that came

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
out in 2021, the UAP task force report to Congress.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It had 144 cases.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It said 143 were unidentified.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This one has a lot more cases.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They added it to 510 cases.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So the good news is that the reporting system that has been implemented is working.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They even got reports from the U.S.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Air Force, it says in here, and the U.S.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Navy primarily.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We don't know where these incidents happened.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There's almost no detail whatsoever.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We don't know if they were in space, whether they were under sea, whether they were over

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
U.S.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
airspace or the military encountered them somewhere around the world.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't know what the size or shape or capabilities of these are.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We know that there's an indication that at least some of these cases are advanced technology

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that had capabilities that were really intriguing, but really no details at all.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think the UFO public was prepared to be underwhelmed, maybe not quite this underwhelmed.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But I mean, overall, there's some good stuff.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The fact that they reported it at all, that they're getting better at identifying what's

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
truly unidentified and anomalous and what isn't is pretty good.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But we know that this is all domain.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We know that these cases span from space, air to sea.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now, that's not something, obviously, that's put out to the public, but that's why it's

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
called all domain.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's why it's called transmedium.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So I think people got this title based on their bias wrong.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I think the title's right in the report.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There's a top of it.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think page five, can we read that?

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want people to hear what they said.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Continued reporting and robust analysis are providing better fidelity on UAP events.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But many cases remain unresolved.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right in the report.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's the headline.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That is the important part.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And then people try to cherry pick and say all this stuff that we know is false, and

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
they put it through major publications.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The media needs to look at and read everything to be informed.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It doesn't always happen.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It seems like there was a concerted effort to water it down.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I mean, this is the most exciting topic in the world.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's the biggest question in human existence in the history of civilization.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are we alone?

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It would change the world once we get a confirmation that there is another intelligence somewhere,

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
or they're out there or living among us here.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's huge.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And they do their best to add this bureaucratic jingo type language that junk it up and to

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
dilute how interesting it really is to make it as least interesting as possible, it seemed

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
like, in the terms that they use.

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And also you think about who are they that are doing this.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you just look at who writes certain types of articles, you get a sense that this is

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
not reporting.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
These are people that are inserting certain types of topographical premises that they

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
come up with, biases they come up with.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So if we just report the news, the line I just read, that's the news.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's what's important.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So look, I don't know what UFOs are.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But I know that it's unexplained and that there's a mechanical aspect to it.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, they made a point of adding in a bunch of cases that I think were taken out of the

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
original report.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You think or you know?

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, it says that they added in 100 and some cases that had been left out.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So adding these back in increased the total, but it allowed them to say, oh, gosh, a heck

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
of a lot of these are balloons.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A heck of a lot of these are drones.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A lot of it is trash, which is, you remember the New York Times had this pre-bunking piece

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
where they predicted that's what this report is going to show.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's a bunch of drones.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a bunch of balloons.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes, drones exist.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Balloons exist.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We're aware of that.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We're aware that birds fly in the sky.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's not anything new.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I mean, UFOs 101, you learn that 90% to 95% of all UFO cases are explainable.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If you get enough information, they're explainable.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They are drones.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
They're balloons.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They're planets.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They're clouds, things of that sort.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That is the starting point for this conversation.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We're aware that cases can be explained.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We're also aware that while 90% are explainable, 9 out of 10 are not reported at all.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hold on.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll just back up.

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm fucking record scratch.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OK.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They excluded a bunch of cases because they were explainable.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So let's now work on the ones that are not.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What you're saying is they brought those cases back in to be able to give these statistics.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, it says it.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The ODNI preliminary assessment discussed 144 UAP reports and had an information cutoff

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
date of 5 March 2021.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Since then, ARROW has received 247 new UAP reports, but an additional 119 UAP reports

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
on events that occurred before March 5, 2021 but were not included in that assessment have

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
been discovered or reported.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So they took them that have been discarded and put them back in and allows them to sort

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
of dilute the overall impact of this by saying, oh, gosh, these are explainable.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And we know who discarded them.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We know the people that discarded them so that it could focus on the true UAP mystery.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And this was a sleight of hand.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Is that what you're saying?

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, it's a little deceptive, I think, by adding those back in that they already know

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
are explainable.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The reason they were kicked out is because they're explainable.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is it fair to say that there's a minimization process that's occurring to the public?

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They're trying to minimize some of the gravity of this to the public.

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Is that fair to say?

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, they brought back in cases that are explainable.

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
They dumbed down the language, made it as clunky as possible and as least interesting

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
as possible, trying to make it less dramatic, almost as if, hey, there's really nothing

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
to see here, folks.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We did our duty.

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We got this report.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We now have processes in place that makes it easier to report this stuff.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But we're explaining it.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't you worry your pretty little heads kind of thing.

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And one of the reasons we know about that process for the first report is because you

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and I were able to talk to the chief scientist for the UAP task force.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's right.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And he's a guy who is well known to our listeners, to viewers from television.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Dr. Travis Taylor has been on Ancient Aliens a number of times.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's been on The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch at the past couple of years.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
A well known as a scientist who is interested in UFO and related mysteries.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What most people don't know is that he was serving as the chief scientist for the UAP

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
task force.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We learned that and we're floored by it on a trip we made to Alabama last fall, last

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
summer.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I learned about it before, but you reported on it first.

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You told people about that and it kind of threw people for a loop because they know

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
TV, they know from this.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But look, this guy's a serious scientist and he's done a lot of work and he was specifically

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
brought in and tasked because he had certain skill sets that would be good for this job.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And we know who brought him in.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And it's so interesting, man.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I want to get to something.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We had this crazy trip.

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You want to start talking about that?

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Sure, yeah.

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
All right.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
For anybody that doesn't know mine and George's friendship and working together, once in a

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
while, I get some call from George and it's like, pack your bags.

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We've got to go film something.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We're doing an interview.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And just immediately I know, oh, gosh.

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So this is the thing now.

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So my perspective, I've actually never told you this, but my perspective was, okay, George

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
has hopefully a really important interview to hear from somebody that could shed light

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to the American public who's never gone on camera.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And this is kind of the background you kind of gave me.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You know, this could happen.

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But there's also an event going on.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Before we get to that, I'm just like, okay, let me adjust my life to like leave in a few

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
days.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I needed a second camera.

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't even know how to do aperture right.

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You know, professional filmmaker.

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't even know how to do this stuff right.

200
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I knew this was important.

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I was like, I need somebody.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I called up my buddy, Niles Harrison.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He's laying on the beach in Mexico, right, where he just bought a house.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I'm like, I need you on a plane right now.

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Just I need to get you to Vegas.

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And he's like, well, I got all my stuff and we have to put it in storage.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This dude, Niles Harrison, dude, you are my idol, man.

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He packed everything up.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And in two days, he landed in Vegas to meet us to be the DP or the backup for us, the

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
only guy I could trust, you know, and I still don't know what the mission is.

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So I can't tell him the mission, you know.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So it's just like this fun kind of experience where I'm like, we get to Vegas.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm like, what's going on?

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You know, and we hop right on a flight.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So just so you know, I mean, it was, it was, it was crazy, man.

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is how it works with you and me is sometimes I call you, sometimes you call me and

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
it's time to go.

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, the premise for this, there were, there were multiple reasons to make this trip.

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Huntsville, Alabama is a defense hub.

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
A lot of interesting defense contractors have grown up around there.

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Of course, it's Rocket City.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's where the, it's where the birthplace of the U.S.

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
space program really was.

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Werner von Braun and his team were all down there.

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I didn't even know where we were going.

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're like, you know, now you're saying it, but like you, so you tell me, okay, look,

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
we're going to Huntsville.

228
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm like, Hunts where?

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And you're like, Huntsville.

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm like, why?

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, in a sense, you know, I hate to admit this, but Huntsville has become sort of the

232
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
de facto UFO research capital of America for a long time.

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
For the past 30 years, it's been Las Vegas because of Robert Bigelow, his needs organization

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
that became Bass, that was headquarters for the OSAP program, which that's a lot of acronyms,

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but that program was the largest UFO investigation ever funded by the U.S.

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
government that we know of.

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And so because of Bigelow and Collin Kelleher and their colleagues in Las Vegas, Las Vegas

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
was a hub for this research.

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I think Huntsville might now have that title because of all the people who are concentrated

240
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
there.

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The defense contractors that have grown up around the U.S.

242
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
rocket program, the U.S.

243
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Army's redstone arsenal is there.

244
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
In addition to the defense contractors and the rocket programs and a lot of government

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
agencies, there is also an UFO organization, SCU, the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies,

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
headed by a guy named Rich Hoffman.

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He's put together a team of scientists.

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
They've done some great analyses on key cases, the Puerto Rico UFO that looked like a transmedium

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
for one thing, and they did a tic-tac paper.

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They're doing some great work, but they have an annual conference.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I've been invited to go to each one of them, and finally I wanted to go because they not

252
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
only had a really great lineup of speakers, but I had a feeling that the audience might

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
be more interesting than the people who are up there on the dance, given the speeches.

254
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
To back up, there are these UFO study groups, but this is one that really focuses on the

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
science and technology, and it gets great speakers and members.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We know people just come in to quietly, silently listen that they might be interesting people

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
because it's in Rocket City.

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You had an idea that we were going to get a specific interview, but at this point you're

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
telling me we're going to this conference.

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's a UFO conference.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm like, come on, George.

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're like, no, no, it's a cool one.

263
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's science.

264
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm like, all right.

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I texted Ryan Graves, the fighter pilot that everybody knows now.

266
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I just wanted to get a beer with him because we had talked so much.

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I was like, okay, I'm coming.

268
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll meet with Ryan.

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We're going to have a beer.

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That didn't end up happening.

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We ended up missing each other two ships in the night, but we met a number of really interesting

272
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
people and were able to get some first ever interviews with people that were going to

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
come forward and also recorded with and talked with individuals who people don't know yet,

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
but are also critical and essential to the UFO puzzle and what's going on within government

275
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and Congress and different intelligence agencies looking at this.

276
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Just straight up, it was fascinating.

277
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We had fun and we're driving in a car.

278
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You think I'm going to kill us.

279
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You know, we're making jokes about green pyramids.

280
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Our primary concern is getting there alive, which is not a given in light of the fact

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
that Jeremy is the person driving and the navigator and the navigator.

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah.

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Hopefully we arrive in one piece.

284
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It was a little worker guy with a goddamn pyramid.

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, is that a pyramid or triangle?

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Is that just a drone?

287
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's construction work.

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So that's not a pyramid that you see right there.

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, it's a guy building a pyramid.

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So is it like the government building a pyramid?

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Would that be accurate to say?

292
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You could infer that perhaps.

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay, I'm going to.

294
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And off record, I fucking drive a car.

295
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We had a lot of fun, but what happens next, George?

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I mean, this is a really neat moment for us.

297
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So I had hoped that we'd be able to land this really important interview

298
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
with someone who has never spoken on camera before,

299
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
has never interacted with the media in a way where he could be quoted.

300
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Someone I have known for a long time.

301
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You protected his name.

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I could never mention his name.

303
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You know, I've known about him, and then I got to know him.

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I happen to know that he loves Lindo Michoacan, this Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas,

305
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and has been known to hang out there.

306
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He's worked with the NIDS guys, with Bigelow and Kelleher and some of those folks.

307
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We'll go into more detail on that in a moment.

308
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But there he is.

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We now know that he had relocated to Huntsville.

310
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
One of my favorite stories of last year that we produced for KLAS and Mystery Wire

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
was about this company, this defense contractor in Huntsville, Alabama,

312
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
that put out an amazing, seemingly innocuous release about two men they had hired.

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Actually, there were two releases.

314
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The one was an announcement that they had hired a guy named Jay Stratton,

315
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
who had been a lifelong intelligence officer,

316
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
had worked at the Pentagon in very high-level positions for a number of years.

317
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And I was astonished to see his name released in the public,

318
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
because it's been forbidden that I could ever mention it.

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So that's the guy.

320
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's the guy.

321
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Jay Stratton.

322
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Jay Stratton.

323
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The world doesn't really know Jay Stratton.

324
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
People figured it out.

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
People figured it out.

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There's been little things now that have come out.

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But at that time, you had kind of held back.

328
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But the big question is, who is Jay Stratton?

329
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Jay Stratton.

330
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So if anyone who's read the book Skinwalkers of the Pentagon,

331
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
written with Dr. James Lakatsky and Colin Kelleher,

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
there are references to this guy in there.

333
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I wouldn't use the name Jay Stratton.

334
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'd use a different name, but references to a high-level guy,

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
a really credible intelligence officer,

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
who was involved in key positions in these UFO programs.

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
OSAP, ATIP, the UAP Task Force, and AERO.

338
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He is the only person who is involved in all of those,

339
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
who is sort of the common link from the start of OSAP

340
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
through the creation of AERO,

341
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and continues, I think, to advise the folks who are involved with that.

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There's only one guy that's been there for that whole trip

343
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
who has worked with OSAP and then Louis Elizondo with ATIP

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and created, in essence, the UAP Task Force,

345
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
who got the government to ship from using the term UFO to UAP,

346
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
whose work, we'll talk about some examples of it.

347
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, back up, you just said Jay Stratton,

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
did you just say Jay Stratton created the UAP Task Force?

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah.

350
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Okay, so that would explain to me why numerous military,

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
active military individuals were so stoked

352
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
to see Jay Stratton's name come out.

353
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I said, why?

354
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And they're like, because this is the one individual

355
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
who is credible military intelligence,

356
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
who's worked DIA, who's worked in tons of programs, in ONI,

357
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
all these different intelligence agencies,

358
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
that has pushed not only to be honest and true to the American public,

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but to create an interface so that we could honestly bring forward

360
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
to the American public what we know and don't know about the UFO

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
or what he helped systematize UAP process.

362
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And the reason he said he did that was to destigmatize reporting of UFOs.

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So this guy is trying to destigmatize reporting of UFOs,

364
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
trying to systematize it so that reporting becomes better

365
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
as a learning process, as bumpy as it is.

366
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
People would put reports in from, let's say, the Nimitz

367
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
or any of these encounters.

368
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
They wouldn't hear back.

369
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
They thought it got lost in the ether.

370
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
They didn't want to get mental checks.

371
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But he made it cool to report and learned along the way.

372
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I respect that.

373
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So a lot of military people are like,

374
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
that is so amazing to get him to talk because he's talking for us.

375
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We don't have voices.

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He's got a voice for us.

377
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So I just want to tell you that's what I've gotten a lot of.

378
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So that's who we're talking about, talking about a very serious,

379
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
credible individual who's worked in intelligence capacity,

380
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
who's done the right thing, and he's done the right thing in a way

381
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
to help destigmatize and communicate with the American public

382
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
so we don't have the same problems as Project Blue Book,

383
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
what, in his own words, what Roswell did to the situation,

384
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
the lies from our government.

385
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So now I know we might be interviewing this guy.

386
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And that's really cool. First interview.

387
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Well, I learned that he was going to be there,

388
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that he and his colleague, Travis Taylor, were going to be at this event,

389
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
this SCU conference.

390
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
They're going to be in the audience.

391
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It was sort of the coming out party in a sense.

392
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Both had been hired to work by Radiance Technologies.

393
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And the releases, each of them was hired.

394
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Jay was hired first, and then he convinced Radiance that,

395
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
hey, Travis Taylor is a really qualified guy.

396
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He's the guy I'd like to work with here.

397
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And they hired him as well.

398
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And the releases for both of those guys were astonishing in that,

399
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
unlike most defense contractors, they don't want to talk about UFOs.

400
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
They don't want to mention it.

401
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They don't want to give it any credence.

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Even some of them who probably have deeper roots with the topic

403
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
than they care to admit, they don't highlight it.

404
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But this Radiance Technology, those releases, both bragged about,

405
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
in essence, they highlighted the fact that both these guys

406
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
had worked on UFO programs with the U.S. government.

407
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It was as if they were saying, this is no longer a forbidden topic.

408
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We want to be involved in it at every level.

409
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
In fact, if you've got some UFO contracts to give out to private industry,

410
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
we're ready to go.

411
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I think I can get away with saying this.

412
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I think it's fine.

413
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So we filmed at Radiance.

414
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's okay.

415
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You did a news report.

416
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
How cool to be shown what we were able to be shown.

417
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We couldn't film what they're doing there to some degree.

418
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I mean, obviously, they have offices at Wright-Patterson

419
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
for their technology company.

420
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But with what they could show us, we had to get the special badges,

421
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
which we couldn't even photograph, you know, all that stuff.

422
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Do you remember when I was pushing them?

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I was like, that's a skiff.

424
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Let me see inside the skiff.

425
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I don't believe it.

426
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Let me see inside the skiff.

427
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And everybody's like, don't do that to everybody.

428
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
He's not going to show you.

429
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And then they're finally like, okay, you can peek inside the door,

430
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
but don't say a word.

431
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You know, there's something going on in there, but it's okay.

432
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's okay.

433
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think I could.

434
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

435
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I didn't believe them.

436
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Open that door.

437
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Holy cow.

438
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I mean, there was some cool stuff going on.

439
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Bam, closed the door.

440
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It was nice of them to let me peek in just to verify, you know, what...

441
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's a cool company in a lot of ways.

442
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's owned by the employees.

443
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The employees own it.

444
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oh, really?

445
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You know, everybody benefits from it when they do well.

446
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
They have offices in 17 states.

447
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Nearly all of them are attached to or within U.S. Air Force bases.

448
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So they're at Wright-Patterson.

449
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
They're at Nellis.

450
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Two bases that we know have a long history of involvement

451
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
with the subject that is near and dear to our heart.

452
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And so they do serious work.

453
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You can see hints of it on their website, the kind of things they do.

454
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But essentially, that company does reverse engineering work,

455
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
which in the UFO world, that term is laden with hidden meaning.

456
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You know, it suggests taking things apart to figure out how they work,

457
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
things that we did not build.

458
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But they do that.

459
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And Jay Stratton, who went to work for them,

460
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
specialized in reverse engineering and not just technology,

461
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
not just systems, machinery, but in situations.

462
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
When he worked for the DIA, he would reverse engineer potential threats,

463
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
figure out who might be flying what, what their capabilities were,

464
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and what kind of systems we might need to counter that.

465
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I mean, he was a top expert in that kind of work.

466
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And we'll allow him to maybe explain some of the jobs that he held at the Pentagon.

467
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Definitely.

468
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And additionally, I also want to be clear,

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
we weren't shown anything we weren't supposed to see.

470
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But it was just neat that we got that tour and be able to see in certain rooms.

471
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Obviously, they keep a real kind of lock and key.

472
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But I just got to say, it was such a cool experience for a company like that

473
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
to be so open for the first time with journalists coming in there.

474
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And even the president sat down and did an interview, and you did a report on it.

475
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It really shows that their interest in the reverse engineering of things,

476
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sure they would love to have some of the goodies.

477
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And it would be a great company.

478
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Well, we asked them, I said it, you know, all right, you hired Jay Stratton,

479
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
you hired Dr. Travis Taylor.

480
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It sounds like maybe you guys are taking a part of Flying Saucer or building one.

481
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And they kind of joked about it.

482
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Well, yeah, we'd kind of like to do that if we got a chance to.

483
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

484
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You know, it's so compartmentalized with a company like that.

485
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The president even told us, it's like, he has tons of projects going on that he is not read into

486
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
because that's how it's stovepiped.

487
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So with this company out there, and you and I going out there,

488
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and people were approaching us that were told to approach us.

489
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And that was really interesting to me because it was happening so much at that thing

490
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
that there were people in the audience that people still don't know who they are.

491
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And they trusted us with numerous things which will be coming public at some point.

492
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah, well, we went there with some goals in mind, specific goals,

493
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and talking to Jay Stratton and to Travis Taylor would have been,

494
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
if that was all we got, that would be awesome.

495
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We didn't know for sure if that was going to happen, but that's what we went there to do.

496
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And then we ended up meeting a bunch of other people who introduced themselves

497
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and began a dialogue with us that I think will bear fruit throughout this whole year.

498
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You know, and I was like, okay, you know, we're going to film this.

499
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I got my buddy all the way from, you know, he flew in from Mexico and here we go.

500
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And then I was like, oh, no, man, we're not recording in a hotel room.

501
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I was like so upset about that, you know, visually.

502
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But we had to do it kind of private and we needed to make sure that it was,

503
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
the information was well documented.

504
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You know, another thing that, so when we started the interview,

505
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
something that Jay said kind of right away that was so interesting to me was that

506
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
from the very onset was technological.

507
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It was technology.

508
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It was about discovery of disruptive technologies.

509
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And you look at all the dirts and the reports and obviously they're thinking forward

510
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
looking 30, 50 years from now.

511
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What could be a disruptive technology?

512
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
No matter where it's from, what could be a disruptive technology?

513
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And then he said, but look, where the evidence led is that there were other things that we learned.

514
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
There was a disruptive technology aim,

515
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
but that there were a lot of other things they learned when they were studying things like the ranch.

516
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So that really threw me for a loop that, you know,

517
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
something like OSAP came in with the idea of identifying future threats

518
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and then realized, wow, there's a lot more going on.

519
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
He talked about that in his interview with us.

520
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
That's just as far as ringer.

521
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

522
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And alarms are off.

523
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The cameras are all in this little A, B common marker.

524
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay.

525
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Jay, have you done an on camera interview before?

526
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Have you done interviews before?

527
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So this is the first.

528
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I mean, your world is the black world.

529
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Classified stuff.

530
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Right.

531
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Can you give me broad strokes of your career, the highlights and kind of secure program you work on?

532
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Sure.

533
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You know, I started military.

534
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I was a full time reservist with the Air Force,

535
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and I moved up to Maryland to work at Pax River to do weapons integration with the F-18 flight test out of Navier.

536
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And from there, I went to the Office of Naval Intelligence,

537
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
where I was recruited to be an aerospace engineer working with them to look at,

538
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
really apply the blue knowledge, as we call it, and apply it to the red and potential adversaries

539
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and write up reports on what I think foreign capabilities can do or not do.

540
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
In a sense, reverse engineering.

541
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Absolutely.

542
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And take that into DIA.

543
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I went over to the Defense Intelligence Agency to work in the Defense Warning Office,

544
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
where I was applying the same knowledge but at a higher level

545
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and more kind of orchestrating the intel community at that point.

546
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There's a term we use, validation,

547
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
whereas if you're building an F-22 or you're building a Joint Strike Fighter,

548
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
you're really kind of designing that to counter a potential threat,

549
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and that potential threat needs to be a validated threat,

550
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
because what we can't have happen is a Lockheed Martin or a Boeing

551
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
spending tons of money against a threat that they say exists,

552
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
or the government needs to say it exists.

553
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So it's kind of a contractual thing of you're building to the validated threat,

554
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and that's what I did at the Defense Intelligence Agency,

555
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
along with also having a Science and Technical Intelligence hat

556
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
with the Defense Warning Office to look across the spectrum at technologies,

557
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
specifically air and space, that are leading edge,

558
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
things that could be disruptive and challenge us in the future.

559
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
We're looking 10, 20, and sometimes 50 years out, depending on the topic

560
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and trying to provide the Department of Defense and across the intel community

561
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
a better understanding of some of those potential disruptive threats

562
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
so that we could get ahead of the game and counter them.

563
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And when you're at DIA, I'm ignorant of this stuff,

564
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
but you were a Navy guy who then goes to work for DIA.

565
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Does that mean you're a Navy guy within DIA or you're always a Navy guy?

566
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So when I transitioned to Office of Naval Intelligence, I became civil service.

567
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So I'm a Navy employee with the national intel community.

568
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So your service centers, Office of Naval Intelligence, NASIC,

569
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
National Air and Space Intel Center, the Missile and Space Intel Center

570
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
is a subcomponent of the DIA that's here in Huntsville,

571
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and then you have the MCIA, which is the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity,

572
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and then finally the National Ground Intel Center at Charlottesville.

573
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Those are the four what we call service centers,

574
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and now you're going to have one for the Space Force

575
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
co-located at Wright-Pattison Air Force Base.

576
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Those are service centers that support the analysis that supports the Navy

577
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and supports the Marine Corps, supports the Army.

578
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But in reality, they are all funded by the Director of National Intelligence now,

579
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
the ODNI, as national intel-funded billets that are able to support.

580
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So people refer to O&I, the Office of Naval Intelligence, as the Navy's intel center.

581
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The reality is it's the National Maritime Intel Center,

582
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
where we are the threat at the maritime.

583
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And when you think of Navy, too, you've got to remember that Navy is the Navy,

584
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
but the Navy also has an Air Force, and the Navy has an Army,

585
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and the Navy's Army has an Air Force, right?

586
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So it's a big service.

587
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So with that, O&I has a big footprint and a big concern,

588
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
but in all of that, the key in bringing up that the ODNI funds the four service centers

589
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
is very important because back to the threat that justifies

590
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
the building of new systems and such, right?

591
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
The Air Force really wants a program.

592
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
They might go to NASA and say, we need a threat to drive that program,

593
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and we are funded by the national side of the house,

594
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
so we can say, well, we don't take orders from the Air Force in that regard.

595
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
We take orders from the Navy, so we can, you know, this is the assessment, right?

596
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That's driven out of tradecraft, and that's the answer.

597
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's kind of independent, you know?

598
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's very independent, and a lot of people don't realize that.

599
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You know, they look at those service intel centers as kind of parts of the Air Force,

600
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
parts of the Army.

601
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They are on paper, but in reality, you know,

602
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
the majority of their budget comes from the national.

603
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So you have high security clearances.

604
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You see sensitive stuff, as sensitive as it gets.

605
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
All through my career.

606
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So from there, you know, DIA went back to O&I to be the head of Air Warfare.

607
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I was the deputy initially.

608
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Then the fleet it up, as we say, to be the director of Air Warfare for O&I.

609
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
When I first went back, I had everything that touches air in the Navy,

610
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
so science and technical side as well as the operational and tactics side, we call it.

611
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Spear is kind of the nickname for or the name that that organization uses.

612
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
We've got a history all the way back to Desert Storm.

613
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
If you watched Top Gun originally, Charlie, that's briefing the MiGs,

614
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
she was based on a spear analyst.

615
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So the group that I led has that kind of pedigree of talking about how capabilities operate.

616
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So, you know, your national intel centers at NAZIC, for example, right,

617
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
can talk about a Russian fighter, and I'll just throw an example.

618
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Everybody knows we look at Russia.

619
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
A Russian fighter and talk about how fast it flies, how high it can fly,

620
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
based on their assessments, right.

621
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
What Spear does is we get into the head of the pilots

622
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and we try to talk about how they're going to fly the aircraft.

623
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You know, one of the analogies I've used for years is hockey players, right.

624
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Every hockey player has to know how to skate.

625
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Some of them are better than the others, but it's really about the game, right.

626
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It's about everything else but skating.

627
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Skating comes second.

628
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So if you think about that and apply it to a fighter aircraft,

629
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
it's how they're deploying it, right.

630
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And guys with my background can watch somebody flying an airplane and go,

631
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
well, he's probably Russian or whoever, right.

632
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That's probably an American.

633
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So, you know, you really kind of can recognize some of the techniques

634
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and the way they do things.

635
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You know, a mutual friend of ours was trying to describe how high up you went

636
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and he compared you to a two-star Admiral.

637
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That wasn't accurate, exactly.

638
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You weren't comfortable with that.

639
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But how would I explain to our audience how far up the rung you went?

640
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Well, sure, it's right in.

641
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And I didn't want to really push any buttons with that.

642
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So from O&I, you know, I went to the Pentagon and I worked in N-2 and 6,

643
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
which is the headquarters level for Naval Intelligence.

644
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
The director of Naval Intelligence is dual-hatted,

645
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
is what we call the N-2 and 6, which is just, you know, the Op-Nav office code.

646
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
At that point, I was still a 15.

647
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And then I went off to be the J-2, the Director of Intelligence

648
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
for the Joint Warfare Analysis Center at Dahlgren.

649
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And then from there, I was promoted initially to what we call Tier 1,

650
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Defense Intelligence Senior Level Tier 1, which is as a senior executive position.

651
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And then within eight months or so, I was bumped up to a Tier 2,

652
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
which is where the two-star comes in.

653
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You know, it's an equivalency throughout my career.

654
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's been, you know, are you really equal, right?

655
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
We always throw out GS-15s or kernels or...

656
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
There's an equivalency, but you don't go busting around the Pentagon saying,

657
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
oh, I'll rank you or, you know, so...

658
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Right, yeah.

659
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But you do have the gravitas, if that's a good word to use.

660
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That's not a good word to use.

661
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The kind of the peer level, right?

662
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So, you know, if I go into a meeting with a two-star or one-star,

663
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
you know, kind of a peer level, so I'm not put in the corner, you know,

664
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and typically in my meetings, you know,

665
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I was there representing someone higher than me as well.

666
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Sometimes I'm representing myself,

667
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
but sometimes I'm there representing someone higher than me,

668
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
so then I inherit their authority.

669
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm sitting at their seat with their name on it,

670
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
so I'm speaking for that person.

671
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I wouldn't have been sent to that meeting if I couldn't speak for that person.

672
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And a lot of that in the Pentagon is resource sponsoring.

673
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So, you know, I've sat in many tables where I was representing the resource sponsor,

674
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and that gets attention because acquisition programs at your NAVA,

675
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
your NAVC, your Air Force Materiel Command,

676
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
those are all built on requirements back to the thread, right?

677
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And those requirements are paid for by resource sponsors.

678
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So the resource sponsor says, we need a new jammer,

679
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and from that resource sponsor, requirements are driven,

680
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and then capabilities are built,

681
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and they go to whoever can build that capability,

682
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
whether that's NAVA or that's NAV, you know, whoever that might be, right?

683
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So in those circles, you know, you get to know a lot of people,

684
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and that helped me later to really kind of know who I need to reach out to.

685
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Can you describe for me at what point UFOs, they were called then, UAPs now,

686
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
at what point that kind of got on your radar screen?

687
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Was it something you had at least a casual interest in growing up,

688
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
or it came to a point in your professional career that it landed on your desk?

689
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah, every time I've done anything related to UAP or UFO has been my job.

690
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And what I mean by that, I didn't really have a passion growing up.

691
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I didn't have all the books. I didn't watch all the TV shows.

692
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I stepped into a job at the Defense Intelligence Agency

693
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
where some things came across the desk, again, thinking technologies and other things,

694
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
where I needed to really kind of dig in and understand potentials.

695
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And those potentials, you know, I kept an open mind, a skeptic mind,

696
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
whatever you want to call it, you know, looking for something that could answer this

697
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and all the means that I had to chase that.

698
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But there were definitely some times where we really couldn't close the loop.

699
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And with that, we realized that something needed to be done about it.

700
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
We should maybe just fill in our listeners about how Jay Stratton ended up studying UFOs

701
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and related mysteries because he made it clear to us in our conversation with him.

702
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
He's not a UFO guy. He's not sitting at home watching UFO videos on YouTube.

703
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
He'd watch guitar playing videos on YouTube, but not UFOs.

704
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
He didn't have a whole bunch of books. He didn't have an abiding interest in it.

705
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But he ended up moving from Office of Naval Intelligence over to DIA

706
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
and became an acquaintance and colleague of Dr. Jim Lakatsky,

707
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
who eventually became the creator of the OSAP program, what became OSAP.

708
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And Lakatsky had an interest in Skinwalker Ranch, in the book that Collin Kelleher and I wrote.

709
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And we'll let Jay Stratton explain how that process went.

710
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I can remember telling our mutual friend, Dr. Lakatsky, that some of this stuff I don't,

711
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and I hate saying the word now because I have so much more background, but the word believe, right?

712
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
The belief isn't there necessarily that I'm seeing what I think was being reported, right?

713
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So that evolution between 2006 and then to 2008,

714
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,000
at that time I had to go to Iraq, just a normal deployment,

715
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
because we did deploy civilians.

716
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
A lot of people don't realize that civilians are just on the hook, just like military.

717
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
In 2006 and 2007 timeframe, as we were trying to think about this problem set,

718
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Jim Lakatsky says, hey, you know, basically I made the comment something effective.

719
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I'd love to see one with my own eyes.

720
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And what I meant by one is a nuts and bolts craft, right?

721
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Because in my mind, that's why I'm a technology aerospace guy.

722
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm thinking the craft that I can go touch and put my hands on, right?

723
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Or I'd like to see one of these things in person.

724
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And I was getting ready to go.

725
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Jim was obviously, he was tracking the ranch,

726
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
and he kind of made a joke, or I don't need to say it's a joke,

727
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
a comment of, hey, you know, there's one place in the world

728
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
we might see one of these things as this place.

729
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And he hands me your book.

730
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And I throw the book in my backpack and literally took it to Iraq with me.

731
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So I read that book in the green zone and in my downtime.

732
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And, you know, before I even got back,

733
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
we're talking and things are proceeding along.

734
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So I come back, and at that time we were at,

735
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
initially the Defense Warning Office and DIA was at the DIAC,

736
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
we call it the Defense Intelligence Analysis Center,

737
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
at Bowling Air Force Base.

738
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Now, granted, I was flight test back in the day

739
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
at Pax River Naval Air Station, which is in St. Mary's County, Maryland,

740
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
so I still live there.

741
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And I never sold my house throughout this whole process,

742
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
because I liked where I lived.

743
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But I was making really terrible commutes.

744
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So I agreed to work at the Defense Intelligence Agency

745
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and made that commute.

746
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And in the process they transferred us 14 miles through the city

747
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
to another place.

748
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And I can remember the quote to this day,

749
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
it's not only 14 miles, Jay, but it's 14 miles of D.C. hell, right,

750
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
going through the commute there.

751
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So anyway, we end up in this place, it's called Clarendon,

752
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
and it was really killing me physically, you know,

753
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
just the drive every day and the stress of that.

754
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I love the job, but the stress of getting there at home.

755
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And in 2008, Owen and I offered me the position to come back

756
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and be the Deputy Director of Air Warfare,

757
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
which was a lot better commute.

758
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And I loved Owen and I.

759
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You know, I kind of grew up there in the Intel community,

760
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
so I took that job and left.

761
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You know, Dr. Ocasio stayed in touch,

762
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
but that contract, you know, it was already in the beginnings.

763
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And then 2009, if I remember my timeline right,

764
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
he put it on FedBizOpps to be bid,

765
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and they had two bidders that I remember,

766
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
one being Bob Bigelow, you know, Bigelow Aerospace,

767
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and the other being a company that I don't remember the name of,

768
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
but it was a company that did a lot of business with DIA

769
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and kind of that contract world, you know,

770
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
that you have your favorite customers and your favorite.

771
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But there were more than one bid.

772
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And no funny business that you can see?

773
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
None at all.

774
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And I know all of the leadership, right,

775
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I worked there, worked for them.

776
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
They're the most straightforward, honest people as you can imagine.

777
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And they could not, I could never in a million years imagine them

778
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
taking any kind of favoritism into account.

779
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I guarantee they went over everything very detailed

780
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and made a decision based on the best response to the proposal that they had.

781
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
They fired up this program.

782
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Bigelow's organization springs in action.

783
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
They create these 38 papers.

784
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You know, we've heard it described as junk science.

785
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Do you recall how those papers were received when they came out?

786
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So what I remember, so Dr. Lokatsky, you know, that was driving that,

787
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
and our colleague, Dr. Hal Putoff, kind of led the charge there

788
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
supporting Bigelow Aerospace.

789
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And the idea of them, in my mind, was awesome, right?

790
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I'll have this reference document that I can always go back to

791
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
on all these different technologies.

792
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,000
They did come back being really, I'll say, academic, right?

793
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Very high-level academic.

794
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Whereas we're dealing with the Defense Intelligence Agency

795
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
that predominance is a liberal arts degree.

796
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And, you know, their war on terrorism was hot and heavy, right?

797
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
We're hiring people who are experts in that culture

798
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and hiring some people just because they speak Arabic, you know,

799
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and all these things.

800
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It wasn't, we weren't hiring the best and brightest engineers at the time

801
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
because it just wasn't the need of the DIA.

802
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So if you take all of that into context and you realize

803
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
your average DIA analyst is going to look at that

804
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
with their, you know, poli sci or history background and go,

805
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
what is this, right?

806
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Whereas other folks out, you know, AFRL and folks, you know,

807
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
people with the educational background will look at it and go,

808
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
oh, this is interesting.

809
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But they may say some of it is junk science

810
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
because it is bleeding edge, and that's what we wanted.

811
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
We wanted to know what they thought as the leading expert

812
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
on a potential technology,

813
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
what would be pushing the edge of that envelope.

814
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Because I needed something to point back to.

815
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
If I saw something in any kind of reporting,

816
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I could say, look, you know, based on Dr. XYZ,

817
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
they wrote this report, that's significant.

818
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You've seen what else was produced by OSAP over the 27 months.

819
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I mean, it's a lot of stuff.

820
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
But a lot of it is, some of it is pretty weird.

821
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I mean, you know, the skinwalker angle.

822
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I've heard it said now people who want to denigrate the program

823
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
that it was nonsense.

824
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It got off on all this weird paranormal stuff

825
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
that was never what it was supposed to be.

826
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And it was a waste of money.

827
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And that's why it was canceled,

828
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
because it got into these weird topics

829
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
that are just too far out.

830
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
In general, can you address the work that was done by OSAP,

831
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
the reports that you've read that haven't been made public,

832
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
whether it was worthwhile or not?

833
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So I think, so I'm back at O&I at this point, right?

834
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So my day-to-day interaction with the contract

835
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and with Bass was not there.

836
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You know, I didn't have that day-to-day.

837
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
However, Dr. Lakatsky and I, again,

838
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
he wants to pick my brain on things that are being seen.

839
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And I'm still in a role where I'm concerned

840
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
about threats to aviation and those types of things, right?

841
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So it's good to keep me and the team that I had

842
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
and my larger Rolodex of experts across the Intel community.

843
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So it was good to keep me up to speed.

844
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The heart and soul of OSAP was those technology areas.

845
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And the heart and soul of those technology areas

846
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
is preventing a disruptive technology.

847
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The other stuff that came out of that was collateral.

848
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You know, if you go to the ranch to see a nuts and bolts craft

849
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
that you might be able to put your hands on

850
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and you see other things that you can't explain,

851
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
no one to this day can explain.

852
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Is it something to do with the technology?

853
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Is it something, you know, is it an effect on the body?

854
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Is it something that's driving you to see things

855
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
that aren't really there?

856
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
You know, all those things needed to be studied.

857
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And again, throughout this whole process, I'm learning.

858
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
All of this comes into the forefront later

859
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
with the bigger task force and knowing what I needed

860
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
and knowing the kinds of expertise that I needed.

861
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And that true diversity may not mean, you know,

862
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
whether you're from a certain country

863
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
or your ethnic background or anything else.

864
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
True diversity may be purely the way you think

865
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
based on your own background

866
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
that is kind of an asymmetric approach to the technology area, right?

867
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
For example, hiring a biologist to look at the terrorist network

868
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
and the thread of radical Islam

869
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
and how it spreads like a virus, right?

870
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You take that same mindset to other things

871
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and the various phenomenon that we're seeing.

872
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's important to bring in that kind of diversity

873
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
just purely the way they think.

874
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And I always like to bring in folks with that kind of background

875
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
that didn't have a military background

876
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
because now they're not in this box in this viewpoint

877
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and they're always trying to mold things into.

878
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
They're coming at you with,

879
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
well, have you thought about this, right?

880
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And that is where the true, the power of those,

881
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
and those papers come from too

882
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
because then you've got to be,

883
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
something to point back to to say,

884
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
hey, take a look at this, what do you think, right?

885
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You know, to another academic or,

886
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and how can you, how could you see that applied?

887
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So Jay Stratton is not a UFO guy.

888
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
He's a, I don't know if you say a career intelligence officer,

889
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
but ONI to DIA, the UFO thing hits at him

890
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and he realizes there's a void there.

891
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
We need to do this right.

892
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
There are potential threats.

893
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
We don't know where they're coming from.

894
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So I'm going to create the UAP task force

895
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and we're going to look at this in a badass way

896
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and we're going to be clear with the American public.

897
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
He also made sure to put that in.

898
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We're going to be clear with the American public.

899
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
He did that for a while and then he had a break, right,

900
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
from the, it wasn't his job.

901
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And during a time he was doing intelligence

902
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
in another field, are we up to that point in the story?

903
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So the public, the UFO public is aware of the programs

904
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
that Jay Stratton was involved in.

905
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
We've mentioned the names of those.

906
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
What they don't know is they're already familiar

907
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
with some of his work.

908
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
For example, in 2018, I released through KLA Awesome Mystery Wire

909
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
a 13 page report about the Tic Tac incident.

910
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Tic Tac occurred in 2004.

911
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Your friend, Commander Dave Fravor,

912
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
is the aviator for the Navy that had the direct encounter

913
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
with this strange object.

914
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Five years later, when OSAP is born,

915
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
the first case they start looking at is Tic Tac.

916
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And the person they came to rely on to write the first report

917
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and investigate a report on Tic Tac was Jay Stratton.

918
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I released that report in 2018.

919
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It had no insignia on it. It wasn't signed.

920
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It doesn't say who wrote it.

921
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
But we can say now, he's the guy who wrote it.

922
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And it was great work.

923
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
He talked to all these aviators

924
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and different people who were involved in it.

925
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It is one report that then became a much bigger report

926
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
that has not been made public, but eventually will be someday.

927
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So that's one bit of work that he did.

928
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
A second thing that the public would know about is the DIRDs.

929
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
There are 38 of these DIRDs,

930
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Defense Intelligence Reference Documents.

931
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That's the acronym, what it means.

932
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And 38 of those reports were prepared for the OSAP program.

933
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And as Jay explained to us when we met with him,

934
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
it was meant to be a baseline

935
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
to establish what our baseline is for science and technology

936
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
in specific kinds of categories

937
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and to project what it might be 50 years from now.

938
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I remember when I made some of those,

939
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
when you and I released some of those reports,

940
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
people were griping and moaning,

941
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
oh, this is sci-fi, it's nonsense, it's garbage science.

942
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Well, it's not.

943
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
That's not how it was received by the defense industry.

944
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
They loved those reports because it was really good work.

945
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And they needed a baseline from which they could compare

946
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
when they had UFO cases to analyze, is this ours?

947
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Could it be ours?

948
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Could we duplicate that 50 years from now?

949
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And many times the answer was no.

950
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Right.

951
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And Jay actually talked about this in this interview that we did.

952
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's like he was saying,

953
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
we were trying to find the disruptive technologies

954
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and 50 years from now, the things that we were seeing,

955
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
the things that were going on,

956
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
we didn't have good explanations for,

957
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
so we have to theorize and get out there,

958
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
like what could it be, how could it be happening?

959
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's so interesting to me the way he also said,

960
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
he was so dismissive in a calm, cool, collected way

961
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
because he really empathizes with people

962
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
that have less information than him.

963
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And I get that.

964
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So certain things that are classified within our Department of Defense,

965
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
he can't just like go out on Twitter and say,

966
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
even if he gets on Twitter, you know what I mean?

967
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
But he was very clear that if something was identifiable,

968
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
if something was ours,

969
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
if something was a traditional object or a known foreign nation,

970
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
or even a question that could be a foreign nation, a known,

971
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
despite the capabilities,

972
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
that those would not be included in his reporting, in his analysis.

973
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And he really specifically said, you know,

974
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I get it that people think it's just one piece of evidence,

975
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
like just a video,

976
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
but you and I are hyper personally aware that there's other corroborative evidence

977
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
that is not for public consumption.

978
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Jay says it himself though, we had more information.

979
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And so when you say, oh, it's, you know, birds, balloons, optical illusions, reflections, pilot air,

980
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
he's like, bullshit, it's not, we would never have included it.

981
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And it's nice to hear him say that because it carries a lot more weight than just,

982
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
you know, it actually supports the pilots and people that know because they were there.

983
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Exactly. I mean, you know, the armchair experts, the debunkers on social media,

984
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
just throw anything out, throw it out and see what sticks against the wall.

985
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It's birds, it's flares, it's, you know, it's exhaust from a jet.

986
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It's ridiculous is what it is.

987
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And, you know, for that explanation to work, any of those,

988
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
you have to assume the U.S. military are idiots,

989
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
that the pilots are idiots, that the people manning the sensors are idiots,

990
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
that the analysis done by intelligence officials afterward,

991
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
that they're all idiots, that they don't recognize a bird from, you know,

992
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
an unknown object traveling at a high rate of speed.

993
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So Jay did share with us that there is so much information

994
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
that cannot be shared with the public for national security reasons

995
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
that went into their analyses of these key cases,

996
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Gimbal, Tic-Tac, Go-Fast, and a lot others that you and I got into.

997
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So he worked with OSAP, with Bigelow and Colom and Lakatsky,

998
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and he developed relationships in other parts of the Pentagon

999
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and the intelligence community that served him well years later.

1000
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Twenty-seven months after OSAP starts, it ended.

1001
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
And then Lou Elizondo comes along, picks up the pieces,

1002
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
creates what came to be known as ATIP, and Jay was directly involved with that.

1003
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Well, and also Jay developed, it was so cool hearing him talk about this,

1004
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
he developed what he said was like asymmetrical approaches.

1005
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So he would get people in different fields

1006
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
because they had different ways to solve problems,

1007
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and he would get them with their specialties,

1008
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
like a biologist that would look at the spread of information

1009
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
a little bit differently.

1010
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So I really appreciated the way that he would take an intelligence approach

1011
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
to problems that haven't been solved in traditional means.

1012
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So my point is, he actually developed staff and teams,

1013
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
and this was a big deal.

1014
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I think that what he did in developing, and for people that don't know,

1015
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
so OSAP, we keep saying that, it's bare to repeat,

1016
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Application Program,

1017
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
that was the largest, best-funded government,

1018
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
DIA, UFO program in history that is publicly known.

1019
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And then as that transitioned, it turned into ATIP,

1020
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.

1021
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
So those are the acronyms that we keep talking about.

1022
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
But I think it's important to show that there's individuals

1023
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and intelligence agencies that are taking this seriously

1024
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
and building infrastructure for better reporting

1025
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
and want to be transparent with the American public

1026
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
to the degree that is safe with problems with foreign problems.

1027
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
That's so encouraging.

1028
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I love that there are a multitude of agencies now

1029
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
that are developing beyond an interest,

1030
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
but a process to help bring this information to where it needs to go.

1031
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It will make you and me obsolete maybe as journalists,

1032
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
but it's great, it's happening.

1033
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
OSAP, the DIA program, lasted 27 months,

1034
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
and then because it got into some pretty controversial areas

1035
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
and became a hot potato within the Pentagon intelligence community,

1036
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Lou Alzando steps forward and was able to keep something going,

1037
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
a form of the program.

1038
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's not as big, it's not as high-profile,

1039
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
but he kept it going and was upset eventually

1040
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
that it just didn't get enough attention.

1041
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It didn't get enough resources to be able to do the work they really needed.

1042
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Jay, who was working with Lou, they're good friends,

1043
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
a lot of mutual respect between the two of them,

1044
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
moved on to another job.

1045
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
He was aware, as he told us, he was aware that Lou Alzando was going to leave

1046
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
and the reasons why he was going to leave and was upset.

1047
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
He was not aware that the New York Times story was going to come,

1048
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
and boom, it happens one day.

1049
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
That's a funny thing.

1050
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Lou, people just don't get this, but Lou is a champion.

1051
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
He took something and he kept it going and he made it strong.

1052
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I think Jay really appreciates that, you can tell from the conversations.

1053
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
We get to the point where Jay is now out of the UFO topic.

1054
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
That's not his task with his intelligence job.

1055
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
He's doing something else.

1056
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
The way he said it to us was so cool.

1057
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
On December 17th or whatever it was, 2017, when the New York Times thing,

1058
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
somebody put a paper bang right on his desk and says,

1059
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Merry Christmas or Happy Birthday, whatever he said.

1060
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
We'll let him tell that story.

1061
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I knew Lou was leaving.

1062
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Again, at that point in the 2017 to early 2018 timeframe,

1063
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I was in a job that UFOs were not my job in any form or fashion.

1064
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I did not do that job.

1065
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I was very conscious throughout my career of sticking to what I'm paid to do.

1066
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
However, again, Lou and I are friends, and the folks that took it over when I left,

1067
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I knew them all.

1068
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I got a face-to-face, it's called a Tamborg, secure face time with Lou in his office.

1069
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
This was about three or so days before he dropped his letter,

1070
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
and he's holding his letter.

1071
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
There's something to that effect.

1072
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
He's like, here's what I'm doing.

1073
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I said, good luck.

1074
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Then, lo and behold, he's on stage with Hal and Steve Justice and the team there.

1075
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I'm watching, and it's still at this point.

1076
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I had no idea I would be back in this topic at all.

1077
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I'm watching as an outsider just like everybody,

1078
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
but I could actually text Lou if I wanted.

1079
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I had some insider, but I'm watching and interested.

1080
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Are you sympathetic to his stated reasons for leaving,

1081
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and that he was frustrated that I can't get through to the Secretary of Defense

1082
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
and tell him about this, and it needs to be a higher priority?

1083
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I am.

1084
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
What we needed was a recognized program of record, as we call it.

1085
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
We needed something that had the oomph behind it, the power behind it,

1086
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
the authority behind it, to do a lot of things in order to get the answers we needed.

1087
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I was building towards that later, and I'm sure we'll talk about the task force,

1088
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
but I had a five-year plan of how we're going to get all of these things that we needed.

1089
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
If you're just a working group and trying to do your job,

1090
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and in my hat, maybe at the headquarters,

1091
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I had a certain amount of wiggle room for trying to get things done and authorities,

1092
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
but you needed something above all that.

1093
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
You needed something at that SecDef level, at that ODNI level,

1094
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
that could reach into everything and have the authority to get the answers it needed,

1095
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
and Lou and I knew we needed that,

1096
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
and every time we would try to knock on a door and say,

1097
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
hey, we need that, here's what we know, right?

1098
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Here's what we've seen, a little bit of history on OSAP and other things.

1099
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Yeah, you get the door kind of shut in your face because it's back to that careerism.

1100
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I don't know. I don't know. I'm afraid of the Washington Post.

1101
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Was there any involvement, I've heard these stories from people we know,

1102
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:00,000
about fundamentalist religious people, high-ups, who were concerned about its demons

1103
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
or were messing with forces of biblical proportions?

1104
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
There's absolutely some concern there, and I did see it in writing one time in my career

1105
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
where someone was asking me to push back because of their religious concerns,

1106
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
and you should wave off of this topic is literally what they were telling me.

1107
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You shouldn't be involved in this.

1108
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I know it exists. I think what my professional opinion is,

1109
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:35,000
after, again, years now of being involved, is that seems to have died off.

1110
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I think, one, I'm elevated into that senior level,

1111
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
and a lot of my colleagues that were all at the same level that had grown up with me

1112
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
throughout the process, we don't really think that way, right?

1113
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So I think kind of the old guard was moving out, the new guard was moving in,

1114
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and never once after that early DIA stuff did it ever, ever stop or get in the way.

1115
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It was just early on when that old guard's there and protecting what they believe.

1116
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
December 2017, it blows up, New York Times story.

1117
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I don't know if you knew that was coming, but I know a blue has been through the wringer since then.

1118
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I also know that Senator Reid, he let me know it was coming.

1119
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
He starts getting phone calls immediately from his former colleagues in the Senate,

1120
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
and they're asking, hey, what's the deal? Is this program real? How do I find out about it?

1121
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Is that when you get sort of pulled back in and you start doing briefings?

1122
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Also, I was sitting in my office at the other non-UFO-related job,

1123
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
and I get an email from my old boss that was a link to the New York Times story,

1124
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and she said, Merry Christmas, because I had no idea that was coming at all.

1125
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And it was literally, holy crap, when you're reading that and you have some inside baseball knowledge.

1126
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
But I didn't have any security concerns.

1127
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
If I had security concerns, I would have addressed it with a security concern.

1128
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I can't believe we're saying all this in the New York Times because of everything that was involved, right?

1129
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
But I didn't know it was coming. It took me by surprise.

1130
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I had zero intent at that point of working the topic again.

1131
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Just when I'm out, they pulled me back in.

1132
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Exactly what happened.

1133
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
A godfather.

1134
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Exactly what happened. So my old boss that sent me the email some time after that

1135
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
sent me a position and said I should consider it, and I did, and I applied, and I got that.

1136
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
That was that promotion.

1137
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I was actually stepping back into Office of Enabled Intelligence to do a different job,

1138
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:49,000
but at that point, you know, your pilots had been taken to Congress,

1139
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
the Senate Armed Services Committee and all these folks had interest in the topic.

1140
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And my boss realizing, you know, she knew all along, hey, I've got one guy that's got some history in this

1141
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
and the trust to tackle it appropriately and keep it professional and do all the things that need to be done.

1142
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So she reached out and said, hey, I want you to take this over.

1143
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And she really wanted a joint program, is the word she used, but, you know, a joint effort built

1144
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:21,000
to tackle this problem and get out ahead of it because of the Alex Dietrichs of the world, right?

1145
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
The people that we want to take care of.

1146
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And I only say her name because she's come out herself.

1147
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And with that, I took it.

1148
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I had the authority.

1149
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
We call it DERLOT, Direct Liaison Authority.

1150
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I had Direct Liaison Authority across the entire government.

1151
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
She empowered me with her, you know, her power to do that, to say, just go for it.

1152
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And I wouldn't let anything stop me unless they threw me out, right?

1153
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So I started going through my own education and saying, here's what I need.

1154
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And that came from the years of looking at this.

1155
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And I knew I needed things like the FBI and the Coast Guard and others for their Title 18 authorities.

1156
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I needed folks with the right Title 50 authorities, the folks with the right Title 10 authorities.

1157
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And to do this right and to get that level of respect and get to those true answers,

1158
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
you've got to have the right people involved, right?

1159
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
So I went out like building a business and started knocking on doors.

1160
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And now, thanks to my new rank, I pretty much got doors opened, right?

1161
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And previously, they might have opened the doors.

1162
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But now, hey, let's see what this guy has to say.

1163
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
At that point, you know, we had the gimbal and other things, right, that people know about.

1164
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
But we had more, obviously.

1165
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I'm going through what we know, what we don't know, what we think.

1166
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And everywhere I went, because, again, of that education of how to present the data,

1167
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
how to present the information, they went, holy crap, how can we help, right?

1168
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And I ended up with somebody in each organization that was kind of my belly button to say,

1169
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
hey, this is your guy, he'll help you.

1170
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And I just started building out that business and that framework

1171
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and getting the things that we needed to be successful.

1172
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I would call it, at that point, a partnership, not a task force,

1173
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
because really, you know, task force is a legal thing in the DOD circles.

1174
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
But we were this partnership with the right people across the services,

1175
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
everybody approaching it from the right perspective.

1176
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Did it have a name at that point?

1177
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
No, I started loosely calling it a task force, but that was very loose.

1178
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And the way I would brief it is partnership, you know, as I kind of show who's helping out.

1179
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
But at that point, I am briefing Congress, you know, from that day forward, right?

1180
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I went in and briefed a couple of the committees on my plan.

1181
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I had what I call a one-pager.

1182
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Again, I'm, you know, from a marketing perspective, everything on one page,

1183
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
and here's what I'm going to do, and here's how I'm going to do it.

1184
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And they loved it, and they got behind it,

1185
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
and you saw some language coming out of the authorization for that.

1186
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I heard it became a hot ticket that, you know, whereas before,

1187
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
it was not nothing that ever popped up in Congress,

1188
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
and suddenly, hey, let's have a hearing, show us the videos.

1189
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Absolutely. And again, it's how you present the data, right?

1190
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And there were plenty, there were still a few of the old guard kind of hanging out

1191
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
that could prevent me from being successful,

1192
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
and some of them did not want to hear from me, right?

1193
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
They don't want to get the briefing.

1194
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But every time I finally got to brief them, they were supportive.

1195
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Every congressman I ever briefed, except one, I won't say who,

1196
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
and it gets back to the belief word.

1197
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
You know, everybody understood where I was coming from and the problem set,

1198
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,000
and that, you know, at the end of the day, the business I built was working,

1199
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
and it was what we finally needed, right?

1200
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
It sort of reminds you of Michael Corleone,

1201
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
just when I'm out, I thought I was out, they pulled me back in.

1202
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
It's the kind of thing. So again, he was not a UFO guy.

1203
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
He was doing his job.

1204
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Each of the times he was asked to do this, he was doing his job.

1205
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And you know, something else he said that really impacted me was,

1206
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
he was a really high rank, and I don't want to get into exactly how that works,

1207
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
but we'd say an equivalent of, let's just say a really high rank.

1208
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
So a lot of people could have pressured him because of their rank

1209
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
to try to diminish the work he was doing,

1210
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
but he resisted that all along the way and did the right thing.

1211
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And I thought that was a really cool thing to hear from somebody

1212
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
and to know it to be true.

1213
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You know, the public knows a lot about the role of Lou Elizondo,

1214
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
both in blowing the story wide open and trying to get a bigger program

1215
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
and in bringing some of the aviators and other witnesses,

1216
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
escorting them to Congress.

1217
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
He and Chris Mellon work on pushing that ball down the field.

1218
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Jay Stratton is the unsung hero who is working in obscurity,

1219
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
but doing the really important stuff.

1220
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
And this was, he didn't have a program.

1221
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It wasn't called the UAP Task Force.

1222
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
It was after that New York Times story and Congress starts asking questions

1223
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
that he was putting in charge of an inquiry, you know,

1224
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
to try to pull all the different strings together,

1225
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
to start pulling information together and cases

1226
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
and getting a structure of an organization that became the UAP Task Force later on.

1227
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Jay Stratton started the UAP Task Force,

1228
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and that was huge for transparency on the subject.

1229
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I do want to say you're like, he's the unsung hero.

1230
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I got to say, though, Lou gets a lot of grief that is not, it's not valid grief.

1231
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
He's really endured a lot of slings and arrows, as you say.

1232
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
So it's like, you know, being a hero in this ain't what it cracked up to be, maybe.

1233
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I mean, it's, you know, he is to me, absolutely a hero to this topic.

1234
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
And I think it's important what he's done.

1235
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I think Jay coming forward with us on camera,

1236
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I think I hope he is treated differently because, man,

1237
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
he's done great things and now the public's going to learn about them.

1238
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Well, you remember at end of 2020, Congress says we want a program.

1239
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
In fact, we want a report.

1240
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
You got, here's the legislation.

1241
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
We want that report.

1242
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
You got six months to write it.

1243
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So January, Jay's organization starts working on it.

1244
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
The UAP Task Force, we're going to put this report together.

1245
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And it's precisely that moment he gets yanked out of it.

1246
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And it looked really suspicious.

1247
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I remember I reported on it at exactly the time when you need him most,

1248
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,000
when the most experienced guy in the U.S. government on the UFO mystery

1249
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
is taken out of it and given another job.

1250
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
But he actually was supposed to be doing that job all along.

1251
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
This was a temporary duty.

1252
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So he has taken out the people who he had left there.

1253
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
They didn't have a full-time position.

1254
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
They didn't have any full-time positions, didn't have a budget.

1255
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Here, put this report together for Congress.

1256
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And I think they did a remarkable job in six months to get it together.

1257
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
That's right.

1258
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
And he had two people that were putting this report together.

1259
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
And I do agree, it was a phenomenal job.

1260
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
He even talked about why, in the interviews with us,

1261
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
he even talked about why he started in 2004

1262
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
rather than going back all the way through UFO history.

1263
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Everyone's like, why did he start in 2004?

1264
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And he explains that really well.

1265
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And there's a clip of it.

1266
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
So you get a lot of, you know, I said on numerous occasions, right?

1267
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Trust is important.

1268
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I think it was Colin Powell that said you can't surge trust.

1269
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
The minute you're...

1270
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I mean, we're already 70 years behind the power curve for trust, right?

1271
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Because everybody says the government's lying to us, right?

1272
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And the whole Blue Book thing and the whole Roswell thing killed trust, right?

1273
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Very good reason why not to even go there, right?

1274
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And this whole discussion, the task force and everything else,

1275
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
we kind of started 2004, right, as Mr. Bray said in the congressional hearings.

1276
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
You got to start somewhere.

1277
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And in my recommendation, when I created it,

1278
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
is that 2004 start date is important

1279
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
because that was the first case in recent history

1280
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
where I had pilot reporting and data, right?

1281
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Back to the data.

1282
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
But you take all that, that trust,

1283
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and then you get this bureaucratic machine

1284
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
that is the Department of Defense and the intel community.

1285
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And then, you know, this is an interagency whole government.

1286
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So now you're talking about Congress

1287
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
and you're talking about all the other departments,

1288
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
your DHSs and your transportation, right,

1289
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
with FAA and everybody else.

1290
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Like, you got to have a singular message.

1291
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And that's why I wanted the task force to have its own spokesperson

1292
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
so that we're briefing as much as we can of what we're dealing with.

1293
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
But so you get this whole machine,

1294
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
and no matter how hard you try,

1295
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
email is not the best communication method, right?

1296
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And hardly anybody picks up the phone these days.

1297
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
So what would happen to me

1298
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
is I would see a response from the DOD spokesperson

1299
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
and I would say, oh my gosh, why did we say that, right?

1300
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
And you come back and you try to clean up,

1301
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
but there's no cleaning up at that point.

1302
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
So it was all that circular, and then you had agendas, right?

1303
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
You still had, I think you're probably aware of Lou's previous,

1304
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
and you know, you had that happening.

1305
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And that was also manipulating and driving,

1306
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
because again, DOD is a very conscious,

1307
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
rank-structured organization, right?

1308
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
So if someone senior is telling you to do something,

1309
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
it's not illegal.

1310
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
They probably don't want to risk things and go with it.

1311
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
So I think you had some of that going on.

1312
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Now, I'll tell you, even as the head of the task force,

1313
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I didn't get into those politics on purpose.

1314
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
In fact, I went back to my old days,

1315
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
the Defense Intelligence Agency,

1316
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
when I was saying we're nationally funded

1317
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
and I need to make an assessment that isn't manipulated by politics,

1318
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
which is actually the law now following 9-11.

1319
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I stuck to my guns that I am here to, you know,

1320
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
work on behalf of the intel community

1321
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
to give the American people an answer on numerous occasions.

1322
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Anytime someone tried to play the rank game,

1323
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I would just stick to my guns.

1324
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Essentially, the idea that he would choose a date

1325
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
where they have a great amount of systems data

1326
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
and move forward from there, it makes total sense.

1327
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
And I think that was a very smart move.

1328
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I'm sure there is historic data that we can look at now,

1329
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
but I think that was a great starting point.

1330
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So that was very cool when he did that.

1331
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And the two people that he tasked with doing that report, again,

1332
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
did a remarkable job.

1333
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
There's something else he did that you and I have referenced

1334
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
in various reports without attributing it to him in any way,

1335
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
because I couldn't use his name.

1336
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
But there was a briefing presentation that was put together,

1337
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
and it was an accumulation of all these cases

1338
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
that Jay and his colleagues had been investigating.

1339
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And a lot of them had included video and photos

1340
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
and things of that sort.

1341
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And he put this together as a briefing presentation

1342
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
for higher-ups in the Pentagon, for members of Congress,

1343
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
for defense contractors, and for the intelligence community.

1344
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And he made the case, hey, this is real.

1345
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
This is a genuine unknown.

1346
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
This is a national security matter.

1347
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
We need to take a look at it.

1348
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I understand it's a very persuasive piece of information,

1349
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
but some of the images that were in that briefing document,

1350
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
it's classified.

1351
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But some of the images that came from that are not classified.

1352
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Right.

1353
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I mean, we'll be clear, because we've been clear all along the way,

1354
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
is as journalists, obtaining and releasing

1355
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
unclassified information is absolutely fine.

1356
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
No designation, nothing like that.

1357
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Sure, something can be contained within something classified.

1358
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I don't know.

1359
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
What I know for sure is that, and it was confirmed by the Pentagon,

1360
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
that stuff that we ended up releasing,

1361
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
especially regarding the 2019 events on the West Coast,

1362
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
which is something we've covered on an episode at length,

1363
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
one of our last episodes.

1364
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And I think that the key thing here that I think people should know

1365
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
is that you've got this audiovisual presentation

1366
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:00,000
that is being shared within multiple intelligence agencies.

1367
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Why?

1368
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
The reason why appears to be to de-stigmatize,

1369
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,000
to acclimate people to the possibility of how do you report this,

1370
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
and to encourage reporting,

1371
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
going right back up the chain of command where it should go,

1372
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
which is a smooth and cool process.

1373
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
The problem was they didn't respond a lot to people

1374
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
when they would report it up,

1375
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
and they realized that was an error and that they should give feedback

1376
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
so people know these reports are going somewhere.

1377
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
We're taking them seriously.

1378
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
He also needed to find a way to get beyond NDAs, right?

1379
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Because sometimes you just over-classify stuff,

1380
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
and people have to do an NDA because something was seen or picked up,

1381
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
and they have to go through the process of getting past NDAs,

1382
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
which I don't know he ever got,

1383
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
but I think that's important moving forward for Arrow

1384
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
if it's going to do some great work.

1385
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Yeah, a lot of those cases that were part of his briefing presentation

1386
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
ended up as part of the UAP Task Force report to Congress.

1387
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
They didn't spell it out in any instances,

1388
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
but we know that that is the case,

1389
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
and that Congress did respond and did take it seriously.

1390
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Jay Stratton left government in 2021 and entered the private sector.

1391
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
He was happy to move to Huntsville, Alabama to work for Radiance.

1392
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
He was happy to bring Travis Taylor along,

1393
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
and as we know, we've been able to share at least a couple of excerpts

1394
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
from this interview that we did.

1395
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
There's a lot more coming from Jay Stratton, I think, in 2023.

1396
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Oh, I know. Yeah, we know.

1397
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I mean, he is making it a point to communicate as clearly as possible

1398
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
with the American public about his roles, what he did,

1399
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
what he hopes for the future with this, what's currently going on.

1400
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I think it's great that people will be seeing a lot of him,

1401
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
that he'll be coming and talking about his roles and experiences.

1402
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I think when you can put a face, you know what I mean,

1403
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
to these people that were really before the Unsung Heroes,

1404
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I mean, the intel community, people are deep inside,

1405
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
they don't want to be in front of a camera,

1406
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
but now that people come forward a little bit

1407
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
and give other people the encouragement and the permission,

1408
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I think that that's very powerful for witnesses

1409
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
that have been part of UFO exploitation and reverse engineering programs

1410
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
and legacy programs or current programs to come forward

1411
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
through the new legislation that has been passed into law

1412
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
that protects whistleblowers.

1413
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
And in fact, it's not just a right to come forward.

1414
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
In fact, it's a duty.

1415
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
If there have been programs that have been hidden from congressional oversight,

1416
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
proper congressional oversight, you have a legal duty to come forward.

1417
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So I really hope people are encouraged by this in these programs

1418
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
that we do know exist, that they do come forward

1419
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
and that they share with our Senate Intelligence Committee

1420
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
or whatever the process is at this point to get this information forward,

1421
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
then hopefully out to the American public.

1422
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
This technology is important, man.

1423
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I totally agree.

1424
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You know, I want to say this also about Jay Stratton.

1425
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Although I've been allowed to know of him and then to know him,

1426
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
he is not a source.

1427
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
He did not leak any of these images to us.

1428
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
This is a guy who plays by the rules.

1429
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
It drove me crazy to know a guy like that who could answer these questions

1430
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
and who has access to all kinds of materials that I have not seen,

1431
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
that you haven't seen, that the public hasn't seen,

1432
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
but he played by the rules.

1433
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
He is a stickler about that.

1434
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Now that he's in the private sector and he is a public citizen,

1435
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
a private citizen, he has a lot more flexibility to pursue these subjects.

1436
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
He's definitely hooked on it now.

1437
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
If he wasn't before, he is now.

1438
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And we're going to hear a lot more from him in 2023,

1439
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
but I just want to make it clear, he's not a leaker.

1440
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
He didn't leak any stuff to us.

1441
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
You know, it's so funny, man.

1442
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
People are going to try to, I would too, try to guess how this works.

1443
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Everybody's been wrong.

1444
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Everybody's been wrong about how information gets to journalists.

1445
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
We don't need to constantly tell you, we would never have a source on.

1446
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
But the thing is, what does it mean to be a source?

1447
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Sometimes you and I have received stuff that we don't know exactly

1448
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
who or where it came from.

1449
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
So our job for years sometimes, which is what's now,

1450
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
a lot of that's coming out, but like for years,

1451
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
is to figure out the validity of information

1452
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
rather than the source of information.

1453
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
That's interesting, isn't that?

1454
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
That's something unexpected to me.

1455
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You know, the people who are real heroes in this saga, this ongoing saga,

1456
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Dr. James Lakatsky, who almost single-handedly,

1457
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
with the help of Harry Reid and Robert Bigelow,

1458
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
got the OSAP program created,

1459
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
and then Lou Elizondo, who rescued the remnants of it

1460
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
and got ATIP and kept it going,

1461
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
and then Jay Stratton, who was part of all of this,

1462
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
all those programs and beyond into the current era,

1463
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
you know, he might be the most important UFO,

1464
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
government UFO investigator ever of all of them.

1465
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And it's so great to be able to talk to him.

1466
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
We have so much more that we haven't been able to share yet,

1467
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
but we will over the next course of the year,

1468
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and hopefully he'll be here live sometime.

1469
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Yeah, and look, this program or whatever,

1470
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
this audio and visual program,

1471
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
it's because we know we can now.

1472
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Now we're going to have people here.

1473
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Every time we're able to use this to get stuff out

1474
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
that you and I wouldn't normally be able to get out

1475
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
in any traditional means, so I am excited.

1476
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It would be great right here if there was somebody

1477
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
who worked in one of the government UFO programs

1478
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
that could sit right here next to us.

1479
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Wouldn't that be great?

1480
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Well, look at the wheels that are turning

1481
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
because of the work of the guys I just mentioned,

1482
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
you know, Lakatsky, Callum Kelleher,

1483
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Lou Elizondo, Jay Stratton.

1484
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
The work that they did, toiling in obscurity

1485
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
for so many years, is really paying dividends.

1486
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I mean, this is not a terrific report,

1487
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
but the fact that it exists at all is amazing.

1488
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
The fact that they now have a streamlined process

1489
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
and have taken away some of the stigma

1490
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
attached to reporting UFOs

1491
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
is amazing progress in a short period of time.

1492
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
And Congress, maintaining an ongoing interest in this,

1493
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
they're demanding more information.

1494
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
We don't know what's in the classified version of this,

1495
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
but it's exciting, it's awesome.

1496
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
And, you know, the legislation that offers protection

1497
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
to whistleblowers is also very exciting

1498
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
that we're going to be exploring over the next nine, 10 months.

1499
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Is this George Knapp being optimistic about the UFO topic?

1500
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Let me take that back. Let me take it back.

1501
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
No, you can't take it back.

1502
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I heard it loud and clear.

1503
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It sounded like George Knapp was being optimistic

1504
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
about UFO transparency in some way.

1505
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Look, man, we're only going to get as far as we push it.

1506
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Nobody wants to give up information,

1507
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
you know, if it's special to them.

1508
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
There's no reason to, but I think if the public demands it,

1509
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
we ask nicely and shake the doors a little bit.

1510
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Look, there are great people within our,

1511
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
the majority of our armed services, our intelligence agencies.

1512
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
You know, they are just like us.

1513
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
They're curious about this. They're excited about it.

1514
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
If it's not a matter of national security,

1515
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
this is stuff that should be told to the American public.

1516
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
So I am very optimistic by nature,

1517
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
but it was kind of cool to hear some optimism from you.

1518
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
You're not so optimistic sometimes when it comes to traveling

1519
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
because of your curse.

1520
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And I want to finish this trip and remind you what happened.

1521
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So we are, we do these great interviews and we're just stoked, man.

1522
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It was really fun.

1523
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
We met really interesting folks that we ended up, you know,

1524
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
having friendships with along the way,

1525
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
who I'm sure you will hear from in the future,

1526
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
who are involved in this topic deeply.

1527
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
So we're like, okay, let's just get home.

1528
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And of course we're on some horrible airline.

1529
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
There's this photo I put up on social media.

1530
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
We look like gorillas, man.

1531
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
We have our bags and we're just walking down this runway,

1532
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
just trying to get on this plane.

1533
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
We're all masked up because guess what?

1534
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Turns out, Niles, if COVID didn't kill you, I was going to kill you.

1535
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
My buddy who we were with all week had really bad COVID.

1536
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I'm in bleeding coughs and I was like, oh man, you and I, we escaped it.

1537
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
We thought we escaped it. There we are in the plane.

1538
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And then we get this lightning storm.

1539
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I have never seen so much lightning in my life out a window.

1540
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
It was like, it just felt like doom because of your travel curse.

1541
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
But we got back and we still had to sit on this story.

1542
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
We had to sit on the story up until now in a lot of ways.

1543
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
So it was, you know, it's funny, like as a journalist,

1544
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
you've probably dealt with this like tons,

1545
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
but you got to really respect that someone gives you their trust

1546
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
and they're allowing you to do this.

1547
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
So you got to time everything right.

1548
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
You can't just throw something up on YouTube or throw something out on Twitter.

1549
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
You have to do it responsibly.

1550
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Check everything before you do it.

1551
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And God forbid you make a mistake, but if you do, you say it, right?

1552
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
So that was kind of a neat trip.

1553
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
We get back and man, we were tired, but we got what we needed.

1554
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Yeah. You know, we got so much material from Dr. Taylor and from Jay Stratton

1555
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
and the folks at Radiance and then the people, other people we met at the SCU conference.

1556
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And we were really excited to go ahead and share it with the public.

1557
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
But it takes time, you know.

1558
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
We didn't have the okay to go ahead and spill all those beans.

1559
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
We do now.

1560
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
We have permission from Jay to use some parts of that interview.

1561
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And I think we're probably going to be using more in the future.

1562
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,000
And hopefully we'll be hearing from him live, maybe on this stage and maybe on other stages.

1563
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Okay. So what's the big picture now?

1564
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Like as we do these and we try to put these pieces together for public consumption.

1565
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
And here we are in 2023.

1566
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
You know, what's the big picture, man?

1567
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Where are we going with this from Reports to Arrow to other agencies we know that are interested in the UFO subject?

1568
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Like, where are we going with this?

1569
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Well, we know that because of that legislation, there are whistleblowers who are lined up,

1570
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:55,000
at least a few of them that we know of, who are lined up prepared to tell what they know.

1571
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
The most interesting unanswered question is where are the goodies?

1572
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Is there metamaterials stashed in a warehouse?

1573
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Are there intact craft, as Bob Lazar suggested, somewhere out in the desert?

1574
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Are there bodies?

1575
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,000
You know, there are people who have told us that they know that those things are true,

1576
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
that there are materials, exotic materials from somewhere else.

1577
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
The question is, are they going to be allowed to speak?

1578
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Now, I did express a little bit of optimism a couple of minutes ago.

1579
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
But I think for them, it's still a dicey deal.

1580
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:33,000
You know, stepping forward to tell these incredibly sensitive secrets comes with risk.

1581
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:41,000
And we know that there are at least some of them who are already facing potential consequences for agreeing to step forward.

1582
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Hopefully, the stories will come out.

1583
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
The information will be conveyed to Congress.

1584
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Whether or not that information gets to us, the public, that's another matter.

1585
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
But we'll be doing our best to get it out.

1586
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
The process designed through the whistleblower protection stuff,

1587
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:05,000
the idea of using something like the inspector general to move forward with complaints of reprisal and this sort of thing,

1588
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I think it is fair to say, because we've said before, that process, whether or not it has been formalized,

1589
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:21,000
there are people in this subject who are using the right mechanisms to get the information where it needs to go at a fear of reprisal.

1590
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
That is something current that is happening.

1591
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,000
So I'm encouraged that that process is there to protect people.

1592
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Ultimate goal, let's just say it like it is.

1593
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:40,000
There are UFO study programs in multiple agencies across every branch of our military, many of which we know about.

1594
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:46,000
The idea is, can they go through a formal process to bring those illegal programs to where they should go?

1595
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
This shouldn't be a job of journalism. This should be a job of cleaning house.

1596
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
This should be something that they do on the inside.

1597
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Journalists do what they do. This should be clear and straightforward.

1598
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:02,000
If there are unknown illegal programs dealing with non-terrestrial technologies, yes, that's a huge issue for humanity.

1599
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
But this also needs to be fixed on the inside.

1600
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Absolutely. And this report, for example, there's a line in there that I found pretty interesting.

1601
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:17,000
It says that we have no evidence of any direct human health consequences of exposure to UFOs.

1602
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I can hope that sometime in the next 12 months that the Arrow folks will go down the hall

1603
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and knock on the door at the DIA and ask to see the OSAP files.

1604
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Because OSAP, as we have reported, has very definitive evidence about harmful consequences from people who got too close to UFOs.

1605
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:45,000
And there are some very dramatic and well-documented cases that the DIA program followed for a number of years.

1606
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:55,000
So having seen some of these reports, the thing you're saying is that Arrow, who's studying the UFO phenomenon,

1607
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
they should already have all this documentation of a huge program like OSAP

1608
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:08,000
that clearly shows that there have been health issues that have been caused directly from close proximity to UAP.

1609
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Right. And they don't seem to have any knowledge of that.

1610
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It was similar to the two guys who appeared before the congressional hearing, the first congressional hearing in 54 years,

1611
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
when they were asked about nuclear incidents, incidents on our nuclear missile bases.

1612
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
They don't know anything about it.

1613
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Well, there are some pretty dramatic cases that were studied also by OSAP that were written up into reports.

1614
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:36,000
All they have to do is ask for it. Congress seemed to only know a little bits and pieces.

1615
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
They were unaware, seemingly unaware, that OSAP ever existed.

1616
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
When the Navy guys were asked, is there anything in between Project Blue Book and ATIP?

1617
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Nope. Well, that's not true.

1618
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I mean, you know, it was a lot of money. Millions of public dollars were spent on that.

1619
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
The stories have been all over the world. The book has been written.

1620
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
The people who were involved in the program have come forward and talked about it.

1621
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
How can they not know? How?

1622
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Yeah, man. So I guess, you know, kind of where we're at here is it would be really great to hear from somebody

1623
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
who actually worked in these programs. And I think we're going to get that pretty soon.

1624
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
You know, thanks for kind of telling us about the report and getting to the point we're at.

1625
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I guess where I'm at is I'm just excited to see kind of how this is all assimilated into our processes.

1626
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Like so that I want the American public to know if this is true.

1627
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:36,000
You know, I have I don't have the luxury of disbelief on certain things, but I want it to be stated and boldly stated.

1628
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I don't know when that's going to come and what the truth is or what the full truth is.

1629
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
But I think we're getting closer.

1630
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Well, the public also needs to understand as OSAP came to realize that this is way beyond just UFOs.

1631
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You're never going to solve this mystery just by studying lights in the sky or craft that appear on a sensor and you can't see with your own eyes.

1632
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
You have to look at the big picture. And unfortunately, a lot of that gets really weird.

1633
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:09,000
So strange. Maybe it's almost by design that it's so strange that people are reluctant to dig into it.

1634
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:17,000
That's how many in the Pentagon seemingly reacted to the reports that came in from OSAP, from the big low organization.

1635
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,000
It gets really strange. The stuff at Skinwalker is really strange.

1636
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,000
It's easy to make fun of. It's easy to dismiss because it's so strange.

1637
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
But it happened. It really did happen.

1638
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And the reports that have not yet been made public lay it out in very specific detail.

1639
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And we're going to be getting into that more in the course of the next few months on this program.

1640
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Absolutely. And I just want to kind of testify here that I think I'm nuts and bolts.

1641
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
You know, my family thinks I'm just fucking nuts.

1642
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
But the thing is, is that I have a resistance.

1643
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I have a resistance to the high strangeness, to the weirdness, to the things that seem to happen around the UFO phenomenon.

1644
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I am cool with Bob Lazar's description of craft as an example.

1645
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
That's what initially the science of that, how that would work.

1646
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I am cool with the nuts and bolts.

1647
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I get an allergy when it comes to the weirder stuff.

1648
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:19,000
And, you know, even with everything I know, have seen and been briefed on, but I have an allergy to it.

1649
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:25,000
So I can understand that the public, you know, kind of trying to be like, that's too weird to be true.

1650
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
We can accept flying saucers. We can accept UFOs.

1651
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
We can accept reverse engineering and governments hiding this and there being a cover up.

1652
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
To some degree, we can accept that.

1653
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
But when it gets weirder, I empathize with the resistance to it.

1654
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Now, I'm going to try. I'm going to try to look at straight and say, you know, look at it just like I would anything else.

1655
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:53,000
But I think hearing from people directly who have direct experiences in these programs, that's going to be the key to understanding that.

1656
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Well, Dr. James Lakatsky spent 20 years as a rocket scientist at the DIA.

1657
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:05,000
That's as nuts and bolts as you get. Studying rockets, our rockets, other nations' rockets, potential threats.

1658
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Jay Stratton, his friend and colleague, also at the DIA, nuts and bolts guy.

1659
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Reverse engineering, how to figure out technology, figuring out the nature of threats of all sorts.

1660
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Both nuts and bolts people who came to understand that this mystery goes way beyond nuts and bolts.

1661
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Jay Stratton, we've heard from him today in pieces of the conversation that you and I had with him.

1662
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:34,000
What we haven't heard is some of his personal experiences and that goes way beyond just studying lights in the sky.

1663
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And hopefully sometime in the course of 2023, he's going to open up about that.

1664
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Yeah. Well, look, man, I'm looking forward to it. As always, I'm willing to learn.

1665
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And, you know, the main thing is I think that having those direct conversations are going to help round the corners for a lot of people, including myself.

1666
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
So anyway, thanks, man. That was fun. Yeah. All right.

1667
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Thank you.
