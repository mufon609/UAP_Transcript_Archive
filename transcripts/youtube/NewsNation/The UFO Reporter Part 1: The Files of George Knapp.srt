1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,060
Mr. Chairman, ranking members and congressmen, thank you, I'm happy to be here.

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,140
This is an important issue and I'm grateful for your time.

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,760
My name is David Charles Grush.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,720
I was an intelligence officer for 14 years.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,100
In July 2023, a bombshell congressional hearing made waves around the world.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,900
I was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,860
and reverse engineering program.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,100
But one investigative journalist has been sounding the alarm on UFO secrets for decades.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,580
I think it is a hugely significant moment and I never thought I would see it in my lifetime.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,740
George Knapp joins us now.

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,660
UFOs, the best evidence, George.

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,060
There are many unanswered questions about UFOs.

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,500
Speculation about some long-standing government cover-up is tough for many people to swallow.

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,780
You've got photos, you've got movie footage, you've got video.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,300
There is some kind of a phenomenon here that can't just be written off.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,180
I've always approached it as a news story.

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,020
It's not my religion, it's not a belief.

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,340
I don't know what to believe even now.

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,100
Now NewsNation is bringing you unprecedented access to the files of George Knapp.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,580
I have secret stashes of files and things all over the station.

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,740
Mountains of evidence compiled from the government's own files.

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,500
No one who knew Area 51 from the inside ever talked publicly.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,060
Well there's several, actually nine, flying saucers.

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,140
They have between 30 and 50 alien bodies.

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,020
The government has been telling us for years that they're not real.

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,780
And how his life's work still influences the conversations on UFOs.

27
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,860
It is true.

28
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,500
It would be the biggest story in history.

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,980
36 years later, I'm still trying to figure it out.

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,620
We're in Vegas, we're on the Strip, we're on our way to meet George.

31
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,020
He's finally agreed to meet with us.

32
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,060
It took a long time because he's very busy.

33
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,900
He says he gets multiple interview requests per day, but he's finally going to sit down

34
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,940
with us at the TV station where he's worked for decades.

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,740
So this has been my office amazingly.

36
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,820
They've let me keep it all these years.

37
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,980
I have secret stashes of files and things all over the station because I'm a pack rat,

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,340
I keep everything.

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,740
This is where a lot of the stories that we did were created.

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,060
All these things that have come out over the last couple of years started right here.

41
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,060
What brought you to Vegas?

42
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,380
I flipped a coin.

43
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,500
I was living in Northern California.

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,980
I had been the debate coach at UC Berkeley.

45
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
I was tired of being broke.

46
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,260
You know, I knew I had to do something and I met these crazy bartenders from Las Vegas

47
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,780
and they told me about the town, they said, hey, you can write, you're a speaker.

48
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,020
We know a guy in television, you can get a job there.

49
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,020
So I moved here.

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
We've done so many stories.

51
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,500
You know, when I moved to Las Vegas, I didn't know there was an Area 51.

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,220
I didn't know there was a Nevada test site, the most nuked place in the world.

53
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,420
This is the center, the heart of the nuclear testing where all these big holes, that's

54
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,780
caused by nuclear bombs.

55
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,900
And those bombs became tourist attractions by themselves, but all those brainiacs and

56
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,620
scientists and engineers who amassed in Las Vegas at the same time the mob was here and

57
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,580
showgirls, it was a really interesting historical time.

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:33,780
The wide variety and array of top name entertainment is really what sets Las Vegas apart from anywhere

59
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
else.

60
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,700
I met this bartender who was a mob guy and he said, you want to drive a cab?

61
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,740
So I was the worst cab driver in the history of the world.

62
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,020
I didn't know where anything was.

63
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,540
During the same time, KLVX hired me as a part-time production assistant.

64
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,340
At night when I finished the cab driving shift, I'd go over to this nightclub, which was called

65
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,580
the Oz, and all the mob guys were there.

66
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,700
All the mob guys from the movie casino would be there on a regular basis, and I got to

67
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
know them.

68
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,260
Back to KLVX, I would toil there, do whatever jobs they asked.

69
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,780
About two months later, their anchorman quit, and they had open auditions to be the anchor

70
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,780
of their news guest.

71
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,220
I applied and I got it, and suddenly, less than a year in Las Vegas, I'm anchoring two

72
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,220
newscasts.

73
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,220
It was crazy.

74
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,500
It could never happen again.

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:24,100
And within a year of doing that, KLAS, Bob Stodall, and a guy named Ned Day took notice

76
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,440
of me, invited me to come over, and I've been here ever since.

77
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,740
And in those days, we all did mob stories, like it or not.

78
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,300
Organized crime is part of our city's heritage.

79
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,260
Mob money and mafia muscle put Las Vegas on the map.

80
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,460
There was so much going on.

81
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,940
Every day was a bust, a gaming control board hearing, a trial.

82
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,740
There was always something going on, because it was the start of the push to get rid of them.

83
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:51,060
The Commission has issued an emergency order pursuant to Nevada law, effective immediately

84
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,580
upon service, suspending the license of the Aladdin Hotel.

85
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,340
And of course, because I already knew these guys, I not only had access to law enforcement,

86
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,260
but I could talk to the mob guys, and it was really helpful to me in those former days.

87
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,460
Again, like before the internet was big, was it all just files and paper?

88
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
Sure.

89
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,460
These are mostly crime stories.

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,460
Cold case murder.

91
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,500
Would you do a file for every story, or what was your system?

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,260
People would mail you stuff?

93
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,780
People would mail me stuff almost every day.

94
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,820
People send me little stuff that make me homemade saucers out of tinfoil.

95
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,660
Lots of stickers we had made up when Mystery Wire was first created, my craggy old face.

96
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,160
This was sort of my little nerve center for a long time.

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,920
So you were a popular news anchor, popular investigative reporter.

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,320
How did this UFO thing suddenly come into your life?

99
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,680
It was really a quirk.

100
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,760
Ned Day and Bob Stodall had broken a really big national story.

101
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,980
They had information about a secret plane out in the Nevada desert, and it was invisible

102
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,980
to radar.

103
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,200
That's what our sources had said.

104
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,880
George Knapp's source was this man, John Lear, famed aviator, son of the founder of the Lear

105
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:11,520
and soon to be influential in the conversation on UFOs.

106
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Thanks for being here.

107
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Okay, George.

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,280
To begin with, you're a pilot, an airline pilot, captain.

109
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,520
You have held 17 different world speed records at one time or another.

110
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,600
You're a member of the famous Lear family that all Nevadans are pretty much familiar

111
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
with.

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,880
John Lear had developed the Lear jet, and he had a passion for secret planes.

113
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,080
So he and a group of people, they called them the Interceptors, would go out into the Nevada

114
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,020
desert and would sit outside of Area 51, the Nevada test site, to see what was flying around

115
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,020
in the sky.

116
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,560
You don't sound like the kind of guy who would get hooked up in something that a lot of people

117
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,120
would say is a bunch of nonsense.

118
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,260
No, it's just by coincidence that I got really interested in this about two years ago.

119
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,600
My father saw a UFO, and my brother did.

120
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,720
And one day, John Lear walks into the news station, this is in 1987, with a stack of

121
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,480
documents, UFO documents, and he plops them on Ned Day's desk.

122
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,120
And he says, Ned, this is the biggest story you will ever cover in your life.

123
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,560
It's about a cover-up of massive proportions.

124
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
You're going to become famous.

125
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
You've got to do this story.

126
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,480
He pushes the documents over, and Ned starts reading them.

127
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,720
And he pushes the pile back and he tells Lear, this can't be true.

128
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
If this was true, this UFO cover-up, then I'd already know about it, he says.

129
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,080
I'm eavesdropping, as I tend to do.

130
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,760
And I said, Mr. Lear, let me take a look at that stuff.

131
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:34,640
So I read through it, and at the time, I produced a little talk show, a half-hour public affairs

132
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:43,240
show called On the Record, and it would air on Saturday or Sunday morning at 6 or 7 o'clock.

133
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,680
And I said, John, you want to do this show?

134
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,800
And I put him on, and I just let him go.

135
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,080
I'll give you the bottom line, I'm not trying to sell a book, I'm not trying to promote

136
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
a lecture.

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,840
It's based on what I've come across after intense research in the last year.

138
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,320
And I have found out that the government has retrieved between 10 and 15 factual flying

139
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,520
saucers, three of which have been in perfect condition, one of which they tried to fly.

140
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,480
They have between 30 and 50 alien bodies in cryogenic storage.

141
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,560
We even have the name of the person whose job it is to show these bodies to the heads

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,960
of state and the people who are authorized to see them.

143
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,480
They represent at least five different civilizations.

144
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,120
Okay, you mentioned the saucers and the bodies.

145
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,360
Now what kind of proof do you have that that is true?

146
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
How do you know that?

147
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Well, let me take a look.

148
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,840
Let me read to you first what the Air Force says about the bodies.

149
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,600
First of all, I'm going to read from the Introductory Space Science, Volume 2, Department of Physics,

150
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
United States Air Force.

151
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,960
This is Chapter 13, Unidentified Flying Objects.

152
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,840
Now this is what the Air Force has the students at the Air Force Academy read.

153
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,240
And it says, the most commonly described alien is about three and a half feet tall, has a

154
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,720
round head, arms reaching to or below his knees, and is wearing a silvery space suit

155
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,800
or coveralls.

156
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,840
It blew me away.

157
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,880
It blew away our audience.

158
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,280
I didn't know what to make of it really.

159
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,880
And looking back on the tape of that show, I can see the expressions on my face.

160
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Is this for real?

161
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Yeah.

162
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
This guy making this stuff up?

163
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
He's nuts.

164
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,160
Opening the vault to decades of UFO bomb shows.

165
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,240
April 25, 1964 was the first official communication between our government and the aliens.

166
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,840
I've had my life threatened by them, my wife's life threatened by them.

167
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Revelations.

168
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:38,320
What we've learned this week is that the government has lied to us about UFOs, has withheld information,

169
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,880
has spied on UFO organizations, and has discredited UFO witnesses.

170
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,940
And steps the government may be taking to keep secrets.

171
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,020
The military has been installing secret sensors on public land surrounding the base.

172
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,700
There's your transmitter right there.

173
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,860
Plus we set off to find Area 51 for ourselves.

174
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:03,980
We'll have to turn it off again.

175
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,980
Welcome back, UFOs.

176
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,020
Are they real?

177
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,860
We're talking with John Lear on the subject.

178
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,820
The most commonly described alien is about three and a half feet tall and is wearing

179
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,860
a silvery space suit or coveralls.

180
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,940
I can see the expressions on my face.

181
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,940
Is this for real?

182
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,940
Yeah.

183
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
This guy making this stuff up?

184
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
He's nuts.

185
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Now I'm not making this up.

186
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,940
This is an air for you.

187
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,940
You can pick out an Air Force physics book and read this stuff.

188
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,340
And at the end of the chapter, they go on to say, this leads us to believe in the unpleasant

189
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,420
possibility of alien visitors to our planet, or at least of alien controlled UFOs.

190
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:44,380
Now the picture that we have of the big head that the Air Force describes, this picture

191
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,260
was drawn by an Army surgeon.

192
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,980
These are one of the bodies that was recovered in the famous Roswell incident of 1947.

193
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Tell us about that.

194
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,180
It was the first flying saucer that crashed and was recovered by the Army.

195
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,060
Originally, the Roswell Army Air Base announced it had recovered a flying saucer from a ranch

196
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,540
outside Roswell.

197
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,260
The story made headlines around the world, but hours later, higher up said no, it was

198
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,580
a weather balloon.

199
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,100
Pieces of the balloon were shown to reporters.

200
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,080
Hours later, the officer who first visited the crash site, Major Jesse Marcel, confided

201
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,380
that the weather balloon story was a cover-up.

202
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,900
One thing I was certain of, being familiar with all air activities, that it was not a

203
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,860
weather balloon, nor an aircraft, nor a missile.

204
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,140
It was something else of which we didn't know what it was.

205
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,740
What was shown to reporters wasn't what he found.

206
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,260
The newsmen saw very little of that material, very small portion of it, and none of the

207
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,020
important to you, like these members that had these hieroglyphics or markings on, and

208
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,620
when the general came in, he told me not to say anything, that he would handle it.

209
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,700
Since Marcel's admission, scores of other witnesses have also surfaced.

210
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,220
And one of the surgeons that was responsible for the autopsy drew that picture.

211
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,900
This is an autopsy report, and you said the government goes to great lengths, the Air

212
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,420
Force in particular, to discredit this kind of stuff.

213
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
Where did this come from?

214
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,420
How did you get this?

215
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,740
It came from the private collection of Leonard Stringfield, who was one of the premier researchers.

216
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:17,620
He worked for the Air Force in the early 50s, in a secret project reporting UFOs.

217
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,700
Then as a civilian, he continued his private research, and this is out of his collection.

218
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,420
You think maybe it's a top secret area.

219
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,100
If the Air Force actually does have them, maybe they got him here.

220
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
I'm certain they do.

221
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:39,100
Up at the test site, there's a report that of the three that they got in perfectly good

222
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,860
condition, at least one is up at the test site and has flown, and one was being flown

223
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,740
as of 1981.

224
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
By us?

225
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,740
By us, yeah.

226
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,480
We mentioned at the top of the show that perhaps a breakthrough might be coming, that some

227
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,040
of these people from MJ-12 or from the Project Blue Book who are in on the government's research

228
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,160
and who saw some of this stuff, might be ready to talk.

229
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,440
We got about a minute left, why don't you tell me about that?

230
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:11,000
It's our information that half, part of MJ-12 wants to release, and part of it doesn't.

231
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,280
We're hoping that we can do this, but of course, as researchers, we're not aware of all the

232
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,680
ramifications.

233
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,280
We just know of what we're looking at.

234
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,240
So we would like to see them release it, but we really don't know if they are.

235
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,880
Okay, John Lear, it's been very interesting.

236
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
You keep us posted.

237
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Sure will.

238
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Thank you.

239
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,000
We'll see you next week with more of On the Record.

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,120
And as soon as that aired, I started getting calls, and it didn't stop.

241
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,200
What was the deal with that guy?

242
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Is that for real?

243
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Do you have any more information?

244
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,520
Are you going to do that again?

245
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,280
I realized this topic touches the pulse of the public in a way that I did not understand

246
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,720
and did not appreciate at the time.

247
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,280
I had him back on again the following year, and in between, I started reading about UFOs,

248
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,780
just trying to separate wheat from chaff.

249
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,220
It's a gigantic learning curve, and figuring out what makes sense and what's real is really

250
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,220
hard.

251
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,860
So I tried to educate myself and get ready for that next Lear appearance, and the response

252
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,420
from the public was even bigger.

253
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:14,660
Now, on April 25, 1964, was the first official communication between our government and the

254
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,340
aliens.

255
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,600
Three saucers landed there by pre-arranged agreement.

256
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,680
It was filmed by five high-speed cameras, 68,000 feet of film.

257
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,320
The reason we know this is because in 1972, when they were going to release the first

258
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,520
information about UFOs to the public, a very knowledgeable writer, whose name was Robert

259
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,400
Emanager, was asked by the agency to write a documentary, which he did.

260
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,000
They were going to release this thing, and we had the whole history of the UFOs, and

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,680
the last part of the documentary was the footage of the saucer landing.

262
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,560
In 1973, when they were ready to go, we had Watergate, and they were faced with two problems.

263
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,480
Number one is they didn't think the public could handle two traumatic experiences at

264
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,660
the same time, and number two, they thought that the public would perceive this picture

265
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,040
of aliens and spacecraft as a ploy by Nixon to divert the attention from Watergate.

266
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,600
The inevitable result of these charges has been to raise serious questions about the

267
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,360
integrity of the White House itself.

268
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,760
So they shelved it.

269
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,760
The documentary actually came out, it was narrated by Rod Serling, but instead of the

270
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,000
real footage, they had drawings of these flying saucer landing, and they said, Rod

271
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Serling says,

272
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,400
Let's look at an incident that might happen in the future, or perhaps could have happened

273
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,920
already.

274
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:45,920
According to John Lear, this is the only snippet of real UFO footage that aired in the documentary.

275
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,000
Do you believe, in part, that the movies, E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind,

276
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,560
were not entirely just the creative products of some Hollywood director, that maybe there's

277
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
more to that?

278
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Why don't you explain?

279
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,400
They were carefully guided by representatives from MJ-12, who is this organization that

280
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,800
is in charge of the cover-up, in order to get us ready for the release of the information

281
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,160
that there are indeed aliens.

282
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:22,720
Unfortunately, they're not so benevolent, so they made probably one of the most disastrous

283
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,480
mistakes when E.T. was put out.

284
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:33,640
At that time was before we discovered what I call the double cross, or the grand deception,

285
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,360
and they were trying to get us used to the benevolent little creatures, but that isn't

286
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
the case.

287
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,280
I had him on a third time in 1988, and he hinted at the time that he met this guy who

288
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,480
was trying to get hired at this place out in the Nevada desert, and that he thought

289
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,640
it was going to be a really big deal.

290
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,760
John Lear's new friend not only knew what was going on out there, he knew when and where

291
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,240
to look to the skies.

292
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,480
Good evening, this is John Lear.

293
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,720
In March 1989, he accompanied a small group to the outskirts of Area 51.

294
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,040
Three Wednesday nights in a row, they watched a glowing disk rise above the mountains over

295
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,760
Papoose Dry Lake.

296
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,680
The person who initiated the desert outing was a scientist who claimed he worked at Papoose

297
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,240
on flying saucers.

298
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:28,880
That scientist was interviewed live on television in May 1989 from Lear's driveway.

299
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,400
What George didn't know was that this would be even bigger than John Lear.

300
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,800
It turned out to change everything we know about the government and UFOs.

301
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,240
Coming up, the bombshell interview that opened the floodgates.

302
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
What about aliens?

303
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,480
Any of those up there at Groom Lake?

304
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,800
I really want to steer away from that right now.

305
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,440
The phones go crazy.

306
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,040
I get pulled off the set, the general manager comes back, what the hell was that?

307
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Is this for real?

308
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
What did you just do?

309
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,080
And what was discovered out in the middle of the Nevada desert.

310
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,360
By the way, that's Area 51 out there.

311
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Oh, is it?

312
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Yeah.

313
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
That's Groom Lake.

314
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
That's Papoose Lake.

315
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:20,080
In the spring of 1989, I'm anchoring the 5 o'clock news, and we would have a five-minute

316
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,640
nightly interview segment, a live interview with somebody on the set.

317
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,800
Our guest on this particular day canceled at a last minute.

318
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,920
I'm thinking, who could we get to fill this?

319
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
I called up John Lear.

320
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,440
I said, you said you had a guy who was going to work out there and maybe work on flying

321
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,800
saucers in the desert.

322
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Can we talk to him?

323
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,040
I don't even know his name.

324
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,360
We put a silhouette, we created a silhouette interview.

325
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,480
He used a pseudonym, and out the story comes.

326
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:51,280
Well, there's several, actually nine flying saucers, flying disks that are out there of

327
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,400
extraterrestrial origin.

328
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,680
And they're basically being dismantled.

329
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,640
Some are, well, in various stages of completion, built from other parts, and they're being

330
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,680
test flown and basically just analyzed.

331
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,480
You say there's nine saucers.

332
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,480
How are those tests going?

333
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,020
As far as what?

334
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,440
As far as whether they're successful and that sort of thing.

335
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,280
Oh, well, some of them are 100% intact and operate perfectly.

336
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,240
The other ones are being taken apart.

337
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,960
I was involved mainly in propulsion and the power source.

338
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,520
Basically, as far as I can remember, about half of them do operate and the other half

339
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:40,280
are just being torn down basically to analyze the components to them.

340
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,800
Where did we get these saucers?

341
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
How did they come into the hands of the government?

342
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,400
I haven't the slightest idea and you have to understand the information is very compartmentalized

343
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,880
and I was only allowed information that pertained particularly to what I was involved in.

344
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,760
But I mean, couldn't our government have made them as opposed to getting them from some

345
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
alien beings?

346
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,240
Totally impossible.

347
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,640
The propulsion system is a gravity propulsion system.

348
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,520
The power source is an antimatter reactor.

349
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,320
This technology does not exist at all.

350
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,560
He said, well, this is technology that we do not have.

351
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,240
We were reverse engineering it and I didn't know what that meant.

352
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,880
I'd never heard of it before.

353
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,200
Taking it apart to figure out how it works and to see how we might either be able to

354
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,600
duplicate the technology or defeat it if we had to fight against it.

355
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,880
In fact, one of the reasons that I'm going forward with this information, it's not only

356
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,720
a crime against the American people, it's a crime against the scientific community,

357
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,880
which I've been part of for some time, who are actively trying to duplicate these systems,

358
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,680
yet they are in existence now and basically in the hands of the government.

359
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,680
What would happen to you if the government learned that you were giving us this information?

360
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
Anything could happen.

361
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
I don't know.

362
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,480
It's, I haven't the slightest idea.

363
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,480
You said you were referred to getting into trouble.

364
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,760
Have you had some repercussions already?

365
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah, I've been threatened with being charged with espionage.

366
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,760
I've had my life threatened by them, my wife's life threatened by them.

367
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,560
And I mean, I don't know where else you can go from there.

368
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,440
Will the government ever tell us about the testing and do the Soviets know about this?

369
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,920
The Soviets were involved at some specific point.

370
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,440
They were kicked out of the program rather abruptly in the middle.

371
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,960
I don't know why that was or what happened.

372
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,400
They're not very happy about it and as far as them revealing it, I'm sure they have

373
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,520
every intention of claiming that all the technology was developed here and it was absolutely not.

374
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,840
If the Soviets were kicked out of this testing program, why wouldn't they tell us about this?

375
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
I have no idea.

376
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,760
They weren't allowed all the information.

377
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,240
Apparently they had some and we were basically trading with them.

378
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,080
As far as whether they have disks or not, I don't know.

379
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,040
I don't even know if they had knowledge that we actually had any there.

380
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,320
But they were involved to some extent and I don't know how much.

381
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
What about aliens?

382
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,000
Any of those up there at Groom Lake?

383
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,760
I really want to steer away from that right now.

384
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,040
Is the Star Wars program in any way related to what's going on up there?

385
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,440
I know some people believe that maybe we're building Star Wars for something other than

386
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,680
the Soviets.

387
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:25,600
This directly taps out of the Star Wars budget, which is very hard to follow because it requires

388
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,440
huge amounts of money.

389
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,720
It taps out of a lot of other places too that would be very hard to track down, but yes,

390
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,400
Star Wars is directly related to it.

391
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,840
The United States Navy is the part of the government that really maintains control over that.

392
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,240
Well, we want to thank you for joining us.

393
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Pretty interesting stuff you've got to say.

394
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Thank you.

395
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Thank you, sir.

396
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,120
More news in just a moment.

397
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,800
I mean, we couldn't get away with it now.

398
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,840
We'd done no vetting at all, had no business doing it.

399
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,160
He tells me this story, the phones go crazy.

400
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,080
I get pulled off the set and pulled into the news director's office.

401
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,560
The general manager comes back, what the hell was that?

402
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Is this for real?

403
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
What did you just do?

404
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,640
I said, look, I don't know if it's real.

405
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
I have no idea.

406
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,280
We just wanted to do an interview, but I'm going to find out.

407
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Coming up, a concealed test site now exposed to the world.

408
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,560
Since those stories, tens of thousands of people have beaten a path out there to look

409
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,960
around in the sky and to see whatever is flying around.

410
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,440
But wait until you see what else George uncovered at Area 51, things the government didn't want

411
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
exposed.

412
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,560
And right here will be the time delay unit.

413
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:54,080
Well, there's several, actually nine flying saucers, flying disks that are out there of

414
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,080
extraterrestrial origin.

415
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,520
And he tells this story and out in the desert, they built this facility into the side of

416
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,560
a mountain disguised it to look like desert so it can be seen from the sky.

417
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,720
And in that facility, he said, were these nine hangars built side by side, and each

418
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,400
one of those hangars was a flying saucer that came from somewhere else.

419
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,200
So how do you know they're not ours?

420
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,600
He said, well, this is technology that we do not have.

421
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,520
Area 51, a now well-known military base that is synonymous with UFOs, but it's still shrouded

422
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,480
in mystery to this day, with the exception of what George Knapp uncovered there.

423
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,680
The military now admits what the world already knew.

424
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,560
It has a, quote, operating location near Groom Lake, but the Pentagon says the base

425
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,840
has no name.

426
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,400
By denying the base has a name, the Defense Department hoped to forestall a lawsuit filed

427
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,960
on behalf of base workers, workers who claimed they were exposed to toxic chemicals while

428
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,520
working at Groom Lake.

429
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,080
Despite official denials, the common name for the base has always been Area 51.

430
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,480
We recently found this 1967 government map which lists that name.

431
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,600
Subsequent maps left the name blank.

432
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,600
To those who suggest that Area 51 has been shut down or moved somewhere else, there are

433
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,680
a few points that are kind of tough to explain.

434
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,720
For example, the bus filled with employees that comes in and out of the base several

435
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,120
times each day.

436
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,640
It's still there, all right, still closely guarded, but not much of a secret anymore.

437
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,040
By the way, that's Area 51 up there.

438
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Oh, is it?

439
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah.

440
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
That's Groom Lake.

441
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
That's Papoose Lake.

442
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,780
So where is, like, where is it?

443
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,600
Can you see it on a map at all, any of the buildings, or is this all pre-…

444
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,520
You know, you can see some of that right there, and that's the runway, and those are some

445
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,700
of the buildings from when that photo was taken.

446
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,240
There is an entrance to Area 51 from here, and we've been up there to do stories on

447
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,400
other matters, and the Department of Energy staff, though it's funny, they would just

448
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:58,240
say, just don't look that way, just look this way, and of course I look that way.

449
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,680
Area 51 is about 150 miles outside of Las Vegas.

450
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,400
We're on our way there now on a highway actually called the Extraterrestrial Highway,

451
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,600
and this is a route that George has taken dozens and dozens of times over his career.

452
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
It's not exactly an easy place to find.

453
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,880
You can't just Google Area 51 and figure out where the entrances are.

454
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
You sort of have to know what to look for.

455
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:39,960
Okay, so we made it out here to Area 51.

456
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,160
It is so eerie and quiet out here.

457
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:49,000
We had to go down this long, windy dirt road off the main drag, the Extraterrestrial Highway,

458
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,660
to get out here to the entrance.

459
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,440
You really cannot get very close behind me.

460
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,920
About a quarter of a mile is one of the guarded entrances.

461
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
There's barbed wire.

462
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
There's armed guards there.

463
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,080
We're pretty sure that they definitely know we're here.

464
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,600
Trip after trip through the Nevada desert, George broadcasted the closest photos we've

465
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,840
ever seen of Area 51.

466
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,360
These photos, never before shown in public, are about as close as anyone will ever come

467
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,760
to seeing what the place looks like again.

468
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,040
The dry bed of Groom Lake, corrugated metal buildings, a three-mile long runway, and some

469
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,440
highly sophisticated radar and detection equipment.

470
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,320
It's been known by many names over the years, Dreamland, the Ranch, the Skunk Works.

471
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,160
If ever there was a place to test a secret new technology, this is it, and that's exactly

472
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,520
what's been done here for decades.

473
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,160
Area 51 is where Francis Gary Powers and the other U-2 pilots were trained in the 50s,

474
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,440
and where the U-2 itself was developed.

475
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,480
The SR-71 spy planes that spotted Soviet missiles in Cuba in the early 60s were also developed

476
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
at 51.

477
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:58,040
51 is where stealth technology was nurtured, where Star Wars devices are still tested,

478
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,480
and where all manner of CIA monkey business has been plotted and refined.

479
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,600
The CIA built it for use in the U-2 program.

480
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,320
This is rare footage taken from Groom Lake of some early tests.

481
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,920
Current warning signs indicate it's an Air Force facility, but all branches of the military

482
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,260
have used it, along with most major defense contractors.

483
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:22,460
The common thread has always been EG&G, which has had the contract to operate the facility

484
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,860
since the beginning.

485
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,140
What goes on there today?

486
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,140
Plenty.

487
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,660
Highly placed sources say the base employs about 1,800 people.

488
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,540
One of their main missions is to evaluate Russian defense systems, equipment that's

489
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,120
in the hands of unfriendly nations like Iran and Iraq.

490
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,380
Another program at 51 is the stealth helicopter, although the technology isn't far along.

491
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,540
As for flying saucers, the military admits it has built these unmanned craft.

492
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,560
It may not be a coincidence that the Air Force's only unmanned aerial vehicle squadron is

493
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,860
based at Nellis.

494
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,020
Whatever is flying around out there still attracts visitors from all over the world.

495
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,140
It's still newsworthy in Europe?

496
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,140
Yes, yes.

497
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,940
No, also in Europe, Air 51 is well known.

498
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,260
And this is all closed off, this whole area?

499
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,700
Yeah, it's a secure facility.

500
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,060
I mean, they used to occasionally have tours out there, but it's kind of hard to get in

501
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,060
there now.

502
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,460
Do people live out there at all, or are they all commuted?

503
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,020
They have a little town where people will stay for a short period of time.

504
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,460
Our report set off a UFO stampede that has yet to diminish.

505
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,620
Tens of thousands of people have trekked into the desert hoping to see a UFO, inspiring

506
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,500
the extraterrestrial highway and creating a new industry for Tiny Rachel, which has

507
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,960
become a UFO merchandise center and a hub for saucer watchers.

508
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,840
It probably peaked in 97, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Roswell, because we

509
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,960
had media out here every day.

510
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,240
The hype has been good to Rachel, but has given the military fits.

511
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,880
Their secret base was no longer secret, and security officers had numerous run-ins over

512
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,480
the years with over-exuberant alien hunters who crossed the line or came close to it.

513
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,720
Base security resorted to high-tech spy gear, even low-flying choppers, to keep the saucer

514
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
nuts out.

515
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,680
There's really nothing out here.

516
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,280
It's very, very remote surrounding Area 51.

517
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,560
We've heard stories that people have actually found surveillance equipment in the brush

518
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
out here.

519
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,320
The only strange thing that we've seen is there's this black wire that runs all along

520
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:33,560
the perimeter road outside the base.

521
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,320
George first revealed the lengths the government appeared to be taking to keep Area 51 a guarded

522
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,680
secret, profiling a citizen whistleblower on a mission to expose it.

523
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,680
I've found 31 or 32 of them so far.

524
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,240
Retired astronomer and desert rat Chuck Clark has a new hobby.

525
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,240
He's prowled the hills and deserts of Lincoln County for several years now.

526
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,560
Over the past few months, he's discovered the military has been installing secret sensors

527
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,080
on public land surrounding the base.

528
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,880
Using a frequency counter, he can tell when his vehicle has tripped the sensor.

529
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,800
When that happens, he looks for the hard-to-spot wire atop the device.

530
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,560
This is our sensor right here.

531
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,080
Then he digs them up, takes pictures and puts them back.

532
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:24,080
There's your transmitter right there and we'll come around here and right here will be the

533
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,960
time delay unit and you'll see it's clearly marked U.S. Government property.

534
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,480
Clark isn't a terrorist or spy but is angered that hikers, four-wheelers or photographers,

535
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,600
anyone who uses the backcountry is being monitored by the military on public land miles

536
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,280
from the boundary of the base, a boundary which is clearly marked by ominous signs.

537
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,200
It's a little overkill in my opinion.

538
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,600
They have about a 25-mile buffer zone out here and it's all terrain like this.

539
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,600
It gets rougher as you go.

540
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,420
Why they have to put stuff outside the line really escapes me.

541
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,240
During the I-team's visit last week, two sensors were located and base security wrote down

542
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,840
the plate numbers of our vehicles.

543
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,800
We returned five days ago and drove to the rear entrance of Area 51.

544
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,400
Three days after our visit, FBI agents working with Air Force Intelligence and the Joint

545
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,760
Terrorism Task Force raided Clark's home in Rachel and seized photos, records and his

546
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
computer.

547
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,000
Is it legal for anyone to touch military sensors hidden on public land?

548
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,120
The government doesn't think so, although Clark hasn't been charged with anything.

549
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,280
Is the military trying to silence this outback gadfly?

550
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:40,440
They're sort of paranoid about this location and I don't see why.

551
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,880
After those stories, Area 51 was changed forever.

552
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,280
It created so many headaches for the camo dudes and the people that patrol Area 51 and

553
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,160
try to keep the public out.

554
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,760
The so-called camo dudes have assumed legendary status.

555
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,600
Oddly, despite all the security headaches, the alien lore has seemingly been embraced

556
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,920
by the military.

557
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,840
Base personnel are regular customers at the alien.

558
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,400
I let them come here and have a quiet time.

559
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,680
I don't try and get into their own personal stuff.

560
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,800
I don't want that because if we started to pry, they'd back away.

561
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,000
A lot of the patches and caps and things, you know, probably half the guys on the base

562
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,360
out there have them.

563
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,080
We know guys that work there that have come in and bought things to take out there because

564
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,400
they don't have any official things.

565
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,660
Since those stories, tens of thousands of people have beaten a path out there to look

566
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,300
around in the sky and to see whatever is flying around, UFOs or secret planes.

567
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,220
Every major news organization in the world has beaten a path to Area 51's door.

568
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,820
A lot of them made fun of me and fun of the whole alien scenario, but they've all been

569
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,820
out there.

570
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,100
It's one thing to make fun of our stories about Area 51, but you've never been out there

571
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,860
sitting in the desert night after night as we've done.

572
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,140
You haven't interviewed the witnesses.

573
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,380
You haven't dodged the security guards and coyotes and filed the FOIA request.

574
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,540
You haven't done it.

575
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,500
You're bringing up retaliation against the Area 51 whistleblower.

576
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,300
It's as if someone has made him disappear.

577
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,500
Well, they're trying to make me a non-person.

578
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,700
And all these years later, what secrets does Area 51 still hold?

579
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,700
Something's out there.

580
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
We went to find out.

581
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
Light this or nothing.

582
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:32,420
Despite the speculation, no one who knew Area 51 from the inside ever talked publicly

583
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,820
about the saucer story.

584
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:41,740
Well, there's several, actually nine flying saucers, flying disks that are out there of

585
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,700
extraterrestrial origin.

586
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,700
He tells me this story.

587
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,580
I mean, we couldn't get away with it now.

588
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,980
We'd done no vetting at all.

589
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,260
I don't even know his name.

590
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,340
I get pulled off the set and pulled into the news director's office.

591
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,740
The general manager comes back.

592
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,740
What the hell was that?

593
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,740
Is this for real?

594
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,740
What did you just do?

595
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,260
I said, look, I don't know if it's real.

596
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,260
I have no idea.

597
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,620
We just wanted to do an interview, but I'm going to find out.

598
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:08,380
The live interview with the shadowy Dennis drew international attention.

599
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:15,020
Actually, nine flying saucers, flying disks.

600
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,620
Despite numerous inquiries and feelers, Dennis has remained anonymous until now.

601
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,980
So it all, the news director and I arranged to meet this guy.

602
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,620
We went up to Lear's house.

603
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,220
It was sort of an uncomfortable situation in the beginning because Lear wanted to control

604
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,220
the whole thing.

605
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,660
He wouldn't tell us the guy's name, but the guy had signed a guest book at the entrance

606
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,780
to Lear's home, so I already saw his name.

607
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,780
I knew what it was.

608
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,220
His real name is Robert Lazard, a young scientist with eclectic interests.

609
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,260
The choice of Dennis was an inside joke.

610
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,240
He says that's the name of his superior at Groom Lake.

611
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,700
It wasn't a joke to Dennis.

612
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,700
He called right after and he said, you have any idea what we're going to do to you now?

613
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,620
And I said, well, no, he hung up the phone.

614
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,220
Lazard's story is by any standards fantastic.

615
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,100
He says he's telling it in order to protect himself.

616
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,260
We go in there and we start talking to the guy who turned out to be Bob Lazard.

617
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,940
He told us his life story, where he'd gone to school, where he'd worked before, and some

618
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,520
of what he had seen out there.

619
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,680
He says he was hired to work at an area called S4, which is a few miles south of Groom Lake.

620
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,680
At S4, he says, are flying saucers, anti-matter reactors, and other working examples of technology

621
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,920
that is seemingly beyond human capabilities.

622
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Right.

623
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
This came from somewhere else.

624
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,400
I mean, as bizarre as that is to believe, but I mean, it's there.

625
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,500
I saw it.

626
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:35,480
I know what the current state of the art is in physics, and it can't be done.

627
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,360
After three or four hours of grilling him, we look at each other and go, holy crap.

628
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,760
What if this is real?

629
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
What if this is true?

630
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,080
This would be the biggest story in history.

631
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,400
But it's also perilous for us if we go after it, and it blows up in our face.

632
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,160
It could destroy not only my reputation and his, but that of KLAS too.

633
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,240
Checking out Lazard's credentials proved to be a difficult task.

634
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,060
He says he earned degrees in physics and electronics, but the schools we contacted say they've never

635
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,060
heard of him.

636
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:08,480
He also said he worked as a physicist at Los Alamos National Lab, where he experimented

637
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,240
with one of the world's largest particle beam accelerators, a half-mile-long behemoth

638
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,160
capable of generating 700 million volts.

639
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,040
Los Alamos officials told us they had no records of a Robert Lazard ever working there.

640
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,120
They were either mistaken or were lying.

641
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,440
A 1982 phone book from the lab lists Lazard right there among the other scientists and

642
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
technicians.

643
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,440
A 1982 clipping from the Los Alamos newspaper profiled Lazard and his interest in jet cars.

644
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,640
A 1982 mentioned his employment at the lab as a physicist.

645
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,400
We called Los Alamos again, an exasperated official told us he still had no records on

646
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Lazard.

647
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,760
EG&G, which is where Lazard says he was interviewed for the job at S4, also has no records.

648
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,480
It's as if someone has made him disappear.

649
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,680
Well, they're trying to make me a non-person.

650
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,960
Explain, you called where?

651
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,520
Well, the schools that I went to, the hospital that I was born at, past job, and essentially

652
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,240
nothing comes up with my name in it.

653
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,280
He smiles but out of futility, knowing the whole thing must sound ridiculous.

654
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,920
I don't think there's any secret flying saucers at Area 51.

655
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,280
I suspect that there was something like that out there at one point because of people that

656
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,200
I know have seen it.

657
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,560
So where would they be now?

658
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,280
Well, either they moved them further out into the Nevada test site.

659
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,100
If you're out there at night, you will see these pockets of light that pop up in the

660
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,320
darkness at places that do not exist.

661
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Something's out there.

662
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,480
After the sun goes down, it is a different vibe out here.

663
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,360
It's almost totally pitch black.

664
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,680
If we switch to the night vision, you can see better out here.

665
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,280
I've never really experienced anything quite like it.

666
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
There's no city lights.

667
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,280
The military base, Area 51, is behind me.

668
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,500
It's just wide open.

669
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,600
The noises are interesting because it's obviously nature noises.

670
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,440
You can hear the crickets.

671
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,640
But then we've also heard military aircraft for the last probably hour or so.

672
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,080
Obviously doing some kind of training missions, you can hear the planes flying overhead.

673
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,680
You can't always see them.

674
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,720
Sometimes there's flashing lights.

675
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Sometimes there's not.

676
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,640
There's a movie right there on the left.

677
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,040
See it on the left side of the frame.

678
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,800
And there's also been some other lights that have sort of popped up over the mountains

679
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,560
and also in the brush.

680
00:39:52,720 --> 00:40:02,560
The light just turned off again.

681
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,240
Oh, there's a plane.

682
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,600
It's true, what I have seen is true.

683
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:14,560
I don't know about the big story, where they came from, what they're like.

684
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,360
But certainly these crafts came from another, not just another planet, another solar system

685
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,360
entirely, extremely far away.

686
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,480
And they're here.

687
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,880
What we've learned this week is that the government has lied to us about UFOs, has withheld information,

688
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,400
has spied on UFO organizations, and has discredited UFO witnesses.

689
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,960
Now none of this proves that UFOs are real, but it does indicate a disturbing level of

690
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,560
interest, government interest in the subject.

691
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,360
If the government will tell us what it knows, what about science?

692
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,560
Well, science is supposed to stand for the investigation of the unexplained, not the

693
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,980
explanation of the uninvestigated.

694
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,900
And so far, science has avoided the subject like a plague.

695
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,740
It's like what Roy Neary, the main character in the film, Close Encounters, had to say.

696
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,940
All we want to know is what's going on.

697
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,700
Thirty-six years later, and we still don't know any answers to the big question.

698
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,700
Next week.

699
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,000
I wanted to tell you a story.

700
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,280
It's about one of the adventures that we had.

701
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Straight down out of the sky.

702
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
What if this is real?

703
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
What if this is true?

704
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,280
This would be the biggest story in history.

705
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,280
The evidence suggests we're being visited by some form of intelligence.

706
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
So they were definitely listening to me.

707
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
They were listening to my phone.

708
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,280
You can't imagine what pressure these people are under to cover this stuff up.

709
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
You can feel it.

710
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
The eyes are on you.

711
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
This is serious.

712
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,280
It's been serious for a long time, and it's been ignored for way too long.

713
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,280
If you're right, everyone has been lied to.

714
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Yeah, there's a sophisticated disinformation campaign targeting the U.S. populace, which

715
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
is extremely unethical and immoral.

716
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,280
So you knew that the U.S. government was funding a secret program.

717
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,280
The keepers of the secrets are better at their job than people like us are at ours,

718
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,280
and they are not going to let this thing go easily.

719
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,280
Thank you for watching.
