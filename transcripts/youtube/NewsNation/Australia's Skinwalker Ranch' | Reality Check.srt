00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Hello, so the myth has long been that in order to stay young and beautiful looking, we need

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,040
special wrinkle creams.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,320
According to Dr John Lakey, the world renowned Beverly Hills beauty expert, most of those

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,480
wrinkle fixes on the market are nothing more than glorified moisturizers.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,320
So recently Dr Lakey has focused his attention away from mainstream cosmetic practice to

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:35,560
pursue a revolutionary anti-aging technology breakthrough, one that some experts say could

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,520
empty the wallets of the cosmetics industry.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,400
His personal clients have dubbed his new do-it-yourself technique the age rewinder method because

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,840
it can take years or even decades off your appearance in under two minutes, I could do

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,240
with some of this stuff.

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,520
Dr Lakey has released a step-by-step video to the public, free and uninterrupted, where

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,400
he outlines exactly how to use this simple solution from home.

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,440
The video's racked up over 2.3 million views and counting.

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:14,320
So far thousands of women, what about the men, are reporting they look decades younger.

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:24,160

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,680
There is one thing that Dr Lakey asks from his viewers, if watching this video helps

18
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,440
you look and feel younger than you have in years, then please share this video with your

19
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,160
friends and loved ones.

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,680
Together we have the power to make as many women reclaim a youthful look as possible.

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,280
Hello and welcome back to Reality Check.

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,600
So I've had a long interest in the northwest of Australia.

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:28,040
I start my book In Plain Sight at the place called the Harold E. Holt Naval Communication

26
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,600
Station, which is a very mysterious former United States facility, now an Australian

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,040
run facility that actually communicates with American nuclear attack submarines in the

28
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,640
Indian and Pacific Oceans using VLF, very low frequency radio waves.

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,000
And the thing about this whole area is that it's been a hotspot for a very long time of,

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,280
how does one say this politely, anomalous objects.

31
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:05,000
And adjacent just to the east of the Northwest Cape is a place called the Pilbara Desert,

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,760
a gigantic squave of Western Australia, rolling red desert country that to the Aboriginal people

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,800
there is beautiful and also deeply mysterious.

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,360
When the first settlers came to as colonists to Australia in the 18th century, they were

35
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:34,200
puzzled by what became known as Min Min lights, orbs, glowing spherical orbs drifting through

36
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,920
the art black.

37
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,400
And the fascinating thing about it is that a hundred and something years on,

38
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,080
we still have no answer to that mystery.

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,640
Well, our guest today is Dr. Andrew Morgan, and he's a Kiwi like myself.

40
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,520
And he's also a person who's got extraordinary scientific qualifications.

41
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:04,840
And he's taken a very, very close interest in the whole subject of UAP's anomalous phenomena

42
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,960
across that part of Western Australia.

43
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,920
And what is uncovered is actually quite fascinating.

44
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,720
It's a poke in the eye for those people who constantly say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

45
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,240
if there really are UFOs and NHI, why do they only ever show themselves over cities in America?

46
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,520
And that's not true at all.

47
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,160
I just don't think we've been properly looking.

48
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,720
And I often think the only way we're ever going to crack this mystery is by scienceing it.

49
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,000
And that's what Andrew is doing.

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,760
He's a scientist.

51
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,400
He's a teacher in science at a school in Western Australia.

52
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,560
But he's got a very illustrious background in studying of science.

53
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,480
He went to the University of Auckland, did an undergraduate degree in zoology.

54
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,760
Completed his paddy dive master qualifications.

55
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,720
Moved to Queensland in Australia in 1995.

56
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,280
And did a master's in marine science at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.

57
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,160
Returned to New Zealand at the end of 1998.

58
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,040
And did a PhD in environmental and marine science at the University of Auckland.

59
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,600
He was commissioned as an officer in the New Zealand Navy.

60
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,680
Did his basic training, bridge watchkeeping and vessel safety over two years.

61
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,640
Joined the active reserves in 2007.

62
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,120
Taught marine studies at the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic in Tauranga in New Zealand for

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,080
five years.

64
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,760
While also consulting to the fisheries and aquaculture industry.

65
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,400
And he moved very sensibly to Australia in 2012 with his family.

66
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,120
And he consulted in the offshore oil and gas industry for five years.

67
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,960
As an environmental advisor in exploration, drilling, planning and approvals.

68
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,440
And he's now the honorable profession of teaching in science.

69
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,200
Presume Andrew, is that correct?

70
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,600
Yes, thanks Ross.

71
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,680
Yes, career science teacher.

72
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,480
So I've been 30 years in science now and back into the teaching profession again.

73
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,320
Now, the thing I find very brave of you to admit because it's very controversial for

74
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,520
a scientist is that as well as being a scientist who's endeavouring to study anomalous phenomenon.

75
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,080
Ever since you were a child, you've been what is politely called an experiencer.

76
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,160
You believe that you have had encounters with NHI with a non-human intelligence.

77
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,200
Can you tell me about that?

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,120
Yeah, that's a lifetime experience.

79
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,760
And I'm very careful about the vocabulary I use as a scientist.

80
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,560
And I've written a book on it now too, which has made me go back through my life and look

81
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,760
at all these patterns and occurrences with entity interactions and all the common vocabulary.

82
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:47,320
Dreams, visions, astral projection, by location, and that sort of phenomena that no one ever talks

83
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,480
about because of the stigma attached to it.

84
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,960
What I wanted to do was say, look, here's a career scientist, 30 years in science, wants

85
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,600
to understand more about how this has impacted his life.

86
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,560
I mean, look at Professor Gary Nolan, for example.

87
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,720
He's an experiencer as well.

88
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,520
So there's a lot of these people very high up in their professions coming out and talking

89
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,160
about this now.

90
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,280
And I think we need to have a conversation about understanding how this impacts people's

91
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,960
lives and what it all means.

92
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,160
So what does it all mean?

93
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,640
What were the kind of experiences you had?

94
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,840
Take me back to some of the earliest experiences you had as a child.

95
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,280
As a child, I'd say at seven and nine years old, I had, I suppose it's a typical childhood

96
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,840
experience of what they call little people in your bedroom that I had twice when I was

97
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,120
seven and when I was nine.

98
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,480
And back then, I've got no concept of what UAP is, what NHI is.

99
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,520
As a child, you don't.

100
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,440
It's just a novel experience, unusual, and then you put it in the back of your mind

101
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,160
through your life.

102
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:00,360
And it's only later on as a teenager where I have these really vivid experiences in my room.

103
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,680
And I've always been able to remember what I do when I'm asleep.

104
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,600
I suppose it's a little bit unusual because I've been able to go back and recount and

105
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:15,320
remember these experiences of being conscious while asleep and out of your body taking places.

106
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:24,680
When I got older and more recently, that turned into even craft entity interactions as well.

107
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,960
So you've actually, you believe, you believe you're a classic abductee.

108
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,240
You've been taken from your bedroom at night and taken somewhere else to a craft, perhaps.

109
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,240
Yeah, because I did a bit of research on this, because I didn't understand it myself,

110
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,320
because there's the physical phenomenon of that, that you read a lot about.

111
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,400
But then there seemed to be some connection with consciousness, and people are talking

112
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,840
about how consciousness is not your character, and that can be separated from your body physically.

113
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,360
So I've gone more down that avenue in researching and talking to people about how that works.

114
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,480
So that part of you can be taken places and then you come back.

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,360
So science it for me.

116
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,960
You're the scientist.

117
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,400
You're the guy who works on the kind of empirical scientific method.

118
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,760
You believe clearly that what you've experienced ever since you were a child

119
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,880
is real, that it's not some kind of hallucination, some kind of psychosis.

120
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,360
Why do you believe it's real?

121
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,520
What is it that has given you that confidence that you're dealing with something that is,

122
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,240
in fact, non-human intelligence, NHI?

123
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:46,360
I suppose the confidence comes from much maturity in thinking over 30 years in science

124
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,280
and understanding the science of consciousness, because it's repeatable.

125
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
The thing is, is it measurable?

126
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Yes, it's repeatable, and there are common themes through your life around the types

127
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,560
of experiences and visions, and even places that you seem to be in, and circumstances,

128
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,520
whether that's, they call it flying dreams, and they can often be in the same place or

129
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,120
the same circumstances.

130
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,040
There's interaction with, sometimes that can be interaction with a craft.

131
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,280
And I kind of, in my book, I classify them into different experiences.

132
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,160
Normal dream processing, which I've read about.

133
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,000
You're processing what happens during the day.

134
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,480
You may or may not remember that.

135
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,360
Then there's visions, which they can be precognition of something that hasn't happened.

136
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:49,560
Then you've got your outer body and astral projection, which is going places.

137
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,800
And then from there, the other one that I've come across is the interaction in your room at night,

138
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,800
where you seem to be, I suppose they call it paralysis, sleep paralysis,

139
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,640
and something's going on.

140
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,320
There's a presence in the room.

141
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,040
You can't move.

142
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,760
And what I tried to understand is fear.

143
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,640
There's a lot of talk in consciousness studies about overcoming the fear of something that

144
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,720
you don't know, and that once you can seek to understand it, you have more freedom to interact.

145
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,000
And I've found that in my older years, I've got more freedom in these circumstances to question,

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,080
to interact, and to ask what's going on.

147
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,240
Is it hard to speak about it?

148
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,120
I mean, there's a lot of stigma associated with saying that you've been abducted,

149
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,000
or that you've had interactions with NHI.

150
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,880
Are you concerned about blowback for talking like that?

151
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,600
Yes and no, but I think we need to develop the vocabulary because there's so much pop culture

152
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,760
around UFOs and UAP, even the word anti-gravity that was coined, because they didn't understand

153
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,760
what they were looking at.

154
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:05,080
So I try to avoid the pop culture terminology and facilitate a discussion about the science

155
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,880
behind it all, because I believe there's a science that connects all of this from UAPs to UFOs

156
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,880
to consciousness studies to experiences and what they experience.

157
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,920
And if you go back to ancient history, the ancients certainly document a lot of this

158
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,960
stuff and had a deep knowledge of it from what I can gather.

159
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,520
So we need to have these conversations.

160
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,440
You know, the thing I love most of all is that your mission, if you like,

161
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,160
took you to one of my favorite bits of desert.

162
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,880
It's beautiful country, the Pilbara Desert.

163
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,440
And I think this all started to really happen for you, didn't it?

164
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,160
When you were at a place called Newman, which is a mining town in the middle of the Pilbara Desert.

165
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,240
Yeah, that's right.

166
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,600
About five years ago, I took the opportunity to teach up there in science in that town.

167
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,280
And that's when things did take off by myself up there coming back to Perth and the holidays

168
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,840
to family.

169
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:07,400
But I had the opportunity to go camping out there and also talk to Indigenous people

170
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,480
and locals at the pub and all that.

171
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,200
And once you get to know people, they say, oh, some strange things happened up here.

172
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,080
And there's some very interesting Dreamtime stories as well.

173
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,240
And because at the time I was writing a novel series, which places reverse engineered UFO

174
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,560
technology in the deep sea mining industry, I was researching the topic.

175
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,840
And I went camping in Karajini with a telescope.

176
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,600
And I was looking around at the night sky.

177
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,560
And I just had the sense that there's a lot more to see than just the light spectrum,

178
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,680
the visual light spectrum.

179
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,640
And I need some more gear.

180
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,880
So I went and thought, I'm going to invest in some infrared digital camera.

181
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,600
And then so round two of my camping trip, I set up to do what I was going to do at night

182
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,360
and tested my film and that.

183
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,360
And then after dusk, I was filming the sky and then the horizon.

184
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,200
And what do you know?

185
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,640
As you've said, orbs appeared in my field of view.

186
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,040
So let's talk to one of those images.

187
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,200
There's a beautiful image that you've sent me on video that you captured of.

188
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,000
It almost looks like a sun.

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,440
It's a solid white spherical object moving very slowly, tracking past trees,

190
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,080
presumably right in front of your campsite.

191
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,960
And it moves across open sky, across trees again, and then disappears out of sight.

192
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,280
Was that one of your first classic sightings of the spherical orbs that you see in the outback?

193
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,960
Yes, that was before I developed all the field methodology to apply the scientific method.

194
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,320
I was just scanning.

195
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,800
And that was one of the first ones I saw that came right past me where I was filming

196
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,960
on my first trip with those digital binoculars.

197
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,360
And that's what inspired me to get other gear.

198
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,840
So I went and got an electric magnetic field intensity meter, a Geiger counter, and another gear.

199
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,520
And you'll probably talk about this soon, but I got in contact with someone I could trust

200
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,360
to talk about how we develop the methodology in the field

201
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,840
to collect reliable and repeatable data and have a data-driven program of research up there.

202
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,640
So that's what I really like about your work.

203
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,120
You remind me a lot of my friends, John and Jerry Tedesco over in Long Island,

204
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,320
New Jersey, who are currently dealing with a plague of a swarm of drone UAPs of some kind

205
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,360
hovering over the East Coast of the United States.

206
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,440
But they decided in their retirement years that they would science the subject of UAPs.

207
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,680
And boy, did they find some interesting stuff.

208
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,440
And what I love about you is you've done the same and you've teamed up with a guy

209
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,200
called Brian Tyson. What can you tell me about Brian and what role does he serve in your research?

210
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Yeah, that's right. So several years ago, when I had this first field trip, I was hunting around

211
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:09,160
for someone I could liaise with that didn't have an agenda, was not interested in owning any of

212
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,920
what I was doing, but would help out in the capacity that they could.

213
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,800
And in his particular role, he had a personal interest in UAP.

214
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,320
And I hooked up with him through my social media channels because I saw him commenting on UAP.

215
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,080
And I just mentioned that I had this project going on in the Pilbara and was he interested

216
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,760
in looking at a little bit of footage and some images.

217
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,960
And he said, yeah, happy to help or have a look.

218
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,480
And then the relationship involved from there professionally and personally.

219
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:49,720
And he became a key advisor on scientific methods, interpretation, a bit of speculation,

220
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,280
what we need to do to develop the research into the future.

221
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,560
Because I only had a self-funded budget.

222
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,000
So we came up with proposals and funding proposals for how we might expand that into the future.

223
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,600
So he's been quite key in the background and wants to remain in the background due to the nature of

224
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,840
his job and his work, which is fine. But yeah, he's been a key player.

225
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,040
And so one of the things, you've had papers published, haven't you?

226
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,760
We self-published on ResearchGate. That's an interesting story because we did submit to a

227
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:30,280
journal and waited the six to eight weeks for the first lab paper to be reviewed, double blind

228
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,560
review. So one reviewer came back positive, published with minimal corrections.

229
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,040
And the other reviewer just focused on one thing.

230
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,680
And that was the cameras only filming at 30 frames per second. I can demonstrate they're

231
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,200
all artifacts of filming. And so the journal rejected the paper, which means the other two

232
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,880
papers we didn't even get to have reviewed. So what we did is we published them as research

233
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,840
papers through ResearchGate attached to our lab, which we just call EnergyScape.

234
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,880
So they're self-published on ResearchGate now.

235
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,480
Let's deal with that. Firstly, is 30 frames per second filming a

236
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,680
liability for you scientifically improving your thesis?

237
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,840
Yes and no, because we should have a frame rate of about a thousand.

238
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Tedesco and Tedesco will tell you that as well. But to compensate, and I even say this in my

239
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,600
research paper, to compensate, we looked at reliable, repeatable, measurable,

240
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,840
data-driven approaches over multiple times. So going back, doing the same thing over and

241
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,800
over and over again. And so your point is, is that if this was a camera artifact,

242
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,800
it would occur, incidentally, it wouldn't occur pretty much all the time. How often are you seeing

243
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:54,600
these objects that you call orbs and rods? Every time we go to the same site and do the same

244
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:03,240
standard pattern of data collection, the intensity and the numbers of them might vary,

245
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,240
but they're always at that site. We think, talking to Dr. Tyson, that it's connected to

246
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,400
some sort of temporal or interdimensional anomaly at the site as well. But to measure that, we need

247
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,120
more gear. I mean, we've looked at electric magnetic field intensity. We've made correlations

248
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,880
between the manifestation and the EM intensity. Let's deal with that because you've mentioned

249
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,400
a Geiger counter and you've also mentioned an EM detector. Let's talk about electromagnetic energy.

250
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,640
Did you notice anything anomalous about the electromagnetic energy in the area where you were?

251
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:43,080
Yeah. So there are naturally occurring EM anomalies and there is with the Hestaden lights as well

252
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,840
in Norway. And we found that there was a buildup during the day in the middle of nowhere. There's

253
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,480
nothing around. There's no high voltage power lines. We're away from anything that could

254
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,360
generate the voltmeters and microteslas that you would associate with suburbia. And that would

255
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,920
build up to late afternoon. And then we found that the intensity of the manifestation of orbs and

256
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:13,320
rods had a correlation between zero and one with the intensity of the electric and magnetic field

257
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:19,560
buildup during the day. Now I'd like to get more data on that because we had four data plots on a

258
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:25,880
linear regression graph to get a strong correlation. So we've got more work to do, but there's certainly

259
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,640
an indication that there is something anomalous going on there.

260
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,440
So can you say that the electromagnetic radiation that was anomalous, was it causative

261
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,520
or correlative to the appearance of the orbs and rods, do you believe?

262
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,760
We post a number of different theories on that. So the key at the moment is not to

263
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,640
say it's this or it's this or it's this. We post several different theories and one in particular

264
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,760
was to do with energy coupling or energy cascades in the area because we've got,

265
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:03,320
I think it's called piezoelectric naturally occurring phenomena as well, where you can get

266
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:11,960
really small natural orbs from the buildup of electric and magnetic intensity in the atmosphere.

267
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,480
So there's that as well, but we think that masks this other UAP phenomena as well, which could be

268
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,440
a life form extension, it could be technological, it could be hiding there. We simply can't know.

269
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,760
Before we get into the life form issue, you also mentioned you had a radiation detector.

270
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,840
Did you pick up any anomalous radiation?

271
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:38,040
No, the gamma radiation was on the same meter and I tested for that and it was always

272
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:45,880
baseline background levels. And I think it's because you'd need to be right near an actual

273
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,920
object or an imprint or a physical trace for that to register. So in terms of background levels,

274
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,480
not above them. So paint me a word picture. I mean, I love the Pilbara. It's a beautiful

275
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,320
part of Australia. And the funny thing is the great mythology about Australia is we all walk

276
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,360
around with big hats on and walk around the outback, but very few Australians ever get out there.

277
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:13,560
And it is wild country. Paint me a word picture of where you are. It's big red hills covered with

278
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:20,920
scrub and blooming hot during the day. Yes, yes. You go in the dry season between April and September

279
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:27,080
because it simply gets walking around in 40 degrees. It's very difficult. It's barren. So

280
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:33,640
Karajini National Park is where we are for the field work. So it's red rock and dirt,

281
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:42,360
lots of termite mounds, short bush and shrubs and grasses, lots of canyons. It gets down to freezing

282
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:49,720
at night. So you've got gorges and canyons with water. Beautiful landscape during the day. And

283
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,080
that night I found in the area I was working and I did some field work at night time, getting up in

284
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:02,760
the middle of the night, quite creepy because it's deathly silent, almost not normal. There's no

285
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,800
insects, no birds, extremely quiet and a little bit creepy when you're sampling and recording

286
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,360
the stuff going on around you because you're ready for something to pop up in front of you and go,

287
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,320
oh my God, where did that come from? So I found that quite unusual as well when I've been out

288
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,440
tonight at night in other areas where you've got background insects, not the odd bird fluttering.

289
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,760
We did debunk some of this. We looked at camera blurring. We've looked at and I've filmed and

290
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,320
recorded four different types of organisms in infrared. And we know that they are organisms

291
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,840
because we did some background research on nocturnal flyers up there. So yeah,

292
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:48,440
very, very desolate place. So do the Aboriginal people in that area, do they talk about anomalous

293
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,360
portals or objects themselves? Is there anything in their mythology or their dreamtime stories

294
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,920
about this kind of object? Yeah, that's interesting. There's a couple of things there

295
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:05,000
because Newman Township, the swimming pool there is built on top of a dreamtime story

296
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,560
because the Aboriginals, to make it rain up there, they had a rain dance and apparently

297
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,840
where the swimming pool is, there used to be some big huge rocks in their dreamtime story

298
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,120
and they would dance around them. And apparently these rocks would split open and a light would

299
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:28,600
shoot up into the sky and then it would rain. And to me, that was a UAP story. You'd probably

300
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,080
have to ask the elders about their interpretation of that now from their dreamtime. But that's just

301
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,560
one. And then I had an anomalous experience up there with an elder that had passed on when we

302
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:47,800
went camping somewhere overnight and I asked an Indigenous person about this experience of my

303
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,560
sleep being interrupted in my consciousness by an Indigenous elder. He said, oh, they probably

304
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:59,000
didn't want you there and you shouldn't have been there. So I took that as advice not to go camping

305
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,760
back there without actually asking to be there. So let's go into the detail of the orbs and rods.

306
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,840
You've written, you and Brian, a fascinating paper that in my view presents pretty compelling

307
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:18,200
evidence that you're seeing something that is actually intelligent and responding to you.

308
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,440
Can you explain why you think these orbs and rods are intelligently responding to you?

309
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,720
Yeah, because we've got a huge archive of video footage and done extensive analysis

310
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:38,120
in frame-by-frame analysis and video clip analysis in a radial manner around the cardinal

311
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,920
directions. And we found that they demonstrated object avoidance. So that's whether that was an

312
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:51,240
obstacle. They would turn on a dime, instantaneous acceleration as well. So some of the five

313
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:58,600
observables are camera recognition or being filmed in infrared. They would come into the

314
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:05,560
field of view and then turn and try and move out of it pretty quickly as well. And same with the

315
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,760
observers. Can I just for a moment just interrupt you there? Okay, let's just try and think about

316
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:17,320
that. An infrared camera itself is not emitting any energy, is it, to try and capture the images

317
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:26,760
that it's capturing, is it? Yeah, we have in the 850 nanometer spectra. So there must be something

318
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:33,800
about that spectra that interrupts some of the, I think it was orbs. Orbs did it, not rods. The

319
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,680
orbs would do that. And then I found in one very interesting one where I was filming an orb and

320
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:46,680
trying to track it as it moved up into the sky. It would try, I would, I would try to look at it

321
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,080
move to the left or right or up and down with it. And then it would move

322
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,840
very quickly backwards and forwards as if it was making fun of me trying to track it.

323
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,840
So there's a trickster quality to this phenomenon. Yeah, there's a trickster. And that's been

324
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,560
mentioned in other studies as well. So there was that. So there's object avoidance. There was

325
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,920
some of the five observables. There's avoiding the camera, avoiding the observer as well.

326
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,880
So in your own words, you think this is intelligent? Can you explain to me,

327
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,920
you believe that this is intelligent? We think, yeah, we think there's some form of intelligence

328
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:33,720
now. Now, what Dr. Tyson and I came up with was a little table that looked at that as to whether

329
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,840
that represented a life form extension or an extension of an ecosystem phenomenon that's not

330
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,720
in the visible spectrum, whether there's some sort of mixture there of naturally occurring

331
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,200
and technological, because we've been speculating that these places with magnetic anomalies are

332
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,600
good places to hide if you're NHI as well. So whether there's some biomimicry there.

333
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,880
So there's a technology that mimics natural phenomena. And I talk about that in my papers

334
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,160
as well and how that can be, because these rods had counter rotating spindles around them.

335
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:16,360
There's no airframe like ailerons fuselage. There's no wings like organisms, but there

336
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,400
were these counter rotating spindles in our digital analysis going around them. And some

337
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,600
of the orbs had bisected rings as well. And so it's very interesting.

338
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:34,120
So you saw differences between the orbs and the rods. They don't behave the same, do they? What

339
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:44,360
are the differences? So the rods have extreme velocity instantaneous acceleration, turn with

340
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:53,480
no inertia. And the orbs, and predominantly the rods move in straight lines. We did see them

341
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,320
avoid objects, but the orbs were more erratic. So they were slower, still quite fast, slower,

342
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:07,320
turned without inertia. But they tended to investigate more. So there was different

343
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,640
types of orbs. There were orbs that had seemed to investigate what was around them. And there

344
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,840
were orbs that just moved through the field of view. And the ones that investigated were able

345
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:23,240
to turn instantaneously, no inertia. So all of these objects were able to overcome inertia

346
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:29,000
and demonstrate some of the five observables. What I find amazing about this, Andrew, is

347
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:35,560
if what you're saying is right, and if you can exclude the probability that these are artifacts

348
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:40,920
inside your camera that are doing these effects, you've found another form of life.

349
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,720
Yeah, I did talk to Dr. Tyson about that, about because one of the things of the life form

350
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:57,640
extension, and I said, well, do you think it's sentient as an intelligent organism, and not just

351
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:05,400
like an animal as intelligent, but actually capable of thought or thinking or some level

352
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,000
of consciousness. But what he did say and what I thought was, if this is a temporal anomaly,

353
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,680
it could also be a silhouette of something that we don't have the full manifestation of in our

354
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:23,320
own dimension. So we've been looking at that as well. So this is doing my head in. So

355
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:30,600
you guys are theorizing that where you were filming in the Pilbara Desert, Karangini National

356
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:38,680
Park, there might be some kind of interdimensional portal that this life form, these orbs and rods

357
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,240
are coming through. And just to get my understanding of what you've just said,

358
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:51,000
the reason why sometimes they appear translucent rather than solid is because they might only be

359
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,560
partially in this dimension. There might be shadows of themselves from the other dimension.

360
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,680
Yeah, that's one of the theories, one of the several theories we've got. And I called it

361
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:06,520
the looking glass effect, because when I was filming, there was this perfectly still night,

362
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:13,160
there was no wind, no breeze, no fog, no clouds, no fog coming up from the ground. But there was

363
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:19,720
this haze quite a few times through the footage. And it's not there when you're looking around.

364
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,480
And then it was what I call ghosting orbs. Yeah, it was sort of translucent. And then

365
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,320
there were the solid ones that would come out of that and be moving off and around.

366
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:37,160
You say solid. Were they solid objects? Do you think you can say definitively that they were

367
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:44,200
solid objects? Yeah, that's no, no, I wouldn't say that we've come to that conclusion because

368
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:50,840
we don't know whether they're plasma, whether they've got a structure to them underneath that.

369
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,160
Because I said to Brian, what if they're actually harnessing the energy that's around them

370
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:03,000
and not creating it themselves? But plasma itself is a solid because it shows up on radar sometimes,

371
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:11,240
doesn't it? Yeah, and if we had the technology and some more instrumentation, because that's

372
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,920
one of the things brought up about our research papers is understanding more about not just the

373
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,560
morphology of these objects, but the underlying structure and how that plasma is generated. So

374
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,800
whether they're generating it internally or externally, yes, it's still a fourth state of

375
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:36,120
matter as a light or a rod with a plasma around it. Now, the thing I find really shocking about

376
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,720
this is because you can't afford a camera that can shoot 1000 frames per second, that's the only

377
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,040
reason that you didn't get published in a peer reviewed journal that would give you the opportunity

378
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,880
to publish your good science in a journal that might give you the approval, if you like, of the

379
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,600
scientific community for what sounds like a potential discovery of a non-human intelligence.

380
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:06,200
Yeah, I think, yeah, that's, um. I find that incredible, really, when you think about it,

381
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,560
the implications are extraordinary. I mean, we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars on SETI,

382
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,440
you know, trying to communicate with radio signals across the universe. From what you're saying,

383
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,480
you are hypothesizing and still working, obviously, on trying to prove it, but you've

384
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,440
got a pretty solid basis for a hypothesis that what you are exploring is another form of life.

385
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,160
Yeah, I think we have the beginnings and the groundwork to do that, and I think

386
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,040
the key is application of the scientific method, and yes, cheap, yes, cheap gear,

387
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:47,880
but cheap gear done well, cheap gear done well is better than expensive gear given to someone that

388
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,120
has no idea what they're doing and just films and there's no methodology. I think the key here is

389
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,960
methodology, scientific methodology and hypothesis-driven research, and yes,

390
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:05,240
we need funding to prove or validate more what we're doing, but being rejected from a journal for,

391
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,440
I mean, I have to stay professional. I can understand from this physicist's perspective that

392
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,800
he has concerns, but there was another reviewer that said, we should publish this as something

393
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,560
here and move forward, because we're not, I think when you get a reviewer looking at one journal

394
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,320
article, they don't see the other two papers that are coming after it. They don't see the

395
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,480
hundreds of hours of video footage and stills, and they just get a summary. So in staying

396
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,040
professional, I understand that, and there are ways to self-publish now, and I think this whole

397
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,440
publish or perish thing needs to be discussed more at universities as well, because it's all

398
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,360
tied to funding models as well, of course, as a university scientist.

399
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Well, let me be the ultimate skeptic. I feel the obligation to be the voice of debunking skepticism

400
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,560
just for a moment here. The scientific community, would you agree, broadly takes the view that

401
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:09,240
UAPs, UFOs, they're not capable of being proved in material science, that essentially it's never

402
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,200
been verified, and that these things can't be, you know, you can't gather data on them,

403
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,840
you can't measure them, you can't sense them, therefore it's not real. What do you think of

404
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:28,920
that suggestion, that hypothesis? I think it's antiquated, because technology's changed,

405
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,600
and our thinking has changed, and if the scientific or academia is still thinking like that,

406
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,600
I think very quickly and very soon, as you're probably well aware, they're going to get left

407
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,840
behind if they don't get on board, and yes, some of us have taken a risk professionally stepping

408
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:50,680
up, you know, Gary, Avi, Loewe, myself, I'm a little bit lower down the ladder professionally,

409
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,240
because I'm not an academic, but I have an academic background, and I'm an educator and a

410
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,800
scientist, so I think if they don't change their mindset when this all starts to accelerate,

411
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:09,800
as it is already, they're going to miss the boat on all this. Yeah, the technology's there to do

412
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:17,800
it now, I don't understand why they would still, I think it's entrenched, it's an entrenched mindset

413
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,680
within academia, it can't be, therefore it isn't, I mean that's talked about a lot as well, and we

414
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,880
know historically, well for me personally, I've written another book coming out next year on our

415
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:35,720
missing science, which we could discuss, and I've looked at the whole UFO UAP thing since World War

416
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,960
II, and some key figures that have come afoul scientifically of the powers that be, including

417
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,200
Otis Carr, Douglas Tor, Dr Ning Li, Victor Shaw, Berger, all these guys seem to be talking about

418
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,040
the same science of field repulsion, field repulsion technology, I'm wondering whether if some of the

419
00:36:54,040 --> 00:37:01,320
stigma is facilitated by counterintelligence over those eight decades of legacy programs

420
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:07,560
and all of this, and that that's distilled into the university system and into their mindset,

421
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,920
so it's a minefield as you know of counterintelligence, personal agendas, you know,

422
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,320
blue book, project sign, project grudge, there's a whole history behind this in terms of academia

423
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,920
that I think we need to overcome the stigma of to move forward. Now you and I have got a mutual

424
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,400
friend Josh, Josh York, who's an anthropologist who operates in that part of the world, and

425
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,680
he's in touch with a lot of the Aboriginal communities across that desert area. I was

426
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,640
fascinated when I first spoke to Josh, he told me that it is a big thing in the Aboriginal communities

427
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:47,880
that they frequently see what they describe as structured craft hovering over the landscape at

428
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,720
times, black triangles, and it fascinated me because I start my book in plain sight with an

429
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,560
account of a young woman who was at the Harold E. Holt Naval Communication Station when it was an

430
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:07,080
American base, and there was a gigantic triangular craft that hovered adjacent to the base over a

431
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:15,080
road leading up to the base, and she told this chilling story about how when she was asked to

432
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:20,600
come into the base to talk to officials about what had happened that night when she and two

433
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:26,920
police officers had seen this gigantic hovering craft, it was quite obvious to her that the

434
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,880
base personnel and more importantly, the people who'd been flown in from overseas from American

435
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,040
military overseas, and civilian personnel, they knew full well about these objects and the whole

436
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,200
intention was to try and cover it up and shut it down. Is it a plausible possibility that what

437
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:50,200
we're seeing is some kind of American testing of prototypes? I mean, the thing that fascinates me

438
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:56,360
about her story is a lot of the accounts from the Aboriginal community in that part of the Western

439
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:02,120
Australia desert, and over the Northwest Cape, they started when our good friend George Knapp

440
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:07,560
started reporting on Area 51, Groom Lake, the Nevada test range, and all of a sudden the

441
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:14,840
cover of Groom Lake was blown as a place where you could safely test military prototype vehicles.

442
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,000
Is it possible that what you're seeing and what the Aboriginal community is seeing

443
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,680
are some kind of secret military technology perhaps being tested in the Australian outback by the

444
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:32,920
Americans? I think there's a lot of speculation in there. Yes, the Indigenous communities have had

445
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,920
a long history, as I've talked to Josh myself, and I've met with him, and a couple of Indigenous

446
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,160
people up there talk about objects, and even around mine sites up there, we've got conversations and

447
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,760
pubs about objects and lights and unusual lights at night, and a particular person at a mine site

448
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:58,440
up there sent me some photos of physical, what I think is physical craft as well in terms of discs

449
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:06,840
and cylinders. Can we see those photographs? That was one thing you hadn't sent me just yet,

450
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:13,960
but can we see those images? I'm trying to get the high res ones because they were low res

451
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,800
off the phone, so when they were sent it reduced the file size, so I didn't want to send those

452
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:26,520
because they're too pixelated, so I'm still waiting to liaise and get more of the high res

453
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:33,000
versions of those. So in anticipation of us getting them, can you talk to those photographs

454
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,480
and tell me what you see? Yeah, because I got a little bit of video sent to me as well. Around

455
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,840
this mine site, because I don't want to talk about companies and naming mine sites,

456
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,200
that wouldn't be professional, but around a particular mine site there's an increasing

457
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:59,080
occurrence of objects in the night sky and during the day. There's the typical rainbow coloured one

458
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,480
that's been filmed at night that I've got a bit of footage of that just changes flashes a whole

459
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:10,440
lot of different colours and moves up and below the horizon. There was another footage of a large

460
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:17,640
cylinder, one that people talk about. I've got some footage of that just hovering in the night sky

461
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:26,040
and there was another one in the mine pit during the day and off in the distance up against or

462
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:34,520
close to one of the walls of the pit that had more of a jellyfish-like structure to it. But

463
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,560
what this person did say was that they, I don't know whether it's they're more aware of them now,

464
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:47,000
so they're seeing them more or mine workers reporting an increased presence or activity

465
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:54,360
around that area because it's around the area outside of these mines as well. So they might

466
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:01,240
be seeing objects that are a few miles away from where they're looking. There are actually

467
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,880
quite a few fans of reality check way out there in that West Australian desert because they send

468
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,640
me their own images of what they're seeing over their remote Aboriginal communities and a lot of

469
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:18,680
what they're describing is what you're describing. Spheres, silver spheres, silver tubes. What on

470
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:28,760
earth are they, Andrew? If you do your research historically and you go back to pre and post-World

471
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:37,400
War II, there is what I call the pop culture narrative and then there's the scientific

472
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,920
narrative. So in the pop culture narrative they talk about flying saucers and cylinders. I think

473
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:51,560
there's a couple of books. David Childress has written books about that whole Nazi Germany

474
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:57,080
narrative for flying saucers and cylinders. So there's a potential there for a technology

475
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:04,920
that's already been seconded away in the private aerospace sector, proved and tested. So there could

476
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:11,320
be that as well and that's why we've had these hearings in the US and Congress about all this

477
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:17,160
as well about who's got this technology and why aren't we aware of it? Have our adversaries

478
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,560
got hold of it and are they doing better than us? So there's that. Maybe the Australia, maybe there

479
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:28,760
isn't a presence up there that's a bit of both, NHI and human engineered technology that with or

480
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:35,080
without the help of NHI. The triangles, they're up there because I've been, like you, I've been

481
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:41,480
sent a photo of triangle lights in the skies by community members up there in the clouds as well

482
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:48,520
and I've seen a couple of objects myself, one at night, one during the day that were of a different

483
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:55,480
structure. So and I think there's a difference too because obviously the engineered ones,

484
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,440
you know, rivets, a structure that's been assembled and it tends to be the NHI ones

485
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:09,160
have no external features that show that they've somehow been assembled.

486
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:17,640
Let's talk about what you referred to earlier, the piezoelectric effects in the rocks. I'm

487
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,080
searching here for prosaic explanations and one of the things that really struck me when I was

488
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:29,480
in Egypt was there was a lot of talk about the quartzite in granite and the piezoelectric effects

489
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:36,120
of granite carrying a lot of quartzite that they are in many ways conductive or attractive

490
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:41,800
of electrical energy. Can you develop that hypothesis for me? How might a piezoelectric

491
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,560
effect in rocks help or assist in an understanding of the UAPs we're talking about?

492
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:54,600
Yeah we took, and I think it was in the third paper that we've published to ResearchGate,

493
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:02,520
we talk about energy cascades enhancing the phenomena up there through natural accumulation

494
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:09,960
of electrical energy. So with the quartzite you've got high-grade magnetite there

495
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:17,480
which has a magnetic field, you've got quartzite which has a under pressure, quartz under pressure

496
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:24,920
generates an electric field and the pillar is a craton so it's one of the oldest rock

497
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:31,800
formations on the planet. So in terms of pressure and movement you've got the excess electrical

498
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:38,120
and magnetic energy in that whole area anyway and combine that with freezing and thawing of water

499
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,240
deep in the rock formations because it's a desert climate that generates pressure friction and

500
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:49,160
electrical energy as well. So that all comes up out of the ground and it can coalesce and that's

501
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:55,560
why they talk about these naturally occurring spheres, small spheres that can form from

502
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:01,320
concentrated EM energy. Well that's what I was going to ask, I mean is it possible that the

503
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:07,720
orbs and rods that you're seeing are something caused by the piezoelectric effect of rocks

504
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,480
simply rubbing together, that we don't need an NHI explanation for this, that it could just be

505
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,480
a geological explanation as I know they're looking for at Hesteland in Norway as well,

506
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,000
you know everybody's still looking for a possible geological explanation to explain the phenomenon

507
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,520
that occurs in this valley in Norway called Hesteland. Yeah and I compare and contrast

508
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:40,200
Hesteland lights in the papers that Brian and I have written and I think even in

509
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:48,200
Teodorani and his papers talks about the potential for that naturally occurring

510
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:53,560
phenomena to mask the presence of any technological phenomena as well. The same

511
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,920
could well apply and we need more research to look at that but there is the potential for that

512
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:05,960
up there but what I found is some of these the kinematics and morphologies of some of

513
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:13,160
some of these orbs and rods don't demonstrate a random pattern of movement that you could

514
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,040
associate with a naturally occurring phenomena which applies that there must be some form of

515
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:25,480
intelligence that is connected to some of these orbs and rods and I think Teodorani in his papers

516
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:34,280
in his work poses that question as well is that do the kinematics in Hesteland demonstrate

517
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,400
an intelligence is there a mixture of both in there and we simply don't know at the moment we

518
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:46,280
need more more field work and more instrumentation to separate the two if they are mixed together

519
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:53,160
in this in this area. It's one of the things that you would cite as evidence of intelligence

520
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,120
that when you point your infrared camera at these objects and start detecting them

521
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:05,960
I think you've described it as a phase shift they appear to change phase and change shape or form

522
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:14,360
in some way. Yeah the phase shifting was interesting because if they were just going on

523
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,640
in and out of the field of view you couldn't say much about it but when I went back through

524
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:25,640
and looked at the frame capture analysis and at some of the videography they would manifest in

525
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:32,040
physical space in the field of view and we and in my third paper we show some frame capture of that

526
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:39,880
of an infrared this all just appears and coalesces as a light as a light ball out from out of nowhere

527
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:45,160
so it's not coming through the field of view it's actually manifesting in the field of view

528
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,120
the rods are too fast to do that because I don't even mind again we talk about high speed

529
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,880
cameras to do that but the orbits were moving slow enough and manifesting slow enough that we

530
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:04,040
did capture that on film and so if that was but again is that a naturally occurring

531
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,960
light ball was that a form of intelligence so that's what we can't separate the two at the

532
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,640
moment because you know the light the large light the larger that you've got video of moving

533
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:21,320
through the field of view when I first went up there that's a lot bigger and it has a completely

534
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:29,000
different morphology to a smaller one as well so they're not all the same can I just ask just

535
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,760
for a bear with a very small brain if light is light those orbs are clearly some kind of

536
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:42,360
light or energy or plasma do you agree yeah yeah there are some kind of energy there

537
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:48,520
light ball plasma some form of energy why can't we see them on anything other than infrared

538
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,360
this is where I put forward to dr tyson the energy cascade hypothesis within an

539
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:04,360
interdimensional anomaly is that to go from invisible to infrared to the visible spectrum

540
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:10,120
requires a certain amount of of energy to manifest in physical space so I put for that

541
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:16,440
as a theory is that and I think teotirani talks about this too that the level of energy required

542
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,760
to be in the infrared spectrum and the visible spectrum is different so and if they're harnessing

543
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,560
energy externally which is another model we put forward not generating it themselves then they're

544
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:35,240
totally dependent within that temporal anomaly on available energy and energy cascades as to how

545
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,760
how intensely they manifest so I'm recording them in the 850 spectra nanometer spectra

546
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,560
and it may simply be that the the intensity of energy required to manifest

547
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:55,720
and the light visible visible spectrum is not enough so so do you need more or less energy

548
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:02,440
to show in infrared than you do in visible light I'm still researching this but

549
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:12,440
I think in terms of energy cascades it's more so I think I think because yeah I'll have to

550
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,800
go and do some more research on this but because I'm still talking to dr tyson about about plasma

551
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:24,760
and light ball and energy cascades within this anomaly if it is a temporal anomaly because

552
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,720
it appears the more the more you move away from the site the less of these objects there are

553
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,760
they still have the same intensity but there's less of them so where where's the energy coming

554
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,600
from for that for that number to manifest and concentrate radially around a certain area

555
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,560
and is that energy intensity like you said related to their ability to manifest

556
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,640
is it are they choosing or are they just choosing not to manifest visibly is there a

557
00:51:52,280 --> 00:52:00,600
dr tyson even talked about what he called consciousness or the observer effect in

558
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:05,400
quantum mechanics is that you observe something and therefore it's matter and when you're not

559
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:11,400
observing it it's a waveform so there's that whole area of physics as well as it is the observer

560
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:19,160
having an impact on the manifestation and and one of the final questions andrew do the things you

561
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:27,400
see the orbs and rods do you only see them at night yeah but that's mainly because of the gear

562
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:35,960
i've got i do electric and magnetic field density right through day and night but the infrared camera

563
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:44,680
i'm standing up to film an infrared at night so daytime yeah well is it possible that they are

564
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,280
showing themselves in the daytime it's just you don't have the type of camera that could pick

565
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:54,760
them up because the infrared would be lost against the daytime heat yeah exactly yep and i think

566
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:00,680
that's where if we get into more field work and a proposal to develop this further with with better

567
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:07,720
technology that we can set up sensor arrays 24 seven and look at others the full spectrum

568
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:14,120
because we're very limited with 850 nanometer spectra and em field intensity just what about

569
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,480
the rest of the infrared spectrum the visible spectrum even the ultraviolet spectrum

570
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:25,000
what would you need to be able to measure them during the day high speed cameras hyperspectral

571
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,120
cameras what would you need yeah we need hyperspectral cameras so we can do day and

572
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:37,640
night alongside em field intensity and also the radar arrays as well to see if there is a signature

573
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:43,480
from an actual object so you've got the hyperspectral cameras you've got your em

574
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,240
field intensity you've got your radar array i think we'd be getting a lot further along the track

575
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:55,400
in terms of what is going on there all we can say definitely is something is going on here it's

576
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:01,080
anomalous it may or may not be naturally occurring and there seems to be some form of intelligence

577
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:08,120
attached to it so we've written three papers on that put forward our theories behind the data

578
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:13,240
suggested a way forward and put place it in the context of the scientific literature

579
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:20,120
literature globally and in particular the Hestad and light research with the exception of

580
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:24,440
Hestelin and the work of Massimo Teodorani the Italian scientist that you've mentioned

581
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,160
a couple of times is anyone else researching these orbs and rods around the world

582
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:37,560
i've had uh there's this anecdotal evidence on from youtubers and there's also there's also

583
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:44,520
historically i found on the internet people have written books on and called them spirits that

584
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:50,200
have passed over and there's this whole uh that whole side of it too and i i stayed away from

585
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:55,800
that i said look this there's a science to all this uh some people have connected these orbs to

586
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,200
spirits or passed over spirits or the spiritual side of things and i think yeah there's a

587
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,040
consciousness consciousness connection but let's let's let's be scientific and you know it's just

588
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:11,080
because we don't understand something let's not turn it into religion and let's keep with the

589
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:18,200
science and and find out what the sciences are behind it all and i again i allude to the fact

590
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,720
that there is there's a missing branch of science in the public arena and i think that there's a

591
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:29,160
science in the public arena that i think other people are well aware of what do you think that

592
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:35,880
missing branch of science is dr andrew morgan yeah we had a discussion about this the book the book

593
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:42,120
i my book on my life is an experience of the book on uap coming out next year and all my background

594
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:47,560
research and one word actually three words i could sum it up as field repulsion science

595
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:54,760
uh everything seems to be connected to to that and if it's so highly coveted why and we had the

596
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,360
conversation about okay scalar weapons technology uh even to go back to maxwell's original quaternion

597
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:07,000
notation where time is a scalar fourth dimension and that's all been taken offline and modified

598
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,600
as well so there's there's something missing across all of this so do you think some science

599
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:17,880
is being actively suppressed by some in the scientific establishment or is that too big a

600
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:25,240
call no i i think yes and no i think there's there's a naivety about it because you don't

601
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:32,280
know what you don't know and the ones that do know uh it's maybe career ending or not a good idea

602
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,920
and then there's counterintelligence as well so because if you go back through and look at all

603
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,560
the stuff that's been taken offline and there's a stigma around it people's careers have been

604
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,760
altered changed or they've disappeared or not working on it anymore and they're all in that

605
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:52,520
area of research is is this rotating this technology counter rotation field repulsion

606
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:59,560
and and go to i've gone into russian work and even um torsion fields a lot of torsion field

607
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:06,200
research is is by russian scientists in nature uh and in terms of technology application and that's

608
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:11,480
all connected to field repulsion science as well so where is all the science why is it not

609
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:18,840
universities in high schools are connected to special relativity and quantum mechanics so where

610
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,720
is it because the big thing that fascinates me is even physicists like eric weinstein admit

611
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:29,880
that there's a huge hole in modern physics that string theory doesn't work it doesn't explain the

612
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,320
known universe we've got a huge problem with modern physics and for much of the last 60 to 70

613
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:41,640
years it's struggled to explain a unified physics theory that actually explains the

614
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:48,600
whole universe um what do you think this field propulsion technology is exactly can you explain

615
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:54,280
that to a lay person without making our heads explode yep yeah it's key it's key to to make

616
00:57:54,280 --> 00:58:03,080
sure we call it field repulsion not propulsion so field repulsion uh and it's all to do with um

617
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:11,960
um uh go back to maxwell's electromagnetic atom and spin a subatomic spin an electron spin

618
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,560
and and everything spins and when when you generate an electric field from that

619
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:24,520
you generate a repulsion so if you look at dr dingley's disk technology same sort of thing

620
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:31,320
getting that that that spin technology to generate a repulsive field uh you go to um

621
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:39,720
victor victor schorberg's uh implosion drive spinning disc uh again generating a field around

622
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:48,440
it which allows it to shoot up in the air uh at instant instantaneously uh and then otis car same

623
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:56,440
sort of thing uh with uh with with uh uh field repulsion so generating a spin and a repulsive

624
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:04,440
field so that's that seems to be where this gap is but i go i think we need to have a conversation

625
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,200
about the relationship between einstein and maxwell because i've been researching this

626
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:14,920
and what happened to maxwell's petunian notation uh and scale of time so i think it all started

627
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,640
from there uh whether that was on purpose or inadvertently because heavyside turned it into

628
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:25,080
vector calculus and then einstein that got a special relativity from from all of that

629
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,960
but maxwell and einstein knew each other so einstein must have known about maxwell's

630
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:37,320
petunian mathematics because he was a genius mathematician and helped einstein so has that

631
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:42,440
been taken offline what happened to it why is why are we not talking about scale of time

632
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:49,160
and field repulsion since then and every time it has been brought up it's it's disappeared

633
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:57,160
so whether by design or oversight a science is being suppressed

634
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:05,080
i i think so and and and maybe there's good reason for that but we're at a stage now where

635
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,720
we can acknowledge that yes you can hold on to the technology but give us our science back please

636
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,680
because we need to understand how how the universe works and i think uh understanding the fourth

637
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:25,560
dimension is gonna uh in terms of what i've just talked about is gonna unravel or bring back

638
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:30,200
what eric weinstein was talking about in terms of our missing science and understanding deep space

639
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,560
travel and hopping around space and and not moving through physical space to get to somewhere that

640
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,720
takes hundreds of years to get to because that's never going to happen i think people are well

641
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:47,400
aware well dr andrew morgan i think your little adventures in the pilbara desert

642
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:54,680
examining mysterious orbs and rods may one day provide us with an answer to that big question

643
01:00:54,680 --> 01:01:00,440
and i sincerely hope it does dr andrew morgan thank you so much for joining reality check

644
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,960
um i think all of us would like to see your research continue it'd be great to see your

645
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:11,480
um work better funded so that you can get the equipment you need to do the kind of research

646
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:17,240
that's needed to definitively get a result and hopefully get you published in a peer review

647
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,440
journal yeah thanks thanks a lot ross i think we have more questions and answers at the moment

648
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,720
but i look forward to what the future holds so thank you very much
