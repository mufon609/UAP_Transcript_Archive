1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hmm.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Secrets, cover-ups, and strange phenomena.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
UFOs and ideas that challenge reality itself.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All these mysteries, all this time.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Are we ever going to get to the bottom of these?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is George Knapp.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I dig into news stories that others can't or won't.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm Jeremy Korbel.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And for some reason, people tell me things they probably shouldn't.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And this is Weaponized.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Some viewers may find this episode of Weaponized disturbing.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's up, Colin?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hey.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is Weaponized.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We have a special guest, a longtime friend of ours, Dr. Colm Kelleher, an eminent scientist and investigator.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And we got a lot of ground to cover.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I thought we would start with maybe a general term that gets way overused.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's become sort of a buzzword in scientific circles.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You see physicists using it.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You see UFO researchers using it.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All kinds of people who don't seemingly know what it means, don't know what the source of consciousness is.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But Colm, you've worked on consciousness related issues for decades.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Give us a sense of does the public understand what it is?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Does science understand what it is and how it relates in general terms to the topics that we all discuss privately and publicly?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, obviously, you know, consciousness means different things to different people, as you've just said.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But from the perspective of what's becoming more and more mainstream, I think we've got a new sort of format for discussing consciousness in even in academic circles.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And people like Jeffrey Kreipel, people like Professor Donald Hoffman from UC Irvine, Edward Kelly.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There's quite a few people who are now coming forward and they're discussing consciousness in a completely different way.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The paradigm, like for 100 years, has been that consciousness arises from the brain.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And what they're saying is we're turning that completely on its head.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And we're saying that consciousness is actually a lot bigger than what's being allegedly made in the brain.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So the whole format of consciousness is changing.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And as this brings more and more into mainstream as a as a person who's looked at UFOs for many, many years,

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I see an awful lot of relevance for consciousness and the overlap with UFOs.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
In fact, I see human consciousness as being a sort of a link, a linchpin for the future study of UFOs.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I think it's all well and good to do a lot of research on sensor driven technology with UFOs.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But the real effects of UFOs on humans have to do with effects on consciousness,

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
as well as effects on other aspects, physiological effects, psychological effects.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So the idea that consciousness might be prime, quote unquote,

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
is a pretty new concept that has been sort of out on the margins of neuroscience, but it's getting more mainstream now.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And I believe that the study of UFOs will benefit from this new infusion of, you know, creativity from academia.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I love how you just went for the jugular and we are deep in it.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I just want to before we go anywhere, I want to say I am so excited to have you on this show

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
because you guys have been friends for so long.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And over those years, you know, for the decade we've been working together, I've gotten to know you and we become friends.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But this is a rare opportunity where we can just talk from a very religious position of knowledge of each other for a long time.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm excited that you're here because you have been central to a lot of what's been going on.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
A lot of times the public could never know about it, but now they can.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And that's why you talking with your buddy, Colm, just talking to him so people can hear to see kind of what brought you here,

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
how you got to the point of being.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know what a good reference would be, but it's like you've studied things that most of the world has never even considered.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But you didn't start that.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I am curious what Colm, Dr. Colm Kelleher's origin story is like, where does that?

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How does this happen?

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So let's let's set the stage.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He's in Ireland. He's in Dublin.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He's taking classes, drinking pints and chasing girls.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And what what was your degree in Colm and what was your long term plan?

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How did you end up here?

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So you're making it sound like I had a Damascus experience in Dublin, which probably arose through a couple of pints of Guinness.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But, yeah, I was studying biochemistry in University College Dublin.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And then I went on and I studied biochemistry in Trinity College Dublin.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And part of that was part of that latter study was a sojourn in France down in in south of France,

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
where I spent eight months at a laboratory in France and met a Canadian guy.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And we collaborated on some experiments and they worked really well.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So we invited me over to Canada.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I left Ireland in 1980 something just for a couple of years.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And I was intending to go back to Ireland.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But, you know, I never left.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I never left North America.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I mean, here I am almost 35 to 40 years later and I'm still here.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think I've been sort of very, very fortunate in the way things have sort of unfolded over the years.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I moved from Ottawa in Canada to Toronto, spent a few years in Toronto, spent a few years in Vancouver,

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
came down to Denver, Colorado, all, you know, following work and following different aspects of research.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And then I moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, to join National Institute for Discovery Science in 1996,

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
spent eight years in Las Vegas and then I moved to a biotechnology company in San Francisco.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And then I got a very mysterious call through the grapevine that there was a new government sponsored program in 2008 starting up.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I moved back to Las Vegas and I've been here ever since.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So it's kind of like this long shaggy dog story.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, we've got to back you up though.

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So you study, you are a scientist.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In what realm were you doing science?

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Like who were some of your mentors at the time?

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Before you answer this strange ad in the newspaper I want to get to, which changes your life forever from how I understand it.

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What kind of science were you doing?

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Who were your mentors and what inspired you by your mentors?

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You were a mainstream guy doing mainstream science for a while and then you went off the rails, right?

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, that's right.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah, I fell off the cliff.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What kind of science?

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I guess the main mentor, as you speak of mentors, was a guy in the Ontario Cancer Institute in Toronto.

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I was studying the molecular biology of acute myeloblastic leukemia.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In other words, how leukemic cells grow and they grow out of control and they kill people.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So part of my study was working with this guy, Ernest McCullough, who was actually credited with discovering stem cells in mice back in the 60s.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So the Ontario Cancer Institute was sort of the place in Canada.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It was kind of the flagship place for research in Canada.

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So I had this guy as a mentor.

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And one of the things that he always drummed into me was, look, son, if you really want to catch a big fish, go fish in places where there's nobody else fishing.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And, you know, that whole sort of advice stuck with me because I could see, you know, the difference between, you know, science as business as usual versus science in a sort of a much more, I guess, paradigm creating way.

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So I took his advice to heart.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And, you know, I was I was working down in Denver, Colorado, in an immunology research institute.

102
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
When I saw this, I opened Science Magazine, which is kind of the the sort of Bible.

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yes, the Bible of science.

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And, you know, you see ads for postdoctoral fellowships and virology and, you know, sort of graduate students and sort of biochemistry.

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But in the middle of all of these really technical ads, there was a sort of almost a full page ad saying we are recruiting scientists who are interested in researching the origin and evolution of consciousness in the universe.

106
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I mean, can you imagine for a for a sort of a mainstream biologists or a biochemist looking at this?

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I mean, the kind of the word the verbiage just blew my mind.

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And there was a phone number at the bottom of the page.

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So I naturally I was so intrigued.

110
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I called it and, you know, I got to talk to Robert Bigelow's assistant and then I got to talk to Robert Bigelow.

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And then I found myself out in Las Vegas, Nevada, in Robert Bigelow's corporate office, sort of sitting there interviewing me.

112
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And he hired me a couple of weeks later.

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it was like a total life changing sort of change in direction because I moved from mainstream science into what could be called, you know, borderline science or liminal science or, you know,

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
science that was not 100 percent accepted by the mainstream.

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So, I mean, it was that ad in Science magazine that I could, I guess, say, change my life.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It was the one and it was the uninvestigated is what it was.

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And what year? Because I want to see where you that were that possible.

118
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Nineteen ninety six. Yeah.

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's where our paths cross.

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

121
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I joined an organization called the National Institute for Discovery Science.

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And, you know, the name of the National Institute for Discovery Sciences is worth noting because discovery is the sort of essence of the scientific process.

123
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And the purpose for NIDS, as it was called for short, was to actually investigate anomalies and investigating anomalies was an inherent part of the discovery process in in sort of opening up new fields for research.

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So I thought that the nomenclature, you know, naming National Institute for Discovery Science was a very good move on the part of Robert Bigelow.

125
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The idea of investigating anomalies is central to scientific progress.

126
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You know, you can stay in a safe lane and spend your whole career living within the paradigm, not risking going outside the boundaries of what's acceptable.

127
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But in the history of science, the ones that really make the difference are the ones that pursue anomalies, something that doesn't fit the general accepted knowledge.

128
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Absolutely. I couldn't agree more.

129
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I mean, and I think when Robert Bigelow founded NIDS, as it became as it became known as, I think that was a central objective was to bring in some mainstream, quote unquote, scientists.

130
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We were shortly joined by physicist Eric Davis, who has sort of since since then become quite well known in the UFO circles.

131
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And we also hired our Robert Bigelow hired a DVM PhD guy named George Onet, who was an expert at animal pathology.

132
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And the purpose for doing that was because this organization was going to investigate scientific anomalies among which were cattle mutilations.

133
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And so the whole idea of hiring a full time staff member of animal pathologists was to actually do that kind of work.

134
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And so it was a sort of an overt attempt to get a jumpstart on a field that was very, very arcane and very sort of mysterious.

135
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I mean, thousands of these cattle beginning in the 1960s and going into the 1970s were being found dead on ranchers properties with parts removed, either reproductive organs or lips or eyes or tongues.

136
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And it was it was a mystery. Nobody had been caught or charged in decades, which is a very unusual situation, because normally if you've got a quote unquote serial killer, you know, eventually they're caught and charged.

137
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But this was decades later during the 90s. And this had been going on for 30 to 40 years without anybody getting charged or caught.

138
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So NIDS got a DVM PhD animal pathologist right from the get go in order to sort of get a jumpstart on animal mutilations.

139
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We thought we could solve it and probably, you know, maybe six months to a year.

140
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But, you know, we were sort of I think we were met with an awful lot more complexity.

141
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This really this gets to me because it's like so George has along the way really kind of educated me on all this history and stuff.

142
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I didn't know about animal mutilations. I was interested in nuts and bolts and flying saucers.

143
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And over the over time, you know, George has kind of showed me here's where the FBI was involved.

144
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Here's in the 70s what happened. Here are the documented cases, the pathology labs and then working with you, I kind of started getting a bigger picture.

145
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But just for our audience or anybody who's unfamiliar with this, when we talk about something as mysterious as the UFO phenomenon,

146
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I begrudgingly had to come to an understanding that possibly something like this, what I considered this other mystery,

147
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
because I wasn't listening to people who are who are experiencing these things, that this other mystery in my mind might have or be correlated to the UFO phenomenon.

148
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But when you're studying it with nids at the beginning, a scientific team and you're you're on the ground, you're going to these things,

149
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
you're doing pathologies, you're doing stuff that like other governments wouldn't do.

150
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Right. In your mind, did you make any association immediately that this has something to do with a bigger phenomenon or are you just looking at mutilations and trying to find the killers?

151
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think a bit of both. I know the veterinarian that joined National Institute for Discovery Science was very skeptical about any possible linkage between UFOs and calculations.

152
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:09,000
However, the literature that we looked into suggested that there were a lot of unusual lights in the sky that usually were seen by ranchers or people close to ranchers

153
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
immediately proceeding, finding their animal dead in the pasture the following day.

154
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So that's the last thing they would report. That's been when George and I have studied specific cases with this mutilation thing under the radar, although filmed.

155
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What what's interesting is that that's the last thing a rancher wants to tell you.

156
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They'll tell you somebody fucked up my cow and I'd like them arrested. I'd like to find out what's going on.

157
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, they they're hesitant to tell you the lights thing or what else they see.

158
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'd add this is, you know, I've reported it a number of times.

159
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The number we use is there's been at least 10,000 cases reported.

160
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And, you know, it's supposedly satanic cults out there carving up cows and other animals or it's coyotes doing it.

161
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Obviously, it is not coyotes or predators doing it.

162
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We'll get into that. But also the cults.

163
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I mean, where are all these Beelzebub worshippers running around out in ranches and how are they have never been caught?

164
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The actual number is probably many times that because ranchers experience this.

165
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They don't want to deal with it. They dig a hole, throw the cow in it and and just forget about it.

166
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They don't report it to anyone. So the actual problem could be a lot bigger than than what anybody knows.

167
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, it is you and I all the time get cases associated with this where they're like, we want you want to tell you we want to show you photos.

168
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We don't want it public. We don't want our name.

169
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And, you know, one, we were able to go investigate.

170
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But the whole thing is, is that you're right.

171
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
This is not something that is just on their priority list to tell everybody.

172
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I got a call from a guy in Dumas, Texas, and he has what appears to be an exceptionally interesting cat amputation.

173
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm going to show you the photos from it. See if you think this is a valid case.

174
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I like to meet with George Knapp because he has walked the walk for decades before me.

175
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We're talking about a reporter who has broken global news from the mob to political investigations.

176
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He's a touchstone for truth.

177
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
There aren't many things we can say for sure about this, but there are a couple.

178
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
One is we know at least 10,000 cases in all 50 states.

179
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They've been reported since the 1970s. I'm going to share something with you that is pretty startling.

180
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This is a paper that was written by NIDS National Institute for Discovery Science.

181
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
One of the investigations that they carried out was in Montana.

182
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
There was a sheriff. His county is home to Malmstrom Air Force Base nuclear missiles.

183
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And there were a whole outbreak of these UFO sightings over the missile bases.

184
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:01,000
By the way, just interject, in Dumas, Texas is one of the largest nuclear missile disarmament and maintenance facilities in the world.

185
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Pantex.

186
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Pantex.

187
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Pantex.

188
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Extraordinary coincidence.

189
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, it is exactly the pattern that happened in Montana over a series of years.

190
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
They had something like 200 mutilations in this guy's county.

191
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And it was happening in the same time period that UFOs were appearing over these missile silos.

192
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Some of those silos were taken down. They were inoperative for a period of time.

193
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
By what?

194
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The story has put out its mystery helicopters.

195
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Holy shit.

196
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It was reported by the Washington Post and the world ignored it. It's well documented.

197
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This is a report by the FBI.

198
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
In the late 70s, a big outbreak of cattle mutilations.

199
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And some U.S. senators said, hey, let's get to the bottom of this.

200
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The ranchers are raising hell. And they hired an ex-FBI agent and basically gave him an assignment.

201
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Explain this.

202
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This is the actual FBI report.

203
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's from the FBI, right.

204
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He took a lot of legitimate evidence and then gave a whitewash explanation that it's predators.

205
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's bullshit. It's not predators.

206
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Contrary to the FBI and the government's attempts to wipe this away with that report, the mystery continues.

207
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If cattle mutilation does happen in waves, we have a reemergence.

208
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There have been, you know, really concerted efforts to make the public ignore it and explain it away.

209
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The public's not stupid.

210
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Witnesses are reaching out to me now. It's fucking amazing.

211
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
When I started doing this, I never wanted to touch the mutilation topic.

212
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So strange and fringe. People equate them with UFOs and government conspiracies.

213
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But I can't ignore the facts.

214
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There's physical evidence. And when there's physical evidence, there's something we can learn from that.

215
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You see patterns happening here that are intertwined with these cases of true mutilation.

216
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:55,000
When you start out with this investigation and NIDS is doing it, there's anecdotal accounts of witnesses, ranchers, lawmen who see strange lights in the sky, black helicopters,

217
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
in association with the cattle mutilations, the animal mutilations.

218
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But there isn't really any solid proof.

219
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Do you start the investigation looking at the physical evidence or do you start with the premise that maybe it's involved or you don't allow yourself to establish it?

220
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Well, we really did not begin to correlate any sort of correlations with the UFO phenomenon at the very beginning.

221
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Our whole idea was to convince law enforcement and ranchers to report these things to us as quickly as possible.

222
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Because remember, in the summer, if a cow drops dead with wounds to the body, you've essentially got 48 hours max in order to get there, get on the scene and then take samples.

223
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You conduct a full what's called a necropsy, an animal biopsy or autopsy and sort of take a whole bunch of tissues and then send them to a variety of laboratories.

224
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But the clock is ticking.

225
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Once that animal hits the ground, you've got the obliteration of evidence that starts happening, especially in the summer with summer heat.

226
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You've got sort of decay happens really quickly.

227
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Now it accelerated even more because the cow has multiple stomachs, which are full of these bacteria that just explode when the animal dies.

228
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So you're running against the clock.

229
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So the idea for NIDS was to contact hundreds and hundreds of ranchers, hundreds of law enforcement people around the country, veterinarians, veterinarian association.

230
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So we set up this hotline that we had so that law enforcement people could call because a lot of the time ranchers would call the law enforcement and say, look, there's obviously some monkey business going on on my property because I've had a couple of animals die and they're not being killed by coyotes.

231
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So we would get a call from law enforcement and say, you know, in northern Montana, we've got a case of this animal died last night.

232
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So we would have this rapid reaction response.

233
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
We would get up there within sort of 12 hours or less.

234
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
We'd have the veterinarian with us.

235
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The veterinarian would be on the pasture conducting a full necropsy on the animal.

236
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
He'd be taking all of these tissue samples.

237
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He'd be sampling around where the cuts are.

238
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He'd be taking blood samples and all of that and then send them to a variety of histology labs, biochemical, chemical analysis.

239
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So we went the whole Monte on the on the animal mutilation phenomenon.

240
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And, you know, it was a very expensive process.

241
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I mean, it was not.

242
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Luckily, Robert Bigelow had a lot of money to put into National Institute for Discovery Science.

243
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But doing this for an animal was not not cheap.

244
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Right. And I mean, from a rancher, it made zero economic sense to pour a whole bunch of money into finding out how his animal died.

245
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He'd already lost his money once that animal hit the pasture.

246
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So there was really no point in doing that.

247
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
No one had ever done this before.

248
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Certainly not on this scale.

249
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Not on this. No, not at the level of of analytical depth that NIDS went into.

250
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And, you know, like I said, we had a full time veterinarian having a full time veterinarian capable of conducting full necropsies

251
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:38,000
when the animal is still in that 48 hour period before death was a very unique thing because I mean, we tried contracting veterinarians later on.

252
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And, you know, having a veterinarian who's extremely busy, has a high caseload, getting that veterinarian out to a pasture within, you know, 24 hours was a chore.

253
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It was a lot of the time it wasn't possible.

254
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So having a full time veterinarian really helped.

255
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Let me ask you, this is a burning question.

256
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So everybody hearing about this.

257
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So what is the difference?

258
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Animals are killed by predators all the time.

259
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
There's signature things.

260
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Why is this even worth investigation?

261
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What are the key hallmarks that you saw repeatedly, case by case, repeated that tells you this is something other than normal predatory animals?

262
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Give me a laundry list.

263
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Tell me what you've seen.

264
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Well, the the the first obvious difference is that a predator when they attack a cow, you know, whether it be coyotes or wolves or whatever predator cats, there's a lot of mess.

265
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You know, they open up the abdomen, they open up, you know, various parts of the animal.

266
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And there's a huge amount of blood on the on the grass.

267
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There's a lot of entrails spread around.

268
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I mean, we've seen this.

269
00:24:49,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So so it's it's pretty obvious complete contrast with that with the cattle mutilation is there's usually pretty precise cuts around the anus, for example, would be cored out.

270
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You can see the edges of the wounds on the hide and they're very sharp edges.

271
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I mean, it looks like some kind of a scalpel or a surgical instrument has been used a lot of the time.

272
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
A lot of the time you see eyes removed and you see a sort of a really sharp cut around the eyes.

273
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We've even looked at the hair on under a microscope of around the eyes and you can see how crisp the cuts are from around the eyes.

274
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Ears are a lot of the time lopped off.

275
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Sometimes, you know, the ear carries a plastic ear tag that the rancher uses to identify the animal.

276
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:50,000
A lot of time that plastic ear tag is gone, but the clean slice through the ear is very, very different, you know, from predators.

277
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Now, even even birds sometimes can can can cause sharp cuts, but not the plethora of sharp cuts that are very, very distinctive around the animal.

278
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The next really sort of defining characteristic is usually lack of blood.

279
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You know, when when you got cats or coyotes or wolves attacking cows, you know, the mess is unbelievable.

280
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:23,000
In many of these cases that we investigated, there's really no blood in the animal or underneath the animal or on the animal.

281
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So now that's not all cases, but it's some cases.

282
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We had we had a case that's been well documented in on the Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, for example, where, you know, an eighty four pound calf that had been born the night previously was found dead on the pasture.

283
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The rancher and his wife had tagged this animal just forty five minutes prior.

284
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,000
They were still in the pasture and sort of maybe two hundred three hundred yards away and their dogs started acting up.

285
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So they went to investigate and they found the mother of the calf that had been they had just tagged dragging its feet and sort of acting very strangely.

286
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
They came upon this calf that they had tagged forty five minutes previously.

287
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The calf was spread out on the pasture and there are photographs on the Internet of this.

288
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
We did a full report and we published it many times, but the calf was like spread, eagled out on the on the pasture, all four legs.

289
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Well, three legs were sort of spread out.

290
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
One of the legs was was about 10 feet away from the animal.

291
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But the interesting thing was that we flew up on Robert Bigelow's private jet.

292
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We were standing over that animal within seven hours of death.

293
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So the animal was still fresh.

294
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You could see the animal's pinkish flesh was not a drop of blood in the animal.

295
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Its entire body cavity was empty.

296
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
All you could see was the sort of the spine running down from head to head to stern of the animal.

297
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And the the legs were were spread out.

298
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It was almost like the calf had been very carefully laid on the grass, not a drop of blood in the animal underneath the animal.

299
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We actually went to the trouble of going to the local abattoir.

300
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:35,000
We got four liters of blood just in case, you know, this a lot of blood have had sort of seeped into the ground and disappeared.

301
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It had not rained during that period.

302
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So there was really no way that the blood had been washed off.

303
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
But the thing was not a single drop of blood on the animal.

304
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
When we poured blood on that grass, it was obvious.

305
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It was so obvious.

306
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The Gormans were especially sensitive because of the losses they'd already suffered out of a herd of 80 cattle.

307
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
They lost 14 head prior to the arrival of nids.

308
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Some disappeared. Others were sliced up.

309
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Twelve more cows and calves were killed while nids was on the ranch.

310
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Their neighbors, the Garcia's, lost several animals as well.

311
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Some of their cattle appeared to have been killed by being dropped onto the pasture from a great height.

312
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The cattle mutilation mystery has been reported in at least 15 states dating back to the 1960s.

313
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Thousands of animals have been sliced up with surgical precision, mostly under the cover of darkness.

314
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
If humans are doing it, not a single suspect has ever been caught.

315
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
For the Gormans, the livestock losses were devastating, both financially and psychologically.

316
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And then things got worse.

317
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
On March 10, 1997, Tom Gorman and his wife walked out of their home and into the pasture,

318
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
planning to tag the ears of several calves that had been born in the preceding days.

319
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It was a bright, clear morning. Snow was on the ground.

320
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Fifty yards from their house, they found the first calf.

321
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
They were with their dog. The two of them tagged and weighed this animal.

322
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They checked it at, I believe it was 84 pounds or 87 pounds.

323
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And they left the animal there with the mother.

324
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Everything seemed to be fine, although they did detect an odor in the air around this area.

325
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
They detected a strong musk smell.

326
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
They took note of it, and then they headed west.

327
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And they went about 300 yards west beyond, the dog run was not there at the time,

328
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
but about 300 yards beyond, towards where that incline is.

329
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And they were tagging a second animal.

330
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Only 30 to 40 minutes had passed.

331
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The Gormans had an unobstructed view of everything in the field,

332
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,000
but didn't see or hear anything unusual until their dog focused its attention back toward the house and the first calf.

333
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
The dog with them down here at this stage began to act really strangely.

334
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It started growling, the hair on the back of its neck went up,

335
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and it started facing back towards here, growling and snarling.

336
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And then it just took off west, away from this spot, it just took off, it was never seen again.

337
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
The Gormans were curious and walked back across the field.

338
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
First thing they saw was the mother of the animal was running back and forth,

339
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
kind of in a sort of half circle from about this area to the fence line,

340
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
just running back and forth and it was limping, I mean it was dragging its foot, it was limping.

341
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
They met the animal and they noticed that it was just totally out of breath,

342
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
it was panting, it was obviously in deep stress, and it was dragging one leg.

343
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And then they noticed the calf, or what was left of it.

344
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It spread eagle on the ground, just about here, it was lying with all four limbs just spread on the ground.

345
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
All of its internal body cavity was gone.

346
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It was completely, pretty well, all of its muscle was gone from the torso.

347
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The legs were still intact, but one of the ears was also gone.

348
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So they called NIDS.

349
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The rancher placed a call to the NIDS investigators who'd returned to Las Vegas for a rare weekend off.

350
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Within a few hours, a four-man team, including a veterinarian, was on the scene.

351
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Necropsy started and the first thing that the veterinarian noticed during the necropsy

352
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
was that the ear of the animal had been sliced off with a very sharp instrument, possibly a scalpel.

353
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And the ear had contained a very large plastic yellow tag, like an ear tag, that they had just put on and it was gone.

354
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So the necropsy proceeded, about ten feet away from the animal there was a femur,

355
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
one of the femurs had been forcibly ripped out of a ball and socket joint,

356
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
which is extremely difficult to do in terms of strength.

357
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It looked initially, superficially, like a massive predator had just laid waste to this animal,

358
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
removed 60 pounds of meat in 45 minutes, which we don't know of any predator that could have done that.

359
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And how could a predator inflict such carnage without being seen or heard by the rancher, his wife, or his dog,

360
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
who were a few hundred yards away in the same field on what was a quiet Sunday morning?

361
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
No four-legged predator known to science could do it.

362
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
The team gathered tissue and bone samples which were sent to three independent pathology labs.

363
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The results arrived later but confirmed what seemed obvious in the pasture that day.

364
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The calf had been carved up by someone wielding sharp, metallic instruments.

365
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
A heavy machete-like object had slammed into the bones,

366
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
a smaller scalpel-like knife had sliced the hide and muscle.

367
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But closer inspection revealed that it was definitely sharp instruments used.

368
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:17,000
There was no sign of blood, there was no sign of entrails around, it was perfectly clean, not a drop of blood on the grass.

369
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
We went even as far as doing an experiment by pouring blood in the grass to see how fast it would seep through.

370
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Videotaped the grass and showed, you know, even two days later you could still see the stain on the grass.

371
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So there was no blood whatsoever, not a single drop, either underneath the animal, on the animal, or on the grass.

372
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It was just completely clean.

373
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
A professional tracker was brought in.

374
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
He scoured every inch of ground in and around the field looking for tracks, human, animal, or vehicle.

375
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Nothing. Eventually the investigators reached an unsettling conclusion.

376
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The bottom line is this animal must have been killed elsewhere because there was no blood.

377
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
There was no blood on the scene and then the animal must have been brought back, laid down carefully,

378
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
almost, you know, really almost ritually on the spot where it had been tagged.

379
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The NIDS team investigated dozens of mutilation cases across the country.

380
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Many of the tissue samples were analyzed in NIDS own lab in Las Vegas and then double-checked by independent labs they hired.

381
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
The Utah calf was in a category all its own.

382
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It seemed akin to psychological warfare intended to shock and frighten the witnesses.

383
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
The following night there was another scare in the darkness of the first homestead.

384
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Shots were fired at something that had rattled the herd.

385
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Eventually, Colm Kelleher surmised that the perpetrators responsible for the calf were mechanical,

386
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
like an assembly line in a meatpacking plant.

387
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
A machine was involved with this carnage.

388
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Whatever happened to that calf was an extraordinary skillful job.

389
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
There's still people that'll say, oh, that's a predator.

390
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That was a mountain lion. That was a wolf.

391
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Obviously, it was, you know, teeth marks and torn.

392
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It's not a predator. It's not.

393
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You look for tracks. You had a professional tracker there.

394
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Right. No animal tracks, no person tracks, no vehicle tracks.

395
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Yes. I mean, we kind of did our due diligence.

396
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I mean, we kind of did our due diligence.

397
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
We hired a professional tracker and they tracked a two, you know,

398
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
two mile radius of that carcass and they covered every inch of the ground.

399
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I mean, they did find tracks in the snow.

400
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
There were very bizarre and mysterious tracks,

401
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
but they were not sort of anywhere close to the animal.

402
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
These were a couple of hundred yards away from the animal.

403
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And again, this is the broad daylight.

404
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The rancher and his wife are out there.

405
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
If there's a mountain lion chewing up this calf, they would have heard something.

406
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yeah, it didn't look like chewing.

407
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So that's it. So George covers this case a lot in my movie for the skinwalker,

408
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
you know, that you guys are featured in.

409
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But but I want to really get into this a little bit.

410
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So the volume of blood in these animals, so blood is missing.

411
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's not like it's just and that happened on multiple cases, multiple cases.

412
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So seven percent of the animal's body weight is blood.

413
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So even with a hundred pound calf, you know, seven percent of that is three point five liters.

414
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You should have buckets of blood all around the grass.

415
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And there was not a drop of blood.

416
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Now, as George mentions, you know, and not just one case, many, many, many cases.

417
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, I'm just giving you the example because we were standing over this calf.

418
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
We took a whole bunch of samples, blood samples and tissue samples.

419
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And sharp instruments had been used on the animal, scalpels, a scissor like instrument.

420
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But there was also teeth marks on the animal. It was very, very weird.

421
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Now, that was an anomaly in the case of normal cattle mutilations.

422
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Normally, what you've got is an ear is removed, an eye is removed.

423
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Sometimes there are wounds on the upper parts of the neck.

424
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But a lot of the time, the reproductive organs are removed.

425
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The anus is cored out.

426
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So it's sort of a classic series of tongue never cut.

427
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah, the tongue is sometimes removed.

428
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
OK, so you've got the blood out and then people I know.

429
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I mean, I talked with Gabe Valdez, who was the kind of head guy and who obviously.

430
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But I interviewed him right before he died at four hours, probably last.

431
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I know it's the last interview ever did. So here's the deal.

432
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's just audio. I wasn't really into this stuff back then to hide.

433
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You guys thought, hey, meet this guy in New Mexico. What year was that?

434
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'll have to look back and I'll get you. Yeah, that's interesting.

435
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I got the recording. But basically, some of the things that I just want to see

436
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
if it's confirmed by your interactions with this experience.

437
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So chemical analysis.

438
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Was there anything that was found like chemical analysis when you look at wounds and that kind of thing?

439
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yes, that sort of started getting very mysterious when we started doing

440
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
in depth chemical analysis of the blood in some of these animals.

441
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
We would find higher levels than there should be of.

442
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
We found a compound called oxendol, for example,

443
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
which is actually a sedative when used at high concentrations.

444
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But it's not a sedative that's used in the United States. It's used in Europe.

445
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So why would a sedative be in an animal in northeastern Utah on the pasture?

446
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
That's, you know, that's not used in the United States.

447
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We found high levels of succinate, which is a breakdown product of another anesthetic called succinylcholine.

448
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We work closely with a guy up in Montana called Captain Keith Wilburton,

449
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
who actually had done a sterling job back in the 70s and 80s

450
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
of investigating cattle mutilations around Great Falls, Montana.

451
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Well, Wilburton had found evidence of obvious puncture wounds in the animals jugulars.

452
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
They also found to drain the blood, possibly.

453
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Well, one of the one of the occasions they turned the animal over

454
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and they found this large hypodermic needle underneath the cow.

455
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And this was a really weird thing.

456
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But it started getting us thinking that there's more to this than meets the eye.

457
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So it, you know, we investigated dozens and dozens and dozens of different cases, cattle mutilation cases,

458
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:55,000
everywhere from Washington state to California, to Montana, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico.

459
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I mean, we covered the gamut and sort of we were able to sort of distinguish

460
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
two completely different MOs in the cattle mutilation.

461
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Two MOs. So what's the difference?

462
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Well, the first MO was the case.

463
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
One of the examples of the first MO was the case I just talked about

464
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
where the calf had been completely, you know, ripped apart and sort of laid on the pasture.

465
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
We found other cases in Northern California where, you know,

466
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
an eye had been very carefully removed and put on the grass facing the animal,

467
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
sort of a psychological sort of, I mean, the animal was dead, obviously,

468
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
and all of its entrails were gone.

469
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
But there was this eye, the animal's eye from its right eye,

470
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
was left carefully with all of the fluid inside the eye staring at the carcass.

471
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So this was not a typical animal mutilation.

472
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
We found a few of those, but by far the largest number we found

473
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
was the obvious sort of removal of the tongue, removal of the eye.

474
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Sometimes there was parts of the brain gone, removal of the reproductive organs.

475
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Was there a hole where they took the brain out kind of thing?

476
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
No.

477
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Or any kind of places where you had organs that are taken out without incision marks?

478
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Well, we came across that too, which was another very mysterious part.

479
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:35,000
For example, in northeastern Utah, we came across a case where this cow had been alive the previous day.

480
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
We did an necropsy the following day,

481
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and, you know, the pericardial sac which surrounds the heart was completely intact,

482
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:54,000
but the heart was shredded as if sort of this, you know, sliced and diced into a sort of a pulp.

483
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,000
But the pericardium, which you would normally have to get into in order to slice and dice the heart, was perfectly intact.

484
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Was there any kind of incision outside the cow that would allow them to get in there that you noticed?

485
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:15,000
There was an incision around the eye, but a direct route from the eye to the heart was, I mean, it was very, very difficult.

486
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
The second thing was that we did pregnancy analysis on the cow.

487
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
The cow had been pregnant and its womb was empty.

488
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You know, it had been obviously pregnant very recently, so no evidence of a fetus whatsoever.

489
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
We also came across different chemicals in that particular body that shouldn't have been there.

490
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I got to back up here for a second.

491
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So you personally studied this case where the pericardium sac is intact, only a hole in the eye, and there was a shredding of the heart.

492
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And that's not like the heart attack explodes the heart into shreds.

493
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
This is different from your personal observation.

494
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And there's other cases where fetuses are removed and there's no entry points that are obvious.

495
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Bones removed without incisions?

496
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
No, we never saw that actually.

497
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I mean, it just takes one strange thing.

498
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Hold on, you're talking about two MOs and I keep thinking about this thing you keep telling me called bisymmetrical mimicry.

499
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,000
If we're talking about these mutilations are being done by like Satanist people that come in, okay, well, no one's ever been caught.

500
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Okay, next one, someone's going to say it's a secret government program.

501
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You did find a syringe and some sedatives from another country.

502
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But does this relate to your idea of bisymmetrical mimicry?

503
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yes, partly, partly.

504
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah, it does.

505
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Now, another another example of medical equipment was Sheriff Tex Graves, Logan County, Colorado, which was a really big epicenter of calculations in the 1970s and 1980s.

506
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:59,000
We're talking hundreds and hundreds of cases in northeastern Colorado, which is a big beef part of, you know, center of the country.

507
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:11,000
In fact, the governor governor actually went up governor of Colorado went up in the 1970s to spec out what was going on because it was so prevalent.

508
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And he called it an outrage that so many cattle were going down and nobody seemed to know why.

509
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And he said it was one of the biggest outrages that he'd ever seen.

510
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:39,000
But anyway, Sheriff Tex Graves have been investigating a lot of these mutilations and he turned an animal over and found medical equipment underneath the animal that was capable of exsanguinating the animal, which is removing all the blood from the animal.

511
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So, you know, that case was not very well reported because it was overlaid on literally hundreds of other mutilations where there was no medical equipment found and no tracks and mysterious lights in the sky.

512
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So the sort of the general meme at the time was that, you know, there was mysterious lights in the sky that seemed to trigger these cattle mutilations.

513
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Therefore, there may have been, quote unquote, UFOs involved with with the, you know, the deaths.

514
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We investigated a lot of these cases and we found because of these medical associations, we postulated that some kind of sampling exercise might be going on at the same time as the, quote unquote, genuine mutilation.

515
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So that that sort of brings brings this whole bidirectional mimicry hypothesis.

516
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
What does that mean? I don't know what the word means.

517
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So so mimicry. Here we have a phenomenon that began, we think, in the 1950s, it probably began earlier.

518
00:46:47,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But, you know, a lot of the cases started emerging in the late 1950s and 1960s of cattle mutilations all the way through the western part of the United States and also up in Canada and actually in other countries, too.

519
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So here we have a phenomenon that's, quote unquote, genuine.

520
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But at the same time, we're finding these occasional cases where it's pretty obvious that somebody is using sedatives, is using hypodermic needles and is using medical equipment to exsanguinate animals.

521
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So we postulated that there were two things going on simultaneously that were causing a lot of confusion.

522
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
You've got, number one, a, quote unquote, genuine phenomenon.

523
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And number two, you've got this medical surveillance project that has been carried out knowing that, you know, most veterinarians will not touch a mutilated animal because the, quote unquote, aliens are associated with mutilated animals.

524
00:47:49,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So these small covert surveillance programs that are being carried out are being carried out knowing that the overall umbrella of cattle mutilations is protecting the perpetrators from being caught.

525
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So, I mean, that's the bidirectional mimicry. You've got the, quote unquote, real phenomenon.

526
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You've got a small program that's hiding underneath the phenomenon.

527
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And then you've got the phenomenon that's actually mimicking, you know, the government surveillance program.

528
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So you've got this, you can create these z plots, but the problem is that you're looking at cattle mutilations through the lens of two layers of deception.

529
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
You know, so you've got the layer of deception from the phenomenon.

530
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You've also got the layer of deception from the government program that is using cattle mutilations as a cover for a surveillance effort.

531
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So you've got two layers of deception.

532
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It's very, very difficult for an outsider coming into this to penetrate those two layers of deception.

533
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
You can draw exactly the same plot for the UFO phenomenon.

534
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You know, UFO phenomenon starts off as being genuine.

535
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Then you, I mean, we interviewed Colonel Barry Hennessey, who was the head of the infamous AFOSI PJ.

536
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
We interviewed him as part of the ASAP program.

537
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:34,000
This, I mean, he blatantly told us he didn't tell us on camera, but he told us that they had used the UFO phenomenon as a cover for their advanced projects.

538
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And this guy was part of the Air Force AFOSI.

539
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So so we have the same thing.

540
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
We've got a we've got a quote unquote genuine phenomenon.

541
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:54,000
We've got a series of advanced technology projects, special access program going on using the UFO as a cover.

542
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And then you've got this sort of reverse engineering setup that's going on that are creating these, you know,

543
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
special access programs that are happening.

544
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And then you've got the phenomenon that is mimicking these special access programs.

545
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
You know, you've got helicopters with impossible levels of acceleration.

546
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You've got, you know, craft flying around the place that look like triangular craft that that should be part of the Air Force arsenal.

547
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
But they're probably the phenomenon.

548
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So you've got this two layers of deception with the UFO phenomenon.

549
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So the question is, which we've been asking for decades, are they ours or theirs?

550
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
You eventually wrote a book about your ideas, Brain Trust, it was right where you're looking at the two levels.

551
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So there is a legitimate mystery, something carving up cattle, horses, sheep, dogs, cats, deer, other wild animals.

552
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It's not just it's not just cows that something has been doing this, taking particular parts.

553
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'd be interested in why those parts, what they, whoever they are, could learn from it.

554
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And then the secondary monitoring, either government or industry, that is tracking something through the food chain.

555
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
What were they looking for?

556
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
What could be learned based on the parts that are being taken from these various animals?

557
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Well, we put out the hypothesis at NIDS back in 2003.

558
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We were looking for what could possibly be of such interest that, I mean, normally if you want to track something, you go to slaughterhouses and you gather samples.

559
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I mean, there's no there's nothing mysterious about that.

560
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
But if you want to track spread of something through herds in the wild, the way you do it is illegal.

561
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I mean, you basically start sampling animals.

562
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
If it's wildlife, it's not illegal.

563
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But if these are cattle that are owned by ranchers, it is illegal.

564
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So you do it under under covert operations.

565
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Why wouldn't the government just have their own staple of cows that they would?

566
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah. Why would you go steal some of these cows?

567
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Because you're tracking something that's that's moving through the food chain in the in the west of the United States.

568
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
To us, to our food chain. OK.

569
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're eating cows.

570
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Right. But we're not eating the government's cows.

571
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So that's why they're.

572
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Well, I mean, the real kicker here is that there's a long history of I mean,

573
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
NIDS came up with the hypothesis that one of the possible infectious organisms

574
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,000
that could be traveling surreptitiously through the herds was what is called a prion,

575
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
which is an infectious protein, indestructible, indestructible.

576
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And it actually has destroyed a lot of the elk population,

577
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
a lot of the deer population in the western part of the United States and Canada.

578
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
But, you know, it also infects cows, it infects deers and elk.

579
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
So we we looked at the hypothesis that the infectious organism,

580
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:08,000
which is a very devastating disease, a brain disease called Christian Jacob syndrome,

581
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:15,000
where you're a human's brain turns to Swiss cheese in cows is called mad cow disease.

582
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And it erupted in the United Kingdom in the 1990s.

583
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And, you know, people who were who were eating infected meat came down,

584
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
young people came down with these devastating brain diseases where the brains became Swiss cheese

585
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
and they, you know, incurable, obviously.

586
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So the hypothesis that we were looking at is that this is so sort of toxic

587
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and very, very, I guess, inflammatory is that a covert program was was launched in the 60s and 70s

588
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:57,000
to see how far these prions might have got from wildlife into the food chain.

589
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
When you say covert, you mean a government decided?

590
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Well, probably a contractor.

591
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
A contractor on behalf of the government?

592
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yes.

593
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Did a covert program to track prions through the food chain?

594
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That was the hypothesis that we we were looking at, because there is, you know,

595
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
it was a very bizarre series of cause and effects that led to that hypothesis.

596
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But to cut a long story short, an NIH scientist out in Papua New Guinea

597
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
was investigating this bizarre brain disease that people in Papua New Guinea were coming down with.

598
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Cannibals.

599
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Yeah, there were cannibals.

600
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
They were eating their dead as a sign of respect.

601
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
But the problem with eating their dead was they were eating these people's brains

602
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and they were come down with this uncontrollable shaking and they would die soon,

603
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
you know, within a year or two of symptoms starting.

604
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So this guy, his name was Carlton Gajusek, he got the bright idea of, you know,

605
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
he was kind of like a James Bond type.

606
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:10,000
He would be out in the wilds and these people would be dying all over the place of this uncontrollable disease.

607
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
So we would open their skulls, take their brains out, which were infected with this thing,

608
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
and he would ship them back to the National Institutes of Health in the United States.

609
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
They all ended up in this place called Fort Detrick, Maryland,

610
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
which is a center of biological warfare research in the United States.

611
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
So they started in the 1960s.

612
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
They really had no idea what this causative agent was doing or what it was.

613
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
They thought it might be a slow virus.

614
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So they started injecting these brain slurries into every animal they could get their hands on,

615
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
everything like from chimpanzees.

616
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
They set up this sort of zoo-like area in Maryland.

617
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
There was actually a wildlife reserve in Maryland.

618
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
They started injecting deer, they started injecting chimpanzees, mice, rats,

619
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:11,000
anything they could lay their hands on to see if these animals would get sick, and a lot of them did.

620
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:18,000
But the problem with that is that the wildlife reserve was so poorly secure

621
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
that a lot of these animals escaped.

622
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And so the origin of this hypothesis is that this prion, which is a very slow way of dying,

623
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
was moving slowly through the food chain,

624
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:41,000
and there was a major outbreak of this prion disease in northeastern Colorado in the 60s.

625
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And so the cattle mutilation phenomenon erupted in northeastern Colorado around the same time,

626
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
roughly temporally.

627
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And so you've got all these sort of lights in the sky that were causing these animals

628
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
or associated with these animals dying.

629
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And so the hypothesis we put out was that they were actually monitoring the spread of these prions

630
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
as it spread through the cattle herds in northeastern Colorado.

631
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And then they found that they were spreading a lot quicker through the United States.

632
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And it's scary as hell.

633
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Collum's book, Brain Trust, tracks the spread of this.

634
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It really is through the food chain.

635
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Those animals get out, a deer is infected, it gets hit, and somebody grinds it up and feeds it to other animals.

636
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
These prions are indestructible, so now those animals have it.

637
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
So you've had cows eating cows, and they get it, and then they get ground up,

638
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
they get ground up and people eat them, and it goes into humans.

639
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
There's been an explosion, we don't call it mad cow anymore,

640
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
but other kinds of brain diseases, brain wasting diseases that nobody wants to talk about,

641
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
that nobody wants to admit might be related to this because they don't want to alienate the beef industry

642
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
or the pig industry.

643
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
They want people to keep on eating this stuff.

644
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah, so I remember this one time in Pioneer Town, you sat me down at a table,

645
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I was filming this adventure to go, there's a fresh cattle,

646
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
but you laid it out for me at that table.

647
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You're like, no, this is happening, it's much more, no matter what it is,

648
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
from lights in the sky to a government program to people running around,

649
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
no one's ever been caught, and you sat me at that table and you laid it out for me.

650
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I was astonished with the documentation that you were able to show me from the FBI on.

651
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
My question for you is, with the book Brain Trust,

652
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
did you publish this after these investigations with the NID stuff?

653
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Yeah.

654
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Okay, so you had direct first hand, but the book is not all about that part of the mystery,

655
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
it's about the prions and the tracking of this illness.

656
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yes, the majority of the book is about the tracking of the illness,

657
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
the origin in Papua New Guinea and the way it tracked into the United States

658
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
and then it tracked through different animals and wildlife through the United States.

659
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
One of the chapters does talk about cattle mutilations

660
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:10,000
and it does correlate the cattle mutilations with the surveillance program that was going on.

661
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I've seen it said in these broad statements,

662
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Colm Keller has explained the whole thing, they're all humans.

663
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It's monitoring something in the food chain, it's all explainable.

664
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
It's not all explainable though.

665
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
As far as a legitimate mystery, we still don't know who they are

666
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
and why they're taking these particular parts.

667
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Absolutely. I think we did enough research with NIDs in the 1990s,

668
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
especially with the cattle mutilation phenomenon,

669
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
to show there were two completely separate patterns of cattle mutilations

670
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
and one of them was not explicable through a surveillance program.

671
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It was way too weird, way too bizarre for a sampling exercise or a surveillance program.

672
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
We ended up that there were two classes of cattle mutilations

673
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
but that message really never got through that there were two classes of mutilations.

674
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Just like with the UFO phenomenon, black triangles, are they ours, are they theirs?

675
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Is it a special access program or is it UFOs?

676
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
You've got these massive black triangles

677
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and NIDs did a lot of research on the black triangle phenomenon.

678
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
We interviewed hundreds of witnesses around the United States

679
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
and we came up with the same kind of thing.

680
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:41,000
It seemed like there were impossibly large triangular craft

681
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
that were floating over neighborhoods at treetop level

682
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
that were so ridiculously brightly lit.

683
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,000
If this was a special access program, it was severely lacking in air safety protocols.

684
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
If this was an experimental aircraft flying over neighborhoods at treetop level,

685
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:10,000
gliding over neighborhoods, the Air Force would fire these pilots.

686
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It made no sense, but at the same time we know that triangular craft are being flown.

687
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:24,000
The B-1 and the B-21 are classic examples of what triangular craft would look like.

688
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,000
But you've got these two different origins of these triangular craft

689
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
and it comes up with the same thing.

690
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You're looking at this black triangle phenomenon through two layers of deception

691
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
and it's very, very difficult.

692
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
NIDs is such an amazing organization.

693
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Bigelow starts creating it in 1995

694
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and by that time I'd been friends with him for about six years, Robert Bigelow,

695
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and he's very ambitious.

696
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
He'd been giving out a lot of money to researchers, Stan Friedman, Bud Hopkins, Linda Howe,

697
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
all to go after their own special slice of the pie.

698
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It also offered money to these UFO organizations, none of whom could get along,

699
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
so he said, the hell with it, I'll create my own.

700
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So he starts putting NIDs together in 1995.

701
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
1996, the very first Science Advisory Board meeting is held at Park House in Las Vegas

702
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
and they asked me to come and speak.

703
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I was overwhelmed. I thought it was really cool, but overwhelmed looking around that room.

704
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
There's Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon.

705
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
There's Jacques Vallee, maybe the greatest UFO writer-thinker ever.

706
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
There's Hal Putoff, there's Kit Green,

707
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
only names I've sort of heard about in whispers in the UFO world.

708
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And then a lot of other academics who were equally impressive, Harrison Schmidt,

709
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
who was a US Senator at the time.

710
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I do a presentation on the Russia UFO files and it didn't really go anywhere.

711
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I mean, a couple of them were interested.

712
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Harrison Schmidt was kind of a jerk about that whole thing.

713
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
He wasn't buying it, it's all anecdotal.

714
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And it was the Russian Ministry of Defense files, but I was in.

715
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And after that meeting, that's when I told Harry Reid about it,

716
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
about this organization called NIDs.

717
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,000
A couple of months later is when Robert Bigelow hears about this ranch in Utah and buys it.

718
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And around the same time, he hires this young Irish guy named Colin Kelleher,

719
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
who I was allowed to interact with.

720
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I get over there, I don't know what he thought, why do I have to talk to this reporter?

721
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But he's telling me all this cattle mutilation stuff.

722
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
They start doing the Black Triangle investigation.

723
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
They're working on all kinds of cool things, including Skinwalker Ranch.

724
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And it's wonderful to be on the inside and to be able to hear this.

725
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
And it was also torturous to be there as a reporter and not being able to tell anybody any of it.

726
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
You couldn't just utter a word.

727
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
We ended up doing some stories. I interviewed young Colin.

728
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I think we talked about cattle mutilation stuff in one of them.

729
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And then later did a story on Black Triangles.

730
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And so we did, I was allowed to pierce the veil a little bit,

731
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
but couldn't say anything about the ranch at all.

732
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I just want to, again, I keep feeling like I have to back up.

733
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:15,000
So you have direct knowledge that our government was using the UFO phenomenon as cover in a way,

734
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
like what, like faking UFO encounters?

735
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Yeah, I mean, Colonel Barry Hannessey was legendary in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.

736
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
He ran a subset of that called an organization called PJ.

737
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:40,000
This was the sort of the really heavy duty counterintelligence organization.

738
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And so we interviewed him in 2009.

739
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Like counterintelligence about the UFO topic or a lot of things?

740
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Of the Air Force, all of the Air Force Office.

741
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
So a subset of that came up during our interview.

742
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:06,000
The only reason we interviewed Colonel Hannessey was because he was a legend in this field.

743
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And we had heard rumors that the Air Force had utilized the UFO phenomenon

744
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
to cover various special access programs.

745
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:26,000
A good example was an early version of the F-117 had crashed near Dulce, New Mexico in the 80s.

746
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And so there was a UFO lore grew up around that part of New Mexico.

747
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
And it was perpetrated by agents of AFOSI.

748
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:43,000
So it was very convenient for the Air Force to have a lot of people talk about, you know,

749
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:53,000
alien UFOs crashing in northern New Mexico when actually an early prototype of the F-117 had crashed in northern New Mexico.

750
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
So that was an example of sort of a marriage of convenience.

751
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And other examples that Colonel Hannessey gave us was there was a very famous set of sightings

752
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:12,000
in what was called the Northern Tier missile bases that spanned between Canada and the United States.

753
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
It was luring Air Force Base in Maine and Wurtsmith Air Force Base,

754
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Maastrom Air Force Base, Minot Air Force Base right across the Northern Tier.

755
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:35,000
A lot of those bases during the 1970s had incursions from very weird sort of UFO type activity.

756
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
But Colonel Hannessey told us some of those were ours.

757
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:48,000
You know, some of those were direct penetration attempts to see, to assess and evaluate the security level of these Air Force bases.

758
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
But he flat out said some of them were not ours.

759
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Some of them were theirs.

760
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So it was this discrepancy between some are ours and some are theirs.

761
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
But the Northern Tier sightings are usually associated with only UFO activity.

762
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
But we know from what Colonel Hannessey told us that it was both.

763
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Right. And so, you know, I've talked to certain pilots.

764
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Have you ever seen a UFO?

765
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
There were military pilots that have flown special craft, you know, and they're like, no, but I've been one.

766
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
You know, it's like the misidentification.

767
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But I think what's hard for people to unravel it because it was hard for me to really get this,

768
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
which is that you've got this real phenomenon of unknown, which is definitively,

769
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
we'll just say unknown at this time, are not ours or not a nation that we know of on planet Earth that we're aware of.

770
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Let's call them them.

771
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Them. There's some, there's some.

772
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:47,000
But there's also this misidentification issue when it comes to our military technology.

773
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
But there is a process for that.

774
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And eventually the people investigating it, they're able to see that was ours.

775
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
You know, don't waste resources on that.

776
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
And there's a whole protocol and process.

777
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:07,000
And a lot of people that want to dismiss this topic, they're always saying, well, this is a foreign tech or this is a black US project.

778
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I've gone through it ad nauseam, like how that doesn't apply, how at the highest levels when people knock on doors, they get to they're wasting resources.

779
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
These are not ours.

780
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And that's so hard for people who don't want to look at the facts to understand.

781
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:31,000
But you're telling us these different layers, they all exist simultaneously, which is even harder to grasp as a big topic.

782
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Now, I do want to kind of get into this one idea that one of the reasons why I'm stoked you're talking with us like openly here like this.

783
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Man, I've heard you guys talk.

784
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I know what's going on to a high degree is that you ran like you ran the largest acknowledged UFO program in the history of our military that's acknowledged.

785
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And that was called OSAP, hired through the DIA contract.

786
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But you were the principal who ran the day to day the investigations.

787
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Is that correct? You overshot all.

788
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Thank you.
