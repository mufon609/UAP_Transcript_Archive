00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Hello and welcome to Reality Check. Before we start I want to tell you a

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,440
little bit about our sponsor for this week. It's the iconic Chuck Norris, a guy

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,120
I used to have on my bedroom wall. The martial artist hero who's still in his

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,720
80s and still kicking butt and still staying active. What's even more shocking

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,320
is he's stronger, he can work out longer and he even has plenty of energy left

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,720
over for his grandkids. He did this by making just one change and he says he

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,960
still feels like he's in his 50s. His wife even started doing this one thing

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,040
too and she's never felt better. She says she feels 10 years younger, her body

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,800
looks leaner and she has energy all day. Chuck made a special video that explains

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,680
everything. Make sure you watch it by going to chuckdefense.com slash Ross.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,200
That's this link below this video. It will change the way you think about your

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:09,760
health. Once again that's chuckdefense.com slash Ross. Now let's get on and enjoy the show.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,640
G'day and welcome to Reality Check. So you've seen the full NewsNation special

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,520
investigation Hunting UFOs where we detailed the allegations of a first-hand whistleblower

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,040
for the very first time telling the inside story of the retrieval of non-human craft.

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,520
I know it's an extraordinary allegation to make and there's millions of armchair experts out there

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,760
who think they know everything about this story. Well today for the first time the bloke who told

18
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,400
that story to me on NewsNation is telling his full account, the full interview for the first time.

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:04,640
Jacob Barber is a guy I first met two years ago and he's not used to the limelight. He's

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,840
fundamentally somebody who's been trained in intelligence. He's been trained in how to operate

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,640
in the covert world and the only reason he's going overt is because he thinks you, the public,

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,040
have a right to know about the illegal and criminal and improper things that he believes

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,320
are going on inside what he calls the program. But be aware that, I think as George Herbert once said,

24
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,600
the life of a spy is to know, not be known. It's difficult for any person to make the decision to

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,600
step out into the limelight, let alone the excoriating glare of many hostile people who

26
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,320
are looking for any excuse to pull Jake down from his pedestal. And the interesting thing is

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,520
he wants to be investigated. He wants the government, the congress, to tackle this story

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:02,640
and begin the slow exposition of what he knows. And it's a difficult story I think for a lot of

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,200
people to grasp because the scale of it and the implications of it are immense. Not only does it

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,080
mean that there is a non-human intelligence that's been engaging with this planet and

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,680
contrary to what the Pentagon says, we've known about it for decades. It also means, of course,

32
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,000
that the government or sections of the government have been lying to us and continue to lie to us.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,600
And that's an egregious breach of public faith and at some stage there is going to be a reckoning.

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,400
But ultimately the big decision now for congress and for the new Trump administration is whether

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,240
they take the allegations of Jacob Barber seriously. So he wants and we've always intended

36
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,960
for his full story to be told. So here today for the very first time is the full interview

37
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,440
with Jake Barber, a great and loyal American who wants you to know the truth. Hey Ross,

38
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,400
my name is Jacob Barber and for the last 30 years I've worked for the US government and

39
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,240
its private partners in both an official capacity as an enlisted man in the United States Air Force

40
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,160
and in a non-official capacity for the broader intelligence community as a contractor. Over

41
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,520
the last three decades my work has been very diverse and has included the recovery of downed

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,960
UAP of non-human origin. I am pleased to share that as of a couple weeks ago I have fulfilled

43
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,640
a promise to our friend David Grush by getting myself into a skiff with congress and I have

44
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,440
provided top secret SCI testimony on the subject matter of UAP. With this behind us I'm pleased to

45
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,640
be at a place where I can share information with the public. The type of information I can share

46
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,640
will be limited by my DOPSR restrictions and personal restrictions I have set in order to

47
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,560
protect the privacy and quality of life of my friends family and colleagues. So with that

48
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:07,760
let's talk. So Jake, you've just made an historic revelation that we are not alone. How did it feel?

49
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,640
Felt pretty good actually. Get that off my chest. You've lived with this secret for how long?

50
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,640
You could say more than a decade. So let's roll back. Let's tell the story of Jake Barber.

51
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,320
Okay. You say you were an enlisted man and then you ended up working for the intelligence community

52
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,120
as a contractor. Tell me that story. How did that happen? Well in high school I was 17 years old.

53
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,120
I was prospected into a program, an enlistment program. It was a guaranteed enlistment or

54
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,640
guaranteed training enlistment program contract for a specific career field at the time called

55
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,280
Combat Control. Career field is still called that. The contract was unique at the time.

56
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,160
It was a 10-year commitment to Air Force Special Operations. I finished my screening for that

57
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,760
program in September of 1994. I shipped off to Air Force Basic Training. Upon completion of that

58
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,120
I went to a place known as Operating Location Hotel. This was Air Force Special Operations

59
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,600
selection. I completed selection roughly four months later and then entered into what is known

60
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,840
as the pipeline. The pipeline is approximately a two-year specialized training schedule where

61
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,680
you go to a number of schools. At a certain point in my pipeline I was approached by some individuals

62
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,880
who had a discussion with me and convinced me it might be a good idea to consider becoming an

63
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:47,600
airplane mechanic. Was that to be your cover? Yes, yes. Because I noticed your DD214 which is

64
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,200
your release discharge document from the U.S. Air Force which you've provided us. It says you're

65
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,560
an aerospace mechanic. I was. I was a mechanic. I spent a lot of time on the flight line at Pope

66
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,040
Air Force Base and an obscure maintenance shop known as the Dash 21 dual rail shop and I spent

67
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,920
a lot of time there in my cover capacity and I worked hard. You're constrained very heavily

68
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,720
aren't you by what's called a defense office pre-publication security review. Correct. And

69
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,720
that's called ADOPSA for short. Yes. And if you accidentally or deliberately reveal information

70
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,600
that they've told you that you're not allowed to reveal you can go to jail for the rest of your life.

71
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,720
Yeah they've created quite a landmine of words to avoid. So there are certain agency names,

72
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,480
certain designations in the military that you're not allowed to reveal or use. Yes and for good

73
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:47,120
reason. Let me clarify something though. You were trained as a top special operations soldier. Upon

74
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,040
completing that I was given orders to Pope Air Force Base where I spent a lot of time actually

75
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,560
working in a maintenance capacity in an obscure maintenance shop known as the Dash 21 dual rail

76
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,240
shop. My time outside of that was spent in any number of clubs you could say. I was a member

77
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,240
of many clubs where I got an opportunity to do a lot of interesting training. You were given

78
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,120
extensive special operations training. I trained in things like survival. I was in parachute club.

79
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,840
I was in scuba club. I was in weapons club. I was in pilot club. I even was in Spanish club.

80
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,680
I was in entrepreneur club, paramedic club. So they were fully training you for whatever that

81
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:41,040
covert role was going to be. Nobody was training me. I was there on my own free will out of my own

82
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,880
interest and trained in a number of clubs. A mechanic but you were training yourself in a

83
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,480
whole range of different skills and I noticed your DD214 document it actually shows that you've got a

84
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,320
sharpshooter's achievement. Yes, yeah. So how many mechanics have a sharpshooter's achievement?

85
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,600
Not many. I will say that the standard for marksmanship in the Air Force is pretty low

86
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,360
but I did qualify as expert marksman in a number of small arms. Right and you've also I noticed

87
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:19,200
you're able to talk about the fact that you earned a commendation for the use of

88
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,160
combat medical skills to help save the lives of two men in a horrible accident.

89
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,400
Yeah that's the interesting thing is every once in a while my club skills would show up

90
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,400
in the ordinary Air Force. Part of what goes on when things are heavily compartmentalized is often

91
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:43,520
the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing and so serving in my capacity is what is

92
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:52,080
known as an OPFOR, an oppositional force. By the time I was deeply immersed in my club training

93
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,800
I soon began to be deployed as what's known as a red team member. I became a red team expert.

94
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,720
So an opposition force person what do they do? Just explain to me what you do.

95
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:10,160
So OPFOR is the bad guys. So an OPFOR is a utility team and that team's utility as in

96
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,560
pressure testing or stress testing the effectiveness of blue what are known as

97
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,680
blue forces which are the good guys. So OPFOR is trained to deploy their own intuition

98
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,680
and innovation in order to make the regular soldier's lives hell and that was where I was

99
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,440
uniquely qualified and was deployed in that fashion in a number of real world scenarios

100
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,600
and training scenarios. Now it's a very useful set of skills that you acquired in the Air Force.

101
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:52,480
Yes. You've essentially had the training of a top tier one operator at if you like Delta Force or

102
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:00,960
STS-24 level which is the top US Air Force elite group but you were not a top tier one operator.

103
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,040
That is correct. There's no evidence that I was ever assigned to any task force that was associated

104
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:15,680
with those teams you just mentioned. What were you? What was I? Ross I was a highly talented

105
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,320
airplane mechanic who got to deploy on a number of presidential support missions. I was a security

106
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:30,480
escort for what are known as HVTs all over the world. I also worked I deployed in Bosnia in

107
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,800
support of the hunt for war criminals. So why do countries like America have covert people like

108
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,480
yourself? What's the purpose of it? Well there's a lot of utility in what you could call a hidden

109
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,840
hand. For better or for worse the US government and its agencies tend to paint themselves into

110
00:11:49,840 --> 00:12:00,320
a corner and they're bound by their own regulations and rules of play which makes it extremely

111
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,840
valuable to be able to outsource to folks who don't have to follow those same rules.

112
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,840
So you were operating outside of the normal rule book but to be clear there's nothing wrong with a

113
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,520
covert role. The US government uses covert operators all the time. Absolutely it's 100%

114
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,680
in the best interest of everyone in this country and to maintain superiority from a national

115
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,720
security standpoint that we play the game that way. And do you regard yourself as a patriot?

116
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,040
Absolutely first and foremost before anything else and I'd like to be clear let's do this

117
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,800
right now. I'd like you to know exactly what side I'm on. Firstly I'm on the side of my family and

118
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,000
my friends. Second I'm on the side of the American people and I'm on the side of the government and

119
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,560
the military. Third and only as long as they're taking care of the first two. In that time when

120
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:58,240
you were being trained learning all these skills did you have any idea about aliens? No not at all.

121
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,560
One way you can validate that you were doing special work is that you were actually recommended

122
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,880
for a heroism medal weren't you? The US Air Force? I was. And you're not allowed to talk about that

123
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:18,480
operation are you? No there was a classified missions that took place in Bosnia and but every

124
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,320
once in a while things showed up in my record and at some point I had the presence of mind to start

125
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,640
making copies of certain things which was a little nerve-racking because it may have been illegal

126
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,640
that I was in possession of certain things but this was a letter recommendation that

127
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:42,080
that calls out my particular act of heroism. Were you awarded that medal? No it was squashed by my

128
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,320
case officer. And do you think it was squashed because they didn't want you to be conspicuous?

129
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,440
Yeah because what the hell would an aircraft mechanic be doing chasing war criminals in Bosnia

130
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,040
and doing so to the extent that he would find himself in a situation that would be worthy of

131
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,960
a medal of heroism. Now you can't name the agency the organization that you were working for can

132
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,440
you? No. You're forbidden by your DOPSA? Forbidden. At any stage during any of the training that you

133
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:17,680
received was anyone ever telling you that you were part of a government that was aware of the

134
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,960
existence of non-human intelligence? No not at that time and I'll have to tell you that

135
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:33,520
that everything changed for me right around 9-11 and I left the Air Force and basically made a left

136
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,760
turn at Albuquerque never part of the global war on terror and quite literally made a left turn

137
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,960
at Albuquerque and was sent out to California at that time to begin establishing my cover basis

138
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,720
for an independent as an independent contractor so that I can serve what was coming down the

139
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:02,080
line next for me and that is the path which led to the UAP subject. In your time in deployment

140
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,360
you met certain people from an aerospace company didn't you? Yes I did. Now it's also part of the

141
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,680
constraints you operate under that you can't name that aerospace company? Correct there's no good

142
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,320
reason to name them even if I wasn't constrained. What were they doing there? Well they were

143
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,680
supporting us with some new weapons technology that could be used to

144
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,560
disable vehicles and aircraft. I can disclose this my understanding is that they were essentially

145
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,080
using it was actually I think it's a meta republic record that microwave weapons,

146
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,000
pulse microwave weapons were being used at that time. Correct there were some early prototypes

147
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,960
that were being used at that time and I met individuals that were there representing the

148
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,840
companies that were providing that service to the government made some friends and those

149
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,920
relationships led to opportunities later in the California desert where I began my journey. Before

150
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,480
we go any further had you ever as a child experienced any kind of anomalous phenomena yourself?

151
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:10,480
No. This was completely off the books for you it was complete revelation to you. I mean I was born

152
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,200
in the 70s I grew up a fan of Star Wars and Star Trek and Back to the Future and it certainly was

153
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:24,640
a pleasant and fun idea but during that same time it was also very clear that the culture

154
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:32,720
it was clearly nostalgic like the subject matter of UAP and non-human intelligence which wasn't

155
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:40,160
an acronym we used back then aliens let's say that it was 100% a fictional story so while I

156
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,800
was interested in it it was purely as a adolescent from being interested by any other fictional

157
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,760
subject. Before we get into the nitty-gritty of what happened after 2001 let's talk about

158
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,120
what you perceive are the rights and responsibilities of American citizens under

159
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,680
your constitution. As an enlisted man did you swear an oath to the constitution? I sure did

160
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,200
How much do you care about the ideas and the principles that are espoused in the U.S.

161
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:18,240
Constitution? Those ideas are absolutely paramount they come above everything else even though I

162
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:27,360
mentioned my family and my friends are whose side I'm on first I cannot facilitate protecting them

163
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,680
without the fundamental nature of the U.S. Constitution so it is paramount to everything

164
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,840
else. Is it fair to say that the reason why you're speaking to us here today is because you

165
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,040
think it's important that the American people be told about what we're going to disclose in

166
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:54,480
accordance with the constitution? Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution enshrines the idea that all

167
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,520
arms of government must be transparent and accountable to the congress. Is that happening?

168
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,640
You know I can't really speak to that from what we're being told there is no evidence

169
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,720
of extraterrestrial presence here there is no evidence of non-human intelligence

170
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,560
there's a little bit of admittance and evidence that there's something anomalous in the sky

171
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:27,040
flying around and we don't know what it is so the bad news is I can't really help further that

172
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,720
question that everyone wants answered the good news is I'm going to begin to be able to start

173
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,400
answering that question and that's the primary reason I'm here to speak to you today. Do you

174
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:49,200
think congress is being misled, deceived about what is secretly known about non-human intelligence

175
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,760
alien life? It's clear they don't have the full story. What's being held back?

176
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,280
Just about everything but there's another problem I don't even know that they're giving it a proper

177
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:07,840
attention to begin with so unfortunately congress is very ignorant when it comes to the subject.

178
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,640
So very recently the pentagon spokesman assured press reporters in a pentagon briefing

179
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:21,040
that there is no evidence of extraterrestrial engagement with planet earth. Is that true?

180
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,040
Is that true? No that's not true. Now they like to hang their hat on some key words there

181
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,920
extraterrestrial so that means outside of the planet earth and that is yet to be determined

182
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:41,920
by my best understanding. So you're saying you know for a fact there are aliens? Yes 100%.

183
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,480
There are alien craft? 100%. Have you been involved in the recovery of those

184
00:19:50,480 --> 00:20:00,000
alien craft? Well Ross yes I have. How does it feel to say that? I'm kind of over it like this

185
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,080
has been a fact I had to get over it wasn't easy when it when it first hit you but that was years

186
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:13,360
ago and it's actually quite therapeutic to get to talk about it and I'm encouraged that it's becoming

187
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,840
commonplace because that's where it needs to be for us to move forward and start gathering some

188
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:25,200
evidence which we intend to do. So you're building up a cover in California shortly after 9-11 what

189
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,760
are you doing? Well I'm doing a number of things one trying to fill out a sensible explanation for

190
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,840
my backstory I mentioned one of the clubs I was in was pilot club and you'll speak to my good friend

191
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,640
Don Paul here shortly who I met during that time but there's no record of that so I actually

192
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,160
one of the first things I did is I had to go to commercial pilot school in order to create a

193
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,400
legitimate training record so that I could operate in an official capacity this time as a

194
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:03,680
helicopter pilot. So you'd learned how to fly as a covert operator but they didn't give you a

195
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,840
license for it in the military no because you weren't allowed to have that qualification

196
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,760
because that would undermine your cover I suppose correct so you had to go and pretend to not be a

197
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,600
pilot in order to get your commercial yeah that was loads of fun actually I was I found it quite

198
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,600
challenging to pretend I didn't know how to fly so it's amusing yeah you must have blitzed it

199
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,880
well pretending to be bad was quite easy in the beginning the hardest part was faking a natural

200
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,880
learning curve so how to show that I'm getting better in a progression that they've seen before

201
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,040
so that was fun a few times I took the liberty to mess with my flight instructor but he just thought

202
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,160
I got got lucky so this happened for what a couple of years yeah a number of things were done so

203
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,360
one of the rules we go by is that legitimacy is the best cover so in order to provide a certain

204
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,920
utility to the government by way of a contractor I have to go and establish a lot of legitimate

205
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,280
businesses I have to function in a legitimate way under existing contracts to build a cover a cover

206
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,440
is not a hollow shell it has to be layers deep and the best way to have many layers of cover

207
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,560
is to just go do something genuine to begin with so let's be clear about this you're a very

208
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:30,400
financially successful businessman in your own right you've done well in business yes you are

209
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,800
not being paid by us or anyone to do this interview no no in fact you're deriving no

210
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:44,160
financial benefit or in kind benefit at all from doing this interview no why are you speaking to

211
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,960
us today well because I've got some good news okay so I know everyone's been waiting for people

212
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,800
like me to speak out and we haven't been doing nothing the past several years there's been a

213
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:04,640
lot going on and I'm very pleased to share that we are moving forward in an official and transparent

214
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,000
capacity to explore the answer to these questions that there appears to be no evidence for and our

215
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,880
number one goal now is to function in a private capacity with the backing of venture capitalists

216
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,600
and in coordination with some of the most key departments in the government in order to start

217
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,680
answering these questions in a transparent way related to the UAP topic are you a front

218
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,240
am I a front yeah I mean you've worked obviously in counterintelligence

219
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,160
you're a trained intelligence operative is this some kind of disinformation proper

220
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,280
propaganda operation no and I'm going to say no and I'm going to tell you I'm not lying to you

221
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,800
but unfortunately there's no way that I can convince you of that if if that's what you're

222
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,840
thinking a lot of people watching this will be thinking oh you can never trust a spook

223
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,960
you know there's obviously wheels within wheels this is part of some official government disclosure

224
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,120
operation yeah is it no it's not and again I'm not going to be able to make you believe that

225
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,240
but what I can invite you to do is I'll paraphrase the book of Matthew you will know us by our fruits

226
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,320
so I'd like to invite you to stay tuned in and watch what our new project is about to do and

227
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,000
prepare to be dazzled so you're proposing you're part of a team that is proposing

228
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:37,600
to do private retrievals of alien technology yes yes and you've got the backing for it

229
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:48,400
yes wow so let's talk about now what you do know okay when you finally secured your pilots training

230
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,920
in the commercial world what happened while I was getting my pilots training I was also working

231
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:01,040
to set up a number of businesses in order to pursue government contracts for from the doi

232
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:09,200
the dod and all their all the organizations and departments within those and mostly what we did

233
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:16,080
a lot like in the 90s you know the cover capacity takes up the the most most of your time is spent

234
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,880
operating in the cover capacity so you were working in legitimate businesses

235
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,800
earning a living like everybody else like everyone else you're just waiting for the call

236
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:31,280
waiting for the call the you know the incidental benefits of the the capabilities of the companies

237
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:39,040
you set up are those benefits that are on standby to be deployed in the subject matter of uaps

238
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,680
so you've set up all those legitimate businesses when did you get the call so as an helicopter

239
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,160
operator we provide a number of services to a number of departments within the military

240
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,280
industrial complex and that includes the department of the interior as well as the doi

241
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,760
the department of the interior has a number of other departments within it and we worked

242
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,360
mostly in those for our conus or within the continental united states those operations

243
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:16,640
include things like firefighting long haul short haul which is our external loads for helicopters

244
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,200
working for the bia bureau of indian affairs anything you could do to provide utility

245
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,040
anything that you could do with the utility of a helicopter we were put to task on now at this

246
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:35,680
stage there was no indication of any anomalous phenomena at all no when did you first start

247
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:42,320
becoming aware of strange objects in the sky during your work well a lot of the work we did

248
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,920
on was on what i call the range and the range is a particular geographical area where

249
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,440
the u.s government and its private partners use to test all kinds of things

250
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,440
weapon systems and resilience to weapon systems of certain craft and so you see a lot of exciting

251
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,880
things and i have to remind you that my particular role is very basic security and

252
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,920
transportation it gets a little broad as you drill down but i'm a security and transportation

253
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,760
expert and that's the service we provided broadly provided to the to the government and its partners

254
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,440
so you start seeing at the range yes interesting objects well yeah it's always interesting out

255
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:35,040
there you know my it was a process for me getting to the point until we had our first

256
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,080
experience with something that was obviously non-human in origin but up until that time

257
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,720
there's lots of interesting things in the sky i can tell you that our technology and by our i

258
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,240
mean anything that lies within the inventory of the united states government its private partners

259
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,720
is pretty spectacular there are some cool things and from an observer's standpoint on the ground

260
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:04,400
it's it's hard to tell exactly what's going on things come in and out of sight things disappear

261
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,400
for a moment and reappear things to seem things seem to move very quickly things change color they

262
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:16,960
change shape and a good reference for this is i'm sure we've all seen these drone shows like they

263
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,840
could put on at the super bowl halftime or other places and those are pretty amazing to see visually

264
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,720
amazing but we all know that's human tech and we accept it but if you kind of think about that and

265
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:36,320
think about perhaps what we might be doing privately in the interest of national security

266
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,280
your imagination could fill in the blanks on what you might see on a test range that's being used

267
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,160
by the u.s government its partners i mean i guess we all expect that this technology that we don't

268
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,120
know about that's being kept confidential for very good reasons because the united states doesn't

269
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,520
want foreign adversaries to know that it has an aerospace advantage or a weapons advantage over

270
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,600
a potential rival and were you telling yourself that for a long time when you started seeing

271
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,000
anomalous objects on the range yeah because just like it is now you kind of have to train yourself

272
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,480
even once you become a believer in the uap subject and you take some folks outside who

273
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,920
are believers and they look up they get really excited and falsely identify a satellite as a uap

274
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,680
or something else in the sky an airplane that has you might not be able to see its

275
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,920
position lights or its strobe so you know what lou elizondo has described as the five observables

276
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,400
instantaneous speed incredible hypersonic speeds transmedium travel water to air air to water

277
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,600
positive lift some kind of propulsion system that isn't explained by conventional systems

278
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,640
and stealth so you were seeing objects that complied with those weird observables yes

279
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:06,480
um and at that time you would also see things when you talk about the uh i'm sorry the trans

280
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,480
transmedium so um one of those that that would raise your eyebrows more of the transmedium

281
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:22,400
characteristics because things would come from the ground like from the earth from a ridge from a

282
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,960
mountain or it could pass through so they'd come out of the ridge out of a ridge yeah now that is

283
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,760
clearly technology that is certainly not known now again that is the that is the visual understanding

284
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:43,920
of what what you're seeing and was that human technology you just don't know i just don't know

285
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:51,760
yeah that i do not so there came a time though where you began to realize that this was something

286
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,440
else well let me let me add to we also know of circumstances and you'll speak to some of my

287
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:05,360
teammates here where we did recover things that were that were exotic in nature in the sky and

288
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,880
we know they were classified craft and we recovered them and took them back to where they go and that

289
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,080
was a that was a regular thing so there are things that we're trying to protect that are far beyond

290
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,920
what we know about publicly yeah much like everything in my story that we're talking about

291
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,800
80 to 90 percent of the time it's very ordinary and boring once you get acclimated to the to

292
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:36,800
the lifestyle it's but for a five or ten percent that is the most outrageous and exciting time

293
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:43,280
of your life but the majority of what we see and do is explainable and is ordinary and is known

294
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:51,840
by many people and is not not classified but there is a certain percentage which is extremely

295
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:59,200
sensitive and that extremely sensitive bit does include what we know is our own man-made advanced

296
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:06,320
technology and we we work we work to our our recovery efforts if this is where we're going

297
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,840
with the conversation when we look at a recovery mission or a crash recovery team you don't put

298
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:20,400
together a team like that with the intent of recovering non-human craft that that team is

299
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,240
trained and provided the training and tools and technology to conduct a recovery mission

300
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:34,640
for a number of objects and craft but in the rare occasion or let's say the hypothetical occasion

301
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:43,040
something of a non-human origin or source were to interface with the ground you would deploy that

302
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:50,720
same team and that is the segue and how we got involved with this particular subject so tell me

303
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:59,200
about the moment when you realized that you were involved in a retrieval of non-human technology

304
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,120
alien tech so it became very clear the first time we recovered something that was non-human

305
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:12,160
in origin that it was precisely what we were dealing with our communications changed our

306
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:20,000
communication process and procedure was modified it was also clear to everyone on the team that

307
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,160
what we were dealing with was something that was unexpected versus expected and then just visually

308
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:32,000
looking at the object on the ground you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous it

309
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,440
was it was not human how close did you get well i was a helicopter pilot and i operate with a 150

310
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:47,680
foot to 200 foot long line so i got within 150 feet of this object what did you see i saw an egg

311
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:55,760
a white egg how large was the object i would say approximately 20 feet plus or minus a little bit

312
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:04,000
about the size of a large suv did it have any seams no what and it was pure pure white it was

313
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,920
like pearly white like a metallic pearly white the best i could i could assess i mean what you're

314
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:16,080
describing sounds something like something out of a tv show yeah well fortune i'm going to share

315
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,160
some images with you and you can see one of these flying in the sky if you like in broad daylight

316
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,320
so you actually saw it in the sky before no not this one but in our new venture we've already

317
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,080
begun work and we're capturing since the data of the exact same craft flying in the sky how did you

318
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:39,920
know that that egg-shaped object was non-human in origin well visually after seeing all kinds of

319
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,880
things in my past it was clearly something that was ridiculously looking it's inconsistent with

320
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,160
anything i'd ever seen before i can also tell you that the reaction by my team who was very

321
00:34:52,160 --> 00:35:00,720
experienced was was not was atypical we changed our our we modified our entire process for recovery

322
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,280
that night our communication process changed we all knew we were dealing with something

323
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:15,200
extraordinary and in addition to that it has also been verified by me by high ranking members of

324
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:23,920
the uip uap task force that what we recovered that night was in fact known in hi craft so the

325
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,560
implications of that are actually quite shocking it it means the government's lying to us which

326
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,520
shouldn't come as any surprise to us but we're being lied to i don't i can't comment on that

327
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:42,400
because i don't know what the government knows this this operation yeah i just can't comment

328
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,680
to that because uh do you think it's possible that there are even senior people in the pentagon

329
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,040
who aren't aware of what you know absolutely there are senior people in all branches of

330
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,000
government that are unaware what's going on at the bottom so when general air force general pat

331
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,280
rider speaks at a press briefing in the pentagon and says there is no evidence of extraterrestrial

332
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,440
visitation or engagement with planet earth he might actually be telling the truth because he

333
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,520
hasn't been read in like you correct now you have what's called i understand a top secret

334
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,800
sci clearance you have compartmented intelligence clearance to certain programs my clearance is

335
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,520
given like on as a as like an as needed basis so like when i go it's not like i go there's no

336
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,880
record of me having top secret clearance anywhere but i get well there is because in the documents

337
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,680
that you've showed us there is one document that shows a nato top secret clearance and what does

338
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:48,000
that mean uh that means you are cleared to the highest level that you that you need to be in

339
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,680
order to function in the capacity that you've been assigned on a particular mission and it's

340
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,640
quite a high clearance it's very high clearance and so the best effort was done to secure your

341
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,440
cover and as part of protecting that cover it wasn't allowed to be known that you had high

342
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,760
clearances but what you have been able to demonstrate to us is that you were in fact

343
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,120
given high clearances as part of your role yeah the clearances kind of accompanied me like a

344
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:22,880
shadow if i got deployed on a particular mission let's use an aircraft an hvt mission for example

345
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,720
high value target high value target i spent a lot of time in the 90s living out of a hotel room at

346
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,280
pope air force base with a pager that that was our technology back then so i'll give you a short

347
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,440
story that'll tie this together so a typical situation for me would be told to go stay at

348
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,760
the lodging on base and i could travel to the chow hall i could travel to the gym but i had

349
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,040
to stay within that response area we would have a sealed aircraft a sealed aircraft is an aircraft

350
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,000
that has been configured and swept and then a metal seal goes on the door to where if that

351
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,400
door is open or broken we know someone has entered that aircraft in an unauthorized capacity so

352
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,040
we'd have a sealed aircraft there if we got dispatched i would go to an aircraft there

353
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,400
would be manifests that go with that aircraft that would list all the crew members their security

354
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,120
clearances and a rough description as to the mission at those times we would the crew would

355
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:23,760
be briefed security clearances would be issued to that crew and anytime i was on a hvt mission that

356
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,040
was highly sensitive i would operate under what is known as a nato top secret security clearance

357
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,200
and there are documents a few documents that i was able to make copies of that show that and indeed

358
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,440
the document that you've showed us shows very clearly that you and the pilot were the only

359
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,160
people on board the plane that had a nato top secret clearance yeah probably the reason he

360
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,480
was assigned is because i was there so not to sound arrogant but the fact that i was being

361
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,840
deployed on that mission meant that the aircraft commander also needed to be read into a certain

362
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,160
degree which would require that clearance it's part of the reason why they keep your clearances

363
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,560
secret in that covert role so that they have plausible deniability if you ever did decide

364
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,160
to speak publicly yeah here's the funny thing like the u.s government can make a bunch of rules

365
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,000
in order to create a scaffolding that keeps things intact but they make a bunch of rules so

366
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,280
that they can break them and hack the system and get around them it provides great obscurity to

367
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,240
create the rules that separate the known from the unknown and i want to add one comment here is

368
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,000
when we're talking about circumstances like the first time we recovered a uap which was the flying

369
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,480
egg that immediately regardless of where you were or what level of security you're operating under

370
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,760
at the time when that shows up you're instantly now in a top secret classified situation

371
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,760
regardless of people's clearance so before you flew out that day to go and do the recovery of

372
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,920
the egg yeah what were you told i was told that we were going out to do our normal thing we're

373
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,560
going to provide range security and we transport crew and we're doing our normal range work you

374
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,080
weren't told that this was an anomalous craft that was clearly of non-human origin and i genuinely

375
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:21,040
believe no one else knew this was going to happen either i think it was a shock to everyone

376
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,560
and at no stage were you ever subsequently told that the craft was of non-human origin no so how

377
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,800
do you know it wasn't human how do you know that we don't have top secret tech that is shaped like

378
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:42,480
an egg right well i'll tell you that because of the reaction of my leadership structure and because

379
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:51,040
of my experience working in that capacity everyone involved was convinced that what

380
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:58,160
we were seeing and dealing with was in fact exotic in its origin i will also tell you that

381
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,880
during this process over the last couple years it's been confirmed to me by ranking members of

382
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,160
the uap task force that what we were working with that night was in fact an hi and it was not a

383
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:19,120
unique experience the egg as we're referring to is known by and there have been many others that

384
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:25,840
have encountered this type of craft in our atmosphere outside of our atmosphere broad day

385
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,960
night time all over the place you got a good look at this object didn't you yeah was there any

386
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,480
visible propulsion system on it no not what we would know there's no engine there was no thermal

387
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:43,280
signature i was operating at night when i finally came in to pick it up so i'm working under

388
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,680
night vision goggles at the time and it was quite clear i flipped them up flipped them down and

389
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,120
looked at it a couple of different ways was there a thermal signature there was not a thermal

390
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:02,240
signature it wasn't hot no no you know general laws of thermodynamics you know if an object's

391
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,360
been flying or driving an engine it's going to show heat isn't it yeah yes yeah so how do you

392
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:14,480
think that object was being propelled well that's a great question that we're looking forward to

393
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,400
exploring with our new venture so when you went back to base was it the sort of job where you

394
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,480
could go to your bosses and say hey listen what was that object that i picked up that strange

395
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,920
looking egg thing no that's not quite how it works when i go back to what you would call my base when

396
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,560
i go back to our facility that's back to my my normal working business and the people that

397
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,000
are involved there have really no idea what's going on when i'm holding myself out for work

398
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,760
for the government so this is this is how the compartmentalization system works it's a need to

399
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,160
know there was no need for the people that were you were working with to know so they weren't

400
00:42:52,160 --> 00:43:00,640
briefed in yes and you only found out incidentally because you saw it on the range right so let's

401
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:07,680
keep on going that's twigged your interest for the first time you've seen something that does appear

402
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:15,120
genuinely anomalous when was the next occasion when you became aware of anomalous non-human

403
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:22,000
technology there's another craft that we recovered that i'm i can talk about and that craft was what

404
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:30,880
we referred to as an 8-gon an 8-gon is basically a disc shaped object that when viewed from the top

405
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:39,200
has eight different symmetrical sections that are delineated by some form of ridge so it's an octagon

406
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:46,560
shaped disc yes what by by any chance was there a name a nickname for the egg yeah the egg we

407
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,720
actually called nanus like from the morgue and mindy show from the 70s because it's ridiculous

408
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,280
that's exactly what it looked like and so it's funny when you look back at the what may have

409
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,560
been the motivation for the 1970s because what where else would that egg is a ridiculous idea

410
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:08,320
for a guy from mort from orc right so you have mort from orc who flew to earth in an egg

411
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:16,240
it surely gives credit to the idea that some like to think that perhaps there was a pr program

412
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:24,480
that utilized our fascination with hollywood and television to paint pictures of actual fact as

413
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:31,520
fiction making it now some weird hybrid you could call faction so what time of day or night was it

414
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:38,960
when you came across the octagonal object the 8-gon we did recovery on that both day and night

415
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,560
so talk me through it what happens

416
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:48,800
you're in your chopper yeah i'm in my i'm in my chopper what sort of chopper

417
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:56,640
at the time is a bell 212 which is the same as a uh uh uh in one it's a twin engine twin bladed

418
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:03,600
bell helicopter you're flying at night flying at night yeah what time at night oh god i don't

419
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,240
remember like after midnight have you been given any pre-flight briefing

420
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,360
i would i'm the one who would be given the briefing but we are given a loadout on the

421
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:23,520
particular uh object that when you're flying an external load um we designate two different

422
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,920
sites one's called the drop site one's called the pick site you could say the pick site is where

423
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,120
the payload is that you're flying in to pick up um as you're making your first trip into the pick

424
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:39,120
site the payloads are already rigged and manifested for you and to prepare them for flight

425
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,760
when you're in route to that object uh you're given some basic information like weight estimates

426
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,800
size estimates and there's two objects that i'm here to talk about one was the egg the other is

427
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:57,680
what we called an 8-gon the 8-gon was a uh essentially a flying disc with what looked

428
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,240
like eight uh delineated sections when looking down and i can tell you what it looked like

429
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,000
from looking down because that's primarily how i saw it because i'm a helicopter pilot

430
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:14,080
we did recoveries with the eight gons there was more than one that was that made its way to the

431
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:19,920
ground on this particular operation and the recovery was done at night and then more was

432
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:28,160
done in the day because of where we operate sometimes things can make their way into the

433
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,560
terrain the terrain where we operate is the highest mountain range in the whole

434
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:40,000
united's continental united states and so the decision was made to wait till daylight

435
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:48,240
to recover some of the object or some of the material that was brought down or made its way

436
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,960
to the ground that night during the recovery of the object at night time i make my way in the

437
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,040
helicopter from where we configure the line and we fly to where what we call the pick site there's

438
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,560
two locations we designate them pick site drop site drop site at the delivery location we have

439
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:14,400
a crew both at the pick site and the uh the drop site on the ground the the pick team configures

440
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,240
the cargo for flight so whatever it is the craft is sitting in a sling waiting for your helicopter

441
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,960
yeah it's saying we have this these things called pumpkins which are like rubberized bags or

442
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,640
containers and from my point of view that it was covered in a pumpkin at least from the bottom

443
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:37,280
and the sides this is one of the most profound experiences i've ever had in my life i'm about

444
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:44,720
to share with you so bear with me um this is for me when it became clear as i get closer to this

445
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,880
pick site i start feeling odd i start feeling extremely emotional

446
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,040
and the closer i get the more the emotion starts to overwhelm me and

447
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,200
what do you feel what's the emotion i feel

448
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,000
i feel

449
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,320
a sense of my mother i don't know how else to explain it i feel

450
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:29,840
this intense hybrid of sadness and happiness and beauty um and song and it was very disruptive

451
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:35,040
to me because i had a very practical responsibility at the time to operate a helicopter in the

452
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:43,520
night and i began wondering what was wrong with me it was late am i am i just stressed am i tired

453
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:55,680
am i marinating in a in in cortisol and estrogen i don't know um but as i came over this object

454
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:02,000
for the pick there was this overwhelming sense of emotion what's it saying the object

455
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,080
tell me what you're feeling

456
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:16,720
like i said it was an overwhelming sense of sadness happiness is it your feeling are you

457
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,000
suddenly having a mental breakdown on the job no i felt like something connected with me

458
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:30,480
connected with me i felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was

459
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:41,920
providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what i was doing was

460
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:52,160
um and it was so overwhelming that i began to cry and uh i can't imagine crying at night time with

461
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,680
night vision goggles is the healthiest way to fly a chopper no it is not and then i'm confused as

462
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,840
to why i'm crying at the same time and then i'm do i abort the mission do i and so i just did my

463
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:10,160
best to focus on my particular cues when doing this type of work and i got the load hooked up

464
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:18,000
and i began flying away and once it was just me and that object in between the pick and the drop

465
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,720
side there's about 20 miles in between i felt like something was inside of me i felt like i

466
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:34,640
was possessed by the most beautiful spirit i've ever been possessed by and was it loving it was

467
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:42,480
loving um but there was a sense of sadness at the same time and um

468
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:52,800
had you ever had an experience like this before no no it was a very feminine energy i'll tell you

469
00:50:52,800 --> 00:51:00,160
that i it felt like felt like the spirit of god but not in any masculine sense that i had ever

470
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,920
felt it was like again the feeling of my mother um and

471
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:15,680
my daughter and beauty uh and it wasn't like a soul it was like a frequency that i was

472
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:24,480
connected with was it scared i don't know if it is a thing i'm still trying to figure out

473
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,160
why that happened i well i don't want to say that because i have a pretty good idea of what's going

474
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,960
on now and whatever that force was since that night it has stayed with me and as crazy as this

475
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:44,000
sounds it's what's guiding me now and it's what's providing protection for me it's changed your life

476
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,760
it's changed my life do you think it's made you a better person that experience it has made me a

477
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,720
more sensitive and aware person which i think all of us would be better people

478
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:03,440
so that was a moment when you became aware of at the very least a technology that had the

479
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:11,280
capacity to touch you remotely remotely telepathically telepathically now telepathy we are told

480
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:22,560
is a nonsense it's a fiction and what happened after you flew the object in the sling to presumably

481
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:28,800
the drop-off zone once i made the drop uh before i got there i was really scared that i was going

482
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,400
to have to stop flying and punch this thing off uh because i was so distracted but then i was like

483
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,920
well crap now we've got another recovery site now we're going to have to recover this i'm going to

484
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,560
have to burn chile and i don't know so it took everything i had in me at the time to get to my

485
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:51,600
drop site and i delivered this oddly enough no one in my crew reported having similar effects

486
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:59,840
from this i do not believe there was a being in that craft i've come to understand now after being

487
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:10,880
involved with other parts of the programs that are tested on the range that there is a there is

488
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:20,400
a known and researched and implemented emotional or psychic or what we call a psionic component

489
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:28,800
to the research and development of the uap program now jack i know it's going to be very

490
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,200
confronting for our audience to hear this but you think that you've discovered something

491
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:41,360
potentially about yourself as a result of that experience that you might in fact have abilities

492
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:50,240
that you were never aware of i know when i in my childhood if we look back to when i was a kid

493
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:56,640
i i sincerely believe that the screening i went through in high school um you know my grandparents

494
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,320
are when i was a kid i there's the reason i joined the military is real simple i wanted to

495
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:09,280
jump out of airplanes and kill bad guys and make my my grandparents proud and my grandparents were

496
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,040
the most amazing people i've ever met you know they grew up during the great depression dealt

497
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:22,800
with world war ii and my grandfathers particularly were the strongest and the most sensitive men

498
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:30,080
i've ever met all wrapped up in into one person we can call them navy grandpa and army grandpa

499
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:36,240
let's say so you know navy grandpa was a very influential naval officer who's actually a member

500
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:43,360
of the seals predecessors the scouts and raiders army grandpa was a was an army captain and a

501
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:50,800
salesman they both founded our neighborhood church and literally set the cornerstone to our church

502
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:59,200
together unfortunately you know their children my parents were very loving people but made a

503
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:06,400
lot of bad decisions and this led to step families for me at a very young age and to get away from

504
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:13,280
the abusive environment i spent a lot of time outside i would tell my my mom i'm going to my

505
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,480
dad's house i'd tell my dad i'm going to my mom's house and i would i'd bug out and just go live

506
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,440
outside you were living in the bush somewhere yeah essentially i was homeless but you know i

507
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,520
just told myself i was a a wild commando survivalist and uh that gave me pride in what i was doing

508
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:41,600
instead of shame um and so that i ref i refined a pretty in um a pretty high level of independence

509
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:48,240
at a young age but my grandparents were still always there um making sure i had some outlet

510
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:55,520
for certain things and so they got me involved with uh an art program and a music program

511
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,680
i'll have to tell you so my navy grandfather he uh he was the superintendent he got his

512
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,480
doctorate in education and by the time i had graduated high school he had retired as a

513
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,640
superintendent of our school district so he was a very influential man and i understand he ran

514
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,360
the gifted and talented education program for that school district yeah you could say he was

515
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:24,000
the ambassador for this area for the gait program which was a program for gifted and talented kids

516
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:32,320
and my personal experience with that was was great it was uh i just got pulled out of normal class

517
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,560
a couple of times a day at least twice and got to go to a private classroom where

518
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:44,240
i had one-on-one time with um a staff member there who played a lot of games with me inside

519
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:54,400
and outside and we ran a number of creative classes together and outside of that i also

520
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:01,840
after school i would attend i had a private art teacher i learned music um and so i felt

521
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:08,400
like i had a unique education experience as a kid my grandfather also got me involved in water

522
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:15,040
polo and swimming he was a diver and a swimmer um and water polo became a great outlet for me i

523
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:22,320
found the um the competition and the physical exhaustion was like great medicine for me looking

524
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,720
back though now do you think there might have been something special about your selection into the

525
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:35,360
gait program well if we we look into my high school years you know unfortunately my senior

526
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:40,880
year i i got a lot of trouble when i did show up to school i was a bit disruptive in class i had

527
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:48,320
a smart mouth i liked being a class clown um and i got a lot of fights and by the time my senior

528
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:54,320
year came around i was the varsity goalie on our water polo team and five weeks into my senior year

529
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:01,680
i got expelled for fighting again and on at that time i was on a disciplinary contract so

530
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:07,040
my accumulation of bad behavior throughout high school resulted in a contract which was interesting

531
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:12,560
and it was a one and done fail situation and five weeks into my senior year i was expelled

532
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,480
at this time my my grandparents decided to hold an intervention and i don't even think my parents

533
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:24,720
or step parents know but the two men got together and met with me and

534
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:33,280
decided to research military programs that would be available at that time and so we made several

535
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:40,960
trips down to uh ucla to an office near there and i began going through a series of tests

536
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,880
of all kinds there were physical physiological psychological creative tests

537
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:55,440
and we assumed that you know all of this was pretty typical you know now don't you that the

538
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:04,240
u.s air force has been secretly testing people through the gait program for certain psychic

539
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:11,920
abilities yes were you tested yes do you think that might have played a part in what happened

540
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,240
to you that night when you were recovering that craft yeah and i don't know that the air force

541
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:25,840
realized that i'll tell you i know others that i've come to meet through the program that we'll talk

542
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:33,360
about that we're in a psionic program that have a very similar backstory but for whatever reason

543
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,680
i was not used in that way again my creativity and intuition resulted in as i've shared with

544
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:48,640
you before being used for creative war games being very creative in war games but

545
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,760
what i used as intuition if we make a spectrum and we put intuition on the conservative side

546
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:03,280
let's say the right side of the scale on the more far outside that might be something that

547
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:12,400
looks a lot like telepathy or telekinesis and we call this psionics which we can talk about

548
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:20,240
and so i knew i was intuitive i knew i was creative and i also know i had good imagination and so

549
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:28,320
looking back it was clear that becoming a red team expert those are the tools that i would deploy

550
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:33,680
my intuition and creativity is what made me successful in that capacity i'm quite

551
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:40,400
struck by how many very senior elite soldiers special operations soldiers when they admit

552
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:46,160
what they do in a combat situation where they're facing imminent harm there's often a moment where

553
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:54,160
they talk about intuition yeah precognition they knew something was about to happen does it happen

554
01:00:54,160 --> 01:01:01,280
to you yeah i would i would say that i have a keen ability to make good decisions short term

555
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:08,080
and long term i also find comfort in chaos you could say and i actually see things more clearly

556
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:15,120
in chaos and tend to make very wise decisions and is that a quality that you recognize in a

557
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:21,120
lot of your colleagues in special operations yeah you might be interested to know that people

558
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:27,920
at an elite operator level there's a lot of them that are left-handed a lot of them that were

559
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:35,920
artists as kids or still are very good drawers illustrators musicians they're also if you were

560
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:42,880
to describe their personalities you might have you might find yourself using some some oxymorons like

561
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:50,640
peaceful warriors sensitive savages you could say that's a real thing and i'll add one more

562
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:58,000
we're a bunch of dead serious goofballs so there's this this dichotomy between feminine

563
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,400
and masculine at the extremes that i don't know if you could go as far as to say is the big blue

564
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:10,320
air force and the big black department of defense knows what they're doing and they're prospecting

565
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:16,240
for these kids at a level and they're planning this long-term well-thought-out path but what you

566
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:24,720
will find is that we end up making our way there something made you connect with that machine that

567
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:32,320
night yes i it chose to connect with me and reportedly no one else on my crew so when you

568
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:38,240
got back to base did you report the fact that you'd had that extraordinary no no why not

569
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:45,920
i was because i didn't know what happened and i don't want you know you carry a lot of responsibility

570
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:52,480
as a pilot you know in this process i've moved from being a very pragmatic person with a

571
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:59,920
tremendous amount of responsibility in day-to-day grind in this dimension to a place where i've had

572
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:07,600
to take into account and incorporate things that are basically metaphysical and find a balance

573
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:14,080
between the two all while maintaining the trust that i could do my very pragmatic work so the this

574
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:20,080
was something pretty new to me this night the last thing i'm going to do is go back and tell my team

575
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:26,240
that i almost had to pop the load off because i was connected with a goddess that was making me cry

576
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:35,120
so you've had those two anomalous incidents with craft yeah clearly

577
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:41,840
these are objects that are being recovered that do not appear to be human technology

578
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:50,640
so this is a good thing to talk about because what we're dealing with is either non-human

579
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:56,880
intelligence if we want to use those words or that phrase or that acronym it's either that or we need

580
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:04,080
to dramatically redefine what we think human intelligence is because this object whatever

581
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:11,280
it was was capable of communicating with you in your mind that object or whatever was controlling

582
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:18,320
that object was also connecting to me through the mind through my mind now you learned

583
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:26,720
didn't you that this was the tip of an iceberg it wasn't just you correct what did you learn

584
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:35,840
well my work coincidentally shortly after that led me in support of another particular part

585
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:41,840
of the program which deals directly with looking at this piece right here which is

586
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,960
is there a component on the summoning side that we call and the operation side of

587
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:56,320
these non-human craft that has to do with consciousness or at least a field of consciousness

588
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:04,080
that perhaps humans can tap into and maybe all beings in the universe can can tap into

589
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:12,080
what is a psionic a psionic person is someone with the predisposition for

590
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:19,120
extral temporal you could say abilities and sensitivities someone who is

591
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:28,480
is has a fantastic intuition what did you discover with the psionics were being used for

592
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:36,560
in the program in the program there was certainly a desire to explore the idea

593
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:43,600
that perhaps uap could be summoned could be communicated with could be controlled

594
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:51,680
and could be persuaded to land all by deploying people with psionic abilities to interface

595
01:05:51,680 --> 01:06:00,960
and communicate with the uap and did you see that happen yes i did so there were people who were

596
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:07,040
purportedly psionically gifted who were brought into the program yes there were where did they

597
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:12,560
come from they come from all over they're not and all over i mean from outside the united

598
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:18,880
states as well as in and how are they detected how are they picked uh you know i don't really

599
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:25,120
know you'd have to ask somebody else i'm told that there are particular indigenous communities

600
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:30,000
around the world native americans people in different third world countries who apparently

601
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,560
have enhanced psychic abilities that are really sure i think um i think most people could grasp

602
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:42,960
the idea that perhaps people that are from other cultures you know our our culture has

603
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:50,320
uh leaves a lot to be desired when we look at the contaminants that exist in our food

604
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:55,600
contaminants that exist in our drugs and contaminants in our culture some of these contaminants

605
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,520
it turns out aren't great for your spirituality or your consciousness or

606
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:10,720
your psionic abilities and so those who live a particular lifestyle or live in a culture

607
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:18,880
where they have a more natural or direct way of life with nature and their surroundings

608
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:25,280
seem to um that within those groups of people there's a little bit higher demographic than

609
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:31,360
there typically is for those with a psionic ability so these people are sought out and are

610
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:37,040
are used to contribute to the research that that might be going on with with the psionic i want

611
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:42,800
to put something to you i've spoken myself you haven't told me this but i've spoken myself to

612
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:48,480
people of native american background indigenous americans who say that this is a particularly

613
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,240
popular thing for recruitment from the program to happen in indigenous american communities yes i

614
01:07:54,240 --> 01:08:01,040
know that for a fact there are also people from countries in the third world where these abilities

615
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:07,920
are recognized and not treated with stigma as we do in the western world yeah there is no stigma

616
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,560
in fact if there's any stigma if you're the one who's not playing along you might be the outcast

617
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:22,720
in those cultures so the irony is that part of your discovery inside the program is that there

618
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:30,800
genuinely are people who can actually make a mental spiritual connection to a technology

619
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:38,880
yes 100 percent was that a revelation to you it was fun it was actually fun to learn uh it's one

620
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:44,080
of the things in our work that was like oh my gosh there's more to life it answered certain

621
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:51,440
questions and intuitions if you will that we have going back to your childhood and if anything that

622
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:59,200
were most present in your childhood which is very satisfying because um you know something as a child

623
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:05,360
you have this this particular feeling and it kind of dies out as you become more mature and have to

624
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:13,360
take on more responsibility and so to be able to uh nurture that and accept that that might be the

625
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:20,960
case and to see organizations as serious as those who we worked with um taking this seriously was

626
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:28,000
actually a heck of a lot of fun see this is an ontological shock i think for many people watching

627
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,240
this because we're all being told firstly there's no such thing as aliens visiting this planet yeah

628
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:39,760
and secondly we're all being told there's no such thing as telepathy or psychic abilities it's

629
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:45,200
rubbish yeah you know i don't think there is going to be an ontological shock i think people are

630
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:49,680
going to react to it the same way i did i think it's going to be an ontological relief because

631
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:56,240
i think everyone deep down knows that that there is more to life than what we are being told and

632
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:02,240
experiencing and to know that there might be something like a sixth seventh eighth sense

633
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:09,680
that has a spiritual spiritual connection and that that might actually have a good

634
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:18,080
nature and application behind it like not only is it not shocking but it should be welcomed i would

635
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:24,400
think well i'd go further jake it's beautiful it's beautiful and isn't that the message you

636
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:32,160
got from whatever that was overwhelming sense of beauty overwhelming and love and love and it's

637
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:39,520
funny hearing an elite soldier talking about love yeah and benevolence you know what fuels every

638
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:46,480
elite soldier is a preservation of love or something that they love that's what's behind

639
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:54,160
all the strength so let's go through the psionic program when a psionic operator engages with

640
01:10:54,160 --> 01:11:01,440
technology how do they do it using their mind something like meditation and i need to preface

641
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:07,120
this by saying this is stuff that i've come to know recently the night that i had this experience

642
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:14,000
there was another team involved come to find out was a psionics team and they were also working

643
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,600
that night and do you think it was them that had attracted the object in the first place

644
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:27,920
yeah i do and so how did the object come to land um i think it was invited to land

645
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,720
by the psionics team is that always how they make the objects land no there's a number of other ways

646
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:40,240
so i have to tell you that you know weapon systems are tested out there i know this from other

647
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:47,680
sources i know that high pulse microwave weapons are being used to bring down some of these craft

648
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:55,840
yes now how often was it done where the objects would land on their own accord and how often was

649
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,000
it done that weapons would be used yeah i can't tell you how often i could tell you they are

650
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,680
brought down both ways that they are invited to land by the psionics team other times they are

651
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:13,040
invited in by the psionics team but then um hpms which are high powered microwave weapons

652
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:21,280
are deployed and they have an effect where they can disrupt the uh the flight pattern of the object

653
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,560
and when it is an object sometimes it's not and it can result in that aircraft being forcibly brought

654
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:33,040
down when they did the attraction of the objects was it purely psychic or was the machinery that

655
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,920
was used as well so we there's five components to our operation which might answer a lot of

656
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,520
your questions so the first component is a calling phase calling is either through man or machine

657
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:50,960
based summoning systems we have man-based systems which are our psionic assets which make a psych

658
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:56,560
a connection through intuition or consciousness with the object and can invite it in the other

659
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,400
is a machine based calling system which uses um many systems which i'm not going to go into detail

660
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:09,360
about you could refer to them as a dog whistle or a lure and uap certain types seem to be

661
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:16,080
specifically attracted or responsive to our machine based calling systems and then from there once

662
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:22,640
they're brought in we communicate with them now the psionics can have a dual role because in this

663
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:28,240
communication phase we do a lot of data collection so it's verifying that what we are seeing is

664
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:35,520
something tangible also that it is responding to our efforts so we might invite it to move

665
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:42,800
left or right or to position our particular mean base machine based systems in a particular

666
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:48,800
direction and then measure the response the implication of what you're saying is that

667
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:56,320
this intelligence that's behind these objects whatever it is seems willing to share yeah

668
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:06,000
yeah i think it ultimately is working for us and um it is it is commonly talked about that what

669
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:14,160
we are getting even when we weaponize it is a donation a gift and even when we deploy equipment

670
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:21,120
when when there's a combined operation where the psionics team and a machine based team all the

671
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,560
equipment kind of has to be blessed and brought in when it's a psionically led operation for

672
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:33,520
summoning a lot of people watching this jake are going i'm sure this is crazy this guy's making

673
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:40,960
this up this can't possibly be true alien vehicles psychic techniques to engage with technology

674
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:47,920
this is disinformation fabrication yeah well we intend to prove that's not the case which has a

675
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:53,600
lot to do with the timing as to why i'm coming out now we plan to produce that evidence in our

676
01:14:53,600 --> 01:15:01,120
new venture with our teams that we've used for years in the legacy program we've now gotten out

677
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:06,720
we've pulled our resources and we're backed by venture capital we're also working in coordination

678
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:12,160
with the most forefront government agencies that you would want involved with us on this subject

679
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:16,880
matter and we're going to start producing evidence on all of this and we're going to share it with

680
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:24,160
but Krishna you you know it works because you've seen it done yes yeah and so have your colleagues

681
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:29,360
that's correct what would you say to people who might say there's no way a secret like this could

682
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:34,800
have been kept for so long i mean you're describing an operation that in your experience has been

683
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,720
going for at least 10 20 years yeah yeah do you know how long the program's been doing the

684
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,920
psionics i would say i'm sorry did over it i don't know what else to tell you

685
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:50,880
so it can be kept a secret can be kept oh yeah secrets uh there are lots of secrets

686
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,600
some kept for good reasons so let me briefly summarize the implications of what you're saying

687
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:05,840
aliens are real so i would like to know unfortunately we got to get really specific

688
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:13,440
with the semantics okay so what do you mean by alien something non-human and intelligent built

689
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:20,160
craft that you have been involved in recovery yes something that is inconsistent with our idea of

690
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:29,600
what a human is uh is involved with these craft are these intelligences whatever they are are they

691
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:35,280
extra terrestrial are they from somewhere else or could they possibly be living on this planet

692
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:39,840
i gotta remind you i'm a security and transportation guy that has been involved in this program

693
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:47,200
really within the purview of those two categories so you're gonna have to ask someone else i

694
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:54,240
presume you got a chance to talk to the psionics yeah when they mentally telepathically engaged

695
01:16:54,240 --> 01:17:01,680
with whatever this intelligence was what did they tell you about it well that uh they refer to it

696
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:10,000
as a they in a very spiritual nature something like angels uh angels and demons uh let's say

697
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,840
there's certainly good energies and bad energies but it's talked of in a very um in a very nebulous

698
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:21,520
way like this because no one really knows what it is no one especially on the psionic side we're

699
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,280
still trying to figure that out we're still trying to figure out exactly what it is and there's

700
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:32,720
probably a number of things going on there might be biological entities and we use the word

701
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:40,800
biological for a very specific reason biological we don't need we we limit it to that because we

702
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:46,240
aren't here to imply that it is sentient or has a consciousness we really don't know that

703
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:53,840
there is some evidence that that shows it might be the case that these are something like soft

704
01:17:53,840 --> 01:18:02,880
tissue drones or lab meat that was programmed in order to operate craft meat robots meat robots

705
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:10,560
yeah okay so it really begs the question but ironically while some of the biological

706
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:19,600
cargo that comes with these craft is not conscious consciousness itself is how you

707
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:25,280
interact and pilot the craft which is ironic because for the first time ever the biological

708
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:30,880
creatures inside are not conscious but the craft is the other implication too from what your

709
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:37,680
experience shows is that whatever and wherever the intelligence is that's behind those craft

710
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:48,080
it seems friendly benevolent benevolent yeah in fact loving loving it's if you want to connect

711
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:51,920
with it if you want to have a relationship and if you want to see stuff flying in the sky

712
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:59,920
you need to be channeling a loving energy that's just the way it works beautiful yeah it is

713
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:08,400
in fact there can be individuals in the group that throw off that vibe that can mess up the vibration

714
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:15,440
of the psionics work and their communication with the beings and then you aren't as successful

715
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,480
have you in any of the work that you've done and i know you're being very limited in what

716
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:26,800
incidents you're prepared to talk about have you ever come across malevolent intelligence that's

717
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:37,200
non-human i have not i personally have not have any of your colleagues you'll have to ask them okay

718
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:43,040
okay the implications though of what you're telling us

719
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:52,800
are incredible we are not alone we are not alone there is a non-human intelligence that has been

720
01:19:52,800 --> 01:20:00,080
engaging with this planet yes to your knowledge is it just the united states that is having these

721
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:07,040
encounters no no i can tell you for a fact that my team has been sought after for our unique

722
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:14,400
service that we provide by organizations outside the united states but let's to be clear i don't

723
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,320
want to put you in the position of imputing that you might have been helping unfriendly countries

724
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:24,240
neither of the countries or none of the countries that you worked with foreign adversaries no not

725
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:31,680
and when i say that i use the word organizations instead of governments because there are there are

726
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:37,200
there are many other folks that may be operating in a private capacity that so let me let me say

727
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:44,800
this this situation is not unique to the u.s. to your knowledge are russia and china doing

728
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,880
retrievals of non-human i have no idea i imagine they are why would you say that well because

729
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:58,320
uh this particular activity is not unique to the united states i know for a fact that

730
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:04,240
members of my team have been asked to provide our expertise and service

731
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:11,360
for organizations outside the u.s. not china and russia but um you know the u.s. government

732
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:16,640
does not have a monopoly on the uap subject matter i mean the skies are not classified

733
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:22,880
your conscience can't be redacted so i the nhi can connect with whoever the hell they want and

734
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:28,880
whoever the hell they are can connect with nhi and this lends itself to a particular situation

735
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:34,480
or formula that you can imagine exists which is if you have a belief that this is a worthwhile

736
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:42,800
venture which ironically the government has made extremely clear like there are many people myself

737
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:47,200
and our new organization included that is not waiting on the government to say this is something

738
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:52,560
you should invest time and energy on and that's become abundantly clear in the last two years

739
01:21:52,560 --> 01:22:00,560
but prior to that anyone that had the will to believe that and the money to invest and the

740
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,440
tools and techniques and talent in order to do it could set up their own communication crash

741
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:12,080
recovery and reverse engineering problem program anywhere in the world the nhi is not hold itself

742
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:18,640
out exclusively for the united states why has this been kept secret from all of us oh god i don't

743
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:27,280
know i really don't know um i imagine you know i have to trust that be careful what you wish for

744
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:34,000
there might be very good reasons i imagine that um some of what we see i know that some of what we

745
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,800
see is our own advanced tech um and it's absolutely imperative that we keep a competitive advantage

746
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:47,360
over our adversaries as a patriot that's paramount we need to be able to defend ourselves

747
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:53,520
and unfortunately you can't tell the public things without telling your adversaries so therefore the

748
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:59,840
public for their own good is going to be kept um they're going to be kept out of the know on

749
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:05,360
certain subjects and so there's this there's this difference between secrecy and privacy

750
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,600
and i will lay this out because we need to be able to flip back and forth between the two

751
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:18,400
privacy is something that protects responsibilities and the dignity of whoever

752
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:28,240
needs that privacy secrecy is something that typically hides vices uh

753
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:38,160
amoral intentions and crimes let's say i know for the most part that what we're dealing with when

754
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:43,760
it comes to our government the subject matter is a matter of privacy not secrecy if you want

755
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:52,800
to look at it that way somebody you discovered was recording these operations in secret there are

756
01:23:52,800 --> 01:24:00,160
videos of these operations that were captured illegally during these operations that are out

757
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:06,080
there you became aware didn't you while you were doing these retrieval operations that there was

758
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:13,840
concern from a private aerospace company that certain computers had gone missing

759
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:26,800
yes and those computers were panasonic toughbooks correct five panasonic toughbook six six

760
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:38,080
six what happened well um we were deployed on a particular task to recover what we call hvt's or

761
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:45,120
high value targets those high value targets were panasonic toughbooks um and whatever was on these

762
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:50,720
toughbooks was highly sensitive material and this this came about i have to tell you after 2018

763
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:59,760
um it is quite possible i will say that the sensitive material that is on these panasonic

764
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:09,840
toughbooks uh has to do with sensor data video um that was illegally captured during some of

765
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:18,640
these operations some of which may be incriminating or classified now i can understand a lot of people

766
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:23,440
may watching this may be indignant but there are good reasons why some things are classified

767
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:30,240
in the u.s military absolutely so you were tasked to get these laptops back yes because the concern

768
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:37,920
was they could break the secrecy of the whole program um i can't speak to what the implications

769
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,560
were of this sensitive information getting out you know my job is pretty simple i get tasked on

770
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:47,520
something i get given a pretty narrow scope you know and after doing this for 20 years that's

771
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:52,880
enough for me because everything that i've done up until now is i've been very well taken care

772
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:59,760
of and everything i trust the process by which we operate so uh i'm only pre pre-loading it that

773
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:05,200
way because that wasn't the case by the end of this operation for the first time in my career

774
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:13,200
by the end of this operation we began asking questions we've never asked which is who are

775
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:20,960
we working for what is going on and why did it turn out to be that there were two

776
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:29,120
seemingly adversarial parties trying to employ us to go after these hvt's so what happened so

777
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:38,400
my team and i worked in coordination with our contact for this particular task there was

778
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:43,040
obviously another team involved which is an intelligence team most of our intelligence

779
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:49,760
came by way of human which is human intelligence which is essentially the reporting of information

780
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:58,160
by a human by their own observation and experience and uh we recovered our first two uh tough books

781
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:06,560
they were um they were in the high sierras i'll tell you that and uh we had first deployed began

782
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:12,160
recon on that on that particular target for the first two in the winter time and there was tons

783
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:18,800
of snow so we continued to just observe that location in order to keep tabs on who might be

784
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,440
coming and going it's very remote there's no way there the only way to get there would be by foot

785
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:31,840
or horse or helicopter so um we did a couple snow surveys and at the time the snow was over nine

786
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,360
feet so we had waited to for the fall before we would deploy to get these first two are you and

787
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:42,960
your men armed yeah we're always armed yeah because whoever this was is potentially very

788
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:48,240
dangerous i'm armed when i go to starbucks so that's not saying much but we were armed yeah

789
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:57,440
so what happened so we recovered our first two tough books um we got back to our our base location

790
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,240
and then went through them and took photographs discovered that the hard drives were missing which

791
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:07,840
is something we expected could be the case we then took pictures and detailed reports of the

792
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:13,520
tough books and the and the contents of the the casing that we found them in and we delivered them

793
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:20,560
to um a very familiar facility which is consistent with the company we are working for and then we

794
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:27,520
went back to task and waited for more instructions on um on where to look next for the missing

795
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,760
components of these computers as well as the other tough books that were thought to have been out

796
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:40,800
there um the next piece of intelligence that came through led us to uh a lake and high altitude

797
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:46,400
lake and we found um the hard drives in a sealed steel container 25 feet underwater

798
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:53,840
wow yeah so someone's going through a lot of effort in order to hide these things

799
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:59,200
but you can you can't blame them i mean this is worth a lot of money if you sell it to the right

800
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:04,640
buyer yeah depending upon what's on there it was clear that again this is this it was clear that

801
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:13,280
whatever was hidden was highly sensitive to the employer of the task we were on and to whoever

802
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:18,240
was in possession of these at the time they were being hidden yeah at any stage did you find

803
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:29,280
yourself under threat yeah so um we didn't get much past that mission we never recovered anymore

804
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:37,600
the very next time we went out things got strange um for me and my spidey senses my intuition was

805
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:44,080
on high alert because our intel contact changed the rhythm and style of our intel

806
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:51,120
changed i'll leave it at that and um when we deployed to the next location to begin our

807
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:58,880
reconnaissance and um in preparation for going to have a look around uh the intelligence became

808
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:05,440
began to change last minute also we were given a partnered air asset instead of using our own

809
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:13,840
and we took it in good faith and as we got closer to the day in which we were going to deploy

810
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:20,880
intelligence kept changing and so that that raised my concern um we ended up going anyway

811
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:28,880
and when we got there the hvt's were gone and it was clear that shots had been fired and i'm going

812
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:41,120
to leave it at that so when i got back to our home base after that i made contact with our

813
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:46,160
with our dispatcher let's say and said we're out we're done and i needed space to breathe

814
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,960
we then deployed our own air assets and we got the hell out of there

815
01:30:53,680 --> 01:31:01,920
um you felt you were in significant danger yeah and i was concerned that we were being set up

816
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:12,400
we were being prepared for the one thing that we've always offered employers and that is

817
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:20,480
possible deniability and that we were perhaps going to be the hidden hand that gets severed

818
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:30,800
and that perhaps we were the ones who may be responsible for capturing that sensitive

819
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:36,080
material on the front end do you think that you and your team had come under suspicion for

820
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:44,400
the videos is it a simple i think that's very likely or we were a suitable patsy i do have

821
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:49,040
to put one thing to you yeah because it's an incident that i've been told about from

822
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:55,520
2004 and i've been told about it by multiple people i've been told that

823
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:04,640
a private aerospace company was testing one of its own vehicles what's referred to as an alien

824
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:12,560
reproduction vehicle an arv in the colloquialism that vehicle crashed somewhere south of new

825
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:21,360
mexico possibly in mexico and i'm told that a team from that private aerospace contractor was

826
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:29,280
deployed and while they were there another team arrived from the u.s military and they had

827
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:34,880
innocently been deployed by their government to intercept what they thought was a potentially

828
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:43,360
anomalous craft and in the course of that encounter i am told two men were killed

829
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:50,720
can you comment on that insert yeah there's nothing i can add to that story or comment on

830
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:57,200
if i did have something to add if i had knowledge of that it would certainly be something i would

831
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:04,080
expect to get squashed by dot sir and quite possibly if i was involved in something like

832
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:08,320
that i probably wouldn't share it for one of my other reasons which is maintaining the privacy

833
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:12,640
and quality of life of my friends and family it's too dangerous for you to talk about potentially

834
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:18,400
it certainly it would be yeah can you speak more broadly without referring to that particular

835
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:24,000
incident speaking broadly about the implications from the program do you believe people have been

836
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,880
hurt or killed as a result of attempts to protect the secrecy of this whole venture yeah it is my

837
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:37,840
understanding and belief that unfortunately that is true people have been murdered that seems to be

838
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:43,920
the case you were in a situation where what you were doing was plausibly deniable you felt under

839
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:48,960
threat you were asking who you were working for who were you working for yeah for the first time

840
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:55,280
in my career i let me start by saying that for my entire career both in the air force and as a

841
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:00,960
contractor afterwards i've been very well taken care of i was given time off to get my head right

842
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,600
when i needed to i was given time to take care of my family when my wife had twins

843
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:13,520
i've been very well compensated i've been trusted and everything that needed to be laid out before

844
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:22,080
me when put on certain tasks was as advertised and as promised that all changed in 2018 and i

845
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:28,320
cut ties and built had to get rid of every one of my team and built a brand new team from scratch

846
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:34,320
the same way i always had but we cleaned house and i went back and recruited through very reliable

847
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:42,720
sources the type of team members i always have from the places i always have and we set out

848
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:50,880
to try and figure out exactly who the adversarial parties were that were both interested in these

849
01:34:51,840 --> 01:35:03,200
laptops and again it was obvious to us at least who the employer was but they were now in question

850
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:11,520
in my mind as being part of the problem we ran into and it became clear to me after working

851
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:19,120
in this world that perhaps it wasn't this company perhaps there was someone in mid-level management

852
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:24,560
or someone completely external that was masquerading as representatives of this

853
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:34,080
company and they liked wearing their merchandise okay so we came up with a plan and i decided

854
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:41,040
we're not going to ask questions down here we're going to go to the top so i reached out to the

855
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:48,160
director of security for the particular organization and a sister organization

856
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:53,520
and set up a meeting with them and went and spoke to them directly about our operation to find out

857
01:35:54,480 --> 01:36:00,160
which was true because there was only two truths in my minds either they were complicit or they

858
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:06,160
were compromised so either their company and their chain of command was compromised meaning the top

859
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:13,920
had no idea what was going on at the bottom or they were complicit this mission that we were

860
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:20,400
asked to do was directed from the top down so the question in your mind was was this a rogue

861
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:26,320
operation what did you find what did you find out well i found out that the people at the top

862
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:30,880
claimed to know nothing about it and they didn't want to touch it with a 10-foot pole

863
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:38,640
and they advised me to leave it alone so this leads you to the possibility that this was a

864
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:44,640
rogue operation somebody was tasking you to do things dangerous things where your life had been

865
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:49,840
in danger and your team members had been in danger this is a good example for everyone watching as to

866
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:55,280
how something like this could be kept secret because you could think of me as again i'm just

867
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:00,000
a security and transportation specialist everything else i'm speaking to and that i know about

868
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,280
i gained just from my own knowledge and interest of being in the environment but i speak to a lot

869
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:10,720
of things that aren't necessarily my specialty i'm on the very fingertips of this thing which is part

870
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:19,040
of why you haven't heard from me before i am i operate in the shadows by design i'm the fingertips

871
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:25,840
of this thing i have firsthand accounts of working with these crafts and in these organizations

872
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,240
they're up here at the shoulder like our friend david grush has worked at a very high administrative

873
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:36,000
level he didn't know who i was he had to find me through the process and so there are things that

874
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:43,200
the shoulder is intending to do if we're going to use a joint analogy that ends up being facilitated

875
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:50,640
by individuals on the fingertips there's another joint in between that's the elbow this is that

876
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:58,320
mid-level something could be dramatically redesigned and repurposed at the elbow joint

877
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:05,600
to where the mission of the fingertips is not consistent with the mission of the shoulder

878
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:12,720
when you confronted the head of security for that unnamed private aerospace company what was his

879
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:21,120
reaction was he nervous oh he was nervous i mean it's quite unusual for you to go and knock on

880
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:26,080
the door of a very very senior person in such a huge organization yeah no he welcomed me and

881
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:32,640
this is something that we had we had made arrangements for right but was he perhaps

882
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:37,680
freaked out frightened when you confronted him about what you told him i know i'd like to think

883
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:45,840
i know how to make myself come across disarming and so he told you to forget it we had a lovely

884
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:56,480
talk actually it was very personable um very congenial and he shared concerns maybe he i

885
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:02,560
like i would go as far as say he had more concerns than i did and and he was at a point in his career

886
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:09,520
where he didn't want to deal with this anymore he was making changes in his career to try and think

887
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:15,120
distance himself if he had any knowledge at all it was clear he's trying to distance himself from it

888
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:23,680
he didn't want to get involved but he did provide some advice on who where we should go if you look

889
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:30,320
at the inspector general function of any organization that is certainly a place that he recommended we

890
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:38,800
go but he he uh he made it clear that there were some inspector generals that may be

891
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:46,800
a better place to go than others and is that what you did no i didn't do that why didn't you go to

892
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:53,440
the inspector general um because these are the oversight agencies that the u.s government has

893
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:59,200
set up to properly investigate these kind of abuses of power it wasn't at that point you got

894
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:04,560
to remember like i had lost all faith in everything i was starting at ground zero i even

895
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:12,000
fired my whole team and was rebuilding my own network from the ground up um so at this top of

896
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,960
i'm a fingertips guy so my knowledge of the shoulder i was not going to go i didn't know

897
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:24,320
who to trust so even going to an inspector general the expectation would be for me to just spill all

898
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:31,520
so um i hadn't done my homework enough to where i felt comfortable going to an inspector general

899
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:35,920
and i wasn't necessarily wasn't sure that that was going to provide me the outcome i wanted

900
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:42,640
so what did you do so the first thing i did is i began expanding the list of people whose opinion

901
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:52,480
i was going to ask and uh through that process uh i found myself reaching out to the one thing

902
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:59,760
that was always my get out of jail free card which was i knew if anything got bad i could go to

903
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:07,040
members of congress particularly the senate intelligence committee the monitor for the cia

904
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:14,880
and plead my case and ask for help so we started there and unfortunately that was a very

905
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:24,240
disheartening experience because me going there asking for their help very quickly turned in

906
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:33,680
to them asking for my help you're kidding no no um which was extremely disappointing to say the

907
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:39,200
least but they were scared they were scared and they were running into their own problems of

908
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:47,440
being in fear of they were being harassed and they were afraid for their own personal safety

909
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:54,000
so people investigating this uap legacy program for congress were feeling threatened they were

910
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:02,080
feeling threatened and other people they were speaking to as sources were being threatened

911
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:06,880
and so they very quickly after learning who i was

912
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:16,640
began asking me for personal protection um and for strategies to mitigate threat

913
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:21,200
but you're not getting the help you need no i'm like i came to you so

914
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,600
that pretty much was a devastating moment where i'm like shoot we're all alone

915
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:32,000
um and it was unfortunately

916
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:41,920
a much more grave situation because what it indicated was that our congress was not only

917
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:49,360
ignorant to the subject they were neutered they were neutered by what they could do about it why

918
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:56,640
how i mean it's in your constitution jake the constitution enshrines the idea that that congress

919
01:42:56,640 --> 01:43:03,280
rules everything is accountable to congress congress needs an enforcement arm so laws without

920
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:11,280
enforcement don't exist so jake hearing your story about a psionic program inside the legacy uap

921
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:18,640
retrieval program makes me think back to cases like the 1980 bent waters incident where at an

922
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:27,680
raf base a royal air force base in the united kingdom christmas 1980 a craft allegedly landed

923
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:34,400
in an adjacent forest the rendlesham forest yeah what do you think happened there man that's one

924
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:40,240
of my favorite cases once i began looking into the history of this thing that's one of the ones that

925
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:46,320
stood out to me especially when you think about where we are now i i'll tell you this i if bent

926
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:52,800
waters happen tomorrow like this thing would be over with and because they couldn't conceal it

927
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:58,960
like well you couldn't conceal it but it's just everything we're looking for has already happened

928
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:04,000
like your book for example in plain sight if you just look it's it's so obvious but that one case

929
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:10,160
has everything we need and i don't know how anyone can say there's no evidence of extraterrestrial

930
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:15,200
and maybe they're hanging their hat on the that's why we have non-human intelligence maybe they're

931
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:19,920
trying to hang their hat on this one little narrow place they can slip through which is

932
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:26,320
things are not from outside the planet i don't know how they're doing that but whatever the

933
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:33,440
case what went on at bent waters has everything we need it has uh firsthand experiencers people

934
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:41,360
that have made physical contact with the craft um the most reputable people um in the air force

935
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:48,800
at that time working on a nuclear facility um osi shows up immediately of the office of special

936
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:53,280
investigation office of special investigation that's a us air force office yes people are

937
01:44:53,280 --> 01:45:02,320
sworn to secrecy um people it happened on multiple occasions there's multiple uh sensor data in that

938
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:07,040
goes with the the firsthand witness what do you say the money what do you speculate brought that

939
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:13,680
craft down well i'm certainly speculating but after my experience i think uh what may have

940
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:22,320
happened in that case is it may have been a craft that was attracted to a psionic asset or was being

941
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:31,920
operated by a son if that craft was ours and it was being operated psionically um there's this

942
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:38,480
thing called link loss link losses it's it's a common phrase used with drone operation drones are

943
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:46,480
or uavs as we call them unmanned aerial vehicles um or uas they're also called that unmanned aerial

944
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:54,560
systems are operated remotely in the off chance that there's a disconnect between the operating

945
01:45:54,560 --> 01:46:00,080
system or the transmitting side and the receiving side within these craft um it's called a link

946
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:07,680
loss and when that happens um our man-made systems are designed to rtb or return to base

947
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:16,240
or they can go to designated landing sites in a link loss so that same system would be deployed

948
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:21,520
because commonly what happens with a with a psionic asset who is using a form of intuition and

949
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:26,960
consciousness to connect with a craft uh there's a disconnect we call it which is like link loss

950
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:33,520
i can tell you when we run exercises using the psionic assets in an intentional environment to

951
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:40,000
get samples to the ground we intentionally disconnect the psionic asset so that the

952
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:46,080
hpm systems can be energized because there are some potential issues that can happen if the

953
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:53,440
psionic asset is still connected to the craft when it's hit with an emp or other hpm i'm told i'm

954
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:59,360
told part of their consciousness can stay in the craft yeah it seems to be the case that um

955
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:08,720
the human being um can suffer some form of cognitive injury by still being connected to

956
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:14,800
that craft when that craft is de-energized there is a case at the ref bentwaters during the ref

957
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:20,560
bentwaters incident in the united kingdom there was an airman called john burrows who was exposed

958
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:26,480
to what we now know was an extraordinary amount of gamma radiation dangerous radiation yeah and

959
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:33,280
he suffered quite terrible injuries but had a terrible time persuading veterans affairs that

960
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:39,120
he deserved medical assistance because he couldn't prove that this was an occupational exposure to

961
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:46,320
radiation well i can tell you i came to know the name john burrows because uh i've been seen by

962
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:50,960
the same doctor as him dr gary nolan for the exact same reason so what happened to you

963
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:59,280
we're not quite sure but the first time i got exposed to what in hindsight uh is obviously a

964
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:05,280
radiation exposure of some kind is uh we were transporting hvt's high value targets high value

965
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:12,880
target which are at this time was a large sealed container um i'll tell you i was in near the

966
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:19,360
continent of africa and uh after this particular mission me and everyone on my team got extremely

967
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:27,760
sick how sick like physically ill in the hospital um within you know weeks after this i lost every

968
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:37,440
hair on my body which they call a an alopecia uh migrating alopecia um and i also lost the

969
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:42,560
skin on my arms so the skin's actually falling off your body yeah like not just falling away

970
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:49,040
it was lopping off within a couple of days like a severe sunburn this led to a series of all kinds

971
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:56,240
of other what i have learned since being with dr nolan is uh autoimmune issues um i ended up

972
01:48:56,240 --> 01:49:01,760
developing a severe heart murmur that i never had before which is the same thing that john burrows

973
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:11,920
had um and throughout my career i would have reoccurring uh autoimmune dysfunction when exposed

974
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:17,280
to other things i ended up recovering from that at the time and because of the nature my work was

975
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:26,080
classified the va was only dealing with symptomology not causation in the treatment of my injuries and

976
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:30,640
i didn't even really understand that it was radiation so were you treated for radiation

977
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:38,000
poisoning no i was not are you being now no i'm not being treated now for radiation poisoning

978
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:43,760
but you're being what you're being investigated for what sounds like a radiation exposure yeah

979
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:50,320
because i had other occurrences later in my career after 9 11 when i left my enlisted capacity and

980
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:55,920
went to work as a contractor i've had other episodes where um i've had other illnesses and

981
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:02,400
i've had i've lost the hair on my body and patched out several times and to me i don't know if this

982
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:06,720
my fear is that there's something permanently broken that might show up in the form of cancer

983
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:12,960
god knows what later in life and we're going to be way behind in trying to figure out how to deal

984
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:22,480
with it so i am i did leave the service with the service uh service service connected disability

985
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:28,080
through the va and so i'm i'm getting treatment through the palo alto va under the supervision

986
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:34,720
of dr gary nolan right now and he's dedicating his expertise and his clout to get me um the best

987
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:40,160
treatment i can get now professor gary nolan is one of the world's top immunologists hugely

988
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:45,440
respected scientist who has as i understand it he's spoken publicly that he's been involved

989
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:53,040
in a program for an intelligence agency investigating havana syndrome yes so does it

990
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:57,840
give you some comfort that you're now getting the medical help that you should have got all those

991
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:02,960
years ago hell yeah it does and plus he's got the best bedside manner i've ever experienced

992
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:10,240
but clearly because of the covert nature of the job you were doing you weren't told what you'd

993
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:16,080
been exposed to no no we we transported what we called mystery boxes all the time i have no

994
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:21,200
idea it could have been empty it probably wasn't empty but we don't know what was inside the boxes

995
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:26,880
and what were you told if somebody tried to seize that box what was i told no we what were your

996
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:34,240
orders we we maintained the authority to use lethal force if anyone tried to seize those boxes

997
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:40,000
so whatever that box was it was extremely valuable to the u.s government that's correct i have to say

998
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:47,600
jake the the idea that you would be so recklessly exposed you know a person who's clearly patriotic

999
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:52,960
somebody who's clearly been a highly trained operator at the elite levels of special

1000
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:58,880
operations in the u.s military it offends my sense of decency that employers would expose

1001
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:03,360
you to something so recklessly can i put on my speculative hat for a minute sure okay so

1002
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:11,440
if if the air force let's say knew that what we were working with that night had any type of

1003
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:17,040
radiological signature or could turn on or turn off there's a whole set of process that we are

1004
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:21,760
we're trained in on how to deal with that from a hazmat perspective and a containment perspective

1005
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:26,480
and a measurement perspective on our person to detect the level of risk that might be associated

1006
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:34,400
and the fact that none of that was was apparent that night tells me they didn't know what was in

1007
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:41,360
the box and it got turned on or turned off which leads me to believe in hindsight all these years

1008
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:46,160
that it may have been something of non-human origin or exotic let's just say exotic it may

1009
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:52,800
have been something exotic that activated or still had some fallout let's say that they

1010
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:57,360
were unaware of you know are you the only person that you're aware of inside the program who's

1011
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:05,600
suffering health effects no no not at all how many are there uh more than me and probably

1012
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:12,560
51 percent or greater i would say are suffering some form of health effects yeah i'll just say

1013
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:18,080
just so you know it's it's more common than it's not that's heartbreaking i mean we ask our men

1014
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:23,200
and women in service to do so many things the idea that because a program is secret

1015
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:27,840
you wouldn't get the help you need i'm going to push back on that a little bit i don't think this

1016
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:35,280
is uh this is something that's unique to the program as we keep saying i would say 51 percent

1017
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:40,720
of more the people that come out of the military have and they sacrifice their bodies for for good

1018
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:44,720
reason that's part of what we're willing to do i mean the ultimate sacrifice they say is death

1019
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:52,640
which we've all agreed to do is to give up our life so anything less than death goes in with that

1020
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:59,040
obligation that we gave up voluntarily so the military at large or anyone that works in this

1021
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:05,840
capacity in the broader service of our nation they you get injured especially doing it 30 years

1022
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:15,200
in the course of your high value target investigation you met dr steven greer yeah yeah i

1023
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:22,000
did what was the purpose of meeting dr steven greer um well first of all i'd like to say that

1024
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:29,920
you know you can say what you want about dr greer but the guy's been 30 years ahead of everyone else

1025
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:38,560
on a lot of the details of this subject um so a lot of what he says is correct he to me he's like

1026
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:43,760
the bent waters like we had everything we needed in 1980 and now we're fishing around for morsels

1027
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:51,280
of that this guy he's he's been ahead of everyone and what i find quite funny is the one thing he

1028
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:57,200
gets the most shit for is the one thing he's probably most right about and that is his ce5

1029
01:54:57,200 --> 01:55:03,760
protocol so ce5 is when he uses meditation and he claims it engages telepathically with the

1030
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:09,360
phenomenon yeah that's his term for it like we don't use ce5 we don't use dr grige protocol

1031
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:16,320
nodor or other people in the in the program or subsequent programs so ce5 is real

1032
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:24,400
yeah if we're going to use his term i'll tell you what is real is is the ability to go into

1033
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:31,680
something like a meditative state and summon uap and pilot uap that is real that's 100 real

1034
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,680
wow i have to process that for a moment because that is just the most extraordinary claim

1035
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:44,320
yeah well we hope to prove it soon on what basis did you approach dr greer my understanding was

1036
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:52,720
that whoever was in a legal position whoever was in illegal possession of these hvt's may have the

1037
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:59,600
intention to expose that sensitive material as a whistleblower you were concerned he might take it

1038
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:06,400
to dr greer i was still working in my official capacity of protecting the sensitive data that

1039
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:14,720
was on these hvt's that was my job at the time so dr greer was scheduling here a whistleblower

1040
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:22,640
conference in dc and was holding a large event at the press club in washington dc

1041
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:29,760
and so we reached out to him one of my teammates made a bump with him in the virginia area

1042
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:36,640
and shared with him some information to pique his curiosity and to also bonafide ourselves as

1043
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:42,400
someone he should maybe consider listening to and we set up a meeting and i explained to him

1044
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:49,440
um upfront what our intentions were that we believed that there were whistleblowers that

1045
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:56,880
might come forward was something that is sensitive and it may not be appropriate to disclose and i

1046
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:03,680
asked to become um asked to be put in a position of authority with him where i could vet his

1047
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:09,840
whistleblowers so we offered our service to help vet whistleblowers at the time thinking our guys

1048
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:17,600
whoever was uh whoever had these hvt's might show up with the did that nope they never did but

1049
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:25,680
it was on this trip that we were what was interesting at the time is we were contemplating

1050
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:30,400
our own whistleblower path forward because of what had happened because of what had happened

1051
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:39,040
it was happening at this time and so what surprised me is during this event a young marine

1052
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:47,280
named michael Herrera came forward with a very particular story and spoke of a particular

1053
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:55,520
operation that we were aware was taking place or operations like it let's say were going on and

1054
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:02,160
i saw this young guy get up there and it just spoke to me call it my intuition that was blessed

1055
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:07,440
i was blessed with that night i made contact with non-human intelligence for the first time but

1056
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:14,560
my intuition was on you know was on high alert that night and when he spoke i knew what he was

1057
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:21,280
saying was true and no one else was believing him and he was wrong about a few key things that he

1058
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:28,160
was speculating on and so i made the decision after he spoke to go to dr gurir and ask to

1059
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:33,840
speak with him privately so let me summarize very quickly what michael Herrera alleged he was on a

1060
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:41,120
relief mission in Sumatra Indonesia they were deployed he and his small patrol to a particular

1061
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:48,160
area and they were helping find people who needed help yeah in the course of that patrol they were

1062
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:52,400
carrying weapons that's something that's been vigorously disputed by some of his colleagues

1063
01:58:52,400 --> 01:59:00,400
but he's adamant that he was carrying weapons and they stumbled across a craft a gigantic craft

1064
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:07,600
yeah many many many meters wide hovering in the air and below that craft there was a platform

1065
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:17,120
with trucks ford 150s and there were containers that he described that pushed buttons with you

1066
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:23,920
what he described didn't he he was told he told he told the greer disclosure conference which

1067
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:30,720
was in 2023 that the paramilitaries pointed their weapons and threatened to kill the marines that

1068
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:36,400
they were american they took their guns off them and they basically threatened that they were going

1069
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:43,280
to be killed yeah that's that's exactly what he talked about basically they were told eventually

1070
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:47,840
they were released they were told to walk away their weapons were unchambered there were no

1071
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:52,480
rounds in the weapons and they were told to walk away they allowed them to leave but they were told

1072
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:58,160
not to look back yeah i can't speak to all that and let me be clear um that is never that is not

1073
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:04,560
the type of group i would ever volunteer to be a part of but i know that uh there are guys like

1074
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:09,600
that out there that get shopped out and become part of these programs the particular part that

1075
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:15,840
that struck me were two things one the description of his craft although the size was enormous i have

1076
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:21,440
i have no experience with a craft that size but the craft he designed was precisely the same craft

1077
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:28,560
that we had come in contact with in our operations within the united states and that is it was a disc

1078
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:34,320
with the eight gun construction when viewed from above the other thing was he spoke of the

1079
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:41,360
containers and his initial uh speculation was that they made they must have been moving drugs

1080
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:47,200
because they had something on the top that looked like some sort of h vac system of some kind

1081
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:53,040
um and i knew right away those were the same type of containers we used for the site team

1082
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:58,480
when they're operating and being transported so what are the containers used for the containers

1083
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:05,280
are used for transportation of the side team and also just as a an operating base it's a

1084
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:12,560
it's a mobile operating base um and so this quickly went off the rails because

1085
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:20,480
it for some reason the term human trafficking got put into the story after or got put into the

1086
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:24,800
minds of the people that were hearing his story after i got involved so what did michael harrera

1087
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,880
think he thought they were either gun running or drug running didn't yeah he thought they were

1088
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:34,800
that's what he assumed they were running drugs and uh i knew that those type of containers when

1089
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:40,720
associated with that craft were used for the side team that's why they had many split h vac units

1090
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:47,440
on the top provide comfortable environments inside for humans for either transportation

1091
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:51,520
or for operation you can operate inside those containers and they're sealed they're kind of

1092
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:56,960
like a faraday cage in that regard where it allows you to concentrate if you're going to

1093
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:02,880
operate from those you can concentrate on your work as a si asset or they're used to mobilize

1094
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:09,040
so clearly whoever those men were they were american they were private military contractors

1095
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:16,560
and they weren't very friendly no are they the people that you feel pose a threat at times to

1096
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:21,920
the legitimate operations of the program yeah i think uh it doesn't take many bad apples to

1097
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:27,200
ruin the batch because to make the point you're at pains aren't you to emphasize that generally

1098
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:35,120
this is a well-run operation that runs on ethical boundaries yeah my primary messages my primary

1099
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:41,280
message that i want to get across is that this mass vilifying of what's referred to as the

1100
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:50,880
military industrial complex is a very bad idea and there are very good people that work over here

1101
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:57,200
not just good the best the best and brightest that america has to offer and the goods and

1102
02:02:57,200 --> 02:03:03,040
service that are provided by those organizations which fall under the military industrial complex

1103
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:06,160
are the goods and services that make our country the greatest in the world

1104
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:16,320
and we benefit from those on a daily basis and so to mass vilify it on mass is not only i mean

1105
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:24,080
that's a crime in itself but it's a shame and we're so hungry to people are so eager to quantify

1106
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:31,040
where their threat is coming from we want a bad guy and this this is not an entire cabal of bad

1107
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:35,840
guys there are a few bad guys like it everywhere that operate within the military industrial

1108
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:43,600
complex and unfortunately um their operations get get the spotlight so you but you you decided

1109
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:48,640
that michael Herrera his account made sense to you from what you knew about the program what did you

1110
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:58,480
do um i told him i told him what i believed was going on and that it that i knew that there were

1111
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:05,120
operations going on oh konus in third world countries to recruit and train psionic assets

1112
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:11,760
and whether or not this was an opportunity to recruit or provide job opportunities to new people

1113
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:17,360
or he stumbled upon an operation in which they were currently being deployed and maybe they

1114
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:24,080
had to evacuate themselves from that area because of the natural disaster who knows but that's all

1115
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:29,440
speculation there's two applications that come out of that firstly we're recruiting psionics from

1116
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:36,720
indonesia a foreign country yeah are those people given are they voluntarily going are they are they

1117
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:41,520
yeah that's my understanding they're very well taken care of um you have you have to think and

1118
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:48,160
this is where the human trafficking idea was a was a very unfortunate turn in in michael's story

1119
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:53,120
especially after my involvement with it because now oh great now we got this guy that is at least

1120
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:58,080
somewhat indirectly informed that there's a human trafficking operation and when we talk about human

1121
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:02,960
trafficking we think of sex trade and all kinds of other things and this is not it at all i

1122
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:09,600
there's my understanding that the programs that are conducted to recruit psionic assets in third

1123
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:14,720
world countries these people come willingly and if you were to go down there and try and liberate

1124
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:21,360
them with any type of you know liberation army um you would be liberating people that don't want to

1125
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:26,160
be liberated they get very well taken care of they get fed there's actually a sense of pride

1126
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:30,800
especially within the native american communities that have been involved in this program that

1127
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:37,120
do cooperate outside of konus as well um there's a sense of pride with this skill and ability

1128
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:44,080
and so again this is another example of it's almost like we want there to be darkness in this area

1129
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:50,640
and there is not darkness and i'll tell you by nature of my experience as i shared non-human

1130
02:05:50,640 --> 02:06:00,240
intelligence itself does not operate that way and so these people that that are whose um skills

1131
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:05,440
are nurtured are basking in a glow of light i would assume most of the time when they're

1132
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:10,480
doing doing their work for them it's a very positive experience very engaging spiritually

1133
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:16,880
with this phenomenon yeah so you say they're basking in some divinely beautiful uh frequency

1134
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:21,360
in order to do the work properly the implications from what you're saying are that if Michael

1135
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:27,920
Herrera is telling the truth if he really did see a gigantic octagonal craft floating in mid-air

1136
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:35,280
with no visible means of propulsion in indonesia in sumatra in i think 2009 yeah it suggests that

1137
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:40,960
a private military contractor working for an aerospace company was operating some kind of

1138
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:46,800
reverse engineered vehicle yeah it's certainly possible i would say especially based on what i

1139
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:53,360
saw i dealt with a much smaller version of an octagonal saucer this was a bigger one i could

1140
02:06:53,360 --> 02:07:00,160
certainly see that being possible can you answer me this question have you seen any alien reproduction

1141
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:07,440
vehicles any replica vehicles made from non-human technology i honestly can't tell you with um with

1142
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:12,560
certainty once we get into the space but i can tell you what i know has been human what has been

1143
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:17,200
non-human when it gets into the hybrids i just don't know can you tell me how many retrievals

1144
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:25,840
you've been involved in no you that's a classified thing yes can you tell me were the remaining i

1145
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:34,000
think four hard disks ever recovered the four tough books to my knowledge no we stopped at

1146
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,400
two so there are still four hard disks containing containing potentially incriminating material

1147
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:45,120
at large or somebody else was hired and they recovered them is it a question mark in your

1148
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:50,400
mind that maybe it was a foreign adversary power that was trying to procure this incredibly sensitive

1149
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:57,840
yeah that's certainly possible was there a a name for the psionics was there a term that you used

1150
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:05,920
for uh there's a term we used which is what a p3 program why the p3 there's three p's it's the

1151
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:15,760
psionic predisposition potential p3 yeah now that's not an official program name i

1152
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:20,800
think you'll find anywhere that's why i'm able to say that from your understanding of the kind of

1153
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:26,480
people obviously who were capable of psionic ability obviously there's people of native

1154
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:30,720
american background people from third world countries that are deeply spiritual that appear

1155
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:35,600
to have this capacity to engage with the phenomenon was there any other group that was especially

1156
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:42,400
susceptible to being able to engage with this technology yeah kids children children it's been

1157
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:47,520
suggested to me that left-handed gay men are particularly good at it yeah that certainly

1158
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:52,880
seems to be the case that there is a larger distribution of the predisposition amongst

1159
02:08:53,520 --> 02:09:02,640
children and gay men for whatever reason the demographic when compared to normal society

1160
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:12,880
within the program that gay men and kids and females are more more often seen

1161
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:19,760
as having the predisposition for the psionic ability i'm again exploring the boundaries of

1162
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:23,200
where i can go and you you might want to say no comment to this but i'm going to put it to you

1163
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:28,400
anyway i have another source inside the program who has told me that one of the aerospace companies

1164
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:34,240
holding this tech at one stage relinquished a craft to the u.s government saying that they hadn't

1165
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:40,320
been able to successfully reverse engineer it and it has been put to me that this was a lie

1166
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:45,200
and that they have in fact got a fully flying intact reverse engineered craft i've heard the

1167
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:52,160
very same thing from a very reputable source so i would i would believe that's true the implications

1168
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:59,600
of this are that there's a whole secret program involving potentially energy technologies

1169
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:07,760
anti-gravity technologies that are mind-blowing yeah it's fun isn't it it is fun yeah i mean i

1170
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:14,480
guess the the message that i'm getting from you is one of kind of optimism yeah i'm i'm very pleased

1171
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:19,840
to be at a place where this is becoming fun again you know when i when i started this journey 30

1172
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:24,880
years ago in a 17 year old kid as i shared with you my intentions were very simple and clear i

1173
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:30,160
wanted to jump out of airplanes kill bad guys and make my grandparents proud somewhere along the way

1174
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:37,920
things got very confusing and very complex we're now at a point where things are very simple for

1175
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:42,800
me again and i see clearly what i want to do with the rest of my life and i have my why

1176
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:50,560
and fortunately because of my experience i have the how i have the capability and we over the

1177
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:59,040
last two years while we've been hiding out we've been working to find a way to bring this operation

1178
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:06,480
out of the shadows and into an open environment where we could build a public private partnership

1179
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:13,440
with full transparency and explore all of these things that have been explored in secret

1180
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:20,800
in a way that we can start from scratch but we may be 60 70 years behind what everyone calls

1181
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:24,720
the legacy program but i'm telling you we're going to catch up very quickly and the reason

1182
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:28,960
it's going to work is because we have all of the people like me that have been working there

1183
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:35,120
we've i call it the league of extraordinary gentlemen but we have been recruiting guys

1184
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:41,840
from within the program and women and those who are associated with the program

1185
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:49,440
in a very open way and have formed and are forming a new team in coordination with

1186
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:55,600
government agencies the two we would want the most coordination with are are coming on board with us

1187
02:11:56,240 --> 02:12:00,080
and we also have the funding through venture capital can you name those agencies

1188
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:05,920
um not at this time but i hope to very soon you know we have some really important meetings next

1189
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:12,240
week and uh i hope that after that time i'm going to need to ask permission out of just

1190
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:18,000
good faith with those folks to see how how much they want to be i guess a lot of people watching

1191
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:23,600
this might be worried that you're getting sucked into say an intelligence agency or a military

1192
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:30,960
agency that is going to try and shut you down yeah well um or it could be where we're just the

1193
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:36,240
we're just the legacy program 2.0 and this all goes underground again i'm giving you my promise

1194
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:43,440
right now our organization is called sky watcher we are part of what has been defined as the

1195
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:50,640
explorer's club and it is full of people who have the best intentions in mind and there's going to

1196
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:55,440
be accountability with there there's not going to be transparency and i know that sounds like a lot

1197
02:12:55,440 --> 02:13:01,600
coming or sounds like could be a load coming from a guy like me with my background but you know i'm

1198
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:05,760
not going to be able to prove it to you in this conversation but i'll say pay attention and

1199
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:12,480
i'll paraphrase a quote from the book of matthew and say you will know them by their fruits so

1200
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:18,640
stand by and judge us for our fruits you've been really touched haven't you by this experience

1201
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:25,760
it's touched you spiritually yes it has there was a gathering at esalen okay and a lot of very high

1202
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:33,120
net worth individuals who were interested in suppression of non-human intelligence attended

1203
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:39,920
what happened i think something epic happened i think something happened that

1204
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:47,360
if it was fully documented and understood would go in the history books

1205
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:54,240
i had a feeling last week that that was historical it felt absolutely historic what you had was a

1206
02:13:54,240 --> 02:14:03,360
combination of the world's leading like most frontier scientists you had people that were

1207
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:12,240
top experts in all their fields and then you had a variety of fields that was

1208
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:19,520
outrageous we had neurosurgeons doctors and neurosurgeon we had physicists we had

1209
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:27,760
high net worth individuals in the billions that were extremely open-minded and had a

1210
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:36,400
frontier attitude towards all this we had mystics we had psychic kids we had children from germany

1211
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:45,760
that could harness and actually showcase their ability to perform telekinesis their ability to

1212
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:56,000
psychically see things with their mind and were able to prove that to all of us we also deployed

1213
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,760
some of our psionic assets that we've used and are part of our new team with skywatcher

1214
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:08,960
and we summoned uap we had the uap come and fly around and visit hang out with us and take off

1215
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:13,760
and i have to say i saw it too yeah and it was profound

1216
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:23,840
it's a spiritual experience and what you're trying to do now is replicate in the private sphere

1217
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:31,600
what's being suppressed in the public sphere yeah you know we we're not looking back you know we

1218
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:38,800
could we can leave the bad actors of the past we can leave them with their lies we have no need

1219
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:46,640
for that we're looking forward i am absolutely confident that we are capable of generating the

1220
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:55,120
type of high quality sensor data and photography and film evidence that everyone is wanting i'm

1221
02:15:55,120 --> 02:16:02,240
also confident that if we continue on the path with our with our government agencies that we're

1222
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:07,200
going to get a craft we're going to get material in hand i know it's possible it's just a matter

1223
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:11,920
of working out the logistics i'm just i'm just exploring this with you the implications are that

1224
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:20,240
that this one part of the black world of the u.s government that is being hidden from congress

1225
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:28,480
hidden from some presidents i know yeah working on retrieved alien non-human technology

1226
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:34,640
yeah it's being kept from the knowledge of the american public and yet there's they're being

1227
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:39,520
funded with taxpayer dollars billions of taxpayers dollars if you believe it yeah

1228
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:41,600
yeah what do you think of that

1229
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:47,600
well it doesn't sound right does it but you you could probably

1230
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:52,720
tell that same story around a number of other things that have nothing to do with aliens and

1231
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:58,000
unfortunately that's the government and the world we live in but the exciting thing is

1232
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:04,560
the thing i find breathtaking from what you're saying is you're saying as somebody who's come

1233
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:11,200
from that black world yeah screw the secrecy i'm going to say it a little differently

1234
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:18,800
the u.s the monopoly the u.s government has on the subject matter is not respected by the non-human

1235
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:25,040
intelligence spirits again the skies are not classified and your conscience cannot be redacted

1236
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:32,080
and ultimately why i feel safe and why i feel optimum optimistic about the future is i know

1237
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:39,280
that the nhi is guiding us that way can you explain how it is that you're not authorized

1238
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:45,040
to do this interview but you ended up applying for a dopsa i think our audience might be confused

1239
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:49,280
they might think that this is somehow an authorized interview and that there are people in the defense

1240
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:54,240
department pulling the strings telling you what to say and that this is some kind of

1241
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:59,920
disinformation operation yeah that's uh that makes a lot of sense to me but you know for what

1242
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:04,880
it's worth i can tell you that's not the case i mean the dopser processes is very interesting

1243
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:09,840
it's way more casual especially on the onset than you might think

1244
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:18,080
when you take into account the ramifications for for violating the mandates that come out of it

1245
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:23,520
and the subject matter that it's supposedly protecting but you know they get put in a really

1246
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:30,320
tough spot and this is part of something we aimed to take advantage of i guess you could say by

1247
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:36,560
interrogating the dopser system one of the things i haven't shared yet is in our effort to find out

1248
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:44,000
who we were looking for one of the ways we came up with on how to do that was to query for who

1249
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:51,520
might want to redact statements we intended to go public with through dopser so you filed i think a

1250
02:18:51,520 --> 02:19:01,360
fictionalized account of some of your experiences to dopser yeah so um any author or anybody that's

1251
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:07,120
going to be contributing to an author to put something in writing or to share it orally like this

1252
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,480
has to go through the dopser process if you ever held a security clearance

1253
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:21,120
working for a government agency in the subject matter that you are intending to go public on so

1254
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:25,920
right off the bat there's a tell right there the fact that i had to go through dopser tells you i

1255
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:30,960
had a security clearance on the subject matter right there so there's their first failure of

1256
02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:38,880
poker face and that's exactly what we set out to exploit and so we came up with a reconnaissance

1257
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:43,600
mission the reconnaissance mission looked like this we were going to write a detailed manuscript

1258
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:50,880
as fiction through a ghostwriter when we completed that it was about 120 000 word

1259
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:56,480
manuscript we broke that manuscript into actual sections that we called episodes

1260
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:04,080
because dopser wants you to complete or submit the entire document we submitted our first 20 000

1261
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:11,840
words our first 10 000 words which was 20 pages and within that first chunk of information we

1262
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:18,400
included four types of information and that information's purpose again was to inform us

1263
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:23,840
as to what they considered sensitive and the smes which stands for subject matter experts

1264
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:29,680
that they were outsourcing the information to because what they do in the dopser process is

1265
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:35,520
they send it out to all of the agencies that might be affected by you going public on something

1266
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:39,760
even in a fictionalized manuscript and they say to them is there anything in here that needs to

1267
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:44,800
be redacted to protect national security that's correct and it could be it could be you could

1268
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:51,200
present it to them as fact or fiction it doesn't matter the context but more importantly if it's

1269
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:58,720
protecting national security and it's redacted it has to be a legally authorized program doesn't

1270
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:06,160
it yes it does so this this is what we use to set up our four categories of information that

1271
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:11,360
i want to get through with you category one we included in that manuscript information we knew

1272
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:20,480
was classified that we were privy to and we knew that was patently classified on a very high level

1273
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:28,240
information category number two was information that was classified but we knew only existed

1274
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:32,080
within the hearts and minds of the operators that were at the fingertips of that operation

1275
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:39,200
um information category number three was information that was classified but you

1276
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:44,480
may be surprised to learn was already in the public domain and open source source because

1277
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:49,520
of the nature of the internet there are things that the dod and its partners would say that

1278
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:54,560
shouldn't be out there but but it is anyway so we put some of that in there and then we had our

1279
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:59,920
fourth category information which was the most fun which was where we took a little liberty

1280
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:06,240
and went fishing we took our information that we knew was compartmentalized connected it with

1281
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:12,640
other information that were these fact islands we were aware of because of our i won't say how

1282
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:19,120
and then we took our own creative liberty at connecting those two dots through a particular

1283
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:26,720
pathway as to why that might exist and filled that space with other fictional classified information

1284
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:33,120
what happened six months later took six months we came back with seven pages of redactions

1285
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:40,640
of all four categories wow so one that confirms there is a classified program relating to this

1286
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:48,480
information yes wow now there was a counterplay here so although that was informative i have to

1287
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:54,640
tell you when they came back our intention was now that reconnaissance mission having

1288
02:22:54,640 --> 02:23:00,000
bared fruits was now going to inform how we went back and edited remember this was the first 20

1289
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:06,000
pages of a of a multi-page i would say the first 10 000 words of 120 000 word manuscript we were

1290
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:11,200
then going to take that information and write around it in order to extract more intel through

1291
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:15,600
the dobser process so you were running a counter counter surveillance operation against the very

1292
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:21,840
organizations that's a red team's best tool right there you were doing op four opposition

1293
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:26,640
play three four five dimensional test yeah chess so you play multi-dimensional chess

1294
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:32,720
so even though they know you and your team were thinking about publishing something they don't

1295
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:38,080
know that you're speaking publicly on national television about the legacy program that's a good

1296
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:42,480
question no they don't but it doesn't mean i was limited to do that because i have to tell you

1297
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:48,000
about the counterplay so there is a although they have no poker face they're in a really tough spot

1298
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:56,800
because not redacting information means that if they just if they just chose hey this is sensitive

1299
02:23:56,800 --> 02:24:00,720
but we're not going to redact it well now obviously that makes it into the public domain

1300
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:08,240
but by redacting it they prove that it's sensitive so they have no idea as to

1301
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:13,280
they have no idea as to how you acquired the information they know based on your security

1302
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:18,000
clearance and your background because it had to be submitted under my official name it's a

1303
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:23,040
social security number and my record in order to get triggered and that's how they know what sms

1304
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:28,320
to send it to the sms who i worked for squashed all kinds of stuff then it went to one of the

1305
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:32,880
other sms i worked for they squashed their stuff and it came back with all these squashings in the

1306
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:40,480
form of black ink now let me keep going because the counterplay for them would have been to let

1307
02:24:40,480 --> 02:24:48,720
certain information go so that it could be formally categorized as not sensitive and the

1308
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:55,840
fictional liberties taken by an author of a fictional book so they could do that they could

1309
02:24:55,840 --> 02:25:02,640
have done that but we didn't really see that what they did do however was they got a sense they were

1310
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:07,600
they got on to us they figured out what we were doing and they said stop you cannot submit anything

1311
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:12,640
else you have to submit the whole manuscript and we told them well that is the whole book we're

1312
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:18,160
going to release this like episodes of a special this is the whole season but we're going to release

1313
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:23,360
it an episode so we have to send it to you 10 000 words at a time because that's how it's going to

1314
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:28,960
be released and they they were kind of caught there and they didn't quite know how to respond

1315
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:37,840
so i can tell you that since then and this was a 2000 correction this was 2022 i think believe in

1316
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:43,600
january when we first submitted the manuscript and they they haven't gotten back to us on the

1317
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:47,760
rest of it still sitting there do you think that there are people in private aerospace who think

1318
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:52,080
that it's inevitable that eventually this story is going to be yeah i know there there are and

1319
02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:56,480
we have a lot of people in private aerospace that are part of our sky sky watcher program

1320
02:25:56,480 --> 02:26:01,120
that have come on because just echoing the point that you made earlier that the military industrial

1321
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:06,880
complex is not one big monolithic organization that says the same thing and has the same view

1322
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:14,000
there are people i know inside the military inside the intelligence community and you've

1323
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:19,200
been one of them who basically think it's implausible to try and keep this secret and

1324
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:23,440
moreover that the public has a right to know yeah it's it's going to come out it's all coming out

1325
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:28,640
it's coming out probably like this year so you think yourself the public has a right to know

1326
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:34,960
this information not all of it no what sort of things need to be protected do you think

1327
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:40,400
let's um anything that affects national security like we have to be careful of

1328
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:45,680
what we wish for like we don't know what we don't know even me i don't know what i don't know

1329
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:51,040
and if we're at the point where we have so little trust in our government that we're just going to

1330
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:56,880
there's a reason it's called catastrophic disclosure catastrophic is not good

1331
02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:02,720
for those calling for heads any more than it's good for those whose heads are being called for

1332
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:08,640
like we as a public do not want catastrophic disclosure we what we need again there's a few

1333
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:15,360
bad apples we need to maintain our institutions we don't get rid of them we need to find a way

1334
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:20,240
to get the right people promoted to positions of power and trust and we already have that

1335
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:24,000
it's called the gang of eight in congress they're a big part of that right now it's not functioning

1336
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:28,000
that way but we're not going to change we can't change the structure we need to get the right

1337
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:34,080
people into power into positions start looking into it um and again you don't need to rely on

1338
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:38,320
the government it's already there like what we need to know is this we need to know that we're

1339
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:46,080
not alone we need to know that there's a profound spiritual component to our existence and that's

1340
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:52,560
just for the sake of our own fellowship is creatures sharing this planet but also there

1341
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:59,840
it's there's an extreme amount of utility in our ability that has been suppressed forever so if

1342
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:06,800
if we could learn how to use that um and also for those that are keeping the secrets keeping

1343
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:12,720
it secret is a bad way to try and study something we need an open source we need all hands on deck

1344
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:19,120
all brains on deck all consciences on deck in order to find out how we can exploit this in the

1345
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:26,800
best of ways in order to come up with things like zero point energy let's say until we do so we're

1346
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:31,440
going to be stuck with the same problem we have been for all the civilization and that's a battling

1347
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:38,880
for limited resources and if we could solve that problem by something that might come out of

1348
02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:44,320
disclosure that would be something i say should be disclosed things relative to national security

1349
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:51,520
no and we can't trust ourselves we can't say give us all of it because we don't trust you we have to

1350
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:55,760
put trustworthy people in position and let them make that decision okay let me ask you this way

1351
02:28:55,760 --> 02:29:04,720
then do you think the public have the right to know that we are not alone yes i'll say yes to that

1352
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:10,080
and the thing i find shocking though is that the most beautiful thing that you've described to me

1353
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:14,880
the most exciting thing is what i think our audience is going to have the biggest trouble with

1354
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:22,960
is believing the idea that human beings have the capacity to do things with their minds

1355
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:29,760
that have been suppressed yeah i've just kind of smiled because that makes it more entertaining

1356
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:34,880
for me because they're going to be shocked but you know what they i think i don't think that's

1357
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:39,600
necessarily the case i think there's more people that believe it they're just not talking about it

1358
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:45,760
and i can tell you for a fact even within our world of hardened operators at the highest level

1359
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:50,800
of guys that are still in behind closed doors we all know it's true and we have the most emotional

1360
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:57,200
talks like we're part of oprah's book club i mean it's it's true and right now we're in a moment

1361
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:03,440
where the truth is being obfuscated and twisted but the truth i'll tell you is our weapon and

1362
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:09,840
when we're willing to accept the truth no matter how profound or earth shaking is when we move

1363
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:16,240
into a position of power and it's going to liberate this subject and you know what how fun

1364
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:20,320
would it be if we're right i'm not telling you it'd be different if the government

1365
02:30:20,320 --> 02:30:24,640
and what was being hid behind this subject matter was the fact that there was an asteroid on course

1366
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:31,520
for earth that we there is no way we could we could redirect it or there's no way we could

1367
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:37,280
defend against it and we were all going to die in the year 2020x or whatever it is that's not

1368
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:42,880
what's being hidden what's being hidden here is something extremely positive and it's something

1369
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:48,560
we've all hoped for it's the one thing we've all looked for in all of our religions that we celebrate

1370
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:55,120
across the world it's the one thing that we want to be true of our religion and it's the one thing

1371
02:30:55,120 --> 02:31:01,520
that um the one common thread amongst all religions and so that's what's being hidden

1372
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:05,680
and that's what we're going to find out and you can't bottle it up the implications of what you're

1373
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:12,720
saying also are that potentially there is some kind of capacity to draw incredible amounts of

1374
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:21,760
energy from the quantum back end you've seen it i've seen it there's also obviously the capacity

1375
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:26,960
to use propulsion systems that are far beyond what we're describing yeah that seems to be the case

1376
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:35,040
as well anti-gravity anti-gravity they know about it anti-gravity zero point energy those

1377
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:42,160
secrets are being suppressed from our knowledge i've seen demonstrations recently that again

1378
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:48,400
proves that the government doesn't have a monopoly on this they have while they have we know that

1379
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:53,840
they have been working on it they've seemed to have been doing a good job in keeping others

1380
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:59,040
from making their own independent progress but that time is changing independent progress is

1381
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:05,520
happening right now and it's coming out that's why i'm so confident we don't need to rely on their

1382
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:12,960
body of lack of evidence let's say we don't need to rely on that like it's here like the the shift

1383
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:18,000
has already happened there's people in silicone valley and around the world that are so financially

1384
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:25,600
independent so intellectually independent and yes so emotionally and psionically independent

1385
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:31,360
that they don't need the government to tell us those things but we still have to work through

1386
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:38,800
do you think the aliens the non-human intelligence wants us humanity to know

1387
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:44,480
about their existence yeah i do believe that that's the message that that we're getting

1388
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:49,600
so you felt that yourself when you connected and there are others that i know of

1389
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:57,440
that are being sent that message directly and they are extremely confident so jake in early

1390
02:32:57,440 --> 02:33:03,440
october you made the decision on the invitation of the senate select committee for intelligence

1391
02:33:03,440 --> 02:33:11,520
to go to congress and give evidence yes i did how was that day um it was great it was a it was nice

1392
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:18,400
to finally get it done and it seemed like by the time i went i held out so long that by the time

1393
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:23,280
i got there there are a lot of people had already done the heavy lifting like dave and others and so

1394
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:32,400
they were like okay we know we don't know and we know that we haven't proven to be the most

1395
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:38,800
they know that they don't have they can't offer whistleblowers the protection we know they need

1396
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:44,400
which was my primary objection the entire time is that they offer protection they have no way

1397
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:48,080
of providing it they've got no enforcement they've got no enforcement they can't protect me

1398
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:55,840
um and so things had certainly changed what was the reception in the room what kind of comments

1399
02:33:55,840 --> 02:34:00,880
did you hear well for the most part it was fantastic you know there was eight or nine people

1400
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:07,600
i'm not going to say versus me but it was a one v nine situation where it was me in there and then

1401
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:13,920
i had at times seven to ten people a few had to come and go because we went for four and a half

1402
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:20,480
hours but um it was all ears it was listening david grush and commander david fravor gave

1403
02:34:20,480 --> 02:34:26,240
evidence to the congress along with ryan graves the two f-18 pilots sat with david grush and gave

1404
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:33,120
evidence to the congress last year under oath and they insisted on doing it under oath to emphasize

1405
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:39,840
the veracity the truthfulness of what they were saying if you were asked would you be prepared

1406
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:45,840
to do the same 100 and i told them that i told congress that during our time in the skiff now

1407
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:50,400
what impact do you think you had on the people listening in the room at the senate select

1408
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:55,920
committee for intelligence well we laughed we cried we had a lot of serious talk so if anything i

1409
02:34:56,640 --> 02:35:03,280
i would think i came across sincere keep in mind we were scheduled for a two-hour block we went

1410
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:08,080
four and a half so they were definitely engaged they seemed like they were

1411
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:13,920
sincere sincere in their effort to find out what's going on why hasn't somebody like you

1412
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:19,840
with first-hand knowledge of the program come forward so definitively before that's a good

1413
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:26,320
question and that's what i kept waiting for more to come forward i feel uniquely qualified to come

1414
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:31,840
forward at this time because i know we have this private venture coming and i've already been

1415
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:38,320
begun negotiating with those government agencies who i thought may have come after me let's say

1416
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:46,080
if they had ill will and it's been proven to me that they don't so there are government agencies

1417
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:52,960
that don't know about this program that are aware of the obvious illegality of parts of it yeah

1418
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:59,200
i don't know if it's that it's every department has within it a responsibility to deal with

1419
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:04,480
in the sky flying around that we don't know what it is i mean just start in the faa for example

1420
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:11,440
which is ryan graves's particular case he's he's trying to advance is that you know there is a

1421
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:15,760
safety of flight here there is an aircraft separation issue a collision avoidance issue

1422
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:21,200
in the air if there are things flying around in the sky and the faa doesn't have a way of managing

1423
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:28,640
that or producing safety reports on it we've got a big problem and the problem gets much bigger from

1424
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:34,480
there and so while we like to speak of the government is the government it is not one big

1425
02:36:34,480 --> 02:36:41,280
cohesive machine that works together and so every department like the fbi like department of homeland

1426
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:50,160
security like border patrol department of defense you know they have their own niche responsibilities

1427
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:55,440
in order to make sure things in the sky aren't our adversaries aren't carrying payloads aren't

1428
02:36:55,440 --> 02:37:01,280
causing safety of flight issue and yeah aren't they also have a responsibility to figure out

1429
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:07,600
whether or not aliens are visiting the planet and you think they are yeah i do so the truth

1430
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:14,720
is out the truth has been out for a long time what would you like to see happen like what's

1431
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:20,640
your dream you've seen this technology yeah you've felt the sincerity of the intelligence

1432
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:26,000
that you were engaging with what would you dream of what's your aspiration for the future

1433
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:32,160
you know what'd be really cool is to be driving down the highway look up and see a billboard

1434
02:37:32,160 --> 02:37:39,440
advertisement for the united states air force recruiting kids into a career field for uap

1435
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:49,520
research and study for psionic exploration for piloting technology to other galaxies like

1436
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:53,920
that would tell me we've arrived and we are at a place where clearly

1437
02:37:54,480 --> 02:38:00,480
the public and the government are working together because the suppression of this secret it's not

1438
02:38:00,480 --> 02:38:06,560
just suppressing technology and weapons which i can you know as much as i don't like the idea of it

1439
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:13,040
i can understand why somebody might have made the decision to do that it's suppressing spiritual

1440
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:19,360
knowledge that you think the public's got a right to know well and here's where i would say we need

1441
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:26,800
to respect the fact that we don't know if we don't know imagine weaponizing consciousness

1442
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:34,480
we don't think of in this story we're telling we're assuming consciousness is the good benevolent

1443
02:38:34,480 --> 02:38:38,480
harmless thing that should be disclosed everything we've researched and understood

1444
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:45,040
imagine if it is the case that consciousness could be weaponized and that people like the

1445
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:51,360
president of the united states could have could be under mind control that's a huge problem and

1446
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:56,640
imagine if someone could independently develop we already see this problem with drones we are so out

1447
02:38:56,640 --> 02:39:06,000
of control with the drone issue that drones can fly around with a payload and cause mash casualties

1448
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:11,120
because we don't have it under control the fa doesn't we just unfortunately we don't have the

1449
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:16,400
cfrs the code of federal regulations and the people hired to deal with something like drones

1450
02:39:16,400 --> 02:39:22,480
imagine if we had to manage and police the malevolent use or the weaponization of consciousness

1451
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:29,120
that could be a really big problem have you done any operations yourself retrievals or operations

1452
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:36,000
involving the legacy program in arizona no have you seen the rubber duck video which was shot by

1453
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:41,360
border patrol from a surveillance plane over parts of the arizona desert yes do you know

1454
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:46,320
anything about that object i don't i don't know anything about it are you aware of any underground

1455
02:39:46,320 --> 02:39:55,920
bases yes have you visited any yes so they exist they do can you tell me anymore no ross

1456
02:39:57,200 --> 02:40:03,120
you can't blame me for trying no i don't blame you do you know anything about the phoenix lights

1457
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:07,840
i'm very yeah i'm familiar with that story i remember hearing about it when i was a kid

1458
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:12,640
and going oh you know that's interesting but not believing it but now knowing what i know it seems

1459
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:18,800
very clear to me that that was a legitimate non-human intelligence that had flown some

1460
02:40:18,800 --> 02:40:24,640
sort of craft over phoenix which raises the question all over the united states right now

1461
02:40:25,360 --> 02:40:32,640
us air force bases are being buzzed by what they call drones yeah and funnily enough nobody's seen

1462
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:38,400
one of these and been able to recover one because so-called electromagnetic pulse weapons don't work

1463
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:45,680
on these objects whatever they are not all uap respond to the same weapon systems it raises the

1464
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:52,800
question is the phenomenon making itself more overt do you think is it trying to wake us up

1465
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:58,720
certainly is to me in my experience but you know it's hard to say i don't know how to

1466
02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:03,760
how to look at that from a completely objective i don't know i don't know how much it's shown

1467
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:09,120
itself over the decades and centuries because a lot of people watching this said to say

1468
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:16,560
you're pushing them up against a barrier of doubt indecision stigma and taboo that's been attached

1469
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:22,960
to the subject for 80 years a lot of people aren't going to believe this what do you say to those

1470
02:41:22,960 --> 02:41:29,120
people i'm not here to make anyone believe anything it's exhausting like either you're

1471
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:34,480
going to get it or you're not going to get it like we have we honor in our own capacity

1472
02:41:35,360 --> 02:41:40,800
we've operated sky watcher already me and my team on the very first outing summoned a white egg in

1473
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:45,760
broad daylight and while i have pictures of it i'm happy to share with you we calculated this object

1474
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:52,000
to be traveling depending upon the slack range distance anywhere between 3 000 and 11 000 miles

1475
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:57,760
per hour based on this size we're still analyzing the data we collected from the range and we're

1476
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:04,240
happy to show that to you and so what else could that be there's this there's this other way of

1477
02:42:04,240 --> 02:42:10,080
looking at this like we can put all this information before you and you could say it's not this it's

1478
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:16,560
not this it's not this we're at a point now where the amount of information is so overwhelming the

1479
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:23,200
probability that any alternate alternate explanation for its existence is there is so much

1480
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:29,440
less than the probability that what i'm telling you is exactly what is going on you want this

1481
02:42:29,440 --> 02:42:34,640
investigated don't you yeah i wanted i want to do the investigating that's what we're doing i want

1482
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:39,920
but would you quite like to see as a result of this story would you like to see yourself questioned

1483
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:45,520
and held to account for evidence and and tested your allegations yeah we have an opportunity

1484
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:53,440
right now to work with the u.s government and as a private partner the place where we operate

1485
02:42:53,440 --> 02:42:58,480
right now we've been successful before in conducting our whole operation all five phases of it

1486
02:42:59,440 --> 02:43:03,600
the u.s government has shown an interest they know we're capable they know what we've pulled out of

1487
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:09,280
the sky it's consistent with the egg and everything else i've told you about and what they're offering

1488
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:16,400
to do now is give us exclusive use access to facilities because they don't know what's going

1489
02:43:16,400 --> 02:43:22,800
on departments there there are departments within the broader branches of the three-letter agencies

1490
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:29,280
that aren't being read into what other sections are so they want us to help and because we're one

1491
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:35,520
of the few groups of people that have experience and we provide them a path to redemption so there's

1492
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:40,960
a real there's a real message here from you of incredible optimism about what this could represent

1493
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:44,480
yeah this is why i know disclosure is coming and guess what it's going to come out in the most

1494
02:43:44,480 --> 02:43:51,040
beautiful way i believe the united states government in the next 12 months is going to use me

1495
02:43:51,040 --> 02:44:00,400
and my team as a peaceful non-judgmental path forward to disclosure they're going to help us

1496
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:02,640
conduct our operations

1497
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:12,000
and gather evidence in order to present this subject matter to the public so that these

1498
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:16,640
questions can be answered once and for all and all the questions i'm talking about what do the

1499
02:44:16,640 --> 02:44:21,920
craft look like how do they operate who is operating them how are they being operated

1500
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:25,200
and where are they coming from we should be able to answer those questions

1501
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:32,240
probably entirely in the next 12 months can i put to you there is a dark state

1502
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:38,880
there are people who don't have good intentions who want this secret to remain suppressed aren't

1503
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:45,760
there it seems that way yeah are they going to win no they're not going to win they're not going

1504
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:51,760
to win there we've we've passed a tipping point there like i said when you're talking about these

1505
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:59,360
people they aren't organized you become a dark person by having by being filled with more vice

1506
02:44:59,360 --> 02:45:04,560
than virtue virtuous people win people full of vice they lose and they're dividing amongst

1507
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:09,280
themselves they're on a sinking ship all of the good people that are in these organizations

1508
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:13,920
realize they're in a position they need to make a decision as to which side they're on

1509
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:19,920
and despite having all this leverage and threat that they have that's being held against them

1510
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:27,840
they're making the decision to move forward are there people inside the program who you know

1511
02:45:27,840 --> 02:45:36,720
will come forward when you speak up yes um i know i'm going to serve as a huge catalyst and that's

1512
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:42,160
going to be an exciting day the things i'm talking about are going to be you know dave did a great

1513
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:47,920
job of paving a path i'm going to come along and try and improve upon that path and widen the road

1514
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:53,520
i expect the next uh people that are the next groups of folks are going to be coming down this

1515
02:45:53,520 --> 02:45:58,400
path are going to blow it wide open do you worry for your safety for your family's safety no i

1516
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:04,960
don't i don't i think i'm being protected believe it or not by the nhi and also i don't i don't put

1517
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:11,600
up with harassment i don't believe in the boogeyman i am the boogeyman you know how to help yourself

1518
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:16,800
yes yep so if somebody comes after you they'd better watch out it'd probably be the worst

1519
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:21,280
decision they ever made in their life i would intend to make it that way clearly

1520
02:46:23,280 --> 02:46:33,120
at the heart of all of this there's been an 80 year cover-up where we've all outside in the

1521
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:41,280
the normal world been told that this is nonsense aliens aren't real telepathy is nonsense

1522
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:49,200
how do you deal with that how do we reverse decades of stigma and taboo you inform yourself

1523
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:57,520
why are we relying on these people that have been keeping the secrets to let us in on the secret

1524
02:46:57,520 --> 02:47:04,080
why don't we make their secrets obsolete by capturing the evidence ourself and becoming

1525
02:47:04,160 --> 02:47:12,160
all firsthand experiencers of the phenomenon and the technology because that's possible

1526
02:47:12,160 --> 02:47:15,920
and from what you're saying jake barber that's a beautiful experience

1527
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:19,680
yeah it was the most beautiful experience i've had in my life

1528
02:47:20,800 --> 02:47:26,160
would you like to see your kids one day doing that work my kids already are believe it or not
