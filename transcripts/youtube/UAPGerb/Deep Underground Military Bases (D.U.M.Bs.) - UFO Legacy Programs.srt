1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
When discussing UFO legacy programs, I aim to expose any clandestine, black-budget U.S.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,760
government military intelligence operation, partnering with defense contractors, federally

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,800
funded research and development centers, and university-affiliated research centers engaging

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,440
with non-human technology. These programs seem to take many forms, including crash recovery of

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,000
non-human vehicles, material exploitation of technologies of unknown origin, reverse engineering

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,080
of anomalous craft, and construction of copycat vehicles famously known as alien reproduction

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,880
vehicles, ARVs. On this channel, we have discussed myriad major range and test facility bases and

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,840
defense laboratories and centers where such programs are likely located. We have also

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,320
discussed at length contractors, FFRDCs, and UARCs that are alleged to operate alongside the

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:02,080
CIA and NSA across Army, Navy, and Air Force UFO programs. When such clandestine and secretive

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,240
operations to master non-human technology have led to, in David Grush's words, a multi-decade

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,320
secret Cold War, where might these programs be located? The logistics of maintaining secrecy and

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,760
strict need-to-know access for unacknowledged special access programs focused on anomalous

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,440
research, development, test, and evaluation of non-human technologies and storage of non-human

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,800
craft and possibly biologics are likely tremendous. For this reason, we must look underground and

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,640
evaluate the decades of rumors and testimonies of UFOs and deep underground military bases or DUMs.

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
DUMs have served as a continuous focus of this channel with recent discussion

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,920
and direct investigation into Dugway Proving Ground. The United States premier chemical

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,240
and biological testing range and its alleged 1,300 square mile subterranean facility and

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,680
remote entrance in the desert. For this investigation, we will be continuously referencing

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,760
the work of Dr. Richard Sautter and his three masterpieces titled, Underground Bases and Tunnels,

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,240
What is the Government Trying to Hide, Hidden in Plain Sight Beyond the X-Files,

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,480
and Underground and Underwater Bases. These three dense pieces give us keen context into

24
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,760
subterranean bases in the form of stringent fact-based analysis through publicly available

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,960
records, FOIA documents, declassified documents, and the occasional witness testimony.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,600
Deep underground military bases do indeed exist. This is fact and we will explore this fact today,

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,160
but do these sites engage with UFO legacy programs? And if so, which DOD sites and

28
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,680
what do they do? And could the decades of rumors regarding underground tunnels connecting these

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,320
clandestine sites through an internal rail system possibly be true? Hey guys, it's UAP Gurb and thank

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,600
you so very much for joining me today as we embark into the world of the subterranean to investigate

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,840
Dumbs and UFOs. The subject of UFO legacy sites embedded into mountains with hidden hangars,

32
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,040
sequestered a mile beneath the earth's surface, or hidden anywhere out of the public and satellite

33
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,040
view has long been a talking point of this channel in my investigations. Today, we finally look below

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,600
the earth's surface to evaluate the existence, feasibility, and operations of UFO legacy programs

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,000
and deep underground military bases.

36
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,720
To borrow from the title of the first chapter of Dr. Richard Sauter's underground bases and tunnels,

37
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,480
deep underground military bases are indeed real. Throughout this project, I will be interchangeably

38
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,200
using the terms DUMB and subterranean facility or STIF, the name said to me by multiple veterans

39
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,360
who have traveled to such underground locations. And speaking of, I should mention, I have spoken

40
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,720
to nearly half a dozen former military personnel who have traveled to STIFs across the country.

41
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,160
I try to shy away from inserting first-hand source testimony and anecdotes into my videos and let

42
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,280
evidence and research speak for itself, so I will interject with these first-hand testimonies when

43
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,080
and if necessary. In a 1989 speech titled, Underground Facilities for Defense, Experience

44
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,520
and Lessons, Deputy Director of Engineering and Construction for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

45
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,440
Lloyd A. Dusha said, quote, After World War II, political and economic factors changed the

46
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,960
underground construction picture and caused a renewed interest to think underground. As a

47
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,840
result of this interest, the Corps of Engineers became involved in the design and construction

48
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,600
of some very complex and interesting military projects, end quote. In the same talk, Dusha

49
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,960
would then go on to exclaim, quote, Although the conference program indicates the topic to be

50
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,960
underground facilities for defense, experience and lessons, I must deviate a little because several

51
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,920
of the most interesting facilities that have been designed and constructed by the Corps are still

52
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,600
classified, end quote. Acknowledged military subterranean facilities do indeed exist.

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,640
Publicly known sites include the NORAD Cheyenne Mountain Complex buried deep under Colorado

54
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,840
Springs. This enormous installation, built to monitor North American missile threats,

55
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,600
sits 2,000 feet underground and spans 5.1 acres, featuring six three-story high and 40-foot wide

56
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,680
tunnels and 15 three-story buildings made of steel plates. And these are just the acknowledged

57
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,240
portions of the base. Additionally, the Raven Rock Complex, aka Site R, serves as a secure

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,080
underground command center or backup pentagon and is shrouded in mystery. This site under Fort

59
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Detrick, Maryland, includes accommodations for 3,000 people, has an in-built medical and dental

60
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,760
clinic, fire department, post office and five acknowledged three-story buildings. The secrets

61
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,920
Raven Rock must hold are endless. But existing acknowledged dumps are not the focus of today's

62
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,920
investigation. Instead, we plan to pursue dumps that operate as UFO legacy program locations and

63
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,920
explore the feasibility of decades of rumors of hundreds, if not thousands of miles of underground

64
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,640
tunnels and railroads connecting deep underground UFO legacy operations. To once again quote U.S.

65
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,920
Army Corps of Engineers Deputy Director for Engineering and Construction Lloyd A. Dusha

66
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,600
when speaking about the Corps' involvement in the 1960s construction of the Cheyenne site, quote,

67
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,640
As stated earlier, there are other projects of similar scope, which I cannot identify,

68
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,520
but which include multiple chambers up to 50 feet wide and 100 feet high,

69
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,360
using the same excavation procedure mentioned for the NORAD facility, end quote. After all,

70
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,120
according to a 1985 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report titled Literature Survey of Underground

71
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,800
Construction Methods for Application to Hardened Facilities, STIFs can be built anywhere with the

72
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,840
right amount of money and in myriad types of structures utilizing deep shaft structures and

73
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,240
facilities tunneled into mountainsides. The report even states, quote,

74
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,560
Since adequate technology is available to construct hardened underground facilities

75
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,840
under virtually any ground conditions, the main constraint in construction projects remains

76
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,200
economic viability rather than technical feasibility, end quote. As we know from David

77
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Grush and multiple other sources and testimonies, UFO legacy programs operate on the U.S. Black

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,680
Untraceable, deep-sixed money and contracts buried within special access, controlled access,

79
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,120
and unacknowledged special access programs. From the excellent work of Catherine Austin Fitz I

80
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,120
mention often, we also know that as much as $21 trillion in unauthorized spending has occurred

81
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,840
between 1998 and 2015, and this is just within the DOD and Department of Housing and Urban

82
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,520
Development, much of which Fitz believed was designated for clandestine military R&D.

83
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,800
Publicly denied UFO research development test and evaluation underground locations would

84
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,360
absolutely classify as such. Dums for clandestine and unacknowledged use is also a practice very

85
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,800
much currently in play. One such example is Warrington U.S. Army Training Center located

86
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,400
in the Northern Virginia town of Warrington. The book, The Secret Team, the CIA and its allies

87
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,880
in control of the world by Fletcher Prouty, identified a highly secretive underground

88
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,200
installation that serves as a federal relocation center by an unknown agency. This was confirmed

89
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,880
in an Inquiry Magazine article titled Going Underground by Robert Walters, which plainly

90
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,040
states the U.S. Army Warrington Training Center is a CIA covert facility. Additionally, there is the

91
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,960
highly secretive U.S. Navy underground facility in the mountains of West Virginia near Sugar Grove.

92
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,480
This location is an underground site run by the Navy for the National Security Agency,

93
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,640
so the NSA and CIA already have a traceable interest in using U.S. military bases underground

94
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,080
facilities as a cover for unknown usage and operations. So before discussing much of the

95
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,600
testimony of UFOs and Dums, let's quickly touch on the reality and history of these impressive,

96
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,280
often unacknowledged sites.

97
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,960
The inception of Dums in the United States can actually be traced back to the Nazis,

98
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,440
an Operation Paperclip, the famous program to recruit Nazi scientists,

99
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,560
engineers and technicians into U.S. government employment. Near the end of World War II,

100
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,320
the Nazis had begun utilization of what we might call Dums. In the book Lucky Forward,

101
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,600
The History of Patton's Third Army, Colonel Robert S. Allen detailed allied discoveries of

102
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
Nazi underground bases.

103
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,520
Some Nazi installations were over 50 feet underground, comprised of several miles of

104
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,120
two- to three-story facilities. The sites were arranged like wheels with spokes designed with

105
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,280
reinforced concrete. The Nazis designed such locations as Ordov to house Nazi high command

106
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,560
after the bombing of Berlin but never got the chance to populate the facility. We additionally

107
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,960
have the Regenwurm Lager or Earthworm Camp in Poland. This Nazi sprawling underground complex

108
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,640
beneath West Poland's full extent is still unknown today. The site featured miles of

109
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,680
underground tunnels and electrical train lines connecting bunkers, fortifications and other

110
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,840
critical military facilities. This sounds familiar, no? Two declassified documents can be discovered

111
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,240
dating back to 1947 regarding the aforementioned Operation Paperclip. Featured in the documents are

112
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,880
requests by Air Material Command for a quote-unquote requirement of four German technicians to consult

113
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,040
on a planned underground plant program. One man named was Xavier Dorsch, director of the

114
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,200
TOT organization in the closing of World War II. This was the Nazis' equivalent of the U.S. Navy

115
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,880
Seabees or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers but not part of formal German military structure.

116
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,880
The founder of this organization, Fritz TOT, designed the famous German Autobahn Highway system.

117
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,760
Towards the tail end of World War II, Dorsch had helped with developing a series of massive

118
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,520
underground industrial manufacturing facilities to hide from allied bombing raids. It is indeed

119
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,920
quite possible he also aided on the Regenwurm Lager and Ordov. Documents and research show Dorsch

120
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,400
once briefed the Americans after he was captured in 1945 and again in 1949. We do not know the

121
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,000
full extent to which he aided in these programs. These massive Nazi underground industrial

122
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,920
manufacturing facilities possibly give us our first look into UFO legacy programs and dumbs.

123
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,320
I have covered on this channel the 1933 Magenta Italy UFO crash retrieval, a case whose validity

124
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:24,640
is strongly supported by David Grush. You say it's a 90-year cover-up. Just about, yeah. 90 years.

125
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:33,120
1933 was the first recovery in Europe in Magenta Italy. They recovered a partially intact vehicle.

126
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,720
In this case, the Nazis purportedly took control of a crashed lenticular disk from the Italians

127
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,600
in 1943 before being recovered by the Americans post-war. Hans Komler was a Nazi engineer behind

128
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,960
construction of numerous concentration camps including Auschwitz and led myriad Nazi secret

129
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,960
weapons projects. Komler would have indeed been one of chief scientists and engineers to study

130
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,880
a recovered lenticular craft due to his unrivaled command over Nazi secret weapons programs.

131
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,320
Komler went missing near the tail end of World War II. However, documents prove rather convincingly

132
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,320
this evil engineer was taken alive into U.S. custody. Albert Speer, Nazi and Reich minister

133
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,840
of armaments and war production, claimed in April 1945, Komler informed him he had business

134
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,240
to offer the Americans. OSS agent Donald W. Richardson seemingly confirmed this by stating

135
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,080
70 years after, he still couldn't fully speak on interrogating Komler. But the Nazis had brought

136
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,800
treasure to the U.S. that, quote, served the development of armament platforms for the Cold

137
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,400
War and for the future, end quote. Under Komler's command, numerous underground tunnels and bases

138
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,600
existed employing German companies to develop and build parts for advanced aircraft and secret

139
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,720
weapons programs. Komler is even said to have stashed treasures and documents regarding his

140
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,480
think tank's top secret documents in a facility underground in the woods of Czechoslovakia.

141
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,480
According to Hidden Nazi by Dan Ruder, 44 years after Operation Hidden Documents to retrieve these

142
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,000
stashed top secret documents, an American team from Lawrence Livermore Labs and Los Alamos Labs,

143
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,480
two FFRDCs, went to a new underground cavern that had not been emptied at the end of World War II

144
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,600
called Mednic Hill. What was found here was, quote, the key to what was hidden at the previous site,

145
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,280
end quote. It goes without saying it stands to reason Komler conducted early iterations of UFO

146
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,120
legacy programs underneath Mednic Hill, as well as his numerous underground locations and tunnels,

147
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,960
and that Xavier Dorsch was a key engineer in constructing these facilities. With Dorsch being

148
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,000
requested by Air Material Command and Komler being more than likely secretly smuggled by the

149
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,280
Americans, these two men could very well be the key architects of modern-day U.S.,

150
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,280
UFO, and dumb legacy programs. I am no expert in history, so to learn more about Komler,

151
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,960
I strongly recommend watching the documentary The Two Lives of Hans Komler. Later in this project,

152
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,920
we will see even more ties between Nazi Germany, Dums, and Paperclip, then in the form of Maglev

153
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:18,960
train systems. On numerous occasions in the 1950s, the United States proposed massive

154
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,720
underground facilities that seemingly disappeared from public light. It is unknown if many of these

155
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,600
facilities were built or not. One example can be traced to 1957 to Green Mountain outside Huntsville,

156
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,760
Alabama. Huntsville is deeply enshrouded in U.S. antigravity research, but we are looking elsewhere.

157
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,280
Two articles in 1957 reported the U.S. Army was planning to build a rocket factory

158
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,240
inside of Green Mountain. The plan was proposed by the American Machine and Foundry Company,

159
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,000
Redstone Arsenal, and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. This location was slated to have a sort

160
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,040
of subterranean junior pentagon where elaborate headquarters would be installed to direct the

161
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,800
defense of the southern U.S. from enemy attack. Again, it is unknown if this location was ever

162
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,160
built. However, such discussion of a junior pentagon illustrated early private military

163
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,840
cooperation, a theme we will touch on much more, much later. Analysis of U.S. military

164
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,720
and underground studies additionally allows us valuable insights into Dums. Take the Rand

165
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,200
Corporation, for example. An FFRDC I have spoken about ad nauseam is a primary semi-government

166
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,360
institution up to its eyeballs in UFO legacy programs. Rand Corporation was established in

167
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,400
1948 and grew out of Army Air Force Project Rand in 1946. Project Rand sought to carry out

168
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,400
long-range research projects of interest to the Air Force. In the 1950s, Yousaf and Rand began

169
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,760
working on the question of underground-based construction and organized various symposiums.

170
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:58,160
Let's analyze a resulting 1959 publication, Deep Underground Construction. The purpose of such a

171
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,480
symposium, according to the chairman, was to discuss, quote, the problems of protecting

172
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,480
military installations located deep underground or under mountains, end quote, in the event of nuclear

173
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,440
war. The chairman also stated since 1957 the Rand Corp had been, quote, actively investigating the

174
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,360
need for a small number of super hard deep underground centers, end quote. Additionally,

175
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,520
in 1960, Rand published a study under Yousaf's contract dealing 12 locations for underground

176
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,160
sites. All sites were assumed to be more than 1,000 feet deep. Of specific interest here is

177
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,040
Site 3 in Santa Barbara, California. Santa Barbara is located just over 100 miles from the Antelope

178
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,880
Valley, California, we will discuss later. Research suggests a major network of UFO-focused

179
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,080
stiff facilities exists interconnected under the Antelope. Site 3 is also located less than 100

180
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,360
miles away from Los Angeles, where a tremendous amount of DoD research development test and

181
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,800
evaluation laboratories lie. We have already mentioned the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer giving

182
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:11,680
in 1989 a quite frank admission of classified underground facilities. And outside of the 1987

183
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,600
U.S. Army Corps of Engineer report detailing construction of dumps boils down to cost. In 1959

184
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,840
to 1961, the Army Corps of Engineer published a five-part training manual titled Design of

185
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,000
Underground Installations in Rock. This startling series assumes the pre-existence of underground

186
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,560
facilities. The report states, quote, vital government installations have been placed

187
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,400
underground as exemplified by the Ritchie Project, end quote. Many of these facilities were designed

188
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,200
as command and control centers and survival bunkers for nuclear attacks. These are known

189
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,960
as continuity of government sites. Raven Rock qualifies as one such continuity of government

190
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,880
or COG dump. Design of underground installations in Rock additionally make some statements of

191
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,360
extreme relevance to the testimonies of dumps and UFOs. Some installations listed by the Army were

192
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,000
to be shallow, while quote, more important equipment and facilities essential to defense

193
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,920
may be installed in deeper workings that are likely to be long and tunnel-like, occupying one

194
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:20,720
or several stories, end quote. The report detailed enormous underground facilities featuring 50 by 50

195
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,800
feet tunnels and chambers as much as 100 feet high, even stating, quote, truck or rail traffic

196
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,320
might be important, end quote. The Army even cautioned, quote, landscape scars, roads,

197
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,760
and portal structures, aka entrances, should be as inconspicuous as possible.

198
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,960
Camouflage should be considered, end quote. This is of extreme consequence when discussing

199
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,640
testimonies such as MS, who detailed the entrance to the Dugway Stiff as a small building in the

200
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,680
middle of nowhere. In 1963, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a manual titled Utilization

201
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,360
of Nuclear Power Plants in Underground Installations. This manual discussed self-contained

202
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,160
nuclear-powered underground facilities with button-up diesel secondary systems.

203
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,600
Critically, in 1964, the Army Corps of Engineers or COE proposed 12 massive structures to be built

204
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,800
up to 4,000 feet underground. There are two sites here of massive importance to our investigation,

205
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:27,040
one facility below Yuma County, Arizona, to be accessed via a vertical or inclined shaft.

206
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,720
Such entry points are common amongst claims of UFO dumps such as the Dugway Dump whose entrance

207
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,560
is purported to be a vertical elevator shaft. In Stephen Greer's DPI Archive, who fans of this

208
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,360
channel will know I have extracted a tremendous amount of information and worthwhile investigation

209
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,080
from, witness 10773's statement reads, quote, nose of massive research and storage facility,

210
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,320
material of unknown origin at Yuma Proving Ground, end quote. Fascinating connection here.

211
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,160
Yuma Test Center is also home to Yuma Proving Ground, a U.S. Army major range and test facility

212
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,080
base. Similar to Dugway Proving Ground's Army MRTFB, the West Desert Test Center, Yuma Proving

213
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,240
Ground is also run by Army Test and Evaluation Command. Indeed, it is no stretch to assume if

214
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,240
a STIF exists under one of these Army MRTFBs, an equally impressive facility likely exists below

215
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:27,120
the other. Second here is Site 3 in Inyo County, California to be accessed via inclined shaft.

216
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,040
Inyo County resides on the inside boundary of China Lake Naval Weapons Testing Facility.

217
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,560
China Lake is one of the Navy's premier major range and test facility base and a location spoken

218
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:45,040
of on myriad occasions as an underground legacy program location. China Lake really needs no

219
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,160
introduction, but stay tuned as we will discuss China Lake in much more detail along with

220
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,440
Antelope Valley. But quickly to mention, Dr. Richard Sodder received testimony from a Navy

221
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,280
contact who served at China Lake. The witness confirmed an impressively large and deep installation,

222
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,040
claiming the facility extends one mile deep and contains, quote, weapons more powerful than

223
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:13,840
nuclear weapons, end quote. Alongside the U.S. Army COE, the U.S. Navy is also deeply entwined

224
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,200
with underground and possibly undersea bases, but that's another story for another day.

225
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,680
In 1972, Naval Facilities Engineering Command issued a report titled Subsurface Deployment of

226
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,880
Naval Facilities, discussing several Navy installations to be placed underground. These

227
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,080
include administration, medical, aircraft maintenance, ammo storage, and miscellaneous

228
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,240
storage facilities. The U.S. Navy CBs additionally maintain underground installations between the

229
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,920
Presidential Camp David and CIA Facility Camp Peary, which we will discuss later on.

230
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,840
In 1947, U.S. Air Materiel Command requested Nazi technicians for construction of underground

231
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,240
facilities. In 1989, Loi Dusha admitted numerous underground installations existed and were

232
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,840
classified. This means Stiffs of Interest were built from 1947 to 1949, a 42-year period. We

233
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,920
can also assume some facilities were built before 1961 where the five-part Army COE document

234
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,480
assumes the existence of such facilities. One such example here may be Groom Lake Area 51 that was

235
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,280
built in the 50s on the site of a former Boron mine. After all, a 1991 DARPA report details

236
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:33,280
secret cavities may be found in conjunction with underground mines. However, due to the existence

237
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,440
of literature on described future plans for massive bases post-1961 that really hold our

238
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,320
interest, we can assume from 1961 to 1989, the majority of our Stiffs of Interest were constructed.

239
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,680
Dums are not a new subject to the study of UFOs or my channel. I myself have talked a tremendous

240
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,440
amount of the alleged DARS, Defense Advanced Research Center, a 10-story underground location

241
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,280
built under Area 51 relayed by USAAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet that dealt with alien

242
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:16,400
reproduction vehicles, including the TR-3B. I have also spoken on the enigmatic Northrop-Tahan,

243
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,640
Lockheed-Hellandale, and McDonnell-Douglas RCS facilities that have since at least 1987

244
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,400
been accused by excellent researchers such as Bill Hamilton as housing UFO legacy programs,

245
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,880
and don't worry, we will touch on these facilities in much more detail later.

246
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,440
Quite recently, I've discussed the Dugway Dumb as relayed by witness MS and even provided images

247
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,280
and details of the exact alleged entrance to the facility, which exists as an elevator shaft

248
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:51,280
concealed by a tiny building in the middle of nowhere Dugway near German Village. As strange

249
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,960
as that might seem, a 1991 paper issued by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project

250
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,160
Agency, and US Army Missile Command titled Development of Inspection and Detection Techniques

251
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:08,240
for Hidden Cavities. This document served to train field nuclear weapons inspectors to identify

252
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,240
underground clandestine test complexes in developing nuclear nations. The report plainly

253
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,760
states buildings of various size can provide cover for shafts or other openings to a secret

254
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,920
underground cavity. Sounds similar to MS, no? And lastly, I've relayed the testimony of Randy

255
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,200
Anderson in the underground facility under the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane housing the

256
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,040
alleged Off-World Technologies Division. The subject of underground UFO legacy programs

257
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,600
rose to prominence in 1989 with the claims of Bob Lazar and Reverse Engineering under Site 4,

258
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,400
as well as the Dulcey Base fiasco where starting in 1979, Paul Benowitz was fed disinformation of

259
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,640
a joint human extraterrestrial base under Dulcey, New Mexico. Both S4 and Dulcey are worthy of

260
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,960
further investigation. In fact, I believe S4 to be a very real location, but due to the controversy

261
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,080
around these accounts, discussions of these sites will be largely omitted from today's discussions.

262
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,320
The first true mention of Dums and UFOs I can find is from Look Magazine in an article titled

263
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:21,760
Is This the Real Flying Saucer? dated 1955. The article discussed a Canadian company constructing

264
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,720
a flying saucer while also depicting a facility built underneath a hill with a vertical shaft

265
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,960
to the surface allowing the departure of flying saucers. Further rumors of UFOs and Dums wouldn't

266
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,520
really arise until the 1970s, so this article is indeed intriguing. Leonard Stringfield's UFO

267
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,080
crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7 is a body of work I often praise extensively. After all,

268
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,160
Stringfield is in my opinion one of the greatest UFO investigators of all time. His work on UFO

269
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,560
retrieval incidents and operations spanned from 1978 to 1994 and relay some of the earliest

270
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:04,080
mentions I can find of deep underground legacy operations. Let's briefly explore a few.

271
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,960
One such intriguing report is an anonymous letter Stringfield received 12 February 1974.

272
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,320
The letter highlighted secret research on UFOs taking place at a secret underground complex

273
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,400
below Grey Army Airfield in Fort Hood, Texas. According to the witness, the complex is shared

274
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,000
with ICBM silos built into a small mountain. This is fascinating as later in the project,

275
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,440
we will discuss how numerous Dums were constructed primarily as ICBM sites.

276
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,240
The witness described a section of the mountain would open up onto a jet interceptor runway,

277
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,800
which was once accidentally observed by a private pilot making a forced landing over

278
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,000
this restricted air corridor. This underground facility, according to the witness, was tied with

279
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,360
NORAD in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, Tinker Air

280
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,520
Force Base, Oklahoma, Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, and others. And this is where the anonymous

281
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,800
account gets very interesting. The witness stated the complex employed a squadron of unmarked

282
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,400
helicopters dispatched, quote, when the need arises, end quote, codenamed the Blue Boys.

283
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,600
This sounds incredibly similar to UFO recovery rapid reaction units I have spoken about in

284
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,840
numerous crash retrieval cases, such as the Blue Berets in the 1965 Kexburg, Pennsylvania case.

285
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,480
The choppers additionally carried a new type of missile the source had been informed had been

286
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,320
used on UFOs, but a new system had been in development, which would be far more efficient.

287
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,160
This was an electronic warfare system designed to disable UFOs under quote unquote controlled

288
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:44,240
conditions. This letter would arrive to Stringfield's desk in 1974, but now in 2025,

289
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,120
we have heard the whistleblower testimony of Jake Barber, where he discussed EMP type weapons

290
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:56,320
designed to bring down UFOs over the enigmatic range. In your time in deployment, you met

291
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,960
certain people from an aerospace company, didn't you? Yes, I did. Now it's also part of the

292
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,280
constraints you operate under that you can't name that aerospace company. Correct. There's no good

293
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,920
reason to name them even if I wasn't constrained. What were they doing there? Well, they were

294
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,280
supporting us with some new weapons technology that could be used to

295
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,160
disable vehicles and aircraft. I can disclose this. My understanding is that they were essentially

296
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,680
using it was actually I think it's a meta republic record that microwave weapons,

297
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,600
pulse microwave weapons were being used at that time. Correct. There were some early prototypes

298
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,560
that were being used at that time. And I met individuals that were there representing the

299
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,360
companies that were providing that service to the government, made some friends, and those

300
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,120
relationships led to opportunities later in the California desert, where I began my journey.

301
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,240
Leonard would actually see a volume of reports regarding underground complexes at Fort Hood,

302
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,840
including a USAAF Lieutenant Colonel who relayed to him in 1975 of an underground project that

303
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,080
took place at Fort Hood. In 1976, Stringfield met an individual from McGregor, Texas who claimed

304
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,760
his father had worked beneath Fort Hood on the UFO program. This secondhand witness relayed a

305
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,640
quote from his father stating quote, the technology that is being applied in this underground complex

306
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,360
would remind someone of a science fiction thriller. It is unbelievable what they know

307
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,360
and what they can do from this area. Spanning the late 70s into the 80s, Stringfield received

308
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,960
myriad reports of an underground facility beneath Wright-Patterson Air Force Base housing preserved

309
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,440
non-human biologics. One such account was relayed from witness J.K. who worked at a Nike missile

310
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:47,040
site in Wilmington, Ohio. J.K. claimed to have seen nine alien bodies under Wright-Patt in 1966

311
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,600
encased in glass frozen to preserve. J.K. also claimed recovered craft were housed at McDill

312
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,640
Air Force Base, Langley Air Force Base, and Seymour Johnson Navy Training Center outside of

313
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,120
Norfolk, Virginia. These locations purportedly all housed craft and sometimes biologics in

314
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,400
underground hangars to conceal material from military and politicians. Stringfield heard

315
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,440
similar accounts of biologics under Wright-Patt relayed secondhand from one T.S. who allegedly

316
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,840
witnessed bodies in the early 1950s. T.S. were amongst a handful that relayed such stories.

317
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,360
Leonard Stringfield would also once receive an anonymous, undated letter from a U.S. airman who

318
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,480
was stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The source relayed rumors and stories of

319
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,040
UFOs being stored in the Manzano storage area in remote Kirtland. Remember if you will, Kirtland

320
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,360
is home to Sandia National Labs FFRDC, which ranging from the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit

321
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,280
report to accusations of reverse engineering a propulsion device for the TR-3B by Edgar Fouchet

322
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:58,080
has stood as a high probability candidate in UFO RDT&E programs. Manzano Mountain Underground

323
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,240
Facility is no myth either. While researching for his 2001 book Underwater and Underground Bases,

324
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,480
Soder received FOIA documents of two underground facilities below Manzano. While these documents

325
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,680
of course say nothing about UFO storage, it is fascinating to see Soder confirm the rumors of

326
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,960
an underground installation beneath Kirtland. Lastly, I want to reference an anonymous letter

327
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,880
to Leonard Stringfield I have covered before. This is dated March 14, 1975, which claims to

328
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,240
recount the testimony of one Lieutenant Colonel Simms, a pseudonym. I previously discussed this

329
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,720
letter in reference to the project on ED, an Edwards Air Force Base 412th Test Group Electronic

330
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,480
Warfare Test Director who claimed to the existence of a joint UFO reverse engineering program

331
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,000
operating between Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada Test and Training Range. Viewers of this

332
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,840
channel will know I consider ED to be one of the most critical UFO legacy witnesses of all time,

333
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,600
and as a quick side note, ED also referenced attending the S4 site. This letter was referenced

334
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,640
due to the mention of Hanscom Air Force Base in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,

335
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,200
an air base and university where ED worked from 2002 to 2005 on foreign military assets.

336
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,920
Amongst the intriguing mentions of contractors, FFRDCs, UARCs, and air bases involved in UFO

337
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,640
research and investigation, the source relayed Lieutenant Colonel Simms speaking of several

338
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,120
computer banks hidden within underground installations scattered across the U.S.,

339
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,800
housing sophisticated computer equipment, electronic instrumentation, and mobile radar units.

340
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,240
According to Simms, these underground installations employ, quote,

341
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,120
squadrons of unmarked helicopters which have sophisticated instrumentation on board that are

342
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,120
dispatched to areas of UFO activity to monitor these craft or airlift them out of the area if

343
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,480
one has malfunctioned, end quote. This sounds quite similar to the Blue Boys rapid reaction

344
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,120
unit relayed to Stringfield, does it not? But perhaps we have other confirming evidence,

345
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,400
so let's also reference the book Trinity's Children Living Along America's Nuclear Highways.

346
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,800
The authors of this book state, quote,

347
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,680
There are more Cray supercomputers in New Mexico, an Air Force computer expert once said,

348
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,560
than anywhere else. They're here at the weapon center, referring to Kirtland. They're across

349
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,880
the street at Sandia. They're at Los Alamos up the highway, and they're at the, quote,

350
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,840
underground places nobody knows about. Intriguing, as we already know Kirtland

351
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:32,320
and by extension Sandia employ at least two underground facilities in the Manzano Mountains.

352
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,680
Los Alamos National Labs additionally employs a deep underground installation.

353
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,640
Dr. Soder had quite an interesting engagement with Los Alamos. He repeatedly attempted to

354
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,360
FOIA the Department of Energy for information on underground facilities and tunnels beneath

355
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:53,280
Los Alamos. The DOE continuously responded there were none. Eventually though, the DOE

356
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,440
provided Soder a badly blurred phototastic copy of an article by Earl Zimmerman titled,

357
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,560
LASL's unusual underground lab, which described an underground facility built in the late 1940s.

358
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,400
This article was undated and of uncertain origin, however Zimmerman can be found labeled as a press

359
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:20,800
bureau member from 1963 to 1965 in a 2020 Los Alamos organizational chart. Dr. Soder additionally

360
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,000
met with a businessman who relayed his experience in visiting Los Alamos in the company of a highly

361
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,800
cleared associate. The businessman was privy to wherever his esteemed colleague went without

362
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,120
question. The individual claimed 75 percent of Los Alamos' facilities are underground and extend as

363
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,600
far as one mile underground.

364
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,720
In relation to TUOs and UFOs, so far we have covered very real stiffs under Kirtland slash

365
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,000
Sandia in Los Alamos while also discussing the possible existence of facilities

366
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,360
existing under Wright-Patterson, Fort Hood slash Grey Army Airfield, Yuma County,

367
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,400
China Lake, as well as the Nevada Test Site under the Nevada Test and Training Range.

368
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,960
Now onto one of the most critical areas of my research, the Antelope Valley, California.

369
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,240
For this section, we will reference the work of both Dr. Soder as well as the late Bill Hamilton,

370
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,560
a tremendous UFO researcher. Hamilton served as a true pioneer of the field, serving as the first

371
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,120
researcher to ever produce the term and a public image of ARV and even handed incredible witnesses

372
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,560
such as Mark McCandlish and Bill Uhouse to Stephen Greer. Hamilton's excellent book,

373
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,320
Cosmic Top Secret, an ultra-rare early 1990s lecture recorded for VHS titled

374
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:49,040
UFOs and Underground Bases, offers us keen insights into Hamilton's research on dumbs and specific

375
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:55,120
area of interest, the Antelope Valley. In fact, Hamilton produced a map relayed to him by sources

376
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,800
of connected underground UFO facilities in the American Southwest. We will compare this map to

377
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:08,080
existing DoD laboratories and RDT&E locations later on in this video. China Lake Naval Air Station

378
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:14,160
is also quite close to Antelope Valley, so we will discuss that enigmatic facility here as well.

379
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,080
Since the late 1980s, Hamilton's work focused on Antelope Valley, California. Many will know

380
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:25,520
this region as one of the chief centers of aerospace technology, housing the infamous

381
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,000
USAF Plant 42, Lockheed Skunk Works, the former Norton Air Force Base, the legendary Edwards Air

382
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,120
Force Base, major installations for Northrop Grumman, Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas,

383
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:43,120
as well as numerous intriguing radar cross-section facilities in the form of Northrop Tehan, Lockheed

384
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:49,040
Hellendale, and McDonnell Douglas. I have spoken on all of the aforementioned facilities in prior

385
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,360
work. Palmdale, California within the Antelope has served as an unrivaled US military-slash-private

386
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,400
contractor classified aircraft production and maintenance location. The region has produced

387
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,800
many of the United States' most famous advanced aerospace platforms such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk,

388
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:14,400
B-2 Spirit Bomber, B-21 Raider, F-117 Nighthawk, and F-35 Lightning. The Antelope Valley in the

389
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,160
city of Palmdale have also served as a critical pillar of my research. Whether this be Norton

390
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,040
Air Force Base serving as the location where primary witness Brad S observed the Fluxliner

391
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,880
alien reproduction vehicle, witness Ed disclosing his work for the 412th test group serving as test

392
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,400
director for reverse engineered vehicles out of Edwards, Edgar Fouchet who stated pilots of the

393
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,040
TR-3B reverse engineered Triangle ARV were plucked from the Edwards 412th test pilot school, or the

394
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,040
alleged Project Red Light out of Edwards which served to act alongside Area 51 to test reverse

395
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,960
engineered vehicles, very similar to the claims of Ed. Antelope Valley is the most consequential

396
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,320
location that has ever come up in all of my research. The late Hamilton was obsessed with

397
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,920
the radar cross-section facilities mentioned above, specifically the Northrop Tejon installation,

398
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,280
sometimes referred to as the Tehachapi facility or Ant Hill, due to the rumors of incredible

399
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,440
amounts of underground tunnels beneath the installation. In my video on Northrop,

400
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,960
I investigated this RCS facility in great detail. Thanks to the research of Dr. Sautter,

401
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,960
we know the Northrop Tejon RCS does indeed have an underground facility, just as does

402
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,080
Hellendale and McDonnell Douglas. The question is how big, how deep, and what do they do?

403
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,440
Some rumors persist of up to 42 levels with underground tunnels connecting the facility

404
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,880
to Edwards and other installations. The concept of a corporate dump should come as no surprise

405
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,280
to anyone. In 1981, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, yes, AT&T, revealed several

406
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,200
underground emergency centers. Believe it or not, AT&T itself has been historically implicated in

407
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,480
non-human technology transfer, but that is not our topic for today. These underground centers

408
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,400
exist 40 feet below ground and feature three story centers with data banks, dorms, and kitchens.

409
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,040
One such location is reported to exist in Catrone County, 180 miles near Sandia National Labs.

410
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:19,920
This is not surprising, seen from 1949 to 1993, AT&T and its subsidiary, Western Electric,

411
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,800
ran Sandia National Labs at Kirtland at the order of President Harry S. Truman for the

412
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,080
Department of Energy. Indeed, as recently as 1970, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey

413
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,320
operated an emergency center 300 feet underground near Hudson, New York. This location that more

414
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,680
recently held corporate reports featured dining halls and 50 sleeping rooms for key company

415
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,520
officials. But back to Tehan and quickly, for those who don't know, what exactly is a radar

416
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,640
cross-section facility? To summarize, these facilities utilize high-frequency radio waves

417
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,840
to test aircraft's radar signatures. This military testing aids in the development of stealth

418
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,600
technologies by reducing radar cross-section. The site features large runways and pylons raised

419
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,520
from underground on concrete diamonds as mounting pads to blast aircraft and materials with radar.

420
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,320
Many RCS facilities, including the Three in Antelope Valley, saw construction during the

421
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:20,080
Cold War. This led the majority of the installation being built underground to hide RCS pylons,

422
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,680
equipment, models, and technology away from Soviet spy satellites. Numerous researchers

423
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,200
over the years have accused the Northrop Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas RCS sites as integral legacy

424
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,400
program locations focused on the downing, retrieval, and storage of non-human craft.

425
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,040
The contentious Dr. Stephen Greer even claimed to have both knowledge of the entrance for the

426
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,240
Ant Hill Dome, as well as personally been flown over these sites and observed the electromagnetic

427
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,360
pulse weapon systems that are used to down craft. Now interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and

428
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,800
Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this. The top people

429
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,280
in the special forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it.

430
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,360
I had known about it since the 90s, but I'd never of course flown directly over it because it's

431
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:17,840
classified airspace and very sensitive. So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.

432
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,520
It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55

433
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,760
come out. They go up and they hover. They're silent. They're electro-gravitic, anti-grav.

434
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,320
The diamond on the left, you see that looks like a runway with a diamond. It's not a runway because

435
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,720
they don't need to run and get there's non-aerodynamic. They just go boom up, but they're

436
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,560
placed over different diamonds. I have a whole series of video and pictures of these I won't

437
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,800
have time to go through, and that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an

438
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:58,960
electromagnetic weapon to see if it's hardened enough to withstand conflict, right?

439
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:05,040
When discussing the RCS facilities, and in particular, Hamilton's obsession with Tejon,

440
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,760
some may remember the XF-131 Super Sentinel. This incredible triangular ARV was drawn by

441
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,480
forensic artist Bill MacDonald and later featured in Season 1 of The X-Files. According to MacDonald,

442
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,280
the craft design was relayed to him from two Northrop Tejon and two Lockheed-Hellandale

443
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,640
engineers who were jaded from the intense secrecy from which they operated. I personally have spoken

444
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,080
to MacDonald on numerous occasions regarding this triangular ARV out of the Antelope Valley and put

445
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,600
much credence into this testimony. For years, Hamilton compiled first-hand witness testimony

446
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,040
regarding Antelope Valley and specifically the Northrop Tehachapi site. Let's briefly investigate

447
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,120
a few of these testimonies. A local man with property on 170th Street west of Tejon reported

448
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:56,960
to Hamilton of the ground opening like a missile silo where a flying saucer took off. Edward's Air

449
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,800
Force Office of Special Investigation silenced this witness. UFO researcher Dr. Richard Boylan,

450
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,120
alongside the first-hand source of Bill MacDonald, have additionally accused Tejon

451
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:12,800
as a manufacturing site for reverse-engineered vehicles including the XF-131 Super Sentinel,

452
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,920
an anti-gravity disc dubbed by Boylan the Great Pumpkin. A contractor named Chuck

453
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,720
relayed his experience digging the underground tunnels beneath the anthill to Hamilton.

454
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,240
This source claimed tunnels in the dump had round doorways with few doors and red and green lights

455
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,840
for ID and entry. An intriguing source of Hamilton claimed to have worked on project Star Talk at

456
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:39,280
Tejon. This project involved lasers in a big building underground for the purpose of constructing

457
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,880
systems to quote-unquote bring in UFOs. The source mentioned scalar technology,

458
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,640
a concept Stephen Greer would later on discuss for decades as a weapon source to down UFOs.

459
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,200
The Star Talk informer also claimed to work at McDonald Douglas Stiff where he observed a

460
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:01,680
UFO held in an underground hangar. This name was very hard to make out by a 144p documentary,

461
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,160
but one Hamilton informer went by the name Goburn who claimed to work at Tejon,

462
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,520
Hellendale and the Nevada Test and Training Range. This source relayed to Hamilton he

463
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,320
worked with alien technology that deeply frightened him. According to the source,

464
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,680
on-site personnel would rotate every 14 to 16 days living and working on-site,

465
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,640
and there existed a command center under Haystack Butte which connected to the anthill.

466
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,600
Hamilton had numerous other informers who would discuss experimental discs being flown out of

467
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,880
Edwards Airfield, extraterrestrial discs being held under Edwards, and underground UFO work

468
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,160
below a hangar on Edwards North Base. Many of these informants would discuss ground vehicles

469
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,360
like electric cars within the dumps and maglev train systems connecting the base to others.

470
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,960
We will of course discuss this much later on. From his data and sources, Hamilton learned of a

471
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:59,280
supposed massive complex of underground facilities in the Antelope Valley engaged with UFO testing,

472
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,120
storage and material exploitation, all connected via tunnels and transport systems. These

473
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,560
facilities included Tehachapi, McDonnell Douglas, Hellendale, George Air Force Base, Edwards,

474
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,160
the NASA rocket test site and China Lake. A network of joint USG and corporate facilities

475
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,360
all connected in the Antelope Valley dedicated to the storage and exploitation of UFOs has proven

476
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:27,680
to be quite a common theory since the late 80s and early 1990s work of Hamilton. I'd once again like

477
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,280
to reference Stephen Greer witness A.H. I have discussed in multiple projects A.H., a Boeing

478
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,960
insider with numerous connections to UFO legacy programs, has historically and likely to this day

479
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,800
served as a primary source of information for Greer. In his 2000 tape testimony, A.H. delivered

480
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,520
to Greer much of the information Greer still discusses to this day, including reference to

481
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,440
a massive facility existing below Dugway. A.H. additionally discussed a complex of underground

482
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,960
facilities near Anzo, California, just south of Antelope Valley, while also addressing a critical

483
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:07,120
Northrop underground facility named, of course, Tejon. Did he share with you any other information

484
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:14,640
on other facilities that dealt with this issue in the US or abroad? Yes, he mentioned there's a base

485
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:22,400
here in California near Anzo, California, and there's another base in the deserts of, I believe

486
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:37,520
he said Tejon, I believe that's the word that he used. There's a base near Lancaster and Palmdale

487
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:44,560
area and near, this is very funny, it's near Northrop. There's an underground area out there

488
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:52,800
too that he was aware of, but he particularly mentioned and stayed focused on Anzo, California.

489
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:00,080
There's some underground areas up there too that they're researching some of this technology and

490
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,200
at March Air Force Base through Project Red Light. Of this network of proposed facilities,

491
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,960
one possible dumb stands out from the rest, Edwards Air Force Base. As mentioned in nearly

492
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:19,120
every project, Edwards serves as home to the 412th Test Group, a major range and test facility base.

493
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:24,480
Witness Ed, a vetted and accomplished USAAF veteran, claimed Edwards and the Nevada Test

494
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,680
and Training Range, specifically Nellis Air Force Base in Area 51 slash Groom Lake,

495
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,360
which is actually run by an Edwards 412th Detachment, runs a joint UFO reverse engineering

496
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,400
program. Outside of the claims of Hamilton's informants regarding Edwards and craft stored

497
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,120
in underground installations, there are many fascinating testimonies and avenues of research

498
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,440
we might pursue. Remember how one source of Hamilton claimed to have worked on the

499
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,400
Ant Hill installation under Tejon in Antelope Valley? The source claimed the installation's

500
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,160
command center existed under Edwards Haystack Butte. This sentiment is shared by the controversial

501
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,280
and enigmatic whistleblower Dr. Michael Wolfe, who claimed as a UAP consultant to the National

502
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,560
Security Council he heard live extraterrestrials were kept under Haystack Butte Edwards.

503
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:16,320
Test facilities are built into and on Haystack Butte, east of Edwards. Indeed, these facilities

504
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,120
are run alongside a primary field lab at the remote northeast corner of Edwards by the Air

505
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:27,600
Force Research Lab's Aerospace Systems Directorate. AFRL, Edwards 412th Test Wing, and NASA Flight

506
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:33,280
Research Facility work together at Edwards to plan, conduct, analyze, and report on all flight and

507
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,400
ground testing of aircraft, weapons systems, software, and components, as well as modeling

508
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,840
and simulation for the USAAF. Since facilities are built into the Butte, it is no stretch to assume

509
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:49,920
locations are built under the Haystack Butte. And remember, this USAAF AFRL Rocket Propulsion

510
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,120
Division and their rocket test labs on Lumen Ridge were named by Hamilton and his informants as

511
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:01,120
featuring a stiff location connected to the wider Edwards underground complex. This lab features a

512
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,760
number of underground missile silos, but the extent to which the Air Force Propulsion Laboratory

513
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,200
sprawls underground is unknown. However, and very interesting, numerous studies out of the Air Force

514
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,480
Rocket Propulsion Lab have shown a heavy interest in anti-gravity propulsion. Is this location

515
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,400
definitely UFO legacy related? Unknown. But a strong argument can be made from witness testimony.

516
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:29,520
And lastly, a bit north to Antelope is China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station. As we showed in a 1964

517
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,080
Army Corps of Engineers study titled, A Feasibility of Constructing Large Underground

518
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:39,040
Cavities in Yo County, which shares territory with China Lake, was considered for underground

519
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,960
purposes. The underground cavity of interest was 4,000 feet deep, and it is unknown if this

520
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,400
facility was built. However, numerous witness testimony may give us some idea. As we also

521
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,120
discussed above, Dr. Sautter had been given testimony by Navy veterans stationed at China

522
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,080
Lake who not only claimed the facility goes one mile deep, but weapons work is conducted on

523
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,640
weapons more powerful than nuclear weapons. Hamilton himself also had a source who allegedly

524
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,080
served as an aerospace engineer consultant to NASA and Colonel. This unnamed Colonel claimed he

525
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,880
worked at an underground installation at China Lake, Edwards Air Force Base, and the Nevada test

526
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,000
site. These locations were, according to the source, connected via a maglev train system from

527
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,280
which he would often enter through a dump beneath White Sands Missile Range. I put stock in this

528
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,320
testimony due to speaking myself to a witness who claimed to travel via underground train

529
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:38,080
system from a fort in Texas to White Sands. This source, an Army officer in the 2010s,

530
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:44,000
claimed the train's speed and acceleration were so great it reminded him of his fear of flying.

531
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,240
We also have Ed in the mention of Edwards and the NTTR. China Lake is not mentioned in his

532
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,360
testimony, however it stands to reason the very near China Lake, which serves as the Navy's largest

533
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:02,480
single land holding representing 85% of the Navy's weapons and armaments RD, T&E programs, could

534
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,480
likely see crossover T.U.O. programs with the USAF. If these programs exchange non-human craft,

535
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,760
materials, and research, it stands to reason such transactions would be conducted underground to

536
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,520
maintain secrecy. I would in the future like to do an entire video on China Lake, so hang tight.

537
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,640
Corporate and military installations do indeed exist below Antelope Valley. Again,

538
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,840
the question is do these sites deal with technologies of unknown origin and exploitation

539
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:36,480
programs? Antelope and Palmdale are home to aerospace juggernauts and myriad DOD, RD, T&E,

540
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,960
and MRTFBs and have for decades featured numerous testimonies of ARV, underground installations,

541
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:49,200
and claims of UFO legacy programs. Due to these factors plus witnesses who have told me they have

542
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,160
traveled below the Antelope Valley, I am inclined to conclude such an anthill, if so to speak,

543
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,160
does in fact exist, to work on UFO legacy programs.

544
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,360
The vast majority of our focus today is the American Southwest and endless claims of

545
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:13,680
underground UFO research in RD, T&E, but quickly I do want to look East. We have already discussed

546
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:20,240
STIFs used by the CIA and NSA under cover of the Army and Navy respectively, but what about

547
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:26,080
UFO STIFs? For this reason, I would like to look to the United States Capitol and address the Deep

548
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:31,600
Underground Command Center. The D.U.C.C. was a STIF below the Pentagon that was never built,

549
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:36,640
however, I am not sure just how true that statement is. Now, an acknowledged STIF under

550
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,000
the Pentagon does indeed exist, the National Military Command Center responsible for generating

551
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,880
emergency action messages to missile control launch centers, nuclear subs, and battlefield

552
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:53,840
commanders. This NMCC was set to serve as an interim facility for the never built D.U.C.C.

553
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,200
The Deep Underground Command Center was first proposed in 1963, three weeks before the

554
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,840
assassination of JFK. Declassified top secret documents dated 7 November 63 detail former

555
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,880
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara proposing meetings to discuss the National Underground

556
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:16,640
Command Center. These plans for the National or Deep Underground Command Center detailed a complex

557
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:22,960
command center built 3,500 feet below Washington D.C. This location would be built to withstand

558
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,760
direct hits of 200 to 300 megaton warheads that penetrate 70 to 100 feet below the surface before

559
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,400
detonation. Two separate facilities were proposed, an austere facility with 10,000 total square feet

560
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:43,200
and 5,000 operating square feet accommodating 40 people at a depth of 3,500 feet. This would cost

561
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:50,960
over 110 million dollars or 1.1 billion today. The second was a moderate sized facility with 100,000

562
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:59,040
total square feet and 50,000 operating square feet accommodating 300 people at a depth of 3,500 feet.

563
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:05,920
This would cost 310 million or over 3.2 billion dollars today. The Joint Chiefs interestingly

564
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,600
proposed the austere facility to be too small. The operation capsule of the center would be near

565
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:17,280
the Pentagon and an access elevator would descend 3,500 feet underground from the Pentagon to the

566
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,480
installation. This may seem like a massive undertaking, however, the memorandum stated,

567
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,280
quote, there is little argument that the construction of a D.U.C.C. is technically

568
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,720
feasible, end quote. To quote the memo again, quote, the nature of the D.U.C.C., regardless of

569
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:39,200
the initial size selected, lends itself to later expansion, end quote. Once Lyndon B. Johnson took

570
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:46,640
office, a second memorandum was issued 16 January 1964 from Wal Rostow to McGeorge Bundy stating the

571
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:53,360
D.U.C.C. concept should proceed. Rostow served as a senior advisor to both Kennedy and Johnson.

572
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:58,160
An additional memo followed the same day from McGeorge Bundy to Carl Kasin showing planning

573
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,800
for the D.U.C.C. had been going forward since the early days of the Johnson admin.

574
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,520
Kasin was deputy special assistant for national security affairs to Kennedy and possibly stayed

575
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,920
on to advise on the D.U.C.C. program. The memo additionally stated, Kasin having spoken to Harold

576
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:21,680
Brown read the D.U.C.C. Brown served as director of defense research and engineering from 1961 to 1965.

577
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:27,120
A last top secret memo dealing with the D.U.C.C. was issued by the Bureau of the Budget estimated

578
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:35,440
between 1963 to 1964. 40 plus percent of this document is redacted. Was the D.U.C.C. ever built?

579
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,760
Conventional sources would say no, however I would argue indeed it was. This confidence of mine is

580
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:47,280
from sources who have described to me first-hand encounters within an enormous cavernous facility

581
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,360
below the Pentagon. But how does such a proposed facility deal with the subject of UFOs? If the

582
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:59,760
D.U.C.C. was indeed built, it is a publicly denied site. Therefore, we can feasibly reckon if the

583
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,640
site does exist, it deals with subjects critical to U.S. national security. Since the 1954 atomic

584
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,000
energy agreement, materials pertaining to UFOs have been misclassified as trans-classified foreign

585
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,640
nuclear materials. As relayed by physicist Robert Sarbacher in 1950, UFO programs exist and their

586
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:24,240
classification resides even higher than that of the H-bomb. On this channel, I have spoken in depth

587
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,760
that UFO legacy program operations are the ultimate secret, deep-sixed, clandestine set of

588
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:36,320
programs deeply embedded within special access programs. The Pentagon resides near Crystal City.

589
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:42,160
Crystal City features 8 of 10 of the U.S.'s top defense contractors, and the small neighborhood

590
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:48,000
is where two-thirds of federal contracts are awarded by value. This location holds primary

591
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,760
offices held by Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, General Dynamics, L3,

592
00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:00,240
Aerojet, Rocketdyne, and more, all contractors I highly suspect engage with UFO programs. The

593
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:05,920
neighborhood also holds or is in close proximity to numerous FFRDCs I believe are up to their

594
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,800
eyeballs in UFO programs. These include the Center for Naval Analyses, Institute for Defense Analysis,

595
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,800
Aerospace Corporation, and Rand Homeland Security Operations Analysis Center. Additionally,

596
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:24,400
Crystal City is home to myriad DoD research agencies including DARPA, Office of Naval Research,

597
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,520
and Air Force Office of Scientific Research. I do believe similar to the Antelope Valley,

598
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:35,520
Crystal City's amalgamation of DoD entities, FFRDCs, and contractors is a major center of

599
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:42,080
operations for UFO legacy programs. Perhaps due to limited airspace and usage of MRTFBs,

600
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:47,040
unlike the American Desert and Southwest, Crystal City is where the majority of UFO-related

601
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,960
USAPs are created, maintained, and kept secure. This is a thesis I will continue to explore in

602
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,880
depth in the future, if Crystal City does indeed majorly engage with clandestine UFO unacknowledged

603
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,240
special access programs. It stands to reason such a classified effort involving DoD,

604
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,640
private, and semi-private entities would require a massive underground facility.

605
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:18,400
The idea of a major network of underground tunnels connecting DUMs nationwide is often scoffed at.

606
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,320
I have no idea if the entire nation's STIFs are connected via tunnel system, but a strong argument

607
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,600
can be made complex systems of interconnecting STIFs exist in the American Southwest and East

608
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:35,520
Coast. After all, in a document obtained via FOIA by Dr. Richard Sauter, we even have hard

609
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,400
numbers from the military-industrial complex of the estimated number of total personnel needed

610
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,840
to build and operate a deeply buried hundreds of mile long tunnel system. And this is the order of

611
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:52,800
7,800 to 8,700 people, and we also have a hard estimate for the total expenses associated with

612
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:58,720
constructing, operating, and maintaining such a system, the neighborhood of $17 billion over

613
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,160
a 10-year period. Many such acknowledged tunnel systems exist, like the Department of Energy's

614
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,200
sprawling tunnel network below the Nevada Test and Training Range, but let's continue to explore

615
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,480
the feasibility of massive tunnel systems connecting bases dozens or hundreds of miles apart.

616
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:20,240
The technology for such undertakings does indeed exist. The most likely candidates are nuclear

617
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,760
subterranes and tunnel boring machines. Tunnel boring machines are huge cylindrical mechanical

618
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,640
boring machines that tunnel through rock and soil, chewing out circular tunnels that may range in

619
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:36,720
diameter of up to 35 or more feet. These Goliaths are powered by electrical motors that have a

620
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,880
cutting head equipped with various metal attachments made of super hard alloys that

621
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,240
cut through rock as the head rotates. The head rotates and the cutting tools dig into the rock,

622
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:52,000
ripping and gouging it away. The excavated rock or muck is then passed by a conveyor assembly to

623
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,560
the rear of the machine where it can be hauled away by truck or train. According to the Pacific

624
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:02,560
Gas and Electric Company, utilizing a Robbins Company TBM to bore a 22,000-foot long 24-foot

625
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:10,240
diameter tunnel, it took a rate of five to six miles per year. However, in better conditions,

626
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,080
some TBMs could bore at a rate of 10 miles per year or greater, roughly double the rate of the

627
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:21,280
Pacific Gas and Electric Company. This would mean dumps below China Lake and Edwards could

628
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,720
be connected in as little as five and a half years. Nuclear subterranes were originally

629
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,600
designed by Los Alamos National Lab. Sound familiar? The patents for such machines were

630
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,560
filed, technical documents were written, but the project seemingly faded into obscurity.

631
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:42,080
These fascinating machines work by melting through rock and soil, leaving neat, solidly glass-lined

632
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:47,840
tunnels by vitrifying materials. Heat is supplied to the system via compact nuclear reactors that

633
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,720
circulate liquid lithium from the reactor core to the tunnel face, melting rock in front of the

634
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:58,000
machine. Cooled liquid lithium then circulates to the back of the machine alongside the exterior of

635
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,640
the machine to cool surrounding rock as the machine is forced forward. Patents were first

636
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:10,080
proposed by the Atomic Energy Commission and US Energy R&D in 1972 and 1975. Further nuclear

637
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:16,080
subterrene patents in 1975 detailed tunnel systems of 12 meters or more in diameter.

638
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:21,280
All but one of the inventors listed in the three patents above were from Los Alamos. Additionally,

639
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:27,840
a 1973 Los Alamos study titled, Systems and Cost Analysis for a Nuclear Subterrene Tunnel Machine

640
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:33,600
a preliminary study concluded nuclear subterranes to be a cost-efficient solution to satisfy US

641
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:39,360
transportation tunnel demands. Similar to how we deduced numerous dumps were built around 1961 to

642
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,960
1989, we can make similar deductions regarding connective tunnel systems. If such an enormous

643
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:52,640
tunnel system exists, it likely saw construction beginning around the early 1970s, 1974 to be exact.

644
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,880
The Bechtel Corporation is an American engineering, procurement and construction

645
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,720
management company founded in the US. Bechtel has often been targeted as one of the US corporations

646
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:09,200
responsible for dumb tunnel systems. In 1974, Bechtel released a report titled, Research Program

647
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:14,880
Plan for Meeting Tomorrow's Needs in Tunneling and Excavation Final Report. This report states,

648
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,000
quote, the demand for tunneling and underground excavation for national defense needs is believed

649
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,360
to be large. Some examples of underground defense facilities include hard rock silos,

650
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:31,120
command posts, communication systems, personnel shelters, storage and power generation facilities,

651
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:36,800
end quote. Interestingly enough, the same report shows a massive list of novel ground disintegration

652
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:43,440
techniques in R&D stages. In 1972, the governing board of the National Research Council formed the

653
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,560
US National Committee on Tunneling Technology. This committee functioned as the, quote, United

654
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:53,920
States focal agency in the field of tunneling technology to assess and stimulate improvements

655
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,800
in tunneling technology applications and to coordinate US tunneling technology activities

656
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,840
with those of other nations, end quote. By 1977, this USNTT had six major subcommittees,

657
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:11,680
including the Deep Cavity and Tunnel Support Systems committees. USNCTT partnered with

658
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:17,520
numerous corporations, agencies and academics of particular interest to this channel. These include

659
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:23,040
both Sandia National Labs and Bechtel Memorial Institute. I have accused Bechtel of engaging

660
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:29,600
deeply with UAP legacy programs, including operations at the Dugway Alleged Dome. In 1981

661
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:36,560
and 1982, the USNCTT sponsored a project called Workshop on Technology for the Design and Construction

662
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:42,080
of Deep Underground Defense Facilities. This was done at the behest of the Nuclear Defense Agency

663
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:48,400
and co-sponsors included the Bureau of Reclamation, Army, USAAF, Navy, DOE and National

664
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:54,320
Science Foundation, including others. The 1982 report of the workshop detailed the need for 400

665
01:04:54,320 --> 01:05:00,560
miles of tunnels ranging from 2,500 to 3,500 feet for various purposes, including housing nuclear

666
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:06,240
missiles. These tunnels were to be up to 16 feet in diameter with, quote, interconnecting passageways

667
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,600
and adits, horizontal passageways for storage, living quarters and other needs, end quote.

668
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:15,440
The location of such a network of tunnels, according to the New York Times, would be,

669
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:21,040
quote, probably in the desert of the western United States. Such tunnels and installations

670
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:26,880
were to be powered via fuel cells or nuclear reactors, and as we saw in 1963, the US Army

671
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,840
Corps of Engineers was very serious about nuclear reactors powering self-contained underground

672
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:38,000
installations. Fuel cells may also be of special interest here, seen as in 1984 Boeing published

673
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,520
the results of a study that set forth plans for power generation in deep ICBM bases using

674
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:49,840
iron-chlorine fuel cells to generate power. The USNCTT called for mobilization of this plan

675
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:54,720
in the late 80s and early 90s. The committee called for tunnel boring machines to be utilized

676
01:05:54,720 --> 01:06:02,240
starting in 1985 for carving tunnel systems. By 1988, USNCTT was publishing reports titled

677
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:06,960
Tunneling and Underground Space Technology Discussing Underground Missile Systems Ranging

678
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:13,600
Between 3000 to 8000 feet underground. During this period in the 80s, numerous contractors

679
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:18,480
I have directly accused of being involved in UFO legacy programs would aid in the construction

680
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,520
of deep underground missile bases and tunnel systems. Of course, we must assume some if not

681
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:29,280
many underground nuclear missile bases may have served as clandestine RDT&E facilities. This

682
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,160
should not come as a shock, as we have already discussed US intelligence agencies utilizing

683
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:40,160
underground military sites for secret operations. Such corporations include BDM who was awarded in

684
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:46,640
1985 a contract to conduct quote, intercontinental ballistic missile deep basing communication study

685
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:52,800
end quote, as well as TRW who had since 1968 been involved in studies into high speed ground

686
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:58,560
transportation tunnel design and cost analysis. Both corporations were later on bought by Northrop

687
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:06,000
The 1985 BDM study is of particular interest here. Remember if you will, earlier that same year,

688
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,600
20-25 May 1985 to be exact, BDM McLean also held the Advanced Theoretical Physics Conference.

689
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:19,200
The meetings of this exclusive group were classified utilizing DOE controls. Notes of

690
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,000
this conference were released by attendee Oke Shannon who formerly served as manager

691
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,920
for special projects at Los Alamos National Labs. This McLean Virginia secure facility

692
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:36,320
group discussed myriad aspects of UFOs including legacy programs and a major engineering project

693
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:42,880
under Bobby Ray Inman. Viewers of my channel will absolutely recall Inman mentioned often as a senior

694
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:49,280
UFO legacy operations member. At this time, the vice president of BDM was former major general

695
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:54,960
and founder of US Army INSCOM Albert Stubblebine. Stubblebine will be mentioned again in this

696
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,480
project including how he was accused of engaging in UFO craft storage and material exploitation

697
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,240
while head of army intelligence at Fort Hachuca, Arizona. Interestingly, the Advanced Theoretical

698
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:13,280
Working Group was spearheaded by US Army Colonel John B. Alexander who from 1982 to 1983 reported

699
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:19,360
directly to Stubblebine. Additionally, recall how Philip J. Corso claimed a UFO working group was

700
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:25,440
established in the mid-80s. According to Corso, this group saw ample funding from US Army INSCOM

701
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:31,760
General Stubblebine. It is interesting to think of possible ties between this ICBM deep basing

702
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:36,800
communication study and Albert Stubblebine and the Advanced Theoretical Physics Conference and a

703
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:43,040
possible UFO working group accused by Philip J. Corso. Throughout the 1980s, US industry and

704
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,840
government additionally demonstrated a keen interest in life support systems for massive

705
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:54,480
tunnel systems, underground ICBM installations, as well as deep and I mean deep underground bases.

706
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:00,320
This can be demonstrated in a November 1985 contract to Unitech Technologies Hamilton

707
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:05,760
Standard Division for life support and chemical biological agent mitigation system on small

708
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:13,280
ICBM deep basing programs. US Army Corps of Engineers as well as USNCTT have even discussed

709
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:18,640
provable technologies, times, and prices to construct such massive tunnel systems.

710
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:25,120
Yet no data exists on any large-scale tunneling project. This may force us to look deeper like

711
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:30,400
at the low-profile records of the Bureau of Reclamation who during the 20th century excavated

712
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:36,080
hundreds of miles of tunnels up to 28.5 feet in diameter at depths of hundreds to thousands of

713
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:41,280
feet. Quite often the Bureau would utilize classic tunnel boring machines. Numerous

714
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:45,840
inside sources to Dr. Richard Sautter have informed him that some of the Bureau of Reclamation's

715
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:51,440
tunnels have doubled as cover for other clandestine underground tunnels. To quote underground and

716
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,200
underwater bases, quote,

717
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:06,080
and striking out secretly to make a clandestine tunnel. It takes about 10 men to operate a TBM

718
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,880
and in good rock you can count on as much as 15 miles of tunnel per year, end quote.

719
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:21,040
For decades, rumors of underground railroad systems, specifically maglev trains, have been

720
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:26,800
inseparable from testimony regarding dumps and UFOs. As we discussed earlier in the Antelope

721
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:32,480
Valley section, such a concept was relayed to UFO researcher Bill Hamilton by some of his many

722
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:37,600
informants. But just how true are these rumors of a high-speed electromagnetic railroad system

723
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:43,760
often described as a pneumatic system, aka a train system operating in a partial vacuum tube?

724
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,560
To begin, what is maglev? Maglev trains are a type of rail system levitated by

725
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:54,480
electromagnetics rather than employing wheels. Maglevs feature numerous benefits to conventional

726
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:59,920
railroad systems, including higher speeds, superior acceleration and deceleration, lower

727
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:05,520
maintenance costs, improved gradient handling, and lower noise. But are much more expensive

728
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:12,400
compared to traditional systems. Maglevs have even reached top speeds of 375 miles per hour.

729
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:17,440
And pneumatic tube trains are an early form of transportation or air vacuum to move containers

730
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,160
or vehicles through tubes while minimizing friction. New York's first subway system was

731
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:27,600
an underground pneumatic tube transport line created by Alfred Eli Beach. Earlier in this

732
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,720
project, we spoke of Nazi scientists being sequestered by Air Material Command in the US

733
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:38,160
to work on underground complexes. I would also like to draw attention to Herman Kemper. Kemper

734
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:43,680
was a Third Reich engineer who created a concept for the Rohrbahn. The Rohrbahn was a system of

735
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:48,720
magnetic levitation trains designed to speed through underground vacuum tunnels at hundreds

736
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:53,840
or even thousands of miles per hour. Suspended passenger cars on magnetic fields would be

737
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,280
propelled through tunnels negating any friction of wheels, rails, and air. Kemper's research

738
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:05,680
began in 1934. By 1938, he envisioned Berlin connected to other European cities with cars

739
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:12,320
traveling at 600 to 1000 miles per hour. It is unknown how far the Nazis pursued this concept,

740
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:17,600
nor is it known if Kemper was recruited by Operation Paperclip. A feasible hypothesis

741
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:23,680
here is Kemper was contracted by the US to help build early iterations of maglev pneumatic systems.

742
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:30,480
Maglev, UFOs, and Dums are often lumped together as conspiracy, however maglevs are not a niche

743
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:36,720
concept. Since the 1960s, maglev technology has seen numerous patents and by the year 2000,

744
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:41,840
even Lockheed Martin entered into agreements with Trans Rapid International USA to develop

745
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:48,000
maglev technology in the US. In fact, by the early 1990s, an acknowledged multi-agency

746
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:54,080
National Maglev Institute was formed. This joint effort by the DOE and US Army Corps of Engineers

747
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:59,520
sought to, quote, define the role maglev could play in US transportation system, to assess the

748
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,480
potential for maglev in the domestic market, to recommend a strategy for the introduction of

749
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:10,480
maglev technology, and to identify the most appropriate federal role, end quote. This NMI

750
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,120
published a report in the early 90s titled Compendium of Executive Summaries from the

751
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:20,480
Maglev System Concept Definition Final Reports. This series of reports sought to determine

752
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:26,240
nationwide maglev system availability by the year 2000. Some interesting players appear in this

753
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:31,760
document. This includes a joint project with Bechtel, Hughes Aircraft, and MIT, which employs

754
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:38,000
a UARC for the Army. A second report saw work by Boeing Aerospace and General Dynamics to study

755
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,880
superconducting levitation. To top this off, a third study saw joint efforts into

756
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:48,560
superconducting magnets performed by Grumman Corporation pre-Northrop, Bechtel Memorial Labs,

757
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,640
and Honeywell. All contractors mentioned above in above board maglev technology research I highly

758
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:59,920
expect have for decades attempted the reverse engineering and material exploitation of non-human

759
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:06,160
craft. However, rumors of clandestine maglev systems far precede the 1990s and 2000s.

760
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:12,000
Dr. Richard Sauter as well as Bill Hamilton first heard whispers of such systems in the 1980s.

761
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,360
Sauter himself referenced reading reports of underground rail systems to Area 51 from Mercury,

762
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:23,040
Nevada and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Corona Division. Discussion of these rail systems would

763
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:30,800
even pop up in online UFO forums around 1997. Look at the name on the top of these testimony reports,

764
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:36,640
A.J. Cradock. In discussed in the Dugway project, Cradock is an oil tycoon operating in Libya that

765
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:42,240
helped Stephen Greer in the 1990s with Seaseti. Cradock brought Greer, in my opinion, incredibly

766
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:48,240
valuable and relevant information regarding Area 51 moving many UFO operations to Dugway.

767
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:53,760
So if maglev systems existed far before UFO legacy program defense contractors engaged with

768
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,880
the acknowledged National Maglev Institute, where and when might these systems have been developed

769
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:04,000
and of what technology? The mid-1960s saw established engineering professors from the

770
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,440
Office of Naval Research, Army Research Office and Booz Allen Hamilton establish the International

771
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:15,840
Society for Terrain Vehicle Systems, or ISTV. Real quick, in the mid to late 20th century,

772
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:21,760
I believe Booz Allen Hamilton was as involved in UFO legacy operations as Northrop Grumman is today,

773
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:27,120
but that's another project for another day. The ISTVS working group coordinated research around

774
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:33,440
high-speed underground tube train systems. At the same time of the ISTVS, the U.S. Department

775
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,800
of Commerce established a multi-agency panel focused on high-speed underground tube train

776
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:45,600
systems. The panel produced a 1967 report titled R&D for High-Speed Ground Transportation, which

777
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,320
states, quote, Regardless of the system adopted, it can be assumed that extensive tunneling will

778
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:55,680
be involved. It is recommended that the department cooperate closely with other agencies in planning

779
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:01,440
and funding research into this area to provide an extra stimulus for rapid development, end quote.

780
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:07,600
Of massive consequence to this investigation, in 1972, Robert Salter of the R&D Corporation

781
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:13,120
published a study titled The Very High-Speed Transit System. In this study, R&D set out a

782
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:17,760
continental deep underground concept that was described as, quote, electromagnetically

783
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:23,120
levitated and propelled cars in an evacuated tunnel, end quote. The study makes some truly

784
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:34,480
shocking statements, including, quote, In an example case of a direct link between Los Angeles

785
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:46,880
and New York requiring only 21 minutes of transit time, I believe Salter additionally makes a critical

786
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:52,160
statement that lends strongly towards the subject of UFO legacy dumps. Salter states, quote,

787
01:16:53,200 --> 01:17:10,400
These intermediate staging points are apparent when throughout this video I have made and will

788
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,760
continue to make in the Hamilton map segment the argument that UFO dump networks feature central

789
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:21,360
hubs. These hubs, if so to speak, are connected to one another and branch to local smaller dump

790
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:26,400
facilities. Think of a railway central station connecting to other major stations while also

791
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:32,240
featuring alternative lines to small local stops. Much of this technology was based on work conducted

792
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:38,400
by Robert Goddard, father of modern rocketry's 1945 vacuum tube transport system, as well as

793
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:43,760
Michael Minovich, the physicist behind introducing gravity-assisted propulsion around planetary bodies

794
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:50,480
1961 work deep underground tube shuttle. Salter and Rand strongly recommended placing the VHST

795
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,720
underground to remove interference with environmental factors such as grade crossings,

796
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:00,080
weather and infrastructure and also observed that it was not appreciable harder to tunnel at great

797
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:06,160
lengths underground than at shallow depths. Within this study is a map of the proposed VHST

798
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:11,200
that corresponds strongly to build Hamilton's alleged western state dump network, but more

799
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:16,800
on this later. Around a similar timeframe to this Rand study is the high-speed ground transportation

800
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:22,720
initiative. This group became operational in the 1960s, performing most of their work in the 1970s

801
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:29,200
before slipping out of public view in the 1980s. For a period of 10 to 15 years, the United States

802
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:35,280
saw enormous efforts into R&D and feasibility and desirability of high-speed underground tube

803
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:41,520
shuttle train systems. Entities involved in this program are countless, including TRW, General

804
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:47,760
Dynamics, MIT, Southwest Research Institute behind Project Stargate, General Electric, NASA,

805
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,720
Army, Navy, and Battelle Memorial Institute. I have mentioned some of the work published under

806
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:59,360
this initiative before, including TRW's 1967 study titled Abstracts of Concepts of High-Speed Ground

807
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:05,120
Transportation Systems. Remember, TRW was purchased by Northrop Grumman and long considered as the

808
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:10,560
contractor behind the majestic 12-like entity Project Zodiac. For the high-speed ground

809
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,760
transportation initiative, TRW additionally prepared a study titled State of the Art Tube

810
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:22,320
Vehicle System in 1970. This study discussed tube systems in tunnels as deep as 3,000 feet underground

811
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:29,120
using trains that would travel at speeds of 450 miles per hour. Similar to the dumb tunnel concept,

812
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:33,760
no admission of maglevs connecting stiffs is publicly available. However, there is an

813
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,560
overwhelming body of historical evidence that U.S. and defense contractors have had a keen

814
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:44,720
interest in high-speed underground transit systems traveling at least as fast as a commercial airliner.

815
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:54,960
To close off our investigation, I would like to return to 1992's Cosmic Top Secret by Bill

816
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:00,560
Hamilton. In this masterpiece of a book, Hamilton provides a map of underground facilities and

817
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:08,640
tunnels provided to him by one TAL in 1990. Some data here is from Thomas C., aka Thomas Castillo,

818
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:13,520
which is an extremely controversial source with the Dulcey, New Mexico story, so instead,

819
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:19,040
let's go ahead and analyze the map. This network spans the American West and Southwest with major

820
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:24,800
installations listed in Southern California, New Mexico, and Colorado. As expected earlier,

821
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:30,400
we find Edwards Air Force Base connected to myriad locations including numerous small marks labeled

822
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:37,120
R&D. We also see a supposed underground base marked Cat. This is of course Catalina Island,

823
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:43,440
fascinating how in 2023 and 2024, discussion began to swirl of an underground extraterrestrial

824
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:50,000
or human base off of Catalina Island. We also see Area 51 as a major reference with connections to

825
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,680
Tonopah, an installation infamous in UFO lore as well. We also find interesting solo marked

826
01:20:55,680 --> 01:21:00,720
dumps not connected in this alleged system including Fort Hachuca, Arizona, a location

827
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:07,120
I estimate is involved heavily in UFO programs. Remember if you will, Fort Hachuca holds a defense

828
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:13,200
agency major range and test facility base, a critical core facility called the Joint Interoperability

829
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:18,640
Center. Army intelligence at Fort Hachuca was previously run by U.S. Army INSCOM founder,

830
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:24,240
Major General Albert Stubblebine. Stubblebine and INSCOM have been accused by myself in numerous

831
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:30,080
projects amongst others as engaging in UFO crash retrieval, storage, and material exploitation.

832
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,720
Therefore, it is really no surprise to see Hamilton's map designate Fort Hachuca as a

833
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:40,320
dumb location. On the map are many locations in New Mexico including the controversial Dulce,

834
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:46,160
Los Alamos, and Sandia slash Kirtland. The latter two we know have underground facilities,

835
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:51,600
indeed the same extents to Cheyenne in Colorado. Intriguing to note here is an installation in

836
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,920
Chihuahua, Mexico. This subject wouldn't be touched on again until Jake Barber's

837
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:01,920
Romana Clay called Sentinels of Ether. This project describes a 2004 blue on blue UFO

838
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,880
retrieval team fire operation in which the clandestine team flew into a disguised base

839
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:12,480
hidden in the mountains of Chihuahua. What happens when we start to compare this map to others?

840
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:18,320
See now a comparison between Hamilton's dumb network and Rand's VHST. See the interesting

841
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:23,680
direct route shared across the two maps through the northern area of Arizona and New Mexico.

842
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:28,240
Additionally, observe how Southern California sees routes split to both Southern California

843
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:33,360
near San Diego and Northern California near Sacramento before continuing north to Portland

844
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:39,120
and Washington. Also notice connections to Denver on both locations. Outside of Cheyenne Mountain

845
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:44,960
Complex, Denver, Colorado is home to an enormous underground FEMA complex. This is likely a

846
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:50,640
continuity of government or COG complex. My true interest lies in comparing the Hamilton

847
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:55,840
piece to defense laboratories and centers across the United States. Here we will not find Groom

848
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:01,120
Lake amongst other select facilities, but I believe this comparison is of critical importance.

849
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:06,400
If you will, please forgive the maps not lining up. The 1990 map is scaled differently than the

850
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:13,360
2019 DOD map, so the two are not merged to scale perfectly. Aligning the two maps brings extreme

851
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,840
interest to both dumb locations as well as markings on the Hamilton piece that are labeled

852
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:22,960
R&D. Since this map pertains to connected underground UFO installations, we can assume

853
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:29,280
by the map's legend these locations do not employ dumbs but are still focused on UFO legacy R&D.

854
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,520
As expected, Southern California brings a massive amount of locations of interest.

855
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:38,000
Even outside of the Antelope Valley to the southwest in Los Angeles lies a tremendous

856
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:45,920
amount of DOD RDT&E labs, FFRDCs like RAND and Aerospace Corporations, and UARCs like the USC

857
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:51,360
Institute for Creative Technologies. Numerous other locations outside of the Antelope line up

858
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:56,080
between the two maps we have discussed throughout this investigation, including Fort Hachuca,

859
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:02,240
Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, Dugway and its two MRTFBs, Los Alamos, White Sands Missile Range,

860
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:07,920
Sandia, and Kirtland Air Force Base. From referencing DOD labs, we can also learn Kirtland

861
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:13,120
and its proven underground facilities stand out even more. Kirtland additionally holds the Air

862
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:18,800
Force Research Lab's Space Vehicles Directorate and Directed Energy Directorate. Of note shared

863
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:24,320
on these maps, albeit slightly shifted, is the 4th Defense Estate Microelectronics Activity in

864
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:30,640
Northern California. In DOD terms, 4th Estate describes non-military parts of the DOD. These

865
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:36,000
include the Defense Contract Audit Agency, Defense Contract Management Agency, and the Defense

866
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,280
Finance and Accounting Service. 4th Estate agencies and field activities all watching this video

867
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:47,120
might recognize are DARPA and the Defense Missile Agency. Prior to this investigation, I had never

868
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:52,640
come across mention of a dump below the DMEA, so this is a terrific point of research moving

869
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:57,360
forward. Let's also reference more of the non-connected R&D locations on Hamilton's

870
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:03,120
map that exist as acknowledged DOD RDT&E facilities. In Nebraska, on both maps,

871
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:07,680
we find identification of the US STRATCOM, University Affiliated Research Center,

872
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:14,160
the University of Nebraska National Strategic Research Institute. Viewers of my work know UARCs

873
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:20,560
and FFRDCs are cornerstones of UAP legacy programs, so it is interesting to see Hamilton identify a

874
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:28,400
as a UFO R&D location all the way back in 1992 that would not be founded until 2012.

875
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:34,880
In Oklahoma, we observe Fort Sill as UFO R&D and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head

876
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:40,400
Special Weapons Division McAllister Detachment as UFO storage. I have come across both of these

877
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:47,040
locations in my research, however, it is interesting to see an NSWC location labeled as storage,

878
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:52,080
especially after the testimony of Randy Anderson and the Off-World Technologies Division at the

879
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:58,160
Naval Surface Warfare Center crane. In northern Kansas, we observe overlap of a UFO research

880
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:04,800
facility. This facility is the US Army Leavenworth Research Unit. In Texas, we find Fort Hood Army

881
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:10,160
Research Unit as a UFO research location, however, it is interesting to see this facility is not

882
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:15,200
marked as a STIF, especially after numerous testimony relayed by and research done by

883
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:20,560
Leonard Stringfield. The Hamilton map deserves an entire investigation of its own and possibly,

884
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:26,960
I will do so with Dr. Soder, because after all, this map does accuse dumbs of existing at all

885
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:33,040
locations we have previously discussed as well as many that warrant further investigation including

886
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:39,920
Fort Stockton, Fort Irwin, Vandenberg AFB, Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range, 29 Palms,

887
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:45,200
Hutchinson Air Force Station, and Peterson Air Force Base as well as the cities of Kingsley,

888
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:51,440
Nebraska, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Riverton, Wyoming. I have spoken to Dr. Soder and he has spoken

889
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:57,760
directly with Bill Hamilton regarding this map so just maybe he can aid in further dissecting

890
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:03,360
of these locations. Hey guys, it's Gurb and if you're still with me, thank you so much for joining

891
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:09,520
me in this. At this point, hour twenty, hour and a half investigation into dumbs. As many of you

892
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,160
know and as many people have been looking forward to this project, dumbs are a passion project of

893
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:19,680
mine. I speak about installations under Dugway, under the Antelope Valley, under the Northrop

894
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:26,960
Tejon and Hellendale facilities in numerous videos. I think probably my last four videos straight I

895
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:32,480
have mentioned one if not multiple of these locations. As we made it to the end of this video,

896
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:37,680
I'd like to thank again Dr. Richard Soder for all of his excellent research. Now this video is going

897
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:41,280
to be doing things a little bit differently. Of course, in every single one of my videos,

898
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:46,880
I include my show notes in the video description or a link. Please bear with me a couple days here as

899
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:53,600
I have not only compiled my research links for this video, but also every single document that

900
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,120
I can find that Dr. Richard Soder has included in his three books. So every single defense

901
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:03,600
technical document, every single Army Corps of Engineer document, every single document I could

902
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,880
find which there's hundreds. So please allow me a couple days to compile all that and deliver that

903
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,960
because I think it's excellent to read through all of those and please read through Dr. Richard

904
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:20,560
Soder's books. They're excellent. As we know from today, the subject of dumbs is very vast. It's

905
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:26,160
almost impossible to know where and when to start. There's a tremendous amount of literature on deep

906
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:32,080
underground facilities for continuity of government use, for ICBM silos, for just general

907
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:37,200
underground installations accessible by vertical or inclined shaft. There's also a tremendous

908
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:44,320
amount of information specifically starting post 1974 with Bechtel on large-scale tunneling systems

909
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:50,720
and conventional and unconventional blasting methods. This would be a tunnel boring machine

910
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:55,920
or a nuclear subterrene as a conventional method or explosives or possibly nuclear detonation as

911
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:01,760
unconventional and also a lot of literature on maglev technology. I know these three subjects

912
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:10,080
of interconnected dumb bases are often scoffed at without a lot of research but this is a very

913
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:16,720
serious subject and at least I would say focused in the southwest and the American desert and the

914
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:23,120
east there are probably large networks of dumbs. This would include New Mexico, Arizona, Southern

915
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:28,960
California, possibly up to connecting to Dugway and Colorado and then a network out east including

916
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:36,960
the Warrenton Army Training Facility, Camp Peary, Camp David, the D.U.C.C. which I wager highly exists

917
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:44,480
and so forth. Now of course let's treat this video as a part one. A part two will be a project with

918
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:49,920
Dr. Richard Soder. I spoke to him the other week for about two to three hours and he graciously agreed

919
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,360
to come on the show and talk more about dumbs. I think what's really interesting here is there

920
01:29:55,360 --> 01:30:00,640
are numerous informants just like Bill Hamilton had that have told him about installations and

921
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:06,560
facilities and perhaps he can tell those on our project together and relay them because he said

922
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:11,200
some to me in our conversations that he hasn't repeated publicly that are indeed quite interesting.

923
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:18,800
Also when Bill Hamilton was still alive Dr. Richard Soder talked to him at length about his

924
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:25,760
network of dumbs maps so possibly for an hour, hour and a half we will dive into that so please

925
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:30,640
look forward to a Dr. Richard Soder project coming in the future and please also look forward to the

926
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:36,720
show notes. You know another thing I'm doing is I'm planning to build a website no sign up needed

927
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:42,560
it's not the DPI archive but I'm planning to put up a website where I have videos, transcripts of

928
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,560
the videos and all research links so I'd like to put those there. The only reason I plan to do this

929
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:52,560
is to make it easier to access all the materials I put forth with my research but I want to know

930
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:57,520
what everybody thinks about dumbs, specifically networks of dumbs. Dumbs are not a controversial

931
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:02,080
thing, dumbs do indeed exist and from numerous testimony whether that be Leonard Stringfield,

932
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:08,080
whether that be testimony to Soder, to Hamilton, to myself, there is a incredible argument that

933
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:13,920
many of these facilities, dumb facilities, engage in UAP legacy programs. I like to think back to

934
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:20,640
the testimony of MS for example which led to a tremendously fruitful venture into the dumb under

935
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:25,120
Dugway and of course we even have a specific entrance to that facility. Other research from

936
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:29,280
other informants can be done on this. Another thing I did differently in this project of course

937
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:34,160
is I hardly interject when witnesses have spoken to me about testimony or given me testimony.

938
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:40,320
I thought it prudent in this investigation just when speaking about various dumb facilities and

939
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:45,200
to summarize these include I've spoken to individuals who have been in networks under

940
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:51,200
the Antelope Valley in a location under Texas that connected via underground train that went

941
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:58,000
so fast it reminded this army veteran of his fear of flying to white sands missile range as well as

942
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,840
the what we might call the deep underground command center out east. This is a location

943
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:09,440
deep under the pentagon how deep I don't know however I have good insight this is a facility

944
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:15,280
or at least there are facilities here that are run by the CIA directorate of science and technology.

945
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:20,640
If that sounds familiar to you that was the CIA office that blocked the material transfer in 2008

946
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:28,400
from Lockheed Martin to the OSAP program and that was the 1953 Kingman crash. But the networks of

947
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:34,400
dumbs are what are so interesting to me for example harkening back to the story of Ed and the Nevada

948
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:39,760
Test and Training Range and Edwards Air Force Base there's other testimony about connections

949
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:46,560
in bases in southern California to to Area 51 Tonopah the Nevada Test and Training Range.

950
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,120
If I could ever get Ed to sit down in a room and believe me I've tried to speak to him the first

951
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:55,440
thing I would ask him if there's connective tunneling systems and what type of vehicles

952
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:00,720
if there are that connect these two places. Now absent in this video of course I talked about

953
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:05,360
the beginning other stories of Bob Lazar the stories of Dulcey Bace and Thomas Castillo

954
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:12,080
and the story of Phil Schneider. I believe that these in that these witnesses these subjects are

955
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:16,880
very controversial so I didn't include them because of their controversy but because

956
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:23,200
when I have such controversial claims I think it prudent to investigate those and vet those

957
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:29,360
and try to determine any sort of objective information from those when we can. So you know

958
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:34,800
S4 for example I do believe S4 is a facility that does indeed exist does it have extraterrestrial

959
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:40,080
or non-human technology I don't know an individual I've spoken to that went to S4 talked about

960
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:47,360
colored lines where to walk but he didn't see anything that would say non-human technology

961
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,480
but then again he was not privy to the entire base but because of that I would like to focus

962
01:33:52,480 --> 01:34:00,160
on subjects like S4 maybe Dulcey Bace and maybe other locations as well and I will do those in

963
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:05,360
a separate project. With this project I wanted to take as objective of an approach as I could I

964
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:11,520
wanted to combine the facts we know about Dums about tunnel systems about maglev systems and

965
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:16,880
relay those to stories of the Antelope Valley stories of locations out east I mean there is

966
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:20,880
a tremendous amount of facilities I didn't get to cover here that I would like to revisit so

967
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:26,960
again as I spoke about in the project with Dr. Richard Sauter this is just kind of a taste

968
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:34,480
into Dums I do think this is one of the most consequential subjects of UFO legacy programs

969
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:39,840
you know like I said and I'll say it again most underground facilities as we see from the US

970
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:45,440
Army Corps of Engineers and other documents were first proposed as a continuity of government a

971
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:52,800
COG or a ICBM silo facility and we know that is partially true in the large FEMA underground

972
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,680
center near Denver Colorado which everybody knows I'm from Colorado so that's near where I am so

973
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,120
the clandestine operation when did these start as we talked about the Dums there's a good argument

974
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:08,560
that in post 1961 when the US Army Corps of Engineers really started to look into underground

975
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:15,120
facilities massive ones ranging up to up to in some documents 8 000 feet underground

976
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:19,840
into the late 90s I think this is when the vast majority of underground installations were built

977
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:25,760
when were the connective tunnels built if these do exist which I believe many locations do feature

978
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:30,560
connective tunnels this of course as we saw in the Bechtel report with conventional and unconventional

979
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:38,160
tunneling methods probably started around 1974 between 1972 and 1974 a whole host of tunneling

980
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:44,800
committees and institutes were set up to investigate massive tunneling systems and of course

981
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:50,720
following in the 80s into the 90s we see the same thing with maglev technology so I think the order

982
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:56,960
of operations here is likely the dumbest built maybe a decade later connective tunnels are built

983
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,280
and maybe a decade after that the full train systems are implemented I mean in the 90s we

984
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:06,640
see the National Maglev Institute and we see corporations like Grumman like General Dynamics

985
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:13,760
like Battelle doing aboveboard maglev research so this could likely imply they have been doing

986
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:20,560
clandestine research into similar projects into electromagnetics long before then so it's a it's

987
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:25,600
an incredibly fascinating subject especially when you start to look at the Bureau of Reclamation

988
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:30,720
and what Dr. Sautter has relayed from his informants about the Bureau of Reclamation

989
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:35,520
this was possibly an aboveboard tunneling system in the American Southwest that featured

990
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:43,040
clandestine secondary tunnels to bore out whatever was needed and as we saw in the list I scrolled

991
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:49,600
through there are hundreds of tunnels from the BOR that in the mid to late 20th century and some

992
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,280
of these are hundreds of miles long some of these are thousands and they range in depths from

993
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:58,800
just underground to up to near a thousand feet so when Dr. Sautter's informant relayed to him

994
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:04,080
that 10 men can operate a TBM and a good TBM in good conditions can chew through up to 10 miles per

995
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:08,720
year I do think this is a likely candidate you know this harkens back to other UFO legacy program

996
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:15,360
funding operations how we what we can make educated guesses via IRAD, sole source contracts,

997
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:22,400
IDIQ and utilizing legitimate contracts to skim off funds for UFO legacy programs.

998
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:30,160
Now again I want to know what everybody thinks if there are people here who have been to underground

999
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:35,040
facilities massive deep underground facilities please reach out to me I would love to hear about

1000
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:41,440
your experience I will respect your anonymity but if you have a location a facility to describe

1001
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:45,760
or an experience in such a facility please reach out to me I would love to talk to you but

1002
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:50,880
again guys let me know in the comments what you think this has been a long spiel almost 11 minutes

1003
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,120
I think I've rambled quite a bit please remember to like and subscribe on the video and remember

1004
01:37:55,120 --> 01:38:00,640
guys I do have a Patreon I don't gatekeep my content in my opinion this might be stubborn

1005
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:05,440
or this might be a bit narcissistic I think the content is important to view so I'm not going to

1006
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:10,160
gatekeep anything because I would like all of my research all of my projects and all my research

1007
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:15,440
materials to be publicly available to anybody so the Patreon is there to support what you think

1008
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:22,000
the channel is worth not to lock off any content so with that guys I have a couple projects coming

1009
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,400
up I'm really really really darn excited about I'm trying to think about how I'm going to juggle

1010
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:31,120
these but about three projects on the immediate mind I'm already working on including and that

1011
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:36,080
includes the project with Dr. Richard Sautter so I will catch everybody soon and thank you so very

1012
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,360
much for joining me bye now
