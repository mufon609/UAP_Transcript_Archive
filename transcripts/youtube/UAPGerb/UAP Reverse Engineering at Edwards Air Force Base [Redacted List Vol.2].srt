1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So here is your list, I'm not going to go through 145 sites, some of them are black sites, some of them are bases you know about like Wright-Patterson, Edwards, Nellis, Area 51 so called, but all of them are based on witness testimony and intelligence we've gathered over the last 30 years, and it's time for it to be disclosed.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Recently in 2024, Stephen Greer and The Disclosure Project released their entire catalogue of documents, communication logs, drawings, and other files. Love him or hate him, over the years Greer has provided valuable witnesses a platform to speak, and wrote in my opinion a truly fantastic piece of work, his 2001 disclosure briefing document, so while I have my problems with Greer, this document archive absolutely commands my attention.

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Greer's list of UFO whistleblowers and witnesses features over 700 names, many of which are redacted. Here we find names we all expect, Michael Herrera, the late Dr. Robert Wood, Richard Doty, Robert Salas, Jonathan Wagan, even Bob Lazar, but we also find 22 pages of redacted names, some of these names are described simply as points of contact to others, but some have descriptions that might be well worth our attention.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Viewers of my channel may remember UFO Witness's redacted list, in which I derived the names and contacted two of these witnesses from poorly redacted documents uploaded by Greer. One such witness MS agreed to interview on UFO testing occurring at Dugway Proving Grounds, while the other witness TB was much more shadowy.

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Today we cover the redacted entry that has captivated my attention and commanded my research for months on end. A witness I have been more than eager to cover, as I believe this witness's alleged first-hand experiences with UFO reverse engineering offer crucial insights into DOD and defense contractor involvement with UFO programs.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And before we get started guys, full disclaimer, I have been able to ascertain this individual's identity and have tried to contact him through myriad methods. Should he ever respond and be willing to go public, I will go to any lengths to speak with him.

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But for operational security and his family's safety, I will not burn witness 11-063's identity. I have also attempted to encourage this individual to testify before Congress or contact the Senate Intelligence Committee.

8
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:57,000
For this project, I will only be using publicly available sources, no classified or hidden information will be disclosed in this video. And I would like to say, I have thoroughly vetted this individual through public online resources and can confirm his Air Force station at Nellis Air Force Base, Edwards Air Force Base, and the Pentagon.

9
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
As well as various positions within the U.S. Air Force as stated by Greer.

10
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I first took note of witness 11-063, who I will further refer to as Ed, when Dr. Greer released his witness list. This astonishing entry reads, quote, Career Air Force Nellis Edwards, test director of Electronics Warfare Group, tested reverse engineer technology, was at the Pentagon DOE.

11
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Unlike MSTB and myriad other witnesses, no communications or files existed on Ed at the initial release of the DPI archive files. It wasn't until late summer of 2024 that the Disclosure Project Intelligence Archive updated an additional section of documents, intelligence briefing modules, the DPI archive files, and the DPI archive files.

12
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It was in these intelligence briefing modules that we would get our first leads on Ed. Within this section, we find Module 3 under UFO crash retrievals titled, quote, Covert Government Retrieval and Handling ET Vehicles, end quote.

13
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In summary, we find some fascinating information adapted from a March 2024 oral presentation from Greer. Not only does Greer discuss 130-plus instances of NHI objects being downed and retrieved, involving major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Skunk Works, and Boeing, but these operations are conducted using advanced electro-gravitic technologies and electromagnetic pulse EMP weapons.

14
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I do highly recommend reading through the entirety of this module as it invokes the quality of the 2001 Disclosure Briefing Document and also makes mention of Witness MS and Richard Foch, a formal Naval Research Labs senior scientist who discussed large, silent, triangular alien reproduction vehicles over remote areas of dugway-proving grounds.

15
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Towards the end of Module 3, we see our first discussion of Ed outside the witness list, quote,

16
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Having left the Air Force in 2009, the Lieutenant Colonel was extensively briefed on operations not just at Edwards but also at Nellis and Area 51. He believes that since the operations he was involved in were illegal, he is free to discuss them publicly and is ready to disclose everything he knows in an open hearing under oath, end quote.

17
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It was around the time of the upload of this module Greer finally uploaded two documents under Witness 11-063.

18
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,000
First, let's analyze what I would consider to be the less impactful of the two documents on Ed to understand his background and motives for contacting Greer in late 2023.

19
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,000
In presumably an internal Disclosure Project email, an unknown individual emailed Greer stating Witness Ed had been following Greer's work for some time and wished to answer Greer's call for whistleblowers.

20
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This DPI employee states Ed served in USAAF from 1999 to his early retirement in 2015, where he ended his career.

21
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
According to the email, Ed additionally came from an engineering background, worked with the Department of Energy, and served at the Pentagon for seven years.

22
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The email accurately breaks down Ed's service record, three years at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, three years at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, and five years at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

23
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In 2006, Ed was sent to Edwards AFB for the base's test pilot school.

24
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It was here Ed would claim pilots at the Air Force Base are trained for unacknowledged special access programs using reverse engineered non-human technology.

25
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Side note, Edwards is well known for its prolific and prestigious test pilot school.

26
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This highly selective program trains pilots, navigators, and engineers on experimental flight platforms.

27
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Originating from the Air Force Material Command's 412th test wing, the test pilot school's mission is to, quote,

28
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
conduct full-spectrum tests and evaluations of aerospace weapons, and to be the world's premier educational and training center for theoretical and applied flight test engineering, end quote.

29
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
An additional point, the test pilot school originated out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base during World War II.

30
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
During his time at Edwards, after graduating the USAAF's highly selective test pilot school,

31
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ed would serve as the head of an electronic warfare group that tested NHI reverse engineered technology.

32
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
In this role, Ed claimed to serve as the intermediary between engineers who had direct reporting to him and test pilots when, quote,

33
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
they had a manned craft they were testing, end quote.

34
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Interesting to point out here, according to the email, Ed agrees with Dr. Greer's stance on free energy systems from direct first-hand involvement in various projects.

35
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A little bit of context here, since the late 90s, early 2000s, Greer has highlighted issues of suppressed technologies and systems levied from the reverse engineering of off-world technologies.

36
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
These technologies are famously referred to as zero-point energy systems.

37
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
To quote the 2001 disclosure document, quote,

38
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Zero-point energy systems essentially generate energy by tapping into the ever-present quantum vacuum energy state,

39
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
the baseline energy from which all energy and matter is fluxing.

40
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
All matter and energy is supported by this baseline energy state and it can be tapped through unique electromagnetic circuits and configurations

41
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
to generate huge amounts of energy from spacetime all around us.

42
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
These are not perpetual motion machines, nor do they violate the laws of thermodynamics.

43
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
They merely tap an ambient energy field all around us to generate energy, end quote.

44
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Zero-point and free energy systems are not the topic of today's video, so I recommend reading The Hunt for Zero-point by author Nick Cook,

45
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Jesse Michael's video Aerospace Secret Search for Anti-Gravity, or even Greer's 2023 documentary The Lost Century and How to Reclaim It.

46
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And it is interesting and worth noting that this internal disclosure project email states Ed is in complete agreement with Greer's stance on free energy.

47
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Ed isn't the only witness to comment on zero-point systems either.

48
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Take redacted entry 10747 for example, who is stated to be an ex-chairman and VP of a well-known corporation.

49
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I have high conviction this company is General Electric.

50
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
According to Greer, 10747 has, quote,

51
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Huge details and testimony regarding free energy and the military-industrial complex cover-up, slash, suppression of these technologies.

52
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No several people killed and scared to death, end quote.

53
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Towards the end of our witness testimony internal email, mention is made Ed had been tracking current legislation relating to legacy program member Amnesty,

54
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and would be willing to testify to Arrow as long as Kirkpatrick was removed from the organization because, according to Ed,

55
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
the good doctor, quote, is an insider and is meant to squash information, end quote.

56
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is indeed a very charged statement and one I am sure many UFO investigators will agree with based off the actions of Sean Kirkpatrick.

57
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And the way you combat conspiracy theories and the associated misunderstandings that fuel them is in fact in science and truth.

58
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So if you've got evidence for a conspiracy, then that helps to investigate what the underlying truth is.

59
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There has been none that has been substantiated for this.

60
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And everything that has been brought to our attention and everything that was brought to my attention when I was in that position as the director,

61
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
we investigated and discovered that it did not come from where they thought it came from.

62
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Most everything was explainable through other documentation, other programs, other people that had talked to other people.

63
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It goes without saying Dr. K has very little goodwill with the public.

64
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like the lies and half-hearted debunks in the Arrow Historical Report Volume 1 or Arrow's 2022 contracts with Sandcorp, a company built to plug whistleblower leaks.

65
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I have even made an entire video on Sean Kirkpatrick and his disinformation,

66
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
which is at this point somewhat outdated as it covered little of Kirkpatrick's role as an unpaid consultant after leaving Arrow.

67
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So let's briefly cover a new revelation that supports Ed's accusations of the doctor injecting misinformation into the public.

68
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, in a recent U.S. Space Command FOIA release by Twitter user tag underscore om,

69
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
we can find a January 2023 meeting scheduled by Dr. Kirkpatrick involving U.S. Spacecom and senior U.S. Joint Command staff.

70
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The purpose of this meeting was, quote, UAP response and recovery and material transfer, end quote.

71
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The witness testimony document gives us a brief overview of Ed, his background and motives,

72
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
but our next document is where our true research can begin.

73
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This two-page set of notes roughly covers a phone conversation between Dr. Greer and Ed on November 25th, 2023.

74
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Not only do these notes describe Ed's testimony in depth,

75
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
but also break down his military career by year and station.

76
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The document is absolutely worth going through line by line.

77
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Off the bat, Ed asked Greer if he has threatened legal action against Lockheed and Boeing,

78
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
as Ed was read into programs overlapping these two companies.

79
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
At the beginning of his Air Force career, Ed did indeed work with Lockheed as a range technical contractor in the early 2000s at Nellis Air Force Base,

80
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
along with some other smaller specialized contractors.

81
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
However, there is no mention of Boeing to the best of my knowledge in his work history.

82
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Publicly, we can find myriad projects and current job openings for work between Lockheed and Nellis Air Force Base,

83
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
but there are a few of extreme interest here.

84
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Check out this Lockheed Martin case study titled, The Importance of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance,

85
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
in which the contractor was tasked with updating the system used by USAAF Warfare Center for Intelligence, Collection and Processing.

86
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Lockheed Martin reconfigured a two-phase security classification system used by the National Geospatial Intelligence System,

87
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
yes, the same agency Crush was a part of when liaison to the UAP Task Force,

88
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and the same agency recently mentioned by respected journalist Chris Sharpe as participating in undersea UAP crash retrievals.

89
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The system was implemented to Combined Air and Space Operations Center at Nellis Air Force Base,

90
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
which is tasked with processing information for exploitation of time-sensitive targets.

91
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I can't help but speculate here.

92
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Although this Lockheed project arose from challenges in the Nellis Red Flag Advanced Aerial Combat Training Exercise,

93
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
could such systems be used to monitor UAP and UAP crash retrievals?

94
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The idea Ed was right into UAP programs at Nellis Air Force Base as a First Lieutenant from 1999 to 2002

95
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
can possibly be reinforced later in the notes where Greer states Ed was briefed at Area 51 S4,

96
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
where quote, a major said they had caught slash captured lots of aircraft, end quote.

97
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This small point will later become even more interesting as we learn that Area 51 Groom Lake Facility

98
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
is administered by a detachment from Edwards Air Force Base, California,

99
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
the base where Ed would transfer to and conduct the bulk of his first-hand work around UAP programs.

100
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Ed states this briefing was conducted via a 30-minute video which showed inspection aircraft that were essentially invisible.

101
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Inspection craft, what exactly does this mean?

102
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Is Ed referring to crash retrievals or possibly alien reproduction vehicles, ARVs, for inspection use only?

103
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This reminds me closely of the story of Mark McCandlish, whose close friend Brad Sorensen allegedly saw three ARVs

104
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
titled flux liners that were available for cleared personnel to inspect,

105
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
with paneling removed to highlight hardware of the craft.

106
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The line these craft were essentially invisible further supports this thesis,

107
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
as I have covered first-hand witnesses before that have discussed ARV craft with cloaking mechanisms,

108
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
craft that look identical to the flux liner highlighted by McCandlish.

109
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
In an interesting detail, according to Sorensen and McCandlish,

110
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
these ARVs were shown at Norton Air Force Base, a mere 80 miles from Edwards Air Force Base.

111
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If you're unfamiliar with the testimony of Mark McCandlish, have no fear, I will cover it soon,

112
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
as I believe it is one of the most impactful testimonies in all of ufology.

113
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Greer goes on to state that at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, Ed worked at building 200,

114
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
under the redacted name of the first commander of the 98th Range Wing.

115
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Now, let's break this down.

116
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The 98th Range Wing, now called the Nevada Test and Training Range, began operations in 2001,

117
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and serves as the primary military training area for the Nellis Air Force Base complex.

118
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
To quote Yousaf,

119
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The NTTR is the largest contiguous air and ground space available for peacetime military operations in the free world.

120
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The range occupies 2.9 million acres of land, 5,000 square miles of airspace,

121
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
which is restricted from civilian air traffic overflight.

122
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The Nevada Test and Training Range NTTR provides the warfighter a flexible, realistic, and multi-dimensional battle space

123
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to conduct testing tactics development and advanced training in support of U.S. national interests

124
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
while also conducting Department of Energy testing, research, and development.

125
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The NTTR coordinates operational and support matters with major commands, other services, DOE,

126
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and Department of Interior, as well as other federal, state, and local government agencies.

127
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The NTTR acts as the single point of contact for range customers.

128
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Analyzing the NTTR and its mission to create, operate, and maintain live and synthetic environments

129
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and integrate partners to optimize warfighter capabilities,

130
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
this location sounds like an ideal choice for DOD and USG elements alongside contractors to test reverse-engineered technology.

131
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
To top it off, the NTTR South Range contains Groom Lake Area 51, a location deeply entwined with ufology.

132
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
His time at Building 200 at the NTTR may have seen Ed interact with Boeing, Lockheed Martin,

133
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
alongside the DOE, which I mentioned I could find no record of in his resume.

134
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Circling back to the call notes, Greer made specific note to Ed serving under the first commander,

135
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
right around 2001, of the 98th Range Wing, or NTTR.

136
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I have tried at length and failed to find the original commander of the 98th,

137
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
but I would like to take a long hard look at the commander from 2005 to 2007, Colonel Christopher Have.

138
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I find this analysis necessary, as Ed may have implied the 98th commander has oversight to UAP reverse engineering programs.

139
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Colonel Have spent 26 years in the Air Force linked to key roles in fighter aviation.

140
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
His post-service resume is of heavy interest here.

141
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Following the Air Force and its service in the 98th Range Wing,

142
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Have directed global trade controls at Boeing in Washington DC,

143
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
handling trade policy and technology licensing within major government departments.

144
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Have additionally led a team at Raytheon Technologies, another defense contractor implicated with UAP study.

145
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Here the Colonel managed relationships with key USG officials,

146
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
such as the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other military departments,

147
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
aligning Raytheon strategies within government objectives.

148
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The Colonel also served as a special advisor on national security affairs to then Vice President Dick Cheney,

149
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
who has seen swirls of rumors recently implicating Cheney as a senior member of UFO programs,

150
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
where Have offered insights on foreign defense capabilities.

151
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Have's resume, as well as his role as commander of the 98th Range Wing,

152
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
offers us a glimpse at a possible reverse engineering program official.

153
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And speaking of the NTTR, in Greer's notes we can find a simple sentence,

154
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
quote, Ed saw man-made craft on the range. Was there quite a bit, end quote.

155
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
With strong conviction, we can assume the range in question here is the NTTR.

156
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
From this statement, we can also gauge that Ed is claiming Area 51 slash S4

157
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and or Nellis Air Force Base has successful man-made reverse engineered craft.

158
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Greer then comments on Ed being sent to Edwards Air Force Base in California in 2006

159
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
for range orientation, where Ed would go on to serve as director of redacted

160
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
for an electronic warfare group.

161
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Referencing the witness testimony document, we can assume this director role was a test director

162
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
for a technology reverse engineering group.

163
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We can also assume from witness testimony this station followed Ed's service in Edwards Test Pilot School.

164
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What bolsters these claims from Ed is the fact Edwards Electronic Warfare Group stems from the 412th Test Wing,

165
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
the exact same wing that houses the Edwards-USAF Test Pilot School.

166
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If Ed's testimony is true, the 412th Test Wing out of Edwards directly deals with the testing of

167
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
reverse engineered craft and technology of non-human origin.

168
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This would also mean the 412th Reverse Engineering Program works in conjunction with the Nevada Test and Training Range.

169
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
This is one of the biggest takeaways of this entire research project.

170
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If his testimony is true, Ed was briefed on UAP programs at S4 while stationed at Nellis,

171
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
where he was then sent to the 412th Test Pilot School and Test Wing to further this work in an Air Force Legacy

172
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
UFO program as a test director.

173
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The documents state Ed served at Nellis until 2002 and was then sent to Edwards in 2006.

174
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Where was Ed during this gap?

175
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This period of time 2002-2005 saw Ed stationed at Hanscom Air Force Base near Boston, Massachusetts.

176
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Greer writes that Ed worked with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while at Hanscom,

177
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
working on foreign military assets but only saw terrestrial craft.

178
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This mention of MIT is still of great interest to us.

179
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I have talked before about the involvement of UARC or University Affiliated Research Centers with UAP programs many times.

180
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Most recently with Dr. Eric A. Walker, head of Penn State's UARC, the Applied Research Laboratory,

181
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
who admitted he was involved in the Kecksburg UFO crash incident.

182
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Well, MIT has their own UARC operating under the U.S. Army as well,

183
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies whose goal is to

184
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
discover and field technologies that dramatically improve the protection,

185
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
survivability, and mission capabilities of the warfighter and of warfighter-supporting platforms and systems.

186
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The only mention I can find of a relation between Hanscom and UAP

187
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
is an anonymous letter sent to Leonard Stringfield dated March 14, 1975,

188
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
which claimed to recount the testimony of one Colonel Sims, a pseudonym.

189
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
According to the letter, both Hanscom and MIT are two of the military bases and research laboratories

190
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
that perform UFO operations, alongside Edwards, Wright-Patterson, Carswell, Los Alamos, Sandia, etc.

191
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay, so, Ed served at Edwards from 2006 to 2010, where he was allegedly formally

192
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
read into multiple quote-unquote advanced aircraft programs at Edwards.

193
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The use of the word formal here is quite interesting, almost like Ed's time at Nellis saw him getting

194
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
bits and pieces of program information while his role as test director saw a complete briefing.

195
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This echoes numerous claims that UAP reverse engineering programs are as if not more compartmentalized

196
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
than the Manhattan atomic bomb project.

197
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Greer writes in 2008, when director of a redacted program, Ed was part of a Go Public plan via the Air Force.

198
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The plan was called off in 2009 to 2010 and saw Ed move to the Pentagon.

199
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The killing of the program was done by a two-star general.

200
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Now, I have found no confirming evidence of this so-called Go Public plan,

201
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
but I have found a series of USAAF two-star generals, aka major generals,

202
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
that either retired as major generals or were at the time period of interest that may give us an answer.

203
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
One prime suspect is Major General Thomas K. Anderson, who reached the rank of major general in 2009 and retired in 2013.

204
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Anderson's senior role oversaw him serving as commander of the Curtis E. LeMay Center for Doctrine Development and Education.

205
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
To quote the Air Force, quote,

206
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The center is responsible for the research, development, and production of Air Force doctrine

207
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and input for joint and multinational doctrine development activities, end quote.

208
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
General Anderson oversaw numerous key positions within DoD, such as the Air Staff,

209
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Joint Staff, Combat Command Staffs, NATO, and Chief of Staff and Director of Intelligence for US Strategic Command.

210
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Let us also inspect Major General Eugene Haas, who served as brigadier general during our window 2009-2010,

211
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
before being promoted to major general in 2012.

212
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Haas served as vice commander Air Force Special Operations Command from 2009-2011.

213
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Haas additionally acted as director for force structure, requirements, resources, and strategic assessment as a J-8.

214
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Haas commanded my interest due to his extremely prestigious role within DoD and stationed at two Air Force bases

215
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
allegedly connected to UAP programs, MacDill Air Force Base and Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

216
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Moving on, I would like to look at Major General Casey D. Blake, who earned his major generalship in 2015

217
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and served as a colonel during Ed's alleged disclosure plan.

218
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Not only did General Blake work as commander to Air Force Installation's contracting agency of Assistant Secretary

219
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
of the Air Force for Acquisition at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio,

220
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
but his most senior position saw Blake as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Contracting

221
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Air Force for Acquisition in Washington, D.C.

222
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Here he was responsible for quote, all aspects of contracting relating to the acquisition of weapon systems,

223
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
logistics, and operational support for the Air Force and quote, overseen support of $826 billion annually.

224
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Although Blake may have been a colonel during this plan, he piqued my interest as during 2008 he served as director

225
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
program acquisitions, defense procurement, and acquisition policy in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense

226
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics for the Pentagon.

227
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
There are a total of four other major generals of interest here including C. Donald Alston, H. Brent Blake Senior,

228
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Randy A. Key, but I want to lastly focus on Major General Christopher P. Ozzano.

229
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Ozzano did not earn his major generalship until 2019, meaning during 2009 to 2010,

230
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
he is the least likely candidate to have decision-making power over a disclosure campaign, however.

231
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
His early career dovetails almost identically with that of Ed and is worth mentioning.

232
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
In the year 2000, Ozzano attended USAAF Test Pilot School at, you guessed it, Edwards.

233
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
In the early 2010s, the general would command the 412th Operations Group at Edwards,

234
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
before serving as the commander of the Air Force Test Center at Edwards.

235
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
At his senior station, Ozzano oversaw a $31 billion enterprise comprising of more than 19,000 military, civilian,

236
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and contractor personnel across Edwards, Egland, and Arnold AFBs.

237
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Greer makes special note to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,

238
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
the infamous location we have discussed in almost every single video I have ever done.

239
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
According to Ed, Wright-Patterson has a tight connection with Edwards.

240
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Ed even makes an educated guess Wright-Patt's Hangar 6, specifically held by Logix.

241
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
According to internal Wright-Patt documents, Hangar 6 was initially,

242
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
quote, primarily used by the Signal Corps for installing radios and antennas,

243
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and after the war it became a facility for retrofitting and modifying planes.

244
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The hangar featured several smaller doors instead of a giant hangar door,

245
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
which would later be used as the Wright Field Fitness Center.

246
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
However, the fitness center is located in Hangar 22, not Hangar 6 at Wright-Patt.

247
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Besides blueprints and images of the exterior,

248
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I can find almost zero internal images, reports, or articles in general on Hangar 6.

249
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
This facility will be a priority of my research moving forward,

250
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
especially analyzing for infrastructure to support living and or deceased biologics, as Ed has claimed.

251
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
From 2010 to 2015, following the failed coming forward plan,

252
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Ed moved to the Pentagon where, according to Greer, he operated within research and development panel chain.

253
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Little was discussed between Greer and Ed on his responsibilities at the Pentagon.

254
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
However, one interesting note is recorded, quote,

255
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
$34 billion, then $40 billion to non-Air Force authorization, non-Blue TOA, end quote.

256
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
TOA meaning Transfer of Authority.

257
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
This statement seemingly confirms statements made over the decades by numerous whistleblowers

258
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
discussing UAP programs being funded through USAP off-book black operations.

259
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I will draw your attention to December 11, 2017,

260
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
where former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Catherine Austin-Fitz,

261
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
published a paper titled Black Budget of the United States.

262
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Here she discussed $21 trillion found in unauthorized spending

263
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
in the Department of Defense and Housing and Urban Development Centers between 1998 and 2015.

264
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Soon after publication, the DOD announced its first ever department-wide independent audit.

265
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Fitz personally believed some unauthorized funding was utilized for domestic clandestine military R&D,

266
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
some of which was illegal UAP programs from DOD.

267
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The primary testimony of Ed involves first-hand work on UAP programs

268
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
focused on the testing of reverse-engineered non-human technology at Nellis Air Force Base

269
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
slash Area 51 S4 and the 412th test group out of Edwards Air Force Base, California.

270
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
As we have discussed before, numerous factors, including Ed being briefed at S4

271
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and then sent to the 412th for test pilot school before becoming Director of the Electronic Warfare Group,

272
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
where he acted as the intermediary between engineers and test pilots

273
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and the 412th test group had manned craft to test,

274
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
we can conclude with high confidence Ed's work revolved primarily around the utilization of NHI tech

275
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
to construct and test ARV or alien reproduction vehicles.

276
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Area 51 S4 has been discussed in ufology for decades

277
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and is often immediately associated with the claims of Bob Lazar.

278
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But what about Edwards?

279
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Are there any other stories of UAP programs at the Californian base

280
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
that can support or detract from Ed's claims?

281
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Well, for starters, we can go all the way back to 1957

282
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
to the testimony of Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper.

283
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Cooper claimed while stationed as a project manager at Edwards Air Force Base,

284
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
a group of photographers assigned to photograph remote positions of the base

285
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
observed a large, strange-looking craft above a lake bed.

286
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Cooper's crew began taking films of the craft,

287
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and according to Cooper, the craft was, quote,

288
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
hovering above the ground and then it slowly came down

289
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and sat on the lake bed for a few minutes, end quote.

290
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The camera crew estimated the object to be about 30 feet in diameter,

291
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
shiny silver in color, and featured three landing gear.

292
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The crew got within 20 yards of the craft before it departed.

293
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Cooper did, in fact, see the film, but stated the evidence was confiscated.

294
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And this is a very brief summary of the story,

295
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
as I would love to cover it further in great detail.

296
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Well, I was having some cameramen film the installation of a precision landing facility

297
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
that we were putting in right on the edge of the dry lake,

298
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
and this saucer flew right over him and put down three little gear

299
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and landed out on the dry lake bed.

300
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And they went out there, picked up their cameras and moved on out toward him filming,

301
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and he lifted off, put the gear back in the well,

302
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
climbed out at a very high rate of speed and disappeared.

303
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And so while I was going through all the regulation books

304
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and finding out the number to call and watching them report it,

305
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I had them go over and develop the film.

306
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
By the time they got back with the developed film,

307
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I was on the higher and higher and higher level officer talking to me,

308
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
finally with the colonel telling me to, you know,

309
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
when the film arrived at my desk to put it in the carrier pouch,

310
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
there would be a carrier there at my office by that time already,

311
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and they'd arranged for him to fly in our base airplane back to Washington with these films,

312
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and do not run prints, etc., etc., etc.

313
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So we stuck them in the carrier pouch.

314
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Did you watch the film?

315
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We didn't have a chance to run it.

316
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I had a chance to hold it up to the window and look at it.

317
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It was certainly a good film.

318
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Good close-up shots.

319
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Good close-up shots.

320
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
In 1972, we can find Project Outgrowth out of the USAAF Rocket Propulsion Lab at Edwards.

321
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
A document titled Advanced Propulsion Concepts Project Outgrowth

322
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
sees discussion of an anti-gravity program and theoretical material

323
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
to change the direction and amplitude of gravitational fields.

324
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Similarly, in 1988, a technical report submitted under contract

325
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
with the USAAF Aeronautics Lab out of Edwards

326
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
discusses the exploration of the Bifield-Brown effect explored at length by Jesse Michaels,

327
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
which allegedly converts electrostatic energy into propulsion.

328
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Around the same year, 1988, Defense Contractor Science Applications International Corporation, SAIC,

329
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
a defense contractor I have directly implicated in the study of off-world technologies,

330
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
studied similar electronic propulsion mechanisms for Edwards Air Force Base.

331
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We can also look to 1990, where journalist Scott Williams wrote an article in Aviation Week

332
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
in which 45 sightings of aircraft accelerating from near-hovering positions to supersonic speeds

333
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
were seen over Edwards Air Force Base, George Air Force Base, and China Lake Naval Weapon Center.

334
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
One such craft was described as triangular in shape.

335
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But let's not forget the 1998 testimony of USAAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fausch

336
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I have covered numerous times who commented on the infamous TR-3B reverse-engineered triangular craft.

337
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Fausch claimed while working at the Defense Advanced Research Board in 1979

338
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
under the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Edwards,

339
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
a full anti-gravity propulsion system was developed and a secret space fleet utilized this technology.

340
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
If you haven't yet, please watch my video on Lockheed Martin,

341
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
as I discuss the Fausch case in much greater depth,

342
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
including his station at the proposed Defense Advanced Research Center.

343
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
While discussing the TR-3B craft,

344
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Fausch makes specific mention graduates from the 412th Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base

345
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
pilot these reverse-engineered craft.

346
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Many more enigmatic claims without direct evidence exist surrounding Edwards.

347
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The infamous base was mentioned myriad times

348
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
within Leonard Stringfield's crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7.

349
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
In UFO crash retrievals, The Inner Sanctum, Status Report 6,

350
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Stringfield makes mention of a Dr. Epigoni,

351
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
a pseudonym for a physicist who claimed to have worked closely with Oppenheimer, Einstein, and Teller.

352
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Epigoni stated in the late 60s, early 70s he worked on something called Project Heaven,

353
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
a special project at Edwards Air Force Base.

354
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
The doctor claimed a flying saucer and its crew had previously landed at Edwards.

355
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The craft was kept in a large hanger guarded tightly

356
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
whilst occupants were carted off to a secure building for evaluation.

357
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The 12 five-foot tall bodies clad in silvery metal suits featured eyes of one color,

358
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
a nose, a mouth, teeth, and blood similar to the appearance of oil.

359
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
To quote Epigoni,

360
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
They, the U.S. researchers, came to the conclusion that since there was no deterioration,

361
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
to leave them alone because another craft might come in the area and rejuvenate or reactivate them.

362
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The craft itself had no rivets, seams, or welding,

363
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and was of a classic saucer design with a dome on top measuring 40 feet in diameter.

364
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Other scientists informed Epigoni craft materials were made of materials they never dreamed could exist

365
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
and could not figure out a way to gain entry to the craft.

366
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Epigoni stated as of 1990, Project Blue Heaven was still active,

367
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
it was run by the DoD, and the Navy had two to three similar projects.

368
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The doctor's account is far more detailed,

369
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and I promise we will circle back to this testimony in future projects,

370
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
but the landing of this craft and seemingly inert bodies reminds me closely of the craft donation theory.

371
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
When you say crash retrieval, what do you mean?

372
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
These are retrieving, non-human origin, technical vehicles,

373
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
call it spacecraft if you will, non-human, exotic origin, vehicles that have either landed or crashed.

374
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
We have spacecraft from another species.

375
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We do, yeah.

376
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
How many?

377
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Quite a number.

378
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The strangest detail of this testimony is the claim the craft touched down,

379
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
the beans walked out of the craft, and laid on the ground.

380
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's worth noting, and Stringfield commented on this too,

381
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Epigoni changed the body count from 12 to 4.

382
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
According to Stringfield and his fellow investigator,

383
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
they, quote, agreed that it appeared that he had consulted with his superiors,

384
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and was advised to alter certain key details, end quote.

385
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Also in 1991, Status Report 6, Stringfield recounts his discussions

386
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
with a first-hand witness to a UFO crash retrieval 15 miles outside of Edwards in 1971.

387
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
According to witness Debbie Clayton,

388
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
her and her girlfriend's family investigated a crash from the sky in broad daylight.

389
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Reaching the craft site, Debbie observed an acorn-shaped craft

390
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
with an extremely similar description to the Kexberg crash.

391
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Quote, we searched for markings, but found only some old scratches that we could not read.

392
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Because it was upright, we couldn't see the bottom.

393
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
There were no windows or seams, appearing to be made from a one-piece mold.

394
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
If I remember correctly, it was a dark grayish color with greenish highlights,

395
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
not a color one normally sees.

396
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
There was a mild heat coming from the craft, somewhat like a car engine after traveling for an hour.

397
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
One more thing I thought was strange, there was no dust that clung to the shell.

398
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Here in the desert, dust is everywhere and clings to everything, end quote.

399
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
According to Debbie, an Air Force car and truck arrived within 14 minutes

400
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
where men with rifles ordered civilians off scene.

401
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Lastly, I want to cover an excerpt Michael Schrat discovered in the files of the late Stringfield,

402
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
which may allow us to directly connect Edwards to operating ARV and NHI craft alongside Area 51 S4.

403
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
In a letter dated April 5, 1980, one Mr. D. L. Dobbs discussed one M.H.,

404
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
a witness identity Schrat chose not to disclose.

405
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
M.H. had allegedly performed radio maintenance at the Atomic Proving Ground in Nevada

406
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
during 1961 to 1963 along with top secret radio work for USAF.

407
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
According to M.H., he participated in a top secret operation at Area 51 titled Project Red Light.

408
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Test flights were conducted on a recovered UFO shipped from none other than Edwards Air Force Base.

409
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
The craft was not conventionally powered and stayed silent during operation.

410
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Security was so tight on the project, program personnel were rotated every six months.

411
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
M.H. claimed to have heard rumors of a West Coast American defense contractor

412
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
encountering difficulties in many of the components comprising the craft.

413
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And lastly guys, I want to cover a possible connection between reverse engineering programs at Edwards and Nellis slash Area 51.

414
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
In July of 1991, an alleged classified NRO document leaked to the public.

415
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
This document informed need-to-know groups and operations about civilian flying saucer organizations organizing protests in Nevada.

416
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Stephen Greer claimed to have given the document to Admiral Thomas Wilson from the Wilson Davis Memo,

417
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
which at the very least we can confirm the meeting between Greer and Wilson.

418
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Allegedly, Wilson told Greer he recognized one of the entities listed and that it was run by a contractor.

419
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Addressed in this document includes Royal Ops, Cosmic Ops, Mag Ops, Magi Ops,

420
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:31,000
multiple USAP Special Forces Divisions in the 26th, 64th, 65th, 527th, Nellis AFOSI, Groom Lake, and Dreamland Area 51 S4,

421
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
AquaTech and SeaSpray Special Operations Group, and one Blackjack team.

422
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
According to Dr. Stephen Greer, inside sources including a source inside Blackjack Control told him of two entities,

423
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Blackjack Control and Blackjack Team.

424
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Blackjack Control is allegedly a Nellis-based facility participating in reverse engineering

425
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
while Blackjack Team operates in conjunction with Control but is stationed at Edwards Air Force Base.

426
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So, but the key facilities I want to go through, and there are others, this is a list that I've updated,

427
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I updated it for the president in 2009. A very chief one is Edwards Air Force Base,

428
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
and there's a whole constellation there, Haystack Butte, China Lakes, George Air Force Base,

429
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
they retired Norton Air Force Base, Tabletop Mountain Observatory, which is run ostensibly by NASA,

430
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and Blackjack Control. So I had a source at Blackjack Control associated with the Edwards related facilities,

431
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:41,000
but the Blackjack Team you saw on that list was Nellis. So there's Blackjack Control and Blackjack Team.

432
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I can find almost nothing publicly available to research on Blackjack besides a late 2010s, early 2020s project

433
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
between DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project, and defense contractors owned by Raytheon.

434
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Project Blackjack was, quote, intended to develop and demonstrate critical elements of a global high-speed network

435
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
in low Earth orbit that satisfied DoD performance and payload requirements at a much lower cost,

436
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
with shorter design cycles, and with easier and more frequent technology upgrades, end quote.

437
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Seen as the alleged NRO document dates back to 1991, I doubt these two Blackjacks connect.

438
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
What's going on guys, it's UAPGirb, and I'd like to thank each and every single one of you for joining me today

439
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
as we took a deep dive into Ed's witness testimony.

440
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Now, I know I discussed this a multitude of times throughout today's video,

441
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
but I'd like to reiterate today's thesis once more for a final time.

442
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Analyzing Ed's credible witness testimony, conclusions can be drawn of a joint reverse engineering program

443
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
focused on craft of non-human intelligence existing between Edwards Air Force Base, California,

444
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
and Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, slash Area 51 S4.

445
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
This program stems out of the 412th test group comprising the Edwards-USAF Test Pilot School

446
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
and Edwards 412th Electronics Warfare Group.

447
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Now, this research was some of the most enticing, exciting, and interesting I have done

448
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
since working on the Off-World Technologies Division, and I would like to compare these two testimonies.

449
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The Off-World Technologies Division and the technology here focused more on singular pieces of technology

450
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and almost weapons as described by RA.

451
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Now, it was interesting to see the juxtaposition between this Air Force testimony

452
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
as the Air Force plants in conjunction with Lockheed Martin Boeing and possibly other contractors

453
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
actually work on the piloting and utilization of reverse engineered craft.

454
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Whether these craft are triangular in shape, the classic TR-3B as proposed by Fausch,

455
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
or possibly the flux liner classic saucer shape as proposed by Mark McCandalish

456
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
that were allegedly housed at Norton Air Force Base 1988, I'm not sure. Perhaps it's both.

457
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
But the line that Fausch states that these pilots commanded the reverse engineered TR-3Bs

458
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
out of Edwards Air Force Base Pilot Test School jumped out to me after covering him so closely

459
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and so long ago in my Lockheed Martin video.

460
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
This research was fascinating. I wish we could find out a little more on Ed's time at the Pentagon.

461
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
All we really have to go off there is the $34 billion and then $40 billion missing in transfer of authorization funds,

462
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
off-book funds. This can possibly support Greer's and other people's thesis that many of these programs

463
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
are funded through black budget operations.

464
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I know that this program at Edwards, Edwards is a very populous base, so if this reverse engineering program

465
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
is indeed real, this must be kept to an exclusively small number of personnel in an exclusively small area.

466
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Who knows? Perhaps Edwards is connected to underground facilities in this region.

467
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I know Greer likes to say that the Ant Hill facility he posted a picture of recently

468
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:04,000
in the Hellendale facility, our dumb location, so possibly this is a kind of a connected area in which craft are stored.

469
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
After hearing Ed's testimony, what do you guys think? I would like nothing more than to speak to Ed firsthand

470
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and hear all this information from himself, but unfortunately he has gone off books.

471
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
There is no way to contact this individual, whether by phone, social media, or email, and believe me, I have tried.

472
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So, if Greer is right and this individual has testified revealing information he knows,

473
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
this testimony is indeed impactful beyond belief, but has he or is that one of Greer's embellishments? We don't know.

474
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I'd like more than anything to see this individual, Ed, before the Senate Intelligence Committee or at November's open hearings.

475
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Who knows? Maybe we'll be surprised to do so.

476
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,000
But let me know what you guys think about this alleged reverse engineering program at Edwards Air Force Base and Nellis Air Force Base Area 51.

477
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Again, if anybody has any other further research to let me know about this, I would love to know.

478
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I know that I drew a conclusion, I decided not to keep it in the video, about the Air Force Plant 42 near Palmdale sightings of Leight and Edwards.

479
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
These two facilities are only about 30 miles apart, which, you know, very interesting.

480
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I think Edwards and Norton are also only about 80 miles apart, so this whole complex is deeply entwined to both UFO sightings and testimonies of reverse engineering programs.

481
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I was also thrilled to be able to dive into the work of Leonard Stringfield and others to look at some more occasions.

482
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I know we researched the Debbie Clayton acorn-shaped craft 15 miles outside of Edwards that was immediately swarmed by Yusuf Khrou within 15 minutes.

483
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And the testimony of Dr. Epigoni, that one is very interesting, relating to the craft donation theory.

484
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,000
If you don't know what that is, certain individuals like David Grush have discussed that some retrievals of UAP are not crash retrievals.

485
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
These craft are just found left unattended.

486
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
This story reminded closely of the alleged 1957 Holloman Air Force Base landing in which a flying saucer touched down at Holloman Air Force Base

487
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
and occupants walked out of the craft to interact with Yusuf personnel.

488
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
In Epigoni's case, these beings walked out of the craft and laid down on the ground and seemingly turned themselves off,

489
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
which could possibly attest to the theory of biological robots, essentially, as many people like to call the grays.

490
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
There will be further research that needs to be done on Blackjack Team and Blackjack Control.

491
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
This just rang a note in my head from that 1991 alleged NRO document, but more research needs to be done here.

492
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Thus far, I can find no connections between DARPA, really.

493
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But this, to me, is the jumping off point of researching Yusuf legacy and contractor reverse engineering programs,

494
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
possibly housed at contractor sites, possibly housed at Air Force Base locations.

495
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So let me know what you guys think. I really appreciate everybody joining me today.

496
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Please remember to like and subscribe, share these videos around.

497
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I got a Patreon if you want to join. I don't charge for any extra content. I don't gatekeep content.

498
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
All of my research is free for anybody to consume.

499
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I only have the Patreon if you want to support what you think the channel's worth.

500
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
But guys, I have some awesome upcoming other projects on ARVs or alien reproduction vehicles,

501
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
including a deep dive on Mark McCandlish, which I hope to do soon.

502
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I know that's been highly requested and I cannot wait to do so.

503
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So without further ado, guys, I want to thank you all again for joining me.

504
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And very soon we'll be back up with another show.

505
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So thank you very much, guys, and I'll catch you all later. Bye.
