1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Well, I had contacted Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,280
Agency in the United States, deputy director at CIA, director of naval intelligence and

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,200
a variety of intelligence posts, a technologist and clearly someone that if this was really

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,520
accurate, that there really were UFOs and non-human intelligence around, this is a man

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,860
who had to know.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,780
So I was able to contact him thanks to a contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here in the

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:36,100
UK and this conversation, he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,700
under national secrecy laws, but that the United States government did in fact have

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,980
possession of the hardware associated with this. In other words, this was an actual physical

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,980
phenomenon as a craft, a spaceship, several of them and they were in operational condition.

11
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:05,780
The particular incident we were involved in, we were just under a mile and a half of water

12
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,780
in North Atlantic. What had happened, they had picked up a, there's a survey vehicle

13
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,780
working in the North Atlantic that had picked up some radioactive signal. It was almost

14
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,780
a perfect symmetric piece of metal with a marking around the edge and it was just a

15
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:42,020
triangular shape, but no glass, nothing that would appear to be a nuclear weapon.

16
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:49,020
From Roswell in 1947 to Jake Barber in 2024, on this channel we have discussed extensively

17
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,060
UFO crash retrieval operations performed by UFO legacy programs involving the United States

18
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,020
Army and Air Force. Over the past decades, these retrievals are alleged to have occurred

19
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,060
over the continental United States, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, the former Soviet Union, China

20
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,780
and numerous lands around the globe. In several US incidents, rapid reaction response teams

21
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,320
are detailed to fly in via helicopter, drive in via flatbed truck or utilize any vehicle

22
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,120
system to retrieve non-human craft and transport them to clandestine above and below ground

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,760
military installations. But what about retrieval operations that must be conducted in the oceans

24
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,880
of our planet? What happens when UFOs crash into water or USOs, unidentified submerged

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,440
objects must be recovered? How are such operations conducted in the most mysterious corners of

26
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,680
our planet where only roughly 26% of our oceans floors have been mapped? This would of course

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,600
require the most powerful seafaring military on the planet, the United States Navy, and

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,160
some measurable special access programs, internal intelligence offices, corporate

29
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,560
programs and partnerships with shadowy US intelligence apparatuses. But does the Navy

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,760
just retrieve UFOs and USOs in our water? Or do they, like many retrieval instances

31
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,080
we have covered on this channel involving the Army and Air Force, additionally engage

32
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,320
in storage, exploitation and reverse engineering of technologies of unknown origin? For this

33
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,600
reason, I want to dive in and explore the MODIS operandi, operational history and key

34
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,200
players in US UFO Navy legacy programs. From the research we will explore in this project,

35
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,800
I theorize naval UFO programs can be delegated to four major components of operation, monitor,

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,300
collect, store and exploit. These operations are likely conducted out of the Office of

37
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,000
Naval Research and Office of Naval Intelligence in conjunction with US Special Forces Command,

38
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,840
shadowy intelligence organizations like the highly secretive National Underwater Reconnaissance

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,960
Office and Navy Special Program, and involve US naval stations like NAWC China Lake and

40
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,520
NSWC Crane, while engaging with defense contractors and FFRDCs such as Lockheed Martin for utilization

41
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,100
of their now retired deep-submergence rescue vehicles Mystic and Avalon. This investigation

42
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,180
will explore in tremendous detail the three components of naval UFO programs I outlined

43
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:37,500
above, UFO and USO collection, NHI craft storage and technologies of unknown origin, TUO,

44
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,860
exploitation. One major cornerstone I theorize exists in naval UFO programs, monitor, will

45
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,580
be largely omitted from today's exploration. While the topic of possible undersea UFO bases

46
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,820
or installations is well worth investigating in the future, I have covered the topic of

47
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,820
USO reports twice already on this channel. These include discussion of OPNAV 3820, a

48
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,940
naval regulation restricting maritime UFO reporting. With that being said, let us look

49
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,860
beyond the veil to analyze naval UFO legacy programs.

50
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,060
Hey guys, it's UAP Grb and I am thrilled for you to join me today as we take a direct

51
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,460
investigation into UFO legacy programs under the United States Navy. We will direct our

52
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,260
focus on three key pillars relevant to today's discussion, collection, storage and exploitation

53
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,300
of non-human craft and technology. In this investigation, we will analyze the alleged

54
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,140
structure of naval UFO programs, study key figures associated with said programs, evaluate

55
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,740
a handful of incredibly intriguing USO retrieval cases, and identify naval installations alleged

56
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,940
to hold non-human craft and biologics.

57
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:57,380
I've been sitting on this information for quite a while now and I felt quite nervous

58
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:08,020
about it because the retrieval program undertaken by the CIA and elements of the US Navy is

59
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,440
probably one of the most tightly guarded secrets in the US government and those protecting

60
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,260
it can be quite nasty and I was warned about that.

61
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,500
On 20 September 2024, excellent UK-based journalist Christopher Sharpe in the Liberation

62
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,300
Times posted an article titled, quote, paradigm changing UFO transparency legislation fails

63
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,860
in Congress for second consecutive year. The piece discussed the unfortunate dismissal

64
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,780
of the UAP Disclosure Act in the fiscal year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act. This

65
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,180
exclusion of the UAPDA is another topic for another day as such bombshell legislation

66
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,500
could very well have begun the unraveling of UAP legacy program secrecy. The September

67
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,780
20 article pivots rapidly discussing multiple programs orchestrated by the CIA's Directorate

68
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,940
of Science and Technology and its Directorate of Operations, alongside Department of Defense

69
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,500
and Department of Energy components that have for decades bypassed democratic oversight

70
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,660
to retrieve advanced technologies of unknown origin. If this CIA DS&T sounds familiar to

71
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,020
you, it is likely because this CIA component has been accused on myriad occasions by Chris

72
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:24,420
Sharpe and Dr. Eric Davis as directly participating in and obfuscating data around UFO retrievals.

73
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,620
For example, Glenn Gaffney, former CIA DS&T Director, has been labeled as the gatekeeper

74
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,180
who ceased Lockheed Martin's attempts to divest UFO materials, likely the 1953 Kingman

75
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:42,060
Arizona crash, to the OSAT program in 2008. Additionally, former CIA DS&T Deputy Director

76
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,620
Doug Wolf aided in founding the CIA OGA, or Office of Global Access, in 2003. Wolf and

77
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,580
the OGA have been accused by Sharpe and others as participating in retrievals outside of

78
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:59,220
the United States with JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command. Anyways, the 20 September

79
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,540
Sharpe article proceeds to detail some truly startling revelations,

80
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,660
include the retrieval of objects from beneath the oceans, involving the CIA's Directorate

81
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:39,260
of Operations, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, coordinated between the CIA and U.S.

82
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,460
Navy, United States Special Operations Command, and submersibles from the Woods Hole Oceanographic

83
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,100
Institute. Additionally, the retrieval of objects on foreign soil is conducted with

84
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:55,180
the involvement of the CIA's Office of Global Access and Joint Special Operations Command.

85
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,780
Sharpe directly named military and intelligence organizations involved with ocean-based retrieval,

86
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,700
including two institutions almost never discussed, the Neuro-National Underwater Reconnaissance

87
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,540
Office and WHOI, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. But before we break down these

88
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,780
statements, I must detail the evolution of this article as it allows us to study, in

89
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:23,900
Chris Sharpe's own words, information detrimental to his safety. By 22 September 2024, the article

90
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:30,140
was revised, redacting all information about the Navy, Neuro, Woods Hole, NGA, NRO, JSOC,

91
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:37,820
etc. The new, bare-bones edition still discussed the CIA, DS&T, DOD, and DOE, but all true,

92
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,700
actionable data was stripped from the piece. Sharpe was accused by some Twitter users as

93
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,500
making quote-unquote stealth edits to remove information from the article, but he responded

94
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,700
by stating quote,

95
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,820
This is sourced information. There is a real, extremely dangerous reason little information

96
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,540
has been released about such programs. Content from the article was removed because of the

97
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,020
threats posed to me, end quote. By 25 September 2024, five days after the original posting,

98
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,060
Sharpe would once again edit the article and say quote,

99
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,020
Okay, so someone has recklessly put me at extreme risk, so I have updated last week's

100
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,620
article relating to the UAPDA, reverting back to details previously mentioned. This time,

101
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,980
the details are far more specific, so here it is, the alleged undersea retrieval program,

102
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,860
end quote. This third edit is quite similar to the first piece, but expands on multiple

103
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,300
departments and agencies named specialized assets and expertise to carry out undersea

104
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,140
craft retrievals. In this latest iteration, Sharpe states for operations, Woods Hole provided

105
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,060
deep submergence vehicles to quote,

106
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,260
Support retrieval efforts, end quote. Deep submerged rescue vehicles or DSRV will be

107
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,540
a crucial aspect of a USO retrieval operation covered much later on in this project. The

108
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,540
third iteration does powerfully claim the undersea craft or quote,

109
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,860
Transfer to the Office of Naval Research, which subsequently hands them over to defense

110
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,980
contractors for detailed analysis, end quote. From this article, we can extract a powerful

111
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,780
thesis, the US Navy works in conjunction with the CIA, DS&T, alongside JSOC or SOCOM forces,

112
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,940
intelligence agencies such as the NRO, NGA, and Shadowy Neuro, as well as defense RDT&E

113
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:25,100
facilities and private contractors to retrieve and store non-human craft found deep undersea.

114
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,220
But let's really break this down, analyzing the targeted role of the CIA's Office of Global

115
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,500
Access alongside JSOC in global soil-based craft retrievals, we can assume a similar

116
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,420
structure for undersea retrievals where the CIA, DS&T, serves as the logistics coordinator

117
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:47,180
while JSOC provides men-at-arms, industrial security, human intelligence, etc. In this

118
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,140
apparatus, the NRO and NGA would harness reconnaissance satellites to provide SIGINT

119
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,940
or signals intelligence to retrieval teams while the Shadowy National Underwater Reconnaissance

120
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,380
Office provides unknown methods of underwater reconnaissance. In such a system outlined by

121
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,500
SHARP, retrieval operations would be done in tandem with the US Navy and contractors such

122
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,020
as Lockheed Martin and their DSRV and Dry Submersible, as well as non-profit research

123
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,300
facilities such as Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and their many deep submergence vehicles.

124
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,820
Finally, in this hypothesized naval UFO program, craft would be taken to various Office of Naval

125
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,260
Research locations before being transferred to defense contractors to study. But in this program,

126
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:36,140
I do think SHARP is missing a key step here. Many speak on joint USG contractor UFO legacy programs,

127
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,180
but a cornerstone of my work has been discussing the missing intermediary, federally funded

128
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:47,020
research and development centers FFRDCs and university-affiliated research centers UARCs.

129
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,980
I will not bore returning viewers of these details, but I often speak on how these semi-private

130
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:59,020
government-controlled RDT and E-Centers act as liaison between USG slash DOD and US defense

131
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,940
contractors for UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation programs. Such institutions

132
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,620
would serve as subject matter experts and provide necessary R&D work on project materials.

133
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,380
This would in turn keep knowledge access and TUO programs quite strict, only allowing contractor

134
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,580
personnel with a need to know full insights into the full extent of the non-human materials on

135
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:27,980
which the programs focus. The Navy employs numerous UARCs and FFRDCs often entwined with

136
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,420
unacknowledged special access programs, special access programs, and controlled access programs.

137
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,940
Such UARCs include the Applied Physics Laboratories at Johns Hopkins University and the University

138
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,900
of Washington, as well as the Applied Research Laboratories at the Universities of Hawaii at

139
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,260
Manoa, University of Texas at Austin, and Pennsylvania State University. Penn State's

140
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:56,220
UARC was established in 1945 by Penn State President Dr. Eric A. Walker. Dr. Walker was

141
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,300
named by physicist and consultant to the DOD Research Board Dr. Robert Saarbacher as participating

142
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,860
in 1950s UFO retrieval and reverse engineering programs alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush. Walker

143
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:15,020
would be contacted by various UFO researchers in the 1980s and make some startling revelations,

144
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:21,020
not only admitting he himself was present at the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash,

145
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,620
but also claiming he knew of the Majestic 12 and to engage in UFO legacy programs one would

146
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:33,100
need to know about ESP, Extrasensory Perception. It is interesting how a former TRW board member

147
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,540
and founder of Penn State's UARC would essentially confess he was part of a UFO legacy program.

148
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:44,140
And by the way, as recently as 2013, the Office of Naval Research has displayed a keen interest

149
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,580
in studying ESP. The ONR would even publish a, quote, revolutionary program looking into

150
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,780
six cents among humans to train personnel on intuitive decision-making, end quote.

151
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,900
Additionally, according to the testimony of Randy Anderson, the Navy, specifically the Naval Surface

152
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,580
Warfare Center crane and contractor SAIC, has engaged in recovered technologies that respond

153
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,660
to human consciousness at the underground off-world technologies division. The Navy also engages in a

154
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,580
tremendous roster of programs with FFRDCs well worth our interest, primarily the Center for

155
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:23,340
Naval Analyses run by the CNA Corporation based out of Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia.

156
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,460
Returning viewers will recall how I recently implicated Crystal City and a likely massive

157
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:34,060
underground facility beneath a neighborhood in Pentagon as a major center for UFO legacy programs

158
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:41,420
SAPs and USAPs. Many of the acronyms Sharp listed in his work regarding undersea retrievals need

159
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:47,420
much further analysis. And as we move forward in this investigation, it is paramount to recognize

160
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,980
the Navy has indeed participated in at least one acknowledged USO retrieval operation. Recall the

161
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,460
1962 Bluegill Triple Prime detonation and subsequent UFO recovery discussed by late presidential

162
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,380
advisor Harold Malmgren. This event took place during Operation Fishbowl, a series of high-altitude

163
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:12,540
nuclear tests. The Bluegill Triple Prime nuclear test accidentally disabled a nearby UFO that

164
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:18,380
went careening into the waters below. The downed craft or quote-unquote pod was searched for and

165
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:24,300
recovered by the USS Safeguard. Historical logs from the Safeguard discuss the vessel alongside

166
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,140
others such as the USS Engage steaming to the water crash location, searching in a square grid

167
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:36,220
pattern and employing divers to recover a quote-unquote pod. During net recovery of this pod,

168
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,740
the Safeguard actually lost power and the pod was released for helicopter pickup. This is a

169
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:47,260
massively consequential case I would like to explore in more detail later on but let's continue

170
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:56,540
with this investigation. I would be willing to wager most watching this channel have heard of

171
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:03,660
the National Reconnaissance Officer NRO. The NRO is considered alongside the CIA, NSA, DIA,

172
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,500
and NGA to be one of the big five U.S. intelligence agencies. This agency within the

173
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,940
U.S. DOD has historically designed, built, launched, and operated reconnaissance satellites

174
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:20,620
providing signals intelligence to the NSA, imagery intelligence to the NGA, and measurement and

175
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:26,300
signature intelligence to the DIA. David Grush worked for both the NRO and NGA where he

176
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:33,260
additionally served as the intelligence agency's liaison to the UAP task force. Since 2023, the NRO

177
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:39,660
has had a provable program that tracks UAP, Project Sentient, uncovered in FOIA documents.

178
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,700
Sentient serves as a quote ongoing research and development program end quote that analyzes

179
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,860
satellite data with AI capabilities. The program was also tasked with analyzing UAP data such as

180
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,780
a 6 May 2021 incident where a small tic-tac object was detected. The Sentient report states

181
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:02,780
this tic-tac to be similar to other objects observed in redacted operating areas. In 2021,

182
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:08,140
the NRO contributed to the ODNI's or Office of the Director of National Intelligence's report

183
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,740
to Congressional Intelligence and Armed Services Committee on progress made by the UAP task force.

184
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,180
This discussion of the NRO and UFOs are interesting seen as they contradict a 2015

185
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,780
statement made by the NRO which stated that no documentation relating to UFOs and that the

186
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,300
topic was quote outside of the scope of NRO responsibilities. Furthermore, the NRO has

187
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:36,460
conducted numerous searches in the past and has located no records end quote. The NRO has of

188
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,140
course additionally been implicated in providing assistance for UFO crash retrieval operations.

189
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,700
These accusations have been made by Chris Sharpe discussed above and witnesses I have covered on

190
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:53,020
this channel numerous times including Stephen Greer witness A.H. as well as Youssef Master Sergeant

191
00:18:53,020 --> 00:19:00,220
Edgar Fouchet who claimed the NRO alongside the NSA and CIA managed the TR3B Reverse Engineer

192
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:07,020
Triangular Alien Reproduction Vehicle. A fascinating document allegedly released by the NRO surfaced in

193
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:13,180
1991. I have covered this document before in relation to Blackjack Control and Blackjack Team

194
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,060
a possible joint reverse engineering group out of Edwards Air Force Base in the Nevada Test and

195
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,260
Training Range. This document is again worth our attention because of the countless groups of

196
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:31,580
interest mentioned throughout. These include MagiOps, Red Flag MOC, Sea Spray SOG and Aquatec SOG.

197
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,460
Allegedly Stephen Greer gave this memo to Admiral Thomas Wilson from the Wilson Davis

198
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:43,340
Notes in a 1997 meeting. This meeting did occur this is not disputed however according to Greer

199
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,780
Wilson recognized at least one of the clandestine groups listed in this memorandum for record from

200
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:55,340
the NRO. Though the NRO likely works with the CIA DS&T and Navy for USO retrievals they are

201
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,660
not our focus for naval legacy programs. The NRO was born based on a recommendation to President

202
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,780
Eisenhower during a National Security Council meeting. The agency was formed to coordinate the

203
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,860
Air Force's and CIA's reconnaissance activities. Lesser known is an additional agency formed to

204
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,620
coordinate the CIA's and Navy's reconnaissance activities the National Underwater Reconnaissance

205
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:25,420
Office. This agency NRO is known as the hidden younger brother of the NRO. Implications about

206
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:31,980
this agency and naval USO retrievals are scant seen as NRO is a classified black agency but we

207
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,980
will do everything we can to investigate. NRO itself has been widely considered to be a special

208
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,340
access program according to publications made by the Association of Former Intelligence Officers

209
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,700
quote most SAPs involve technology projects at the Department of Defense there are relatively

210
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:54,540
few SAPs involving sensitive human intelligence collection or exploitation methods examples of

211
00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:00,300
ongoing non-technology SAPs include interrogation protocols for high-level battlefield detainees in

212
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,980
Afghanistan managed by the Defense Counterintelligence and Human Center of the DIA and every single

213
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,500
capability of all special mission units of the Joint Special Operations Command one entire

214
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,740
government agency the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office is protected by a SAP end quote.

215
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,860
From this statement we can learn NRO is an extremely rare example of an entire intelligence

216
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:29,020
agency being protected via a special access program but do not be mistaken NRO is a very

217
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,540
real program and we can find snippets of its very existence here and there including a drastic

218
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:41,020
revelation we will touch on soon. This includes mention of NRO in a 1975 submission of documents

219
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,460
to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Included in a long list of National Security

220
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,820
Council intelligence directives is a National Security Decision Memorandum 40 which details

221
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,900
both NRO and NRO operations. According to the Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence

222
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,140
by Nigel West NRO began during the Cold War as a joint Navy CIA group to coordinate and fund

223
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:10,060
special projects conducted by submarines. In his book the U.S. Intelligence Committee Jeffrey T.

224
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:17,180
Richelson was able to learn even more about NRO quote. In 1969 as a result of an agreement between

225
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:23,580
the CIA and U.S. Navy an underwater counterpart to the NRO the National Underwater Reconnaissance

226
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,060
Office NRO was established with Secretary of the Navy John Warner as its first director. The office

227
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:35,100
served as a means of managing the conduct of submarine intelligence missions and exploitation

228
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,260
of their product. Those missions involved the recovery of sunken submarines the Soviet K-129

229
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:47,660
taping of the underwater Soviet communication cables the Ivy Bells aka the Declenson program

230
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:53,820
ocean floor mapping under a program named desktop an imagery and SIGINT collection from submarines

231
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:00,140
a program at one time designated the Special Navy Control Program end quote. Author Jeffrey T.

232
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,740
Richelson was even denied FOIA requests on NRO. From what we can learn the agency has deployed

233
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,340
several highly specialized ships and submarines including the USS Parsh, the Hughes Glomar

234
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:18,220
Explorer, the USS Halibut, the NR-1 and more recent the USS Jimmy Carter. Of particular note

235
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,420
is the United States first nuclear-powered submarine launched 1969 the same year as

236
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:29,740
Neuros founding and retired in 2008 the NR-1. This sub carried out numerous highly classified

237
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,940
missions including search, object recovery, geological survey, oceanographic research and

238
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,140
installation and maintenance of underwater equipment. One publicly acknowledged NR-1

239
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:45,980
mission occurred in 1976 with the recovery of an F-14 lost from an aircraft carrier.

240
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,900
Neuro seemingly performed operations to swarm a stranded Soviet submarine in 1981 in Swedish

241
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,740
waters. In response to statements made by former Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger stating

242
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,740
Neuro submarine operations in Swedish waters were routine defense tests a senior US official said

243
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,580
I don't know why Weinberger said what he did. Covert submarine operations is the most secret

244
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:15,500
thing we have. The decisions were taken by a subcommittee of DIA and CIA people most likely

245
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,940
the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office but I will neither confirm nor deny any operation in

246
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:27,100
Swedish waters end quote. An additional high ranking CIA officer confirmed with the International

247
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:32,540
Peace Research Institute Oslo that US covert submarine retrieval operations were run in

248
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:39,020
Scandinavian waters by Neuro whilst directed by Secretary of the Navy John Layman from 1981 to

249
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,820
1987. Analyzing the inception of Neuro and the retrieval of the K-129 Soviet submarine as detailed

250
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,940
by Jeffrey Richardson we may gain some keen insights into the organization and their alleged

251
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,180
UFO retrieval missions. In Blind Man's Bluff the untold story of American submarine espionage

252
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,220
Neuro was established under CIA director Richard Helms to address the sinking of the Soviet

253
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:09,660
submarine K-129 outside of Hawaii in 1968. Though the office was intended to act between the CIA's

254
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,700
directorate of science and technology and office of naval intelligence quote from the day Neuro

255
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,620
was formed the CIA took charge end quote. Neuro has seemingly seen a tug of war of control through

256
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:26,780
the CIA and Navy but by 1972 the Navy regained some control of Neuro seen Secretary of the

257
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:33,740
Navy John Warner serve as its director. However through Neuro the Navy and CIA DS&Ts usage of

258
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:40,700
the Glomar Explorer may be worth analyzing more. To address K-129 the CIA built the ship the Glomar

259
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:47,340
Explorer mentioned above which launched in 1972 to recover the sub under project Jennifer aka

260
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:54,780
project Azorian. Astoundingly the ship carried a modern day price tag of 1.68 billion dollars.

261
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:00,380
I would like to thank medium author underscored for this great piece titled General Motors Glomar

262
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:05,420
Explorer Lockheed Martin and UAP connections his article will be in the video description.

263
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,220
The piece explores the Glomar Explorer being involved in hidden programs beyond the scope of

264
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:16,860
K-129 Soviet submarine recovery in 1974 and was additionally used for nearly two decades by

265
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,300
Lockheed Martin. Since the ship was a Neuro creation we can reasonably assume these clandestine

266
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:27,820
operations and Lockheed Martin's usage were conducted under Neuro. The article discussed how

267
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,420
in 1978 Ocean Minerals Company whose prime contractor was Lockheed Missiles and Space Company

268
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,940
now Lockheed Martin leased the Glomar Explorer for quote-unquote deep sea mining operation.

269
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,540
The question must be asked did Lockheed, Neuro and the Glomar additionally partake in these undersea

270
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:50,700
UFO retrievals? After all later in this project we will address a scintillating 1970s UFO crash

271
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:56,060
retrieval case in which the Glomar Explorer allegedly retrieved a downed non-human craft.

272
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:01,740
We will also discuss an incredible 1991 USO recovery in this project and touch on how I

273
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:07,500
believe Neuro provided transportation and logistics assets to the Navy's project Sand Dollar,

274
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,540
a clandestine highly compartmentalized project that was tasked to retrieve military sensitive

275
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,660
hardware and other items with national security importance from the seafloor of the continental

276
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:24,460
shelf in deepest marine environments. Sand Dollar seemingly gained actionable leverage when in 1964

277
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:30,860
Chief Scientist of the Special Projects Office of the US Navy Dr. John Pania Craven launched the

278
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:36,220
Deep Submergence Systems project which saw the Navy drastically improve deep sea engineering

279
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,820
and exploitation capabilities but much more on this later.

280
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,780
The most astonishing discussion of Neuro actually comes from a man mentioned dozens of times on this

281
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,900
channel who self-admittedly served as its director.

282
00:27:49,900 --> 00:28:01,900
Thank you. I became the Director of Naval Intelligence 13 September 1974, brand new flag selectee that year.

283
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:13,580
I also had a second hat and they still don't want me to talk about it even now,

284
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,300
of Director of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office.

285
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:27,180
Seeing it highly classified, that's the organization that procured all of the sensitive

286
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,860
reconnaissance systems to collect intelligence under the surface of the oceans.

287
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,300
Bobby Ray Inman allows us an extremely rare opportunity to understand naval UFO

288
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,020
slash USO legacy programs as well as the likely involvement of Neuro.

289
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:49,500
Inman served as a highly decorated four-star Admiral in the US Navy from 1951 to 1982,

290
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,220
while also serving as the NSA and CIA Director and Director of SAIC and Wackenhut.

291
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,180
Of course, if you are unfamiliar with these two companies, SAIC is a premier contractor I have

292
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:07,020
discussed and will discuss later in this video as being heavily involved with UFO legacy programs.

293
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:13,420
SAIC was likely the contractor described by former US Army Green Beret Randy Anderson as running the

294
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,820
off-world technologies division below the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane.

295
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,700
Wackenhut was a contracted security company I have covered before that has oftentimes been

296
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,940
implicated as providing industrial security forces who have guarded UFO-related SAP locations.

297
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,940
And of course, Inman's dual roles within US intelligence and the Navy

298
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,060
also suits an organization like Neuro perfectly.

299
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:42,140
Anyways, Inman states in the above clip he took a hold of the highly secretive Neuro in 1974.

300
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:48,300
Inman had only spoken publicly about Neuro once before in an October 2021 interview with David

301
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,740
Zerler, the Director of the Caltech Heritage Project. At this time, Inman served on Caltech's

302
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,860
Board of Trustees, to which he had been appointed in 1989 on the behalf of the Jet Propulsion

303
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,780
Laboratory, NASA and Congress. While discussing JPL's future as a productive national asset working

304
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,540
alongside NASA, Inman was reminded of his Navy and NSA days during his tenure in the National

305
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,660
Underwater Reconnaissance Program. According to Inman, Neuro served as a black program due

306
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,220
to its constant need to pursue evolving, cutting-edge technological capabilities

307
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,500
to outsmart adversaries. Later on in the interview, Inman touched on his role as Director

308
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,780
of Naval Intelligence and Director of Neuro, whose very existence was still classified.

309
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:35,260
In Inman's own words, he was harassed for even mentioning the office, quote,

310
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:40,220
In recent years when I talked about it, I got a pretty hot letter telling me I was not permitted

311
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,420
to talk in detail, since they were all still classified, end quote. According to Inman,

312
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,060
Neuro was in essence a black program that, quote,

313
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:29,980
So from Inman, the U.S. Intelligence Committee in Blind Man's Bluff, we can learn the Director of

314
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:35,180
Neuro dealt with technology acquisition and was also a high-ranking naval official ranging from

315
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:40,140
Secretary of the Navy to Director of Naval Intelligence. Also recall how Inman states he

316
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:47,020
was exposed to Neuro's Glomar Explorer in Hawaii. In 1974, the K-129 Soviet wreckage was picked up

317
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:53,580
1,560 miles northwest of Hawaii, however. Once again later in this project, I will bring up an

318
00:31:53,580 --> 00:32:00,460
alleged UFO recovery in 1973, conducted by the Glomar in Hawaii. Could Inman possibly have been

319
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:05,500
involved in this retrieval in an official capacity? But why exactly are these words

320
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:11,500
from Admiral and former Neuro Director Bobby Ray Inman so important? I have spoken on this topic

321
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:18,220
quite a few times, but as this directly involves U.S. Navy UFO legacy programs, let's dive back in.

322
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:23,340
In 2022, on the Project Unity show, Inman claimed he had found, quote, unquote,

323
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:30,620
plausible explanations for all UAP sightings. In my years active service,

324
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:43,180
I became intrigued by the whole issue of UFOs. And as I dug into it,

325
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:53,020
I found there were plausible explanations for virtually everything that we had observed.

326
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,300
Until recently, with the openness of Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, naval officials quite often

327
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:04,300
denied the existence of UFOs. This dates all the way back to 1951, where the Office of Naval

328
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:09,820
Research physicist Ernest Liddell stated in a public magazine article that all UAP reports

329
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:15,900
were mirages or balloons. He stated trained observers were being fooled. These 2022 statements

330
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:22,140
by Inman contradict much of this man's storied history. I started out extremely skeptical about

331
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,620
this whole thing. I thought this was just rubbish from the tabloids, but I was surprised to find

332
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,900
thousands of U.S. government documents from intelligence agencies that tended to indicate

333
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,620
that there was a little bit more to this than met the eye. So I went to seek guidance from the

334
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,580
various highest levels of the United States intelligence community, and I was quite alarmed

335
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:47,340
at what I was able to learn. In this report that we're now going to show, we're going to hear a

336
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,980
conversation featuring you. Tell me the context of that conversation. Well, I had contacted

337
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,540
Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was the head of the National Security Agency in the United States,

338
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:03,100
deputy director at CIA, director of naval intelligence, and in a variety of intelligence

339
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:09,980
posts, a technologist and clearly someone that if this was really accurate, that there really were

340
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:17,020
UFOs and non-human intelligence around, this is a man who had to know. So I was able to contact him

341
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:23,980
thanks to contact through Admiral Lord Hill Norton here in the U.K. In this conversation,

342
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:30,300
he alarmingly not only indicated that these issues were covered under national secrecy laws,

343
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,020
but that the United States government did in fact have possession of the hardware associated

344
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,020
with this. In other words, this was an actual physical phenomenon as a craft, a spaceship,

345
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,740
several of them, and they were in operational condition, which I assume suggested that they

346
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,420
had been in contact, that they had been given these craft for some reason or another,

347
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:51,500
because they certainly weren't crashed vehicles. In a 1989 telephone call,

348
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,340
Admiral Bobby Ray Inman would tell NASA mission specialist Bob Eshler, deputy director of the CIA

349
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:03,260
DS&T, Everett Heineman, would be the best person to ask if recovered vehicles would be available

350
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:08,940
for technological research outside of military circles. To quote Inman in this call, quote,

351
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,300
The deputy director for science and technology at CIA is named Everett Heineman. He is in fact

352
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,180
getting ready to retire in the very near future. That may make him somewhat more willing to have

353
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:24,380
dialogues than he otherwise would have had. When I knew him in that period seven to ten years ago,

354
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,060
he was a person of very substantial integrity and just good common sense. So as a place to start,

355
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:35,340
he would clearly be high on the list, end quote. And we actually have recorded snippets of this

356
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:41,660
phone call between Eshler and Inman. Do you anticipate that any of the recovered

357
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:48,140
vehicles would ever become available for technological research outside of the military

358
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,820
circles? Ten years ago, the answer would have been whether as time has evolved, they're beginning to

359
00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:00,300
become more open on it is a possibility. Eshler would go on to receive this call from Admiral Inman.

360
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,340
Mr. Eshler, this is Tom King in Admiral Inman's office.

361
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,780
Yes, you would be breaching confidence and or violation of the three laws and discussing

362
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:16,940
his involvement in any matter. Interesting how Inman, a former neuro director, would refer Eshler

363
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:24,140
to a CIA DS&T director for recovered anomalous vehicles. CIA DS&T was of course one half of the

364
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:29,820
founding agencies behind Neuro. To note, while Heineman served as CIA DS&T deputy director from

365
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:36,140
1979 to 1982, he would go on to direct Program B and the National Reconnaissance Program from

366
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:43,100
1982 to 1989. Possibly, this is where a neuro director and NRO program director first encountered

367
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,780
UFO legacy programs together. Heineman and Eshler arranged to meet at the CIA's headquarters in

368
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:55,980
Langley, Virginia, 10 August 1989. In this meeting, Heineman would deny any knowledge of UFO or UFO

369
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:03,580
legacy programs. However, in 2022, Twitter user RGH underscore UFOs would contact Heineman regarding

370
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:09,260
comments made by Inman that Heineman was knowledgeable on US UFO programs. In this instance,

371
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:15,180
Heineman did not deny but instead said quote, I am a long way and quite a few years from working in

372
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,140
the area you are researching end quote. Heineman would offer to answer any questions relating to

373
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:26,060
UFOs but never responded to RGH and as of this time, I have additionally attempted to contact

374
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:32,300
Heineman to no response. RGH's inquiries into UFO programs revolved around Heineman's time in the

375
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:38,140
NRO's Program B. As we just mentioned above, Program B served as the CIA's initiative to build

376
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,940
and operate satellites for SIGINT purposes. Heineman was the first chief of the facility for

377
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:48,220
the ground element of the program in Pine Gap, Australia. It is fascinating to think Heineman

378
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:53,500
could have been working on UFO legacy programs in the 1980s out of the illustrious and infamous

379
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:59,180
Pine Gap for a joint CIA and NRO program. More pertinent to our investigation today,

380
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,820
Inman would additionally connect Eschler with another former Director of Naval Intelligence,

381
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:10,620
Sumner Shapiro. It is unknown if like Inman, Shapiro served on the NRO. In 1989, Eschler met

382
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:16,060
Shapiro under the pretense he was interested in working with a group that managed UFO information

383
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,740
and at this time, Shapiro was retired as Director of Naval Intelligence and served as an executive

384
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:27,660
with BDM International. BDM is of course a former defense contractor purchased by Northrop Grumman,

385
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:33,020
I directly accused of being involved with UFO legacy programs. Shapiro told Eschler,

386
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:38,700
factions within the US possess extraterrestrial vehicles, that he, Shapiro, had even studied at

387
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:44,060
close quarters. According to the former DNI, teams would take the craft apart, pack them up,

388
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,460
and ship them around the country to different laboratories. These craft featured unique

389
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:54,220
interlocking components that had to be disassembled in an exact sequence to be put back together.

390
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,780
However, Shapiro was incredibly careful with what information he divulged to Eschler,

391
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,900
never specifying where vehicles and technology were taken to protect classified information.

392
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:09,580
Eschler would meet Shapiro for a second time in the Admiral's Virginia home in 1990. This visit was

393
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:14,700
far less actionable and concluded abruptly. According to Bob Eschler, as relayed by author

394
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,900
Timothy Goode,

395
00:39:39,580 --> 00:40:00,140
But before we move on from discussing Eschler and insights he gained from senior naval officials,

396
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,900
Eschler would also claim Navy EMP experiments were utilized out of Pensacola Naval Air Station to

397
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:12,620
down UFOs for retrievals. These involved Empress and Empress II on board EMP generators.

398
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:18,140
Inman and Shapiro are not the only naval officials who have spoken on UFO legacy programs.

399
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:23,420
In 2021, now deceased former Navy Director of Science and Technology Development,

400
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:30,300
Nats Kobitz, told Ross Coulthart he was, during his service, read into a Navy UFO crash retrieval and

401
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,900
reverse engineering program. Although Kobitz didn't actively engage with TUO or Technologies

402
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:41,100
of Unknown Origin, he was read into an active program that had retrieved multiple UAP.

403
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:07,500
For many years, for over 30 years. And sadly, when I caught up with him, he was dying from cancer.

404
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:15,580
And fate dictated that I caught him at the perfect time. And over several months, he finally opened

405
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:25,340
up to me about what he was on his own admission, read into. He was briefed on the program. And he

406
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:33,580
told me that he had been read into a classified program involving retrieved non-human technology,

407
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:40,460
recovered alien spacecraft. He eventually admitted that he was officially briefed that America had

408
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:48,140
retrieved multiple non-human craft. And that he was aware there was a secret operation underway

409
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:56,860
for decades, in his words, to undertake to reverse engineer them. He admitted that most of what he

410
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:04,540
knew was effectively hearsay, although from some excellent official sources. This is something he'd

411
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:12,140
been briefed into in his official capacity. He did admit that on one occasion he was flown to Wright

412
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:20,300
Patterson Air Force Base, literally taken deep underground, taken to a secure room and shown

413
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:27,100
what looked like some kind of bulkhead from a craft, which he believed was constructed in a way

414
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:37,100
that defied conventional explanation. The craft's skin and inner bulkhead were composites bonded at

415
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:44,940
an atomic level. He suspected it was non-human intelligence technology. But being the scientist

416
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:52,060
he was, infuriatingly, he wouldn't say to me it was alien tech. He would just say it was something

417
00:42:52,060 --> 00:43:01,420
he had never seen that any human could make. Nat was a patriot. He was a decent, honorable public

418
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:08,300
servant. He respected the fact this program was being kept secret for a reason. But as a scientist,

419
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:14,700
he also recognized that the American public, and especially Congress, had the right to know

420
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:21,900
what was being done with taxpayer dollars. And he frankly told me that as far as he knew,

421
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,500
there was no good justification for keeping it secret.

422
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:35,900
Remember all the way back to Chris Sharpe's mysterious reporting on USO legacy programs

423
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:42,380
involving the CIA, DS&T, Navy, Neuro, SOCOM, and others. To quote Chris in the third iteration of

424
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,340
the article, quote, it is further understood that the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has

425
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:52,220
provided deep submergence vehicles to support these retrieval efforts, end quote. Woods Hole,

426
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,660
or WHOI, as I will call them here, is quote, dedicated to advancing knowledge of the ocean

427
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,300
and its connection with the earth systems through a sustained commitment to excellence in science,

428
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,500
engineering, and education, and to the application of this knowledge to problems facing society,

429
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,860
end quote. The nonprofit research and higher education facility is dedicated to the study

430
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:19,180
of marine science and engineering. During the Cold War, 1985 to be exact, the US Navy deployed

431
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:24,300
a classified mission to investigate the wreckage of the USS Thresher and USS Scorpion,

432
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,980
which had sunk in the North Atlantic Ocean at depths of between 10,000 and 15,000 feet.

433
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:34,460
Sounds like a neuro investigation, no? Well, this mission led to the discovery of the wreck

434
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:40,700
of the Titanic. The operational team and vessel that discovered the RMS Titanic was from Woods

435
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:46,700
Hole. WHOI employs a host of highly advanced underwater vehicles that include human-occupied

436
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,740
submersibles, remote-controlled vehicles, autonomous and towed robots. These include

437
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:58,460
the AUV-centric autonomous exploration vehicle capable of exploring depths of nearly 20,000 feet

438
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:04,700
or 6,000 meters, the HOV Alvin, a three-person research submersible, and the HOV Deep Sea

439
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:11,660
Challenger, used by filmmaker James Cameron. WHOI works closely with US military, specifically the

440
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,780
Navy, where it develops technology including ocean battlespace sensors, unmanned undersea

441
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:22,460
vehicles, and acoustic navigation and comms systems. As a matter of fact, going back decades,

442
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:27,100
Woods Hole was involved with the Atomic Energy Commission, the precursor to the Department of

443
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:32,700
Energy that highly likely housed UFO legacy programs while also serving as the gatekeepers

444
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:38,700
for UFO data and materials, misclassifying such as trans-classified foreign nuclear material.

445
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:45,180
From 1948 to 1949, a gentleman named William Webster served on the Military Liaison Committee

446
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:50,460
for the Atomic Energy Commission. Webster was not only a member of the Massachusetts Institute of

447
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:56,620
Technology Corporation but was also a trustee of the Rand Corporation and Woods Hole Oceanographic

448
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:03,580
Institute. WHOI even manages the Navy Oceanographic Research Laboratory for the Department of the Navy.

449
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:08,780
This WHOI lab is now part of the Naval Research Laboratory, NRL. However,

450
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,900
the National Oceanographic Research Laboratory was formed by a Federal Contract Research Center,

451
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:21,900
or FCRC, the precursor to FFRDC, which I talk about quite often. Present day, Woods Hole also

452
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:28,300
manages projects for the Office of Naval Research, such as Project Sundance. In fact, since 2002,

453
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:34,460
Woods Hole has been awarded over $3.4 billion in federal awards in the form of contracts,

454
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:40,060
subcontracts, and grants. Analyzing such contracts, we can find some data of extreme

455
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:45,180
interest, such as National Defense R&D Services with the Naval Surface Warfare Center,

456
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:50,300
whose crane division I have directly accused runs an underground installation with Science

457
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:56,140
Applications International Corporation housing the Off-World Technologies Division. Historically,

458
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:03,260
WHOI has been awarded these contracts by NSWC via sole-source contracts, a contract method Dr.

459
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:09,180
Eric Davis has spoken of, that are used in UFO legacy programs to maintain compartmentalization

460
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:15,180
in secrecy. Woods Hole is given such sole-source, indefinite delivery contracts because, quote,

461
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,900
the government believes that the supplier has unique capabilities that cannot be otherwise

462
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:26,860
obtained, end quote. And speaking of SAIC, Woods Hole has also been granted R&D contracts with SAIC

463
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:33,820
and NSWC Crane Weapons Systems Division, JXN. But it doesn't stop there. Woods Hole has been given

464
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:39,980
numerous indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity NSWC contracts to build, fabricate, integrate,

465
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:46,060
evaluate, and support unmanned undersea vehicles, specifically for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center

466
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:57,820
installations. And now we finally get to the most interesting part of this video, a deep-sea

467
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:03,260
USO recovery experience that ties together much of what we have discussed on today's episode.

468
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:09,580
This story first appeared on Art Bell's Coast to Coast call-in episode on 19 April 2002,

469
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:14,860
and I plan on using clips of the audio here. However, if people would be interested in fully

470
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:20,300
released audio where I work with a 3D artist to recreate the encounter, please let me know.

471
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,900
On this live radio call-in show, Art Bell was contacted by a retired Marine Corps Lieutenant

472
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:31,740
Colonel. The caller, first named Mark, had been assigned to 22 Area Camp Pendleton to work with

473
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:38,460
the first air delivery unit before being stationed at Okinawa, Japan at the Fatima USMC air station.

474
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:43,420
It was here he began doing rescue diving work on weekends alongside a Navy crew.

475
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,820
Mark would form a friendship with a lieutenant in the Navy who would go on to become a commander

476
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:55,820
of a DSRV or Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle Unit. The friendship I made later came back that

477
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:02,060
I was assigned or requested to join this DSRV unit and did and was reassigned to Virginia.

478
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:08,700
And basically what we did was deep sea rescue and recovery. If we had a downed aircraft,

479
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:14,620
we would go and try to rig the craft to get it back. Anything, any anomalies that we wanted to

480
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:19,020
look at, basically we were sent. There were several teams that did the same thing we did.

481
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:28,380
How deep did you go? We could go two miles, excess miles. You're pretty much pushing it.

482
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,140
This particular incident I wanted to tell you about was about a mile.

483
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,940
You're saying you could go over 10,000 feet? Yes.

484
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,620
Wow. All right. Anyway, go ahead.

485
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,220
Well, I'll say the particular incident we were involved in, we were

486
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:46,060
just under a mile and a half of water, North Atlantic.

487
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:52,060
The specific mention of DSRV is critical to this entire investigation. The United States created

488
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:58,460
two deep submergence rescue vehicles that operated within the US Navy from 1970 to 2008.

489
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:05,100
Mystic DSRV-1 and Avalon DSRV-2 were products of the Lockheed Missile and Space Company in

490
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,460
Sunnyvale, California. DSRVs are to this day, some of the most technologically advanced

491
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:15,340
submersibles in the entire world. These two vehicles were capable of deploying anywhere

492
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:20,140
in the world, transported within a truck, C-5 Galaxy, or naval vessel to piggyback

493
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,100
efficient routes to rescue crews of stranded submarines within 72 hours.

494
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:30,220
These highly advanced submersibles employed a guidance system more complex than Apollo 11's,

495
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:36,140
allowing the DSRVs to hover in place in strong ocean currents to mate with disabled submarines.

496
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:43,340
The Navy conducted numerous exercises with DSRVs 1 and 2, but no official rescues were ever conducted.

497
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:51,100
And this is due to no American subs sinking since 1971. In 1972, saw the introduction of DSRVs 1

498
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:58,860
It is interesting to note, DSRV was born from 1964's Deep Submergence Systems Project, DSSP,

499
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:03,020
to increase and develop the Navy's deep ocean engineering capabilities.

500
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:07,020
The project was initially founded out of the Navy's Special Program Office,

501
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:14,140
and DSRV's launch date of 70-71 dovetails closely with the beginning of Neuro in 1969.

502
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:19,340
Interesting how the DSSP was also founded partly out of the loss of the USS Thresher,

503
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:23,580
the same sub Woods Hole was attempting to find when it discovered the Titanic.

504
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:28,780
If this story is true, this means DSRV, Mystic, and Avalon's practice missions

505
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:32,220
were really to retrieve underwater aircraft and vehicles.

506
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:38,060
And this is most likely fact, as Dr. John Pena Craven, Chief Scientist of the Special Program's

507
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:43,980
Office of the Navy and first head of the DSSP wrote regarding DSRV and classified operations,

508
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:48,860
There were many highly classified missions associated with national security that could

509
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,500
not be accomplished without a DSRV system. The specific operational needs of these

510
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,940
missions could not be anticipated, but they were certain to occur.

511
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:01,980
Thus, a DSRV designed, constructed, and deployed for every conceivable rescue mission

512
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:07,420
would also be available for the intelligence mission impossible that were sure to occur.

513
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:14,460
Craven's words here are particularly interesting. In 1964, Craven was tasked with spearheading the

514
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,980
Deep Submergence Systems Project, which led to the creation of the DSRV and other deep clandestine

515
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:25,820
subs, like the NR-1, to respond to unprecedented events at dramatically extended operational

516
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:31,740
depths. In 1965, Craven was given a high-level intelligence briefing by a naval intelligence

517
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:37,820
officer and was informed on the existence of an extremely sensitive program named Sand Dollar.

518
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:43,020
From Craven's book, The Silent War, The Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea, we get a rare chance

519
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:47,740
to learn more about this program. Sand Dollar was tasked to retrieve militarily sensitive

520
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:52,460
hardware and other items with national security importance from the seafloor of the continental

521
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:57,260
shelf in deep marine environment. According to The Silent War, Sand Dollar was buried within

522
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:02,460
the structure of yet another secret program, itself hidden within the Polaris subprogram.

523
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,620
This hierarchy and compartmentalization of programs is something we have observed

524
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,700
extensively in the Wilson Davis notes and throughout our investigation today.

525
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,940
Craven even wrote the program is still classified to this day, that being 2002,

526
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:20,300
quote, I was shown an inventory, itemizing the items to be known on the seabed and a map of

527
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,180
their distribution throughout the world, end quote. To expand on this statement, quote,

528
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:29,980
The salvageable items of interest were spread around the globe. There were plenty of interesting

529
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,860
objects on ocean floors worldwide, not just in the Bermuda Triangle, and there was an equal

530
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:39,420
distribution of these objects between those that were lying on the continental shelf and those in

531
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:44,060
deep oceans. There was a skew in favor of the continental shelf because of the shallow water,

532
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:49,260
rocks, and shoals, but much of that hardware had either been salvaged or scattered by storms,

533
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,060
end quote. Craven would even discuss two vessels previously mentioned to have been used in

534
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:59,500
operational capacity by the Neuro, the Halibut and Sea Wolf. Craven claimed there was no need

535
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,780
for maximum security for these submarines because they themselves, quote, they only transported

536
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:09,900
top secret equipment and teams of industry specialists who would carry out unknown missions

537
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:15,180
in unknown parts of the sea. The performers and the performances were invisible, end quote.

538
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:20,780
As we explore this undersea recovery with DSRV units, we can now study the case with a strong

539
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:26,540
thesis in mind. Chief scientist John Craven was tasked by the U.S. Navy to drastically increase

540
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:31,820
naval deep sea diving and engineering capabilities to retrieve undersea objects discovered by an

541
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:37,740
astoundingly compartmented program called Sand Dollar. Craven's 1964 Deep Submergence Systems

542
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:42,300
project would lead to the creation of clandestine submersibles that were capable of retrieving,

543
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:47,820
quote, unquote, items of interest from the sea floor. Some of these submersibles, such as the DSRV

544
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:52,540
units, would be shuttled via motherships, including Neuros, Halibut and Sea Wolf.

545
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:57,900
So now the question must be asked, was Sand Dollar the Navy's first UFO legacy program

546
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:03,660
designated with the discovery, monitoring and retrieval of UFOs? After all, Craven would state,

547
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:08,780
quote, could I organize and manage a program to carry out this mission using the assets of the

548
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:14,540
DSSP? Furthermore, could I carry it out in such a manner that my family and friends and closest

549
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:19,820
professional colleagues would have no idea that I was involved in such a project? End quote.

550
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:26,700
From the DSSP, the Navy planned to build six DSRV units and additional DSRVs known as Deep

551
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:33,500
Submergence Search Vehicles, DSSVs, that were never officially built outside of Mystic and Avalon.

552
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:39,820
These DSSV DSRVs were intended for sea floor exploration and recovery and to be capable of

553
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:45,740
clandestine operations with an operational depth of 20,000 feet. So while we dive into Mark's

554
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:51,660
story, I do think it is possible he and his Navy unit were assigned to a DSSV, not the two

555
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:57,900
acknowledged Mystic and Avalon DSRVs. If this is the case, no such vessel in which Mark was operating

556
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:03,660
was ever publicly acknowledged to have been built. But back to the story, our story takes place in

557
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:10,860
the early summer of 1991 at a depth of roughly 1.5 miles in the North Atlantic 250 nautical miles

558
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:18,140
or roughly 288 standard miles outside of Aberdeen, Scotland. Looking at 250 nautical mile radius

559
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:22,700
outside of Aberdeen compared with the Atlantic Ocean depths, we can draw a reasonable estimate

560
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:28,060
of where this retrieval incident would have taken place. Let us also account for some error in Mark's

561
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:33,740
estimate and give a generous plus or minus 20% room for error in radius here. Therefore,

562
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:39,580
our radius could be up to 50 nautical miles larger, so we have a standard radius of 345

563
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:45,420
standard miles. And folks using the superior metric system here, I am sorry guys. Waters in

564
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:51,580
the Atlantic near the UK are actually quite shallow, however, 345 miles almost due west of

565
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:57,660
Aberdeen sees depths reaching over 8,000 feet, which is over our mile and a half claim. This area

566
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:02,860
of ocean is known as the Rockall Trough, east of the Rockall Plateau. Hopefully further data can

567
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:07,500
come from this very specific location at which this retrieval is alleged to have occurred.

568
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,940
Mark's DSRV crew had been sent from Virginia and as we know from a 2011 Nuclear Regulatory

569
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:18,300
Commission emails detailing the tsunamis in Japan, both the east and west coast of the United States

570
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:23,180
had employed a quote, very operational ready deep submergence rescue vehicle, end quote.

571
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:28,780
On the DSRV, Mark served to operate computer equipment on the optical and electronic recognition

572
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:34,060
side and also worked on mechanical aspects of the vessel with mechanical arms and rigging for object

573
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:38,860
retrieval. Mark's team was dispatched after a survey vessel in the North Atlantic had picked

574
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:43,900
up a radioactive signature on the seafloor. A second vessel equipped with a side scan determined

575
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,540
a vessel to be resting on the seafloor. Naval authorities thought this to be a crashed foreign

576
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:53,340
nuclear submarine. However, the radar signature had shown the object to be smaller than any

577
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:59,100
known nuclear sub. Upon diving, Mark's DSRV attempted to contact the vessel and immediately

578
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,700
realized this was not a sub, but shaped more like an aircraft.

579
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:25,020
The vessel came back, it was much too small to be any sub that they were familiar with

580
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:31,180
and at that time we came on site. But you were getting some kind of nuclear signature from it?

581
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:38,860
Right, there's residual radiation from it and the concern was was it a weapon, some type of

582
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:44,060
concealed weapon source or was it actually a power source? Right. And we were brought out

583
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:50,540
from Virginia, steamed out, and not to give you specific minutes, seconds, location, just

584
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:57,020
approximately 250 miles out of Aberdeen, Scotland is where we were. You can draw a circle and

585
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:04,620
narrow it down pretty quick. At that depth you can limit the waters. Yes, sir. But upon diving,

586
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:12,700
we went down, like I said, just under a mile and a half and we contacted the vessel,

587
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:20,300
which we immediately recognized not as a submarine but more of an aircraft.

588
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:28,460
Communications back to the top, we were told to go observe, photograph, determine what we have.

589
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:34,620
We thought at that point we had possibly a Russian or Korean aircraft with some type of

590
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:42,140
contained weapon source. So we went in. Yeah, that would be logical. We went in and this

591
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:48,700
particular vessel was partially in the mud, submerged or buried under some mud, had been

592
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,700
there for some period of time. And how much were you, what were you seeing of it? What shape?

593
00:59:53,260 --> 01:00:00,780
What we saw was the, I would say the rear two-thirds. It was a triangular shape. It was

594
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:07,500
wedged more. Triangular. And best way I could describe it, it would be nosed in with about

595
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:13,900
two-thirds exposed to the back. Yes, sir. And as you come out, the triangular shape at the back,

596
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:19,660
it was rounded as it came to the corner, what would be the corner of the triangle,

597
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:27,340
they were rounded on both sides. Oh, really? Obviously not a conventional aircraft.

598
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:33,580
Well, one comment was made in the DSRV, the Lieutenant Commander is also a good friend,

599
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:39,660
was my comment was, I don't believe it's Russian. And his comment was, if it is,

600
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:47,740
it's not Russia right now, you know, joking. And what, you know, the best way I can describe it,

601
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:54,940
it was a charcoal gray in color. It had some markings on the side. Sir, listen, I'm coming

602
01:00:54,940 --> 01:01:01,420
to a break at the top of the hour. Can you manage to hold on? I can, if you'd like, yes.

603
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:07,340
I would like, yes. Stay right there, all right? You located this craft, which was a triangular

604
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:13,180
in shape, and you were seeing the back portion of it. Right, at this point, we'd come over

605
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:22,620
almost what you, I would best describe as broadside to the craft. The nose, what I would

606
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:29,100
determine is the nose end was submerged in mud. Mark and his crew had no matching craft or pattern

607
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:34,780
to cross reference this craft. The 60 to 70 foot charcoal gray triangle with smooth edges,

608
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:40,620
no windows, rivets, seams or bolts, a rounded rear and hieroglyphic writing along the side

609
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:45,980
did not lead the crew to suspect terrestrial origins. Mark and his Lieutenant Colonel friend

610
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:51,020
both thought the craft to be extraterrestrial, but did not relay this to the surface out of fear of

611
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:56,860
psych evaluations and to not risk communication interception. The surface LPH vessel ordered the

612
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:02,940
DSRV unit to return with still photography and video of the craft. We do need to quickly address

613
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:08,780
the markings on the side of the craft that Mark relayed. And there were markings on the side of it

614
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:14,540
which were in the in the skin itself. And how would you describe those markings?

615
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:21,180
You know, and I've heard this before, people try to say hieroglyphics and all of this. It was not

616
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:29,260
a, it was not any language or marking which we would typically see, Russian, Arabic, nothing

617
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:36,140
we were trained or had seen previously. But hieroglyphic-like. Well, I'll say

618
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:43,420
hieroglyphic-like, but more geometric patterns. There weren't large walking individuals with bird

619
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:50,380
heads. And, you know, I think of hieroglyphics, I think of individuals with a head like a bird

620
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:56,540
or a wolf and then human body just didn't have those type of patterns. It was more geometric

621
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:04,780
shapes, but you could tell some of the actual characters repeated. Quite a bit of it was

622
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:09,900
in mud and then there would be gaps throughout the mud that you could see some repeating of

623
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:15,660
the character. I have covered in great detail the high confidence 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania

624
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:20,940
crash retrieval in which numerous town residents observed U.S. military forces retrieve and

625
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:27,020
transport a 12-foot acorn-like bronze craft. Many such witnesses described hieroglyphic-style

626
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:31,820
writing around the circumference of the lower lip of the craft. And additionally, Danny Sheehan has

627
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:37,260
stated in the classified project bluebook files, he has seen images of a crashed UFO saucer that

628
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:42,620
displayed geometric hieroglyphic-style characters along its circumference. This is a fascinating

629
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:48,220
detail and connection to these other cases. After 12 hours of waiting after returning to the surface,

630
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:54,300
the DSRV crew was ordered to dive again, this time taking a marine archaeologist. The archaeologist

631
01:03:54,300 --> 01:04:00,700
made sketches of the craft and even traveled down with his own personal computer. Where did

632
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:06,300
this go from there? I mean now you've got this thing ID'd, were you suddenly out of the picture

633
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:11,180
or? Well we're in the picture up to the point where we're rigging and recovering.

634
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:18,620
As I said, we took down a marine archaeologist and one thing that was very interesting,

635
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:25,740
that this individual, we actually monitored currents, did some things, temperatures and such

636
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:33,420
at the site. He was making quite a bit of notes and you know really not making a lot of comment,

637
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:39,820
but he did make the comment when we asked you know is this recent because there was no

638
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:45,020
disturbed area around it, best way to describe it. It looked like it had been in place

639
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:50,300
and he said that it wasn't any more recent than at least 30 to 40 years,

640
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:57,260
which really threw us back because this thing looked like something beyond you know where we're

641
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:02,620
at development-wise aircraft and I still hadn't ruled out that it was not experimental aircraft

642
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:10,860
at this point, someone's. But the point that he made that the buildup of the silt mud in the front

643
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:16,540
end would appear that this has probably been in place for a period of 30 years or somewhere in

644
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:24,540
the range 30 to 40 years. And you have, was there an attempt made at recovery? There was a recovery

645
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:29,420
made, not an attempt made, there was a recovery made of the craft. What do you know about that?

646
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:35,180
On the third day of the operation, the DSRV crew dove for a fourth time, this time to

647
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:40,940
retrieve the craft. The team first used thrusters to remove silt and mud from the craft's midsection

648
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:46,620
so Mark and others could attach equipment to try and lift the vehicle. Immediate problems arose as

649
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:51,500
this crashed USO did not fall under the same procedures and weight estimations used for

650
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:57,740
conventional aircraft. Due to this, the DSRV crew had to make size and base weight estimations.

651
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:03,180
The craft's weight estimations was based on the closest size conventional aircraft, the F-14.

652
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:10,940
We had thrusted away a lot of the silt mud from the vehicle. Still had a section,

653
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:17,260
probably about eight foot, that was trapped or under depth. It was more of an angle to it.

654
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:23,660
So when we rigged it to bring it up rear first, use the best language I can. We were going to

655
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:30,060
try to lift the rear end up and bring this thing up on an angle and try to keep everything intact

656
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:38,940
and go. We're rigging it with our calculation for the rigging and the weight, brought it up and

657
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:46,460
it went probably about two and a half to three times the ascent as what we anticipated,

658
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,780
which immediately gave us a feel that we're dealing with something extremely light.

659
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:56,620
Trailing the craft as it ascended, the DSRV crew noticed the underside of the craft was completely

660
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:02,540
smooth. No piping, exhaust or mechanical features existed on the underbelly of the triangle. When

661
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:07,580
the vehicle was recovered, Mark got a clear look at the craft. It proved to be six to eight feet

662
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:14,780
longer than an F-14 at 62 feet, meaning this craft was 68 to 70 feet long. Mark stated nothing like

663
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:21,420
that existed in 1991 and as of the show in 2002, still nothing like that existed. The craft was a

664
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:31,340
solid metal form with no cockpit and no windows. It was a little bit longer than the aircraft would

665
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:40,780
be, probably six to eight feet, I would say, in excess of what you would anticipate for an F-14.

666
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:46,300
Colonel, a straight out question is, do you believe that you recovered an alien craft?

667
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:56,060
I've had conversations with the individual, my friend that actually was there, we're still in

668
01:07:56,060 --> 01:08:04,300
contact quite often. I can't definitively say that it was. I can only say that it was

669
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:09,020
an object that didn't belong there and certainly would not have belonged there

670
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:17,020
30 or 40 years prior to when we were on site and no visible means of, you know, if you

671
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:22,620
anticipated it was an aircraft and I saw a cockpit, I would say it was definitely somebody here that

672
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:29,340
was in development, but technology would not allow you to fly craft 30 or 40 years ago.

673
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:35,660
Within four hours, Mark and his entire crew were steamed off site. Mark received no feedback or

674
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:40,940
debriefing on what the vehicle was, nor did he and his crew receive any threats or warnings

675
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:46,060
not to speak about the incident. However, Mark did state when he joined the DSRV team, he was

676
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:52,700
ordered to sign some pretty lengthy NDAs. As we know from Dr. Craven and DSRV for clandestine usage,

677
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:57,500
this does not come as a shock. Mark would be subject to such intense secrecy regarding his

678
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:03,340
work on the DSRV. Mark stated even if the DSRV retrieved a U.S. vehicle, they were not allowed

679
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:08,540
to discuss. Art Bell got the original sketches of the retrieval by the naval lieutenant colonel

680
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:13,340
and Mark told Bell he would connect him with the naval officer. I am still trying to chase down

681
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:18,300
this case with the help of some high-profile naval officials. More investigation does need

682
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:23,820
to be done on this case since officially DSRV's Mystic and Avalon had an operational depth of

683
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:29,660
just over one mile and it would be unusual to employ USMC divers for the time. For this reason,

684
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:36,700
I do think back to the 1964 proposal of six DSRV and DSSV under the Deep Submergence Systems

685
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:43,340
project where only DSRV's 1 and 2 were built. Remember back to the words of Dr. John P. Craven,

686
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:48,060
chief scientist of the Navy Special Projects Office who discussed many classified operations

687
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:54,300
were performed by DSRV teams. I do think it possible DSRV units outside of Mystic and Avalon

688
01:09:54,300 --> 01:10:00,780
were built with capabilities akin to the DSSV units. 20,000 foot operational depth capacity

689
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:06,300
with a greater capability for seafloor navigation and object retrieval. And it is interesting of

690
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:12,060
course to point out the 1964 Deep Submergence Systems project DSSP which aimed to increase

691
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:17,180
and develop the Navy's deep ocean engineering capabilities for Project Sand Dollar which resulted

692
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:23,900
in the creation of DSRV occurred just two years after the October 1962 Bluegill Triple Prime US

693
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:30,060
Navy UFO recovery. Additionally, this case piqued my interest due to the presence of a crash triangle

694
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:35,900
so often in my videos I discuss many triangular sightings being alien reproduction vehicles.

695
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:42,460
Whether this be the TR-3B XF-131 Super Sentinel or a long list of prototypes I have wagered to be

696
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:47,660
built in the late 70s into the early 2000s, I believe the U.S. saw heavy clandestine

697
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:53,260
experimentation within USAPs to build triangular shaped alien reproduction vehicles. But this

698
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:59,260
triangular case harkens my attention back to the alleged Special Operations 1 Majestic 12 manual.

699
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:06,140
In this piece, the SOM-101 allegedly written in 1952, details are given to extraterrestrial craft

700
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:11,980
types including triangles which according to the document were very new and very rare at the time.

701
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:17,980
The DSRV retrieved the triangle allegedly in 1991. The marine archaeologists claimed the triangle

702
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:24,860
had been buried for 30 to 40 years, meaning the crash likely occurred between 1951 and 1961.

703
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:29,660
Interesting how this date range coincides with the Majestic 12 Special Operations manual,

704
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:35,740
claiming new triangular extraterrestrial vehicles were being spotted at the time of the 1954 manual.

705
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,700
If these retrieval events are true and the inside sources of Chris Sharpe are correct,

706
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:47,020
water-based USO and UFO recoveries are stationed at naval installations and locations of the Office

707
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:53,340
of Naval Research, where they are then utilized in material exploitation programs. Let us review

708
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:58,140
some cases and testimony throughout history of downed craft stored at naval installations.

709
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:02,140
We will reference numerous sources here, including the latest data from the USAP,

710
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:07,420
we will reference numerous sources here, including the legendary Leonard Stringfield,

711
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:12,700
whose work I referenced often in my dumb video. Stringfield's crash retrieval status reports 1

712
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:18,620
through 7 are in my opinion the best crash retrieval work done by any investigator.

713
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:23,180
I will also omit stories of China Lake and the testimony of Randy Anderson and the

714
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:27,820
off-world technologies division, as I have covered these stories and installations and

715
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:33,180
experiences in depth in the past. Leonard Stringfield was once contacted by letter in

716
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:40,620
1978, tipping him off to Derward Buddy Hack, a CPO radar observer who in 1952 while stationed

717
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:45,740
at the Naval Air Station Sunnyvale, California, disappeared out of sight. While serving at the

718
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:51,180
naval installation, Hack, according to his family, accidentally entered a large door of a hangar that

719
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:57,820
was temporarily unguarded. There, he encountered a massive saucer-shaped craft with rows of windows,

720
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:02,700
and when the guards returned, they forced Hack out and threatened him. Stringfield contacted

721
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:07,340
multiple members of Hack's family, who confirmed hearing the story, including his mother, who not

722
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:12,700
only confirmed Hack's disappearance, but also the saucer story. Hack's mother would hear him say,

723
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:20,540
it was certainly no aircraft of ours. In 1979, 6 February 1979 to be exact,

724
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:25,340
Stringfield received a letter from one Joan Jeffers. Jeffers stated she knew a retired

725
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:31,420
Ustav Colonel who enlisted in the 40s and retired in the 70s. While stationed at an Air Force radar

726
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:37,180
facility, the Colonel would attend weekly commander's calls at the Naval Air Station in New Brunswick,

727
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:44,220
At one such meeting in 1956, the Colonel was shown a film by Major Lester Goldberg that was apparently

728
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:49,900
shot by the USAAF. Interesting side note here, one Major Lester Goldberg did in fact serve at the

729
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:55,740
Brunswick Naval Air Station at this time and was the commanding officer of the 654 Aircraft Control

730
01:13:55,740 --> 01:14:01,340
and Warning Squadron. The film showed a circular metal silver colored disc on the ground. The

731
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:06,860
interior of the craft was well lit and featured smooth walls. The film also showed at least three

732
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:11,660
bodies lying on tables. The beans were short and they all looked similar in appearance,

733
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:17,260
featuring a sheen or gray color. None of the beans had any external ears or hair,

734
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:21,980
all appeared to be dead. Further sources of Stringfield, like the anonymous Lieutenant

735
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:28,300
Colonel X, would even state the Navy housed biologics. Such as in 1975, when Lieutenant

736
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:33,420
Colonel X claimed, quote, bodies are now being flown outside of the US to a secret naval

737
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:39,340
installation on an island in the Pacific Ocean, end quote. Now the US Navy does employ multiple

738
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:45,660
DoD Laboratories and MRTFBs or Major Range and Test Facility Bases in the Atlantic and Pacific

739
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:50,940
Oceans. These include the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center on the Andros Island,

740
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:56,060
Bahamas, and Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii. There is also incredible research

741
01:14:56,060 --> 01:15:01,420
I plan to explore in the future conducted by Dr. Richard Sauter that similar to deep underground

742
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:08,300
military bases, the US Navy employs deep underwater military bases. And those familiar with my

743
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:15,100
discussion of MRTFB will recall such installations as Dugway Proving Ground, Edwards 412th Test Wing,

744
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:21,500
NAWC China Lake, Fort Hachuca, the Nevada Test and Training Range, and more. Lieutenant Colonel X

745
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:26,140
also brought forward an interesting connection to the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual,

746
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:30,860
which claims deceased biologics were taken to the Wright-Patterson Blue Room while living

747
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:38,140
entities were taken to the OpNAC BBS-01. Some have guessed OpNAC is similar to OpNav, which is

748
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:43,980
the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, while BBS is the Bermuda Biological Station,

749
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:50,860
an Atlantic-based installation now called BIOS. In Crash Retrieval Status Reports 3, Case 15B,

750
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:56,460
Stringfield relayed a cat and mouse game with Witness AF and his brother Pete. This story took

751
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:01,420
place at the Naval Air Base Yuma, Arizona, now called the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma,

752
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:06,540
which is directly near Yuma Proving Ground. If you remember back to my video on Dums,

753
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:11,820
the US Army Corps of Engineers took a tremendous interest in building underground installations

754
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:17,420
beneath Yuma County, Arizona. This case in question really frustrated Stringfield.

755
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:21,900
What seemed to be a case of great potential, including the emergence of photographs of a

756
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:27,580
saucer in military custody, became less so with the passing of time. Following a series of alleged

757
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:33,180
interferences, my sources said they feared even greater consequences and backed off into oblivion.

758
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:39,260
Stringfield reckoned this case to either be a ploy or example of the lengths legacy operations

759
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:45,260
will go to silence informants. Witness Pete, a former US Marine, claimed to have photographed

760
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:51,660
a saucer-like craft at the naval installation in Yuma, Arizona in 1967. Stringfield tried for

761
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:57,340
months to meet Pete and his brother AF and organized to receive the photos by mail. AF

762
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:01,660
even claimed to have sent numerous letters to Stringfield that were likely intercepted.

763
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:06,380
Stringfield would speak to the men on the phone and learn Pete had been approached by some sort

764
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:11,660
of agency to stay quiet. An intriguing case to mention, but a massive dead end for both

765
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:17,100
Leonard Stringfield and us. Our most fruitful case in Stringfield's status reports can be

766
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:23,500
found in UFO crash retrieval status reports 3 under case A7. This case takes us to the Great

767
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:30,140
Lakes Naval Base in Northern Illinois in 1973. While we discuss this case, do keep in mind the

768
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:34,940
Office of Naval Research has a major Chicago department less than 40 miles away from the

769
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:41,180
Great Lakes Naval Station. Our encounter comes from one witness R.K., an E4 grade instructor

770
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:47,100
in gunnery school at the Great Lakes Naval Base from March 1973 to September 1974,

771
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:52,940
destined for intelligence school. I myself am aware of R.K.'s true name and am trying to vet

772
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:59,420
this individual. On 14 July 1980, R.K. came to the House of Stringfield and relayed his encounter.

773
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:05,260
In September 1973, while instructor in gunnery school, R.K. was assigned to guard the premises

774
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:12,060
of a large quonset hut at Great Lakes Naval Base with orders not to let anybody within 100 yards.

775
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:17,260
While on duty, R.K. was approached by a naval officer who handed him a sealed envelope to

776
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:22,780
deliver to the commander in the quonset hut. Entering the facility, R.K. observed a strange

777
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:28,780
metallic craft 30 feet in length and 10 feet in height resting on a wooden platform. According

778
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:34,380
to R.K., quote, it was light silvery blue and shimmering. It tapered like a teardrop with a

779
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:39,580
flange running along its topside from one end to the other and there were no windows, end quote.

780
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:44,060
R.K. could not linger in the hut due to the presence of other guards. Thus, he delivered

781
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:48,860
the envelope and returned to his post. R.K.'s encounter bore striking resemblance to the

782
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:54,540
testimony of a sailor he had met in San Diego just weeks prior whilst on special assignment.

783
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:59,980
According to this sailor, a UFO identical to the one R.K. would observe in the coming weeks at the

784
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:05,420
Great Lakes Naval Station was shot down by the Navy between Hawaii and the mainland in June of

785
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:12,540
1973. This UFO was picked up via destroyer's radar and came into view making three close passes and

786
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:18,540
one direct overflight over the destroyer. According to the sailor, the UFO was shot with a lucky hit

787
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:25,500
and crashed into a 350 foot deep water. The San Diego sailor claimed the object was retrieved by

788
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:31,340
the Glomar Explorer and shipped to Hawaii and sent stateside and finally to Chicago.

789
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:36,300
The sailor even provided R.K. a sketch that was identical to what he had seen.

790
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:41,020
But just hold on a second here. The claims of the Glomar Explorer retrieving the craft

791
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:48,060
are of significant consequence here. Glomar was run by Neuro, a joint naval and CIA DS&T effort.

792
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:53,500
If this story is true, this means the Navy, CIA and intelligence organizations such as Neuro

793
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:58,780
downed a UFO and retrieved it from sea. The craft was then shipped to an ONR location

794
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:03,980
where due to being guarded on a wooden platform was likely destined for further transport and study.

795
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:09,100
This incident mirrors perfectly the 2024 claims of Chris Sharpe's informants.

796
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:15,260
Other cases of naval bases and the Office of Naval Research possessing both information of crash

797
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:21,740
disks and the materials themselves are plenty. In 1994, former New Mexico State Rep J. Andrew

798
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:26,220
Kissner stated sources within White Sands Proving Ground and the Naval Research Lab

799
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:32,060
briefed him on recovered flying disks in 1947. These disks were given to the custody of the

800
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:37,580
Atomic Energy Commission and studied by national laboratories such as Los Alamos, Sandia, Rand,

801
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:44,540
MITRE, etc. This is very similar to my modern-day hypothesis of DOE working alongside FFRDC

802
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:50,860
and UARC to exploit UFO materials. According to Kissner's naval sources, the UFO programs were

803
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:56,380
signed into presidential executive order under Truman in 1948 with the National Security Council

804
01:20:56,380 --> 01:21:01,340
serving as program coordinator. With support from the Air Force Systems Command, the Research and

805
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:07,260
Development Board ran by Dr. Vannevar Bush in the Naval Research Lab. Interesting to note as well,

806
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:12,860
in 2005, USAAF veteran Stephen Walker would claim while serving at the Naval Support Facility in

807
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:19,100
Diego Garcia, he was exposed to the Navy conducting sensitive operations outside of a large hangar at

808
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:24,540
the northern end of the airfield. Base personnel were ordered to stay away from this quote-unquote

809
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:29,820
empty hangar. One night while the flight line was evacuated, the base was locked down and personnel

810
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:35,740
were ordered to stay inside, away from windows, for the arrival of a classified aircraft. Walker

811
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:40,860
claimed that despite listening for the craft for nearly half an hour, he heard no jet engine, no

812
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:47,580
brakes, no tires hitting the pavement, no idling, or no Air Force sounds. This experience is very

813
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:52,860
interesting when analyzing the claims of Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet, who claimed UFO programs

814
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:59,100
were moved out of Area 51 in the early 90s because of intensive scrutiny from the public on Groom Lake.

815
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:05,180
UFOs, especially the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle programs, were relocated to various

816
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:09,100
installations including Dugway Proving Ground and Diego Garcia.

817
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:14,060
Special Navy Control Program

818
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:19,020
I must now circle back to early discussion of Neuro and reference back to U.S. Intelligence

819
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:24,460
Committee and discussion of Imigent and Sigint collection from submarines. A program at one

820
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:30,380
time designated the Special Navy Control Program. Special Navy Control Program is quite similar to

821
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:37,100
something called the Navy Special Program, or NSP. The NSP is a highly elusive naval office that's

822
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:42,700
similar to Neuro we can only find snippets of. The first ever mention I can find of the Navy

823
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:49,340
Special Program is in a 1974 Omnibus National Security Council Intelligence Directive alongside

824
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:55,580
the NRO. Remember, the NRO was not declassified until 1992, so this mention of the National

825
01:22:55,580 --> 01:23:00,220
Reconnaissance Program, which is the direct funding mechanism for the NRO, is likely to

826
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:05,900
obfuscate the program. But what exactly is this Navy Special Program mentioned alongside the

827
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:11,580
National Reconnaissance Program, especially in the context of this NSCID, not wanting to

828
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:17,500
bring undue attention to both of these programs? Now, since Neuro was created between the Navy

829
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:23,820
and CIA DS&T, you may think Navy Special Program refers to Neuro. However, the Navy Special Program

830
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:29,260
is itself a very real office. Indeed, the Navy Special Program Office serves as an umbrella

831
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:34,620
control system for several naval clandestine undersea operations. However, in this context

832
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:39,580
and due to the extreme secrecy of Neuro to this day, as highlighted by Inman, Neuro could have

833
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:44,940
certainly been rolled under the NSP. To further this thesis, we can look back to an 11 December

834
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:50,940
1975 declassified memo for the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and others. Here we get a keen

835
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:56,700
look at the organizational structure of the Navy Special Program. The Navy Special Program was once

836
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:01,740
designated to run parallel to the National Reconnaissance Programmer NRO under the Executive

837
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:05,980
Committee for the Director of Central Intelligence and the Assistant Secretary for Defense for

838
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:11,020
Intelligence. Someone really ought to ask Christopher Mellon about the Navy Special Program,

839
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:17,660
seen as he himself served as former ASD slash I. The NSP, according to this memorandum, serves to

840
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:23,900
act for intelligence collection, similar to the NRO, DIA, or CIA. Having previously detailed the

841
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:29,900
duties of Neuro, I do think this description means Neuro is likely hidden within the NSP here,

842
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:35,020
especially given the time frame 1975, where throughout our investigation we see Neuro's

843
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:40,860
activities really ramping up from its creation in 1969 throughout the 70s. Therefore, with the

844
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:46,300
Navy Special Program acting as an umbrella office for numerous Navy clandestine operations,

845
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:52,060
including possibly housing Neuro, it is no stretch to theorize a program that conducts undersea

846
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:57,180
retrievals of anomalous craft alongside Neuro that sends such vehicles to the Office of Naval

847
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:02,380
Research Locations. To then be studied by federal elements and defense contractors would be hidden

848
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:07,820
within the NSP. These operations would be compartmented and rolled under the Navy Special

849
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:13,740
Program Office. This process for Naval UFO legacy programs would likely remain the same today.

850
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:20,140
After all, as of 26 May 2023, we can find requests for approval for Special Access Program facilities

851
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:25,740
by the Navy Special Program Central Office. Naval legacy programs hidden within the NSP for

852
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:31,340
extensive classification and compartmentalization carry sound logic, especially when factoring in

853
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:36,380
statements of former Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet. Admiral Gallaudet has spoken on Congressional

854
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:41,740
Record that whilst he is aware of testimony of Naval UFO legacy programs, he did not directly

855
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:46,940
encounter them or was not briefed during his prestigious position within the Navy. We can

856
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:52,860
find one intriguing acknowledged CIA program that likely utilized the Navy Special Program,

857
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:58,460
Project Palladium and its director, Samuel Gene Poteet. Poteet served at the NRO,

858
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:04,140
CIA DS&T, as well as served as the technical director of the Navy Special Program Office,

859
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:08,940
where he provided Naval Reconnaissance Systems expertise for the CIA Directorate of Science

860
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:14,220
and Technology. Poteet was a senior central intelligence agency scientific intelligence

861
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:19,820
officer, inventor, teacher, and association executive. He, quote, provided scientific

862
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:24,060
expertise on space and naval reconnaissance systems in the Directorate of Science and

863
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:29,260
Technology and served at the National Reconnaissance Office as technical director of the Navy Special

864
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:34,700
Programs Office, and as the executive director of the Intelligence Research and Development Council,

865
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:40,700
end quote. Under the CIA, Poteet spearheaded Project Palladium in the 1960s with heavy use

866
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:47,020
of naval assets, ships, and submarines. The project employed a variety of clandestine submarines,

867
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:52,140
radar reflectors, and jamming tactics to trick and gauge Soviet radar capabilities.

868
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:58,300
Essentially, Palladium performed to fill Soviet radar systems with fake UAP signatures. Of course,

869
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:04,220
our true interest here lies with Palladium's usage of clandestine subs and Poteet's connection to the

870
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:10,060
Navy Special Program Office. According to excellent researcher Jeff Cruickshank, references to Project

871
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:17,100
Palladium can be found in the Majestic 12 documents. The Terse memo, dated 28 June 1961,

872
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:22,700
is a majestic document Ryan and Robert Wood have rated with a moderate to high authenticity.

873
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:27,980
This memo allegedly sees JFK write to the Director of Central Intelligence, Alan Doles,

874
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:30,940
in a National Security Memorandum with the subject, quote,

875
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:36,940
review of MJ-12 intelligence operations as they relate to Cold War psychological warfare plans,

876
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:44,060
end quote. It is intriguing to see Alan Doles did indeed meet with JFK twice, 28 June 1961.

877
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:48,700
Cruickshank argues the psychological warfare plans referenced in the Terse memo directly

878
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:54,540
reference Operation Palladium. Although Palladium didn't get its iconic name until April 1962,

879
01:27:54,540 --> 01:28:00,300
when Dr. Albert Whelan took over as head of CIA DS&T, the description of Palladium would appear

880
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:05,340
again in further majestic documents, and this is supported in the Medium Confidence Operation

881
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:12,380
Review The MJ-12 Project, allegedly written by Alan Doles on 5 November 1961. This document

882
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:18,060
describes how the CIA was mapping the Soviet air defense system by using airborne electronic

883
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:22,780
countermeasure equipment and balloon decoys. Such a purpose was to provide a true picture

884
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:28,300
of how Soviet air defenses perceived UFOs. The memo discussed future similar psychological

885
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:33,580
warfare plans very similar to the Terse memo. Details of Project Palladium appearing in early

886
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:39,820
MJ-12 documents dropped to Jamie Shandery in 1984 prove significant, seen as according to an

887
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:45,180
article by Jean Petit in Stories of Intelligence Research, only six people knew about Palladium

888
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:51,820
in the 1960s. Since Palladium was not declassified until long after 1984, this implies whoever wrote

889
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:58,060
these select majestic documents was well aware or a part of Project Palladium. As a matter of fact,

890
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:03,740
the first time Palladium would be discussed was within a classified manner in a 1998 CIA

891
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:09,420
journal written about by the aforementioned Jean Petit. Historically, the Navy special

892
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:14,380
program saw heavy compartmentalization and incredibly strict need-to-know access.

893
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:21,340
In this 29 October 1974 CIA memo titled Clearances held by NSIC, or National Security Council

894
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:25,500
Intelligence Committee working group members, discussion was held around National Security

895
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:30,540
Council working group programs overlapping certain compartmented areas of the Navy special

896
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:35,740
program. For read-on access, clearance requests were required for a redacted name and National

897
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:42,380
Security Council member and CIA officer Richard Ober. This NSC memo was sent just a few days after

898
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:49,660
the NRO memo from 1974 we discussed earlier. We can additionally analyze a fascinating 14 December

899
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:55,740
1984 memo written to US Navy Rear Admiral and Director of Naval Intelligence John Butz.

900
01:29:55,740 --> 01:30:01,580
The memo thanks John for his personal sacrifices in arranging meetings in spite of a tooth injury.

901
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:05,260
The writer, from within the staff of the Director of the Intelligence Community,

902
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:09,500
additionally informed Butz they had received a letter from the Secretary of the Navy John

903
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:13,980
Layman concerning the Navy special program. Remembered, Layman additionally served as

904
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:18,380
Director of NRO. This letter apparently took a month to get to the desk of the Director

905
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:23,660
of Central Intelligence. The writer additionally suggested John Butz include a representative from

906
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:28,940
Everett Heineman's department on the redacted special ad hoc requirements committee. Remember,

907
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:35,260
Heineman was labeled by Inman as the CIA DS&T member knowledgeable on UFO legacy operations.

908
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:39,820
The work here on the Navy special program is just the beginning for me and the ties to other

909
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:44,780
subjects we have covered today is extremely interesting. After all, I have found and

910
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:50,300
attempted to contact numerous former Navy special program personnel. These include a man who served

911
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:55,420
for three years as a diver in the Navy special program with the Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit

912
01:30:55,420 --> 01:31:02,220
1. I have also contacted one Mr. P.R. who served for eight years as Project Lead for Navy Special

913
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:08,140
Program Office and SOCOM Acquisition Program Office. How interesting this ties into the work

914
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:13,580
of Chris Sharpe regarding USO retrievals, the Navy, and SOCOM. Especially intriguing,

915
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:19,180
seen as Sharpe implicated Lockheed Martin Dry Submersible as participating in USO retrieval.

916
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:25,500
And since 2023, SOCOM has declared operational capability with Lockheed Martin Dry Submersible.

917
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:31,260
And finally, I have contacted one Mr. W.H. who served for two years as an Office of Naval

918
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:36,860
Intelligence Chief Information Security Officer for the Navy Special Program. And please understand,

919
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:42,380
I am protecting the identity of these individuals as they very well may wish to speak on the NSP.

920
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:47,660
So,

921
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:53,260
believe it or not, today we have only scratched the surface of naval UFO legacy programs.

922
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:58,780
In the beginning of this project, I separated naval legacy programs into four distinct categories,

923
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:04,780
monitor, collect, store, and exploit. Of course, monitor has been omitted from today's discussion,

924
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:10,620
as has majorly exploit. Has the Navy successfully created seafaring ARV,

925
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:15,820
a deep sea equivalent to the flux liner? This, of course, will be another topic for another day.

926
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:20,620
Today, we have investigated the Navy Special Program Office, an Office of Naval Research

927
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:27,660
conducting undersea UFO and USO crash retrievals alongside SOCOM, private entities such as Lockheed

928
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:34,300
Martin and Woods Hole, and intelligence organizations such as the NRO, NERO, and CIA, DS&T. We have

929
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:39,420
also discussed a myriad senior naval officials such as Sumner Shapiro, Bobby Ray Inman,

930
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:44,300
and Nat Kobitz, who have all commented on the existence of crash retrieval and material

931
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:50,780
exploitation programs. We have barely begun to dive in and discuss the FFRDCs, Naval UARCs,

932
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:57,100
and DoD, RDT, and E facilities that are highly likely involved with naval UFO legacy programs.

933
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:02,780
Outside of mention of Lockheed, Woods Hole, and SAIC, we have barely even discussed contractors

934
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:08,460
in UFO legacy operations. Outside of sole source contracts, we have yet to really even dive into

935
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:13,660
how legacy operations within the Navy are funded. I have spoken before on Witness Ed, who claimed

936
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:18,540
the existence of a joint UFO reverse engineering program between Edwards Air Force Base and the

937
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:23,580
Nevada Test and Training Range. After his service at Edwards, Ed would proceed to work at the Pentagon

938
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:29,580
for the Air Force's RDT&E panel chain, where he would claim in two separate years $34 and $40

939
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:35,340
billion disappeared to non-authorized transfer of authority funds. Ed would additionally work

940
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:40,940
as liaison between the Pentagon and various defense contractors as an F-35 program subject

941
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:45,340
matter expert. As a test director for an electronics warfare group dealing with

942
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:50,940
reverse engineered UFOs out of the Edwards 412th test group, I have theorized Ed's work on the

943
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:57,740
F-35 also dealt with anomalous technologies. This is no stretch, as the F-35 program has historically

944
01:33:57,740 --> 01:34:04,460
carried an incredibly bloated budget of $2 trillion. Such bloated budgets with backdoor clandestine

945
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:10,620
UFO programs may have also occurred in the Navy, and we may get a keen look at such an instance.

946
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:16,860
In 1985, the US Navy faced a massive controversy for an incredibly bizarre occurrence. Scandal

947
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:24,540
arose when in 85 it was discovered the US Navy had paid Grumman Aerospace Corporation $660 a piece

948
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:30,940
for ashtrays to be included in the E-2C Hawkeye. The Navy only began to investigate how many of

949
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:36,140
these ashtrays had been bought and why they cost so much when an investigator for the House Government

950
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:41,580
Operations Committee discovered this egregious oversight. From this investigation, it had also

951
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:46,940
been determined the Navy was paying Grumman $400 per socket wrench that were used to adjust the

952
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:54,060
seats of F-14s. And the Navy had also increased payments for ground locks from $102 in 1982 to

953
01:34:54,060 --> 01:35:01,580
$2,710 a year later. Shockingly, this investigation would also reveal years prior the Navy had been

954
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:09,340
charging itself $954 for ashtrays. For such infractions, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,

955
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:14,780
who made some contested statements about NeuroAbove, removed three officers prior to any

956
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:20,620
investigation. And Grumman aircraft whined that piece prices were so high due to needing to make

957
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:26,380
a small number of parts to spec. The damage had been done, leading to House Committee investigators

958
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:31,900
looking into larger naval contracts and discovered, for example, profits on aircraft carrier contracts

959
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:40,460
were in excess of $753 million or 29.7 percent. And contractor profits on a single Trident 735

960
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:46,860
submarine were in excess of $96 million or 22 percent. Where was all this excess money on

961
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:51,660
contracts and parts going? I wager since we are discussing contractors such as Grumman,

962
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:56,700
which I have directly implicated in UFO legacy programs before its merger with Northrop,

963
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:01,340
these funds were siphoned off legitimate contracts or parts to fund clandestine,

964
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:07,660
deep-sixed, UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation programs. So after all of this,

965
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:12,940
today has mostly served as an expose into naval legacy crash retrieval operations and

966
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:18,140
necessary logistics. More and more in my videos, I plan to speak on naval and special

967
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:23,580
USO legacy programs. This is due to multiple sources of mine informing me,

968
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:29,260
Navy USO programs are more secretive than even standard UFO legacy operations.

969
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:46,700
And as I said at the very end of this video, from multiple individuals that have worked

970
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:53,340
in legacy programs to are tangentially aware of them have informed me that the US Navy's programs

971
01:36:53,340 --> 01:37:00,300
are the most secretive there are. Why is this? Is it because the Navy deals with weapons technology

972
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:05,820
as in the Randy Anderson case with the gauntlet and the orb that supposedly experienced energetic

973
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:11,340
discharge during recovery? Or is it because the Navy, specifically the ONR, is a pristine

974
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:19,020
stop for craft? Or is it because the transmedium capabilities of UFO are the most coveted aspect

975
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:25,900
of material exploitation and monitoring? Or is it possibly because some of the secrecy stems from

976
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:31,820
the possibility there are undersea UFO bases and inherently if this is where some craft are stationed

977
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:37,180
and departing from, this implies much secrecy. And that sort of makes a little sense as we've

978
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:43,260
seen with Neuro, underwater reconnaissance systems, clandestine submarines are some of

979
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:50,140
the United States most highly regarded secrets. We have five major intelligence agencies, the CIA,

980
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:56,380
DIA, NSA, what am I missing, NRO and NGA, but Neuro is not on there and we've seen and proven

981
01:37:56,380 --> 01:38:02,140
today that Neuro does exist, so why is Neuro not listed? Neuro is really what kicked off my

982
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:06,940
investigation into this subject back in September with the work of Chris Sharpe when he detailed

983
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:14,300
and changed the article about undersea retrievals in the ONR, JSOC, SOCOM, Lockheed Martin, Woods Hole

984
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:19,660
and Neuro, this really kicked off my interest. One of the most intriguing aspects of this project of

985
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:26,780
course was Bobby Ray Inman, a regular of this channel admitting that he was Director of Neuro

986
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:32,540
and I'm really glad we got to explore a little bit more into Inman and his interactions with

987
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:39,260
Echler and Bobby and sorry, excuse me, Everett or R. Evan Heineman as well as Sumner Shapiro.

988
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:45,580
Again, as I stated, I've received no contact back from Heineman and I've also tried to contact

989
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:50,620
Shapiro's family. They have not gotten back to me either. I would like to get statements from

990
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:55,180
some other people surrounding this case, but Neuro really kicked off this operation and as we've seen

991
01:38:55,180 --> 01:39:01,660
with Neuro, as a black program agency, all of its operations have been shrouded in secrecy.

992
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:09,340
Whether this entails usage of the Glomar Explorer, the Halibut, the NR1, the Sea Wolf, there is so

993
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:15,900
much secrecy surrounding Neuro and that bridges really perfectly into the 1991

994
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:21,660
retrieval case under witness Mark. Now, as I said in the video too, I'm still vetting this case.

995
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:26,380
I'm working with some individuals to try to identify Mark, to try to identify the

996
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:31,660
Naval Lieutenant Commander and trying to track down those original sketches. I know Art Bell

997
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:36,300
has passed away and he was the point of contact for both of these, but I am trying to track that down.

998
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:45,260
So, Mark's story involves a DSRV or as I hypothesized from Craven in the work under the DSSP,

999
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:52,060
a DSSV, Deep Submergence Search Vehicle. I think those depth capabilities and mechanical arms and

1000
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:59,660
rigging for retrieval of craft suit a DSSV more than a DSRV because DSRV was specifically created

1001
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:05,900
for transfer of crew from a submarine where a DSSV was specifically tailored, never built,

1002
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:12,060
to retrieve vehicles and to retrieve items. Did this fall under Project Sand Dollar? As we saw

1003
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:18,060
with Project Sand Dollar under Craven as well, Sand Dollar involved items of interest on the

1004
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:24,620
sea floor of particular interest were radioactive or nuclear emitting items. And as we see in Mark's

1005
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:30,140
case, the original side scan from vessels and other vessels that picked up the signature of the craft,

1006
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:36,300
this was emitting some sort of radiation to the point where the DSRV crew initially thought this

1007
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:41,340
to be a downed Korean or Russian aircraft with some sort of nuclear technology. And it is

1008
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:47,420
interesting to see as Mark said he steamed out of Virginia that the 2011 Fukushima documents

1009
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:52,540
detail that DSRV units were ready and able in the east and west coast of the United States.

1010
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:57,500
So let's talk about that incident a bit more because it's very rare we can ever find an under

1011
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:02,780
sea retrieval. The only other example I can think of is Shag Harbor which occurred in 1967 and I

1012
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:07,740
would like to tackle that case in the future, especially because there is testimony of the US

1013
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:11,740
Navy kind of coming in, the US Navy divers, and coming in and really taking over the retrieval

1014
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:19,180
operation. But Mark's DSRV crew observes a triangle. And as I said in the video and as we talk about

1015
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:25,740
in this channel quite often, I oftentimes attribute human origin to triangular craft, whether this be

1016
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:32,060
the TR-3B, the XF-131 Super Sentinel, which I almost put more credence in than the TR-3B,

1017
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:38,460
or other prototypes that we discussed throughout the 80s and 90s in the TR-3B video. But this craft

1018
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:47,260
featured hieroglyphic-like writing alongside its outer edge, which similar to Kexberg and Danny

1019
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:55,260
Sheehan's account is not rare but not common in UFO crash retrieval incidents. The description of

1020
01:41:55,260 --> 01:42:03,020
this craft is very similar to other NHI craft, no landing gear, no mechanical systems, no cockpit,

1021
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:11,820
no glass, no windows, etc. What interests me is the aftermath of the retrieval. Mark states that

1022
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:16,460
after the marine archaeologist and four dives were able to observe the craft and they were able to

1023
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:21,980
get it off the ground and retrieve it, that after a couple hours Mark and his crew were steamed off

1024
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:27,020
site and were never warned not to speak about this incident, warned not to talk about it or

1025
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:31,500
signed further NDAs. Now Mark inherently had to sign NDAs and non-disclosure agreements for his

1026
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:37,580
work on DSRV, which as we know from John Payne or Craven, were sent almost exclusively on

1027
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:41,660
clandestine operations, so it stands to reason there's a heavy amount of secrecy when you sign

1028
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:49,500
on for this crew. But it almost appears as if the steamer of the LPH vessel that discovered the craft

1029
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:54,620
and the DSRV was still trying to figure out what the heck they had uncovered because it took a

1030
01:42:54,620 --> 01:43:00,540
couple hours for Mark and his crew to be steamed off site and they were never briefed on the

1031
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:05,580
incident, debriefed, or discussed it further. I do hope Mark is still alive and I would like to speak

1032
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:11,020
to him, I very much would. And then what is interesting with Neuro as well as the connection

1033
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:17,100
to the 1973 Great Lakes Naval Station case, of course Stringfield published on this back in the

1034
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:24,940
80s. So the Glomar Explorer and its work with Neuro wasn't very well known if at all at this time.

1035
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:30,300
The Glomar Explorer had been known for project Azorian retrieving one-third of the Soviet K-129

1036
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:40,780
submarine, but just the connection of witness JK stating that the San Diego sailor that he met that

1037
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:47,820
saw basically the same craft he saw had told him that it had been shot down between Hawaii and the

1038
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:55,500
mainland by a destroyer and retrieved by the Glomar Explorer. And this was early 1973. And then there's

1039
01:43:55,500 --> 01:44:02,700
fascinating connections that Bobby Ray Inman stated that in the early 70s, 72 to 74 to be exact,

1040
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:08,460
he became aware of the Glomar's activities out in Hawaii. So there's a lot of really

1041
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:14,380
connective tissue here with these statements. And I know I say this in most videos, but our work

1042
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:19,420
with the Navy is really just beginning here. There are so many more facilities we need to look at,

1043
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:26,140
so much more investigation into China Lake because the Navy and if Chris Sharpe's reporting is

1044
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:32,060
correct, the ONR specifically is almost a staging point for housing craft. Now this makes me wonder,

1045
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:36,940
is this, does the Air Force, if they retrieve a craft or the Army, if they retrieve a craft,

1046
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:42,940
do they initially stage at Naval locations to then be transported again? Does the Navy just

1047
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:49,020
satisfy Naval UFO legacy programs for storage of craft or do they also operate alongside Army and

1048
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:54,780
Air Force? This would surprise me as everything I have been told, investigated and seen is that

1049
01:44:54,780 --> 01:45:00,780
Army, Air Force and Navy almost act siloed. Very different programs, sometimes doing the same thing

1050
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:05,420
but almost no communication to adhere to the compartmentalization of these programs where

1051
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:09,980
only the intelligence community overlords really know what's going on between programs. So that

1052
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:15,500
would be really interesting to track down. But anyways guys, if anybody watching this video

1053
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:21,740
has any experiences or connections with individuals who have retrieved undersea craft or know of

1054
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:27,340
stories of undersea craft retrieval, please contact me and I would love to speak to you.

1055
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:31,980
But let me know what you guys think in the comments. This was a wonderful project for me

1056
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:36,380
to pursue and I really hope everybody enjoyed it. Let me know what you think. If you have any

1057
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:42,140
thoughts, comments, things to add, please remember to like and subscribe. I have a Patreon,

1058
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:47,180
I don't gatekeep content, that's not what I do. Only support what you think the channel is worth

1059
