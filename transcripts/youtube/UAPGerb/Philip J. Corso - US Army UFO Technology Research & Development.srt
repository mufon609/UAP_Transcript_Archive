1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,040
Your Army's research and development program is a continuing effort to help ensure the

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,920
survival of this nation.

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,760
Army industry teamwork is essential to the accomplishment of the Army research and development

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,640
mission.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,720
To maintain superiority in our military arsenal, new ideas are essential.

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,680
New weapons must be developed and perfected to meet new requirements.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,280
In these days of explosive advances in science and technology, Army research and development

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,680
plays a major role in maintaining America's military supremacy.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:00,240
You are saying to the human race, for the first time, an official intelligence representative

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:06,320
at a high level from the US government is saying publicly, we are not alone.

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,480
We're definitely not alone.

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,920
Absolutely the data points empirically that we're not alone, yeah.

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,760
You've said that we have, the United States has spacecraft, intact craft.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,080
We do.

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,440
Do we have bodies?

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,040
Do we have species?

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,960
Well naturally, when you recover something that's either landed or crashed, sometimes

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,360
you encounter dead pilots.

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,840
Well the book is really my experience as I lived them in research and development of

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,760
the Army under General Trudeau, Arthur Trudeau, and he drew me back in and put me in charge

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,400
of that and established the foreign technology division for me.

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,360
And these were the artifacts on the crash flying saucer, which we used the word applied

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
engineering.

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,000
Dr. Tello is still alive and knows he helped him.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,320
And we fed these things.

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,620
He gave me the job of finding industry or scientists that were close to these items

27
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,480
and feed us to two of them in normal R&D projects.

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,240
And you're saying these items came from somewhere else?

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,800
They came from a flying saucer.

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,760
How do you know that?

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,200
Because they were marked in the files as coming from New Mexico.

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Roswell.

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Yeah, Roswell.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,960
Well, I think some came, there might be another crash, but these were came from New Mexico

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,600
and Roswell especially.

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,640
And General Trudeau gave me the job of working out a program, put these things out, feed

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,240
them to industry, but there was provisions for you.

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,000
They could have the patents, but they had to feed them out back to us as a competitive

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,760
and to the American people and the world as necessary.

40
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,080
Before the 2023 congressional hearings on UAP, before the Schumer legislation and before

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,360
Grush, the 20th century saw a decorated Lieutenant Colonel of the U.S. Army speak and sign affidavits

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,200
on the existence of non-human intelligence, crashed UAP, and exploitation of technologies

43
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,960
of unknown origin.

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,240
The legendary Philip J. Corso and his infamous book, The Day After Roswell, and lesser known

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,520
but far more impactful manuscript, Dawn of a New Age, have cemented Corso as one of the

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,400
most controversial yet credible UFO whistleblowers of all time.

47
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,140
Lieutenant Colonel Corso's central claims revolve around his time in the U.S. Army serving

48
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,280
as the chief of the Foreign Technology Division, where he claims he not only came in contact

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,920
with autopsy reports of extraterrestrial beings, but also craft and artifacts from UAP crashes,

50
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,760
and discussed how under his command, technologies found in UAP were seeded into U.S. industry

51
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
to give the Army a competitive edge.

52
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,120
But are Corso's grand and epic claims indeed true?

53
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,600
And what can we learn from these claims?

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,720
What valuable research can be extracted from the names, locations, agencies, incidents,

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,640
and technologies mentioned by the late Corso?

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,360
Hey guys, it's UAPGurb and I am thrilled for you to join me as we fully analyze and deconstruct

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:17,080
the testimony of Philip J. Corso and his claims of UAP crash retrieval, NHI biologics, and

58
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,000
reverse engineering of exotic technologies.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,280
Let's conduct a comprehensive deep dive into Corso ranging from carefully analyzing statements

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,560
made in his manuscript to digging through his military record and grand claims.

61
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,640
And some quick bookkeeping before we get started today.

62
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,800
We are taking the global bestseller The Day After Roswell, co-written by Corso, and throwing

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,960
it out the window.

64
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,520
We will instead be focusing solely on Dawn of a New Age, the original notes and manuscript

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,320
of Corso released in Italy in 2003 and the U.S. in 2011, after Corso's death in 1998

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,520
at the age of 83.

67
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,360
We will do this so we can directly study Corso's pure claims without the creative liberties

68
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,120
taken in The Day After Roswell, possibly inserted by the other co-writer Bill Burns.

69
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,440
According to Corso's son Philip Jr., he originally had no plans to release his father's manuscript,

70
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,320
but did due to his father's distaste for the bestseller.

71
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,840
As relayed by Jr., Corso went through The Day After Roswell and highlighted everything

72
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,320
he did not say or did not like.

73
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,160
He got solely halfway through before giving up due to frustration with the book.

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,720
Several individuals were privy to the manuscript before Corso's death, such as Colonel John

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,320
B. Alexander, who remarked on sensational details featured in the book missing in the

76
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
manuscript.

77
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,680
Due to the existence of the manuscript and Corso's son's firm remarks of releasing

78
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,120
the piece to correct the mistakes in the book that made his father furious during his lifetime,

79
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,280
we must give Corso the benefit of the doubt and study solely his unfiltered words.

80
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,160
For example, The Day After Roswell is 130 pages longer than Dawn of a New Age, whilst

81
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,800
the two cover roughly the same concepts.

82
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,280
Day After Roswell adds in details like recounting the time when Corso intimidated the CIA director

83
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,160
of covert operations into self-deleting.

84
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120
The manuscript features no such tale.

85
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,760
Another example is the book originally shipped with a forward written by U.S. Senator Strom

86
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,720
Thurmond, who angrily recounted his statements once learning the book centered on UAP, leading

87
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,880
to an early copy reprint.

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,600
While the manuscript makes mention of Corso's relationship to Thurmond, no such advocation

89
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,720
by the Senator was ever mentioned.

90
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,920
A final example I'll discuss is the missing first chapter from the book, The Roswell Desert,

91
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,280
which describes the Roswell, New Mexico, UFO crash in painstaking detail and passes it

92
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,240
off as an accurate description even though Corso was not present at this event.

93
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,720
So feel free to visit the video description and download both the book and the manuscript

94
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,920
and follow along as we dive into the claims of Corso.

95
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,760
Philip Corso has as ironclad a background in the U.S. armed forces and military intelligence

96
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,560
as does David Grush.

97
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,320
Few other witnesses, even with proven accolades in the U.S. military such as Roswell witness

98
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,040
Walter Haught of the 509th Bomb Group, come close to matching Corso's rank, stations,

99
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
and history.

100
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:22,680
Lieutenant Colonel Corso served in the U.S. Army from February 23, 1942 to March 1, 1963.

101
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,080
The young man initially served in military intelligence during Europe in World War II

102
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,040
before becoming chief of the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps, CIC, in Rome.

103
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,240
At the end of the Second World War, Corso arranged safe passage for numerous Jewish

104
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,800
refugees out of Rome and served as personal emissary to Giovanni Battista Montini, who

105
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,560
would become Pope Paul VI.

106
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Corso also served diligently in the early 1950s throughout the Korean War, performing

107
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,320
intelligence directly under General Douglas MacArthur as chief of the Special Projects

108
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,600
Branch of the Intelligence Division Far East Command.

109
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,200
His work here would focus mainly on prisoners of war, POWs, and missing in action MIA soldiers

110
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,080
during the war, tasked with investigating North Korean POW camps and investigating the

111
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,280
number of U.S. and UN POWs held at each camp.

112
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,760
Corso would even testify in 1992 before the Senate Select Committee on POW-MIA Affairs

113
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,040
on hundreds of American soldiers being abandoned at these camps.

114
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,800
Corso served on the staff of President Eisenhower's National Security Council for four years

115
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
from 1953 to 1957.

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Skeptics and detractors of Corso claimed he was never a member of this NSC under Eisenhower.

117
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,600
However, the 1992 Senate Select Committee hearing report would say otherwise, where

118
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,760
the retired Lieutenant Colonel was clearly listed as NSC staff under the Eisenhower

119
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,320
administration.

120
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,440
We can also analyze Corso's own FOIA military documents, which show him as a member of the

121
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,640
Operations Coordinating Board, a U.S. secret covert operations committee established in

122
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,920
1952 by Eisenhower under Executive Order 10483, which reported directly to the National

123
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,560
Security Council.

124
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,340
In 1960, Corso joined and shortly became commander of the Army's Pentagon-based research and

125
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,800
development program, the illustrious Foreign Technology Division, under Lieutenant General

126
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
Arthur Trudeau.

127
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,280
This Foreign Technology Division is not the Air Force's infamous Foreign Technology

128
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,960
Division born out of the Air Force Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air

129
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,400
Force Base.

130
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,120
This program stems from the Office of the Chief of Army R&D and has almost zero trace

131
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,120
or record outside of Corso's own military documents, and we'll discuss this much further

132
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
later on.

133
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,080
I do briefly want to mention some interesting context to lend to the credibility of Corso

134
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,500
as we dive into his claims.

135
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,600
Viewers of my channel will know of my recent interview with Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson

136
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Davis Memo, where Davis intimately discussed President and former CIA Director George

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
H.W.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,960
Bush's involvement with UAP legacy programs.

139
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,480
Well, let's reference Jacques Vallee's book, Forbidden Science Pacific Heights, which speaks

140
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,200
on Eric Davis and former President Bush Sr.'s professional relationship.

141
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,760
After a candid call initiated by Bush giving Davis advice on his future career, the two

142
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,360
spoke again and saw Davis ask Bush about his interest in Corso's disclosures.

143
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,780
Quote, could it be that Corso was mistaken in dealing with the material he was handling?

144
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,760
Could that have been Nazi hardware?

145
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
End quote.

146
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,880
Talkingly, to the statement on Corso, Bush replied, quote, impossible.

147
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,320
The two topics were clearly separated.

148
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,720
By that time, all German secrets had been processed and filed away.

149
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,240
They were not used as cover for anything else.

150
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
End quote.

151
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,480
Bush expanded on the 1954 alleged landing of non-human intelligence at Holloman Air

152
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,200
Force Base, where allegedly Eisenhower and NHI brokered a deal.

153
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,240
According to Bush, this event really did happen, resulting in a secret project with obscene

154
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,720
When the two spoke again, Bush told Davis he was briefed on legacy programs by Trudeau

155
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,560
at the time of the 1968 Mandel Rivers Congressional hearings.

156
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,240
The book says Colonel Trudeau, however, I do think this is a typo referencing General

157
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
Arthur Trudeau.

158
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,720
Bush Sr. claimed Trudeau told him his man Corso had been asked to testify before Congress

159
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,240
and was able to reveal rumblings of alien hardware that had been distributed to industrial

160
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,280
labs.

161
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,800
The Corso testimony was squashed as a result of this conversation.

162
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,160
And lastly, why did Corso wait until the 1990s to disclose his experiences with UAP technology?

163
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,560
Well, this is because he made a promise to Trudeau he would wait to speak until his death.

164
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:04,640
And General said, when I die, I feel you're released from your oath.

165
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,520
He died three years ago and I started to write it.

166
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,800
Number two is I couldn't talk about people who were with us that I had no right to talk

167
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
about.

168
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,320
In intelligence, like a newspaper man, you don't, your source is not named unless he

169
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,360
gives you permission to name him.

170
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,240
I had no right to do that.

171
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,360
And so my own family, Corso, my son says 35 years, you didn't talk, you didn't even

172
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
tell us.

173
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
So that's right.

174
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,680
Why did I tell anybody?

175
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,360
I had an oath with an honorable man, a great man.

176
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,840
And I wasn't about to betray that oath.

177
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,760
And not only that, I had never any intention of writing a book or putting it on paper.

178
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,160
That never entered my mind on nights in the military.

179
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,320
I never thought I'd write a book or even do a movie on it.

180
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:59,200
That never entered my head.

181
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,680
Shortly before his death in July of 1998, CAUS, Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, published

182
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,040
an affidavit released by Colonel Corso.

183
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,360
This affidavit was signed for attorney Peter A. Gersten of CAUS in order to file a lawsuit

184
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,080
against the Department of Army.

185
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,200
This affidavit reads,

186
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,880
And while stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, I personally observed a four-foot non-human

187
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,600
creature with bizarre-looking four-fingered hands, thin legs and feet, and an oversized

188
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,080
incandescent lightbulb-shaped head.

189
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,240
The eye sockets were oversized and almond-shaped and pointed down to its tiny nose.

190
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,560
The creature's skull was overgrown to the point where all its facial features were arranged

191
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,840
frontally, occupying only a small circle on the lower part of the head.

192
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,920
There were no eyebrows or any indications of facial hair.

193
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,040
The creature had only a tiny flat slit for a mouth and it was completely closed, resembling

194
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,240
more of a crease or indentation between the nose and bottom of the chinless skull than

195
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,600
a fully functioning orifice.

196
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,600
That in 1961, I came into possession of what I refer to as the Roswell File.

197
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,960
This file contained field reports, medical autopsy reports, and technical debris from

198
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,480
the crash of an extraterrestrial vehicle in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.

199
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,080
That I have personally read the medical autopsy reports, which refer to the autopsy of the

200
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,640
previously described creature that I saw in 1947 at Fort Riley, Kansas.

201
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,480
That the autopsy reports indicated the autopsy was performed at Walter Reed Hospital, which

202
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,340
was under the authority of the defendant at the time of the autopsy.

203
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:13,420
That the autopsy report referred to the creature as an extraterrestrial biological entity.

204
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,020
Right off the bat here, it sounds extreme Corso claimed to have observed a mangled body

205
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:23,760
he would later learn was a deceased being from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash.

206
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,540
If you are not well versed with the July 1947 Roswell UAP crash retrieval, I do recommend

207
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,540
doing some homework before continuing with this project.

208
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,260
I'd recommend the Roswell cover up 75 years later, as well as my project UFO Whistleblowers

209
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,100
Volume 1 to hear from some credible whistleblowers on the incident.

210
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,020
For this video, we will be utilizing an array of interesting depictions of the crashed Roswell

211
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,020
saucer.

212
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,660
Based on reports and eyewitness testimony, Corso solely labeled the craft as the Roswell

213
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,420
crashed saucer in Dawn of a New Age.

214
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:01,060
We will explore all of these craft design in a future project solely focused on Roswell.

215
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,740
One night, I was a post duty officer.

216
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,340
Post duty officer means that I was in control.

217
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,340
For that night, I was the one that checked all the guards, checked all security areas,

218
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,420
fact checked the whole post.

219
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,380
I was the duty officer that night.

220
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:23,420
And I went to the veterinarian section and the one, a sergeant I knew very well, was

221
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,060
sergeant of the guard that night.

222
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,500
I told him, Sarge, how's everything around here?

223
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,700
And he said, fine sir.

224
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,940
I told him, you know, they told me to be careful to watch this area because you have a sense

225
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,500
of something sensitive here.

226
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,540
He said, you want to see it, sir?

227
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,220
I told him, yes, let's go look.

228
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,100
And I knew this sergeant very well, he was a master sergeant.

229
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:48,540
I went back and there was five crates there, like five or six, I think it was five.

230
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,940
I listed one up and here's this body there and floating and fluid.

231
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,620
And I looked at it, about 10, 15 seconds, not much more than that.

232
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,220
So I put it back down and I said, Sarge, come on, get out of here now.

233
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,020
I want to get you in trouble because I'm the duty officer.

234
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,020
I can go around, walk around here, but you might get in trouble for coming back.

235
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,260
Just come on, let's go, come out with me.

236
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,860
So we went out and I told him, where did it come from, Sarge?

237
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:25,180
He said, well, five trucks came through, coming through here from an airfield in New Mexico

238
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,100
and they're heading for Wright-Pattison Air Force.

239
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,860
Now, in those days, they wanted all these big roads now, in those days, Route 40 was

240
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,340
about the only cross-country route.

241
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,940
And the route that they took was Route 40, going through Fort Riley, Kansas and then

242
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,540
up to Wright-Pattison Air Force.

243
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,300
And I said, well, stay away from her, Sarge, I don't want you to get in any trouble.

244
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,700
I told him, I can walk around and see them.

245
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,100
So then I started to figure, what was that?

246
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,700
First I thought it was a child, because it was small.

247
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,300
Then I looked at this head and all, and this was only happened a matter of seconds.

248
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:09,820
Then I put the head back down and the head was different, the arms were spindly, the

249
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,580
body was gray.

250
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,780
So right at that moment, I figured, I don't know what this thing is.

251
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,160
Corso's official records do indeed place him at Fort Riley at this date, and he would

252
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,440
claim he was told the convoy of trucks hauling the bodies were headed for Wright-Patt and

253
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,320
came from Route 40.

254
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,300
This is very interesting, as quite often Roswell reports state wreckage was flown to Wright-Patterson

255
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,040
Air Force Base, were deceased by logics transported separately, and if so, why?

256
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,800
Myriad UFO crash retrieval stories feature flatbed Air Force and Army trucks hauling

257
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,060
wreckage away, such as the 1953 Kingman and 1965 Kecksburg crash retrievals.

258
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:56,100
Also an interesting line I'm sure many picked up, the body was referred to as an EBE, Extraterrestrial

259
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Biological Entity, the same phrase used in the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual.

260
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:09,060
This manual describes two sets of EBE, EBE-1 and EBE-2, EBE-1 closely matches the description

261
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,340
of Corso's observed body.

262
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,700
This affidavit provides little more information than Corso gaining first-hand knowledge of

263
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:25,800
the Roswell crash, but fortunately we have his entire manuscript to study.

264
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,780
Just to revisit, the bulk of Corso's testimony revolves around the U.S. Army's Foreign Technology

265
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,860
Division serving to exploit technology of unknown origin, TUO, from crashed UAP and

266
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,140
seeded into U.S. industry to primarily bolster the U.S. Army war machine and, as a second

267
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,500
directive, benefit the U.S. economy.

268
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,780
Through this program, we started feeding it out to industry, but this was not known,

269
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
not on paper.

270
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,940
They went out as normal research and development proposals, not to name something.

271
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,540
Yeah, you didn't put out a report that said there's some alien stuff figured out.

272
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,100
We put out a regular research and development proposal that came from somebody's brain,

273
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:11,160
and also this was known among a select few, mostly combat officers head-to-head.

274
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,480
We kept this among ourselves, because otherwise we were certain that they would have destroyed

275
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,320
our organization, and we had a good organization, General Trudeau pulled it together just a

276
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,080
couple years before.

277
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,300
They were a destroyed organization labeled us as kooks and taking our budget away.

278
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,760
So it had to be.

279
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,720
We didn't cover because we gave it to industry with the provisions, and I'll repeat this,

280
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,880
the provisions were to come back to us with what you approved, a competitive edge of the

281
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,360
economy, give it to the people and to the world if necessary, and take the patents.

282
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,420
This claim dating to 1962 parallels extremely closely the modern day disclosures that branches

283
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:55,120
of U.S. military work closely with contractors under unacknowledged, waived, special access

284
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,080
program in order to exploit technologies of unknown origin to primarily benefit the U.S.

285
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
military.

286
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,320
Let's monitor this evolution closely as we explore Corso.

287
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,760
It is endlessly fascinating to compare the secrecy and centralization of technology exploitation

288
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,840
programs under the Foreign Technology Division as outlined by Corso, all the way to how these

289
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,300
UAP legacy programs may operate today, stove-piped and protected from Congressional oversight

290
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:26,280
nestled within various intelligence agencies and military institutions in league with defense

291
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,200
contractors, UARCs and FFRDCs.

292
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,560
Anyways to the memo, after a brief forward and acknowledgement with the awesome statement

293
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,920
If one passage in these memoirs helps you survive in a troubled world, then all this

294
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,200
work is not in vain.

295
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,000
Corso begins an introduction for the reader.

296
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,220
Philip begins by giving the reader valuable insight into the creation of army research

297
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,160
and development projects exploiting technologies of unknown origin.

298
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,700
And guys moving forward, research and development will now be shortened to R&D and technologies

299
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,940
of unknown origin will be shortened to TUOs.

300
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,100
This sort of inception of a legacy UAP program gives us a framework to understand the construction

301
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,660
and evolution of such programs.

302
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:14,060
Corso also quotes the father of German rocketry, flying saucer researcher and mentor of Werner

303
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,340
von Braun, Hermann Oberth, who once stated quote,

304
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,100
We cannot take the credit for our record advancements in certain scientific fields alone.

305
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,620
We have been helped by people of other worlds, end quote.

306
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,780
1947 to 1958 saw the disorganized dark ages of army research and development.

307
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:37,380
NASA was founded in 1958, killing the army and DoD project Horizon, which served to build

308
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,920
a moon base.

309
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,220
Atomic energy was stripped from the army and handed over to the Atomic Energy Commission.

310
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,300
ARPA, the Advanced Project Research Agency, was also founded, clashing often with Army

311
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
R&D.

312
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,300
It wasn't until 1958, all army R&D was pooled under one single department, the Office of

313
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,180
the Chief of Army R&D.

314
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,140
This was Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau, who handled all personnel, tech services,

315
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,540
laboratory and installations as well as budget.

316
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,780
Trudeau would then create the Foreign Technology Division and designate young Corso as its

317
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,780
chief.

318
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,700
Corso would take quote, all reports on foreign technology which included foreign beings and

319
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,020
events, those not of this world, end quote.

320
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,500
We will discuss this station and division in much greater detail later in the project,

321
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,540
but for now we are focusing solely on the manuscript's introduction.

322
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,780
This led, according to Corso, to the golden age of army R&D from 58 to 63.

323
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,020
However, in this time, the army still faced many challenges impeding their work, civilian

324
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:46,380
control of space efforts, DoD opposers, adverse policy guidance and the animosity of CIA Department

325
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,380
of State.

326
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:53,300
This would all lead to the hyper secrecy of all R&D data pertaining to areas out of this

327
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
world.

328
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,500
All of these materials were compartmentalized and trusted amongst a select few, quote.

329
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,220
Great efforts were made to bring large industry and select laboratories into the army R&D

330
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,700
fold, end quote.

331
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,860
Corso also states quote, the partners we sought and gathered were US industry, a strong laboratory

332
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,820
support and many leading universities, end quote.

333
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,180
I do believe this small line is one of the most crucial aspects of Corso's testimony

334
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,520
believe it or not.

335
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,980
Quite often on this channel, we talk not only about contractors involved in UAP legacy

336
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,580
programs but also university affiliated research centers, as well as federally funded research

337
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,200
and development centers, semi-private institutions.

338
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,540
One such organization created during this golden age of army R&D is an FFRDC I believe

339
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,020
is up to their eyeballs in UAP legacy programs, MITRE.

340
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,540
Officially established in 1958, MITRE was created by MIT Lincoln Labs employees creating

341
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:53,860
SAGE, the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment Program to coordinate radars to produce imageries

342
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,820
of airspace for the military.

343
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,700
A thesis I'd like to keep in mind during this exploration was the MITRE FFRDC created

344
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,580
in part to fulfill the need of army UFO R&D to see technology into US industry.

345
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,780
Of course the foreign technology division was created a year later in 1960, however

346
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,420
Corso does state before his station at the new office, material exploitation efforts

347
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,660
by the army had been ongoing since Roswell.

348
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,060
At an undisclosed date but presumably around the time or just before the creation of the

349
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,980
foreign technology division in 1960, Corso states the top 25 industries on the Fortune

350
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,820
500 list were contacted and meetings were arranged with their board of directors, top

351
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,400
personnel, with the chiefs of army R&D.

352
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,660
Laboratories were strengthened and organized, gathering funds to attract the best and brightest

353
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,000
including foreign scientists such as those brought from Operation Paperclip.

354
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,960
With contractors such as Bell Labs, who is credited with the development of the transistor

355
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:57,060
Two technologies Corso said were leveraged from UAP alongside universities and army laboratories.

356
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,820
This conglomeration, a powerful team, was tasked with exploiting TUOs.

357
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,760
The guiding principle of this army project had but two goals, national security of the

358
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,720
United States and protection of the American way of life.

359
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,920
In a rare Art Bell coast-to-coast interview with Corso and Colonel John B. Alexander,

360
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,040
Corso would state the foreign technology division began to operate with a budget of $2 billion.

361
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:57,360
The first item that would be built from a research contract, we funded the building

362
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
to the first one.

363
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,040
Then after that other people and other agencies funded it.

364
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,440
So we would fund these until it was actually developed.

365
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,600
We had our own laboratories, our comic labs, and the Nigerian labs where our labs at Fort

366
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Belvoir.

367
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,040
Colonel, what aspect of this were you overseeing?

368
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,880
In other words, once you gave somebody a piece of this technology and a budget, what did

369
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
you then do?

370
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,200
Well, I was supposed to keep track of it while I was coming along.

371
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,280
This R, D, T and E funding would equal over $10.5 billion today, quite the starting budget.

372
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,960
The mention of R&D, test and evaluation contracts reminds me closely of witness Ed, who made

373
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,080
claims of a joint UAP reverse engineering group operating between Nellis slash Area

374
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,200
51 and Edwards Air Force bases.

375
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,780
After his service in the Edwards 412th group, Ed would work for USAAF at the Pentagon, serving

376
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,680
on acquisition integration and R, D, T and E panel.

377
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:05,080
It was here, Ed would claim $34 and $40 billion were siphoned off in respective years to non-Air

378
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,640
Force TOA transfer of authority funds.

379
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,520
Here in the introduction, Corso breaks down some of the breakthroughs leveraged from the

380
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,740
Foreign Technology Division and Golden Age of R&D from studying reports and wreckage

381
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,600
from Roswell and possibly other UAP recoveries.

382
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Let's go ahead and break these down.

383
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,120
The first technology are image intensifiers, aka passive night vision devices.

384
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,080
Corso stated the night vision laboratory at Fort Belvoir, Virginia created these first

385
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,280
generation devices with aid from 48 US industries.

386
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,640
All with varying knowledge of the project.

387
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,200
Allegedly, information gathered from the 1947 Roswell crash led to this breakthrough.

388
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,720
Passive systems were indeed constructed by the US Army in the early 1960s.

389
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,420
However, many individuals such as Colonel John B. Alexander challenge this statement.

390
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,340
One of the most contentious technologies discussed by Corso is fiber optics.

391
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,320
This point of Corso's testimony has been highly contentious, like much of the materials.

392
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,800
Allegedly at Roswell, the recovery team discovered what they thought to be a broken wiring harness

393
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,800
with each loose strand end emitting a different color.

394
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,240
These wires were fiber optics.

395
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,440
Bell Labs allegedly utilized this technology to spearhead the greatest advancements in

396
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,120
communication history.

397
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,240
Now this point is contentious because French scientists were indeed working on early developments

398
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,760
of fiber optic principles in the early 1840s.

399
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,520
Bell Labs was involved in the development of fiber optics in the 1970s, where they improved

400
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,440
the technology and minimized loss on mass scale production.

401
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Now let's keep in mind, Corso does say some of the non-human technologies leveraged were

402
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,600
used to bolster human technology, so perhaps this drastic Bell Labs improvement is one

403
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,120
of these instances.

404
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,920
And speaking of Bell Labs, let's remember back to the testimony of Edgar Fouchet, who

405
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,420
who stated that FFRDC's Livermore Labs and Sandia National Labs reverse engineered the

406
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:08,120
propulsion system for the TR3B alien reproduction vehicle.

407
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,440
According to the Majestic 12 documents and the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit reports,

408
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,320
Sandia has also served as a prime site for UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering

409
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,680
operations.

410
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,640
In fact, I have spoken so much about Sandia, I highly recommend committing them and FFRDC's

411
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,220
in general to memory.

412
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:32,340
The telephone company AT&T was given managerial responsibilities of Sandia National Labs by

413
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,400
President Harry Truman in 1949.

414
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:41,700
As of 1925, Bell Labs and their engineering R&D department was placed under shared ownership

415
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,760
of Western Electric and AT&T, very interesting connections here.

416
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,480
Another alleged leveraged technology were super tenacity fibers from one single strand

417
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,860
of fiber that could not be damaged.

418
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,620
The Army at that time, according to Corso, had a tremendous need for fibers for flak

419
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,060
jackets, parachutes, and other military items.

420
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,560
Important to note, Dawn of a New Age states these fibers were utilized to construct composites

421
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,480
for stealth technology in civilian aircraft, while Day After Roswell states these fibers

422
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,780
were used to construct Kevlar, the material in bulletproof vests and made by DuPont in

423
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,780
1965.

424
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,140
Strange molecular alignment techniques were additionally studied from the Roswell crash.

425
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:28,540
The craft showed molecules down to individual atoms, had been aligned in various patterns

426
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:34,740
resulting in incredible hardness and resistance to scratches, stress, strain, and shear in

427
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,460
metals while all repelling cosmic particles and radiation.

428
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:43,260
The chief of R&D of the Army thought this to be a truly consequential discovery and

429
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,100
thus special teams were organized to investigate this chemistry.

430
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,500
Corso stated this atomic rearrangement could lead to incredibly strong yet light spacecraft,

431
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,500
but in 1963, and possibly through 1993, the Army had not solved this issue.

432
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,340
I personally have heard some similar claims that non-human craft employ materials with

433
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,620
interesting, atomic arrangements.

434
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,340
Corso also believed fluid amplification was leveraged from UFO propulsion and guidance

435
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
systems.

436
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,580
Fluidic principles led to the creation of the heart pump.

437
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:20,140
Even though fluidic principles are quite old, they were not utilized commercially until

438
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,660
about 1960 for the demand for reliable controls in space research.

439
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,780
Two of the greatest technologies exploited by Army R&D according to Corso were the transistor

440
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,880
and integrated circuit.

441
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,980
As we mentioned above, Bell Labs first introduced a point-contact transistor in 1947.

442
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,860
Jack Kirby of Texas Instruments introduced the first hybrid integrated circuit between

443
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,660
1958 and 1959.

444
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:51,180
Corso's testimony illustrates a strange transistor with hair-like wires and leads

445
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:58,060
and a chip in a stack of thin, uniformly-shaped wafer-like components found in a crash retrieval.

446
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,700
These formed complete electrical circuits and developed into the micro-module concept.

447
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:08,060
CRD said it would take 50 years to develop the transistor and 200 years to develop the

448
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,060
chip.

449
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,820
It came in a short span of five years.

450
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:19,140
Corso does state this development occurred before the golden age of Army R&D, 1958-1963,

451
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,300
with advancements as early as 1947.

452
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,380
As he states, improvements were made to the existing technologies in 1959 with the introduction

453
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,660
of miniaturization of circuits.

454
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,820
In fact, when Corso began his service as special assistant to Trudeau in 1960, Trudeau would

455
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,520
allegedly show in both transistors and integrated circuits and engage in some philosophical

456
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,560
on the implications of harnessing off-world technologies for human use.

457
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,600
Perhaps this does indeed adhere to conventional history, which states physicist Julius Edgar

458
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,960
Lillianfield proposed the concept of a field effect transistor, an FET, in 1926.

459
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,560
But it was not possible to construct a working device at that time.

460
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,000
It was not until 1947 we saw application of transistors.

461
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,480
The lieutenant colonel also stated the laser, who many program members suggested was the

462
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,760
EBE's method of communication over vast distances of space, was derived from the Roswell crash.

463
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,120
As we know, the laser, which stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation,

464
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,640
was created in 1960 under Bell Labs.

465
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,720
And again, what was the purpose of all of this R&D?

466
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,320
In Corso's own words, quote,

467
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,680
We never quibbled over who discovered or invented a development.

468
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,640
The feeling was if a discovery was adapted to a concrete development, we would all be

469
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,240
ahead in the game and the nation would benefit, end quote.

470
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,200
This reminds me almost identically of the claims made by David Grush regarding secrecy

471
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,440
of legacy program operations.

472
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,200
So the reason for the secrecy exactly is what?

473
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:09,360
Feudalistic dominance, who can have both asymmetric technology for, it seems like, just fueling

474
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,880
the war machine.

475
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:19,120
Grush says that through the 50s and 60s, encounters with the NHI continued, as did the cover-up.

476
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:24,880
Key to mention here, it is stated in the manuscript Extraterrestrials never gave humans a thing.

477
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,400
Not one scientific experiment has ever shown that.

478
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,880
Not one scientific advantage came voluntarily.

479
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,520
Everything was garnered by accident or perhaps force in some cases.

480
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,680
This raises a very interesting point.

481
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,000
Numerous individuals, such as David Grush, have flirted with the subject of agreements

482
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
with humans and non-human intelligence.

483
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,040
If these agreements do not involve technology, what do they involve?

484
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,080
And it's quite clear that you're talking about agreements between America and non-human

485
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
intelligences.

486
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,760
Have we made agreements with non-human intelligences?

487
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,240
That's the kind of information I really hope national leadership is able to get to the bottom of.

488
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,600
I need to pin you down on this.

489
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,840
Are there agreements between non-human intelligences and the American government?

490
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,440
I think that's a question that I would like to know all the details of as well.

491
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,920
Or is it possible R&D programs were kept separate from other compartmentalized

492
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,720
programs that inherited technology, a separation of programs I believe is active today?

493
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,160
I think something a lot of people don't ask that has kind of captured my attention.

494
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,760
During your time investigating legacy programs, did you see much collaboration

495
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,920
or compartmentalization between programs that may exist in Navy, Air Force, Army?

496
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
It's too snow-piped or compartmentalized.

497
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,440
You can't open it up to another one unless there is a need to do that.

498
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,800
That need to get access is defined on a government form called the DD-254.

499
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:08,480
And the DD-254 documents who has access and why and what gets accessed.

500
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,800
And if you're going to have to get access to another compartmentalized program,

501
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,080
then that has to be justified in the DD-254.

502
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,320
And usually that's not justified because programs don't really overlap.

503
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,160
However, Corso's claims NHI technology was taken, not inherited, mirrors closely the claims of

504
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,240
flux liner alien reproduction vehicle witness Brad Sorensen, who was told at the 1988 Norton

505
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,000
Air Show the basis for the ARV, the Roswell wreckage, was taken without the consent of

506
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,600
its operators. Another interesting parallel to today is a contractor Corso makes numerous

507
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,520
mentions to, the Sperry Rand Corporation. Not to be confused with the Rand FFRDC,

508
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,880
Sperry Rand was a major 20th century electronics corporation and military contractor.

509
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,160
Sperry Rand was additionally named in General Trudeau's memoirs as a frequent spot for meetings.

510
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,280
He would often meet with their CEO and directors to discuss army R&D projects.

511
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,200
One such director was the legendary General Douglas MacArthur.

512
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,800
Sperry Rand went defunct in 1986 and many of its divisions became part of Honeywell,

513
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,080
Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman.

514
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,200
Corso then goes on to mention a long list of other benefits garnered from UFO technology

515
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,560
exploration. One I want to mention is anti-missile missiles for the Star Wars program.

516
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,600
Long have I stated the Star Wars program, formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative,

517
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,760
had a secondary function to fund UAP programs and act offensively against UAP. There is indeed

518
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,720
interesting research to suggest although the program was set in place by Reagan in 1983,

519
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,920
Eisenhower established the program for UAP offensive action during his presidency.

520
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,320
The Colonel discussed the need for protection against the EBEs themselves.

521
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,720
The Lieutenant Colonel stated EBEs have performed acts of war with superior

522
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,680
advanced equipment and superior techniques. The threat internally was treated similar

523
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,160
to the Soviets as a fig leaf policy where the Soviets and non-humans threatened

524
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,760
existence but were not considered enemies. These acts included the controversial abduction

525
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,560
phenomena and mutilation as well as quote spying on our atomic installations,

526
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,040
hindering missile and space equipment testing, hampering our military deterrent and nuclear

527
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,880
deterrent, halting and interfering with exploration of moon and mars, causing crashes of aircraft and

528
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,880
casualties among military personnel and tampering with human and animal genome and quote. I would

529
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,280
like to explore some of these more controversial claims in a future project so let's hold on to

530
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,040
this. This passage is key to reflect on as in the revelations of David Grush we have heard people

531
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,360
have been hurt and killed by UAP but cannot attribute malicious intent to these intelligences.

532
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,880
To conclude with the introduction Corso placed much admiration for the individuals behind exotic

533
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,760
R&D. These veterans of World War II in Korea were entrusted with the United States government's

534
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:14,480
highest level deepest secrets. Now that we have spent over half an hour investigating the

535
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,240
introduction of the manuscript we can start to dive in and explore more of Corso's claims in depth.

536
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,280
Throughout the introduction of this document we heard Corso recount for the reader much of his

537
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,480
early military career but quickly let's recap some of his highlights right before he met General

538
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:39,360
Trudeau in his own words. Well your career to the to the point that uh you met the general was a very

539
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:46,800
honorable uh and fairly normal uh military career. It was in conflict just now we were fighting the

540
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:55,040
war in North Africa in Italy and then I joined the general I went to Korea I participated in the

541
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:02,480
Korean War and I joined McArthur staff over there and I came back and when I came back to the States

542
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,400
I joined Stephen Eisenhower as one of the military engineers at the city council at the White House

543
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,120
and there my career sort of changed. I was in the White House for four years and from there I took

544
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:22,160
command of uh of the little Mr. Client the army's Mr. Client range of white fans

545
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,240
then I took the combat Mr. Client and I had the promised warheads even for Germany's

546
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,320
and I became I stayed in command 18 months and then I became Richard General of the Army

547
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,800
and from there I came back to the United States and General Trudeau had reorganized research and

548
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,400
development of the army and he sent for me and I joined him as a special citizen

549
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,000
and he's the point of my division. Corso claimed his military career saw him earn nine clearance

550
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,160
levels above top secret up to the coveted eyes only material for the White House NSC matters.

551
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,920
Achieving these clearances is when the lieutenant colonel would claim he became aware of UFO

552
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,680
information though nothing pertaining to legacy programs or reverse engineering. Since his NSC

553
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:16,560
position occurred from 1953 to 1957 we can wager any interesting UFO information was presented to

554
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,760
him as intelligence staff O for the operations coordinating board attached to the National

555
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,440
Security Council. Corso claimed his superior and the president's special assistant C.D. Jackson

556
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,280
along with President Eisenhower himself were the only individuals aware of Corso's clearances.

557
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,320
C.D. Jackson here is Charles Douglas Jackson special assistant to Eisenhower and government

558
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,320
psychological warfare advisor. Jackson served as liaison between the freshly minted CIA and the

559
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:50,640
Pentagon. Jackson was also a member of the committee on international information activities. Corso did

560
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,160
discuss how in officer school he began specializing in air defense and ballistic missiles twice during

561
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,960
his command of missile units unidentified objects were picked up over New Mexico and Germany

562
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,840
traveling at over 3000 miles per hour. Corso was ordered to destroy any records and tapes following

563
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:13,280
service as commander of the 71st missile battalion in Germany and inspector general of the 7th army

564
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,200
Corso was led to become special assistant to the chief of army R&D lieutenant general Arthur G.

565
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Trudeau quote if Edwin Teller could be called the father of the H bomb general Trudeau could be called

566
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,120
the father of the ballistic missile end quote and now we can get into some of the very juicy details

567
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:36,960
in 1960 Corso entered into his position as chief of the foreign technology division having seen a

568
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,880
small strange body while also being read into some unknown UFO information due to his clearance

569
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,320
levels and had been told of some exotic technologies leveraged from off-world technologies by his mentor

570
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:54,480
and boss Arthur Trudeau but I do find it strange Corso does not write about the 1947 non-human

571
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,160
intelligence body encounter in dawn of a new age as we observed in his signed affidavit this is

572
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,200
especially strange because this encounter of biologics was relayed in the book day after

573
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,240
Roswell so I guess let's go back and hear this story recounted in Corso's own words

574
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,280
and I was instructor at the intelligence school and we had an aggressor force we that I was

575
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,040
so one night I was post duty officer post duty officer means that I was in control

576
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,120
for that night I was the one that checked all the guards checked all security areas

577
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,320
fact-checked the whole post I was the duty officer that night

578
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,000
and I went to the veterinarian section and one of a sergeant I knew very well was

579
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,160
sergeant of the guard that night I told him Sarge how's everything around here and he said fine sir

580
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,720
I told him you know they told me to be careful to watch this area because you have a sense of

581
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:57,200
something sensitive here he said you want to see it sir tell me let's go look and I knew the

582
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,600
sergeant very well master sergeant on back and there was five crates there like five or six I

583
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:10,400
think it was five I listed one up and here's this body there and floating and fluid and

584
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:18,240
I looked at it about 10-15 seconds not much more than that so I put it back down I said Sarge come

585
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,040
on get out of here now I want to get you in trouble because I'm the duty officer I could go

586
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,440
walk around here but you might get in trouble for coming back just come on let's go come out with me

587
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,320
so we went out and I told him where did come from Sarge he said there were five trucks coming

588
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:43,520
through here from an airfield in New Mexico and they're heading for Wright-Pattison Air Force

589
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,760
now in those days young they want all these big roads now in those days route 40 was about the

590
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,160
only cross-country route and the route that they took was route 40 going through Fort Riley Kansas

591
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,880
and then up to Wright-Pattison Air Force and I said well stay away from her Sarge I don't want

592
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,600
you to get in any trouble I told him I can walk around and see them so and I started to figure

593
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:15,200
what was that first I thought it was a child because it was small then I looked at this head

594
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,560
and all right and this was only happened a matter of seconds then I put the end back down

595
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:30,480
and the head was different the arms were spindly the body it was gray so right at that moment I

596
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,800
figured I don't know what this thing is so like an intelligence business I just better put it in

597
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:43,040
back my head here and wait to maybe in the future I get collaboration so I can evaluate what it is

598
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,680
as chief of the foreign technology division the young lieutenant colonel would receive quote

599
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,600
all reports on foreign technology which included foreign beans and events those not of this world

600
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,880
end quote he would spearhead a team of nazi scientists brought over from operation paperclip

601
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,560
as well as us scientists and technicians some of these pieces of technology were known to be from

602
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:10,960
crashed ufos while others were educated guesses corso did recognize his position arose almost

603
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,320
exclusively from his close relationship with the infamous trudeau in fact trudeau personally gave

604
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:22,240
corso what is now famously known as the roswell file a box of materials and files pertaining to

605
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,560
the infamous crash caught me in one day said uh what make you achieve important most division

606
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:36,000
and they're going to have a three drawer file now once you go through this file and look what's

607
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,200
there and you give me a program and tell me what you think they are so I take this file

608
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,160
in my office downstairs from your office the second floor in the pentagon I open it up and

609
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:57,360
I start finding the material which he called later of course it was junk well and there was a bunch

610
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,440
of wires which I didn't know what they were which were in meeting colors I didn't even know if they

611
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:09,840
were wires I had this chip disintegrated circuit a laser instrument they could do like some of the

612
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:19,040
fine cuttings they say the manual medulations and I had also fiber optics something that I had those

613
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:27,520
and we called them we started that because one of my tonight reports on autopsy

614
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,160
that performed along the reed on our lab which refinanced the water

615
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,480
and when I read that it matched with what I saw for rally 14 years before

616
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:46,240
the whole topsy was similar what I'd seen so then I start putting two and two together

617
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,080
and gradually these items will start from then the general called me and I said work out a program

618
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,720
find scientists who are working on these things and shove them in there

619
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,480
I thought but general I have to study these things because really I told him not that

620
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,960
right I don't know what they said all of these things are but they're important he said well

621
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,960
Phil they are important give me a program what they are anyways after Corso was designated as

622
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,880
the chief of the foreign technology division by Trudeau in 1960 Corso was given four subjects to

623
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,600
keep track of one foreign development of this world two foreign intelligence and developments

624
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:32,640
not of this world three act as interim project officer on select r&d projects and four

625
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:39,760
all other duties assigned as special assistant to the CRD for the US army national security

626
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,320
measures meant points one three and four fell into normal categories but point two was a whole

627
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:52,960
different matter many experts in the know felt the army was helpless in the face of NHI technology

628
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,680
let's briefly touch on some more technologies and items featured in the Roswell report given to

629
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,600
Corso by Trudeau we have yet to discuss amongst the physical technologies and reports on artifacts

630
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,280
such as a paper thin high strength metal found at the Roswell crash Corso discovered autopsy

631
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:16,080
reports discussing beings almost identical to what he observed in 1947 accompanying images

632
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,760
show decomposed bodies roughly four feet tall and medical reports detailed heavy variations

633
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:28,480
to human anatomy and organs as well as skin and bone composition these biologics heart and lungs

634
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,600
were very large with a remarkably different muscular structure the beings appear to have

635
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:39,680
skin and bone structure built to protect vital organs from cosmic action cosmic radiation or

636
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:45,200
gravitational pull and it is interesting according to the manuscript a transparent film over the

637
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,640
eyeball of the deceased ebes led to Trudeau mandating the pursuit of passive night vision

638
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,960
technology analyzing every single file he had on the Roswell crash saucer Corso did notice some

639
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,880
odd discrepancies between the beans and their craft the files had no mention of food or

640
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,280
nourishment for the beans in the craft nor mention of water or drinking water or water

641
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,960
for cleansing the body the files made no mention to refrigeration equipment no mention of medical

642
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,320
equipment besides what the recovery crew guessed was a first aid kit and there was no toilet or

643
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:25,040
waste disposal facilities or no rest and no recreation facilities Corso and the OCRD believed

644
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,960
these beans to be clones or at the very least expendable creatures sent by some sort of

645
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,000
intelligence the chief even believed the Roswell craft to be a reconnaissance craft that would

646
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,360
return to a mothership for necessities the lieutenant colonel also reasoned possibly this

647
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:47,280
species had solved gravitational time dimensional travel and could instantaneously return to their

648
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,920
base throughout the manuscript Corso would often hint at multiple UAP or crashed flying saucers

649
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:00,000
analyzed it is frustrating we don't get a total count besides confirmation of the Roswell crash

650
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,520
as well as the 1947 July San Agustin New Mexico crash in which allegedly a flying saucer crashed

651
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:14,240
with no seams joint lines rivets or weld joints this is a ubiquitous description in almost all

652
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,840
UFO crash retrieval reports so when I start putting all this on the extraterrestrial together

653
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,160
I finally gave it a name I told him it looks like you know these are clones

654
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:31,600
and so the name came out extra extraterrestrial biological entity that's what we figured they were

655
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,400
better describe it we never used the letters et there was no such thing

656
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,720
you said that they looked like clones how they were clone not look like they were clones

657
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:51,360
we figured that they were created by some some other intellect and we also came to the decision

658
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:59,280
that they were made specifically to travel in space because we knew even in those days

659
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:07,040
that man could not travel in space some bones are affected his muscles are affected his brain is

660
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,720
affected man cannot travel in space so we came to inclusion of these creatures whatever they are

661
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:20,800
are made to travel in space and gradually through work we did we found out that disintegrated with

662
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,200
the flying saucer and with you because most of the failures make the flying saucers work

663
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:31,440
or the guidance system that this creature was also the guidance system was part of the engine

664
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,640
of the flying saucer it is also fascinating to see how the team was inspired and attempted to

665
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,800
study harnessing brain waves to control aircraft and anti-missile missiles this inspiration came

666
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,400
from apparent discoveries that these extraterrestrial biological entities were part of the craft's

667
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,520
guidance systems this may seem like science fiction however we do live in an age where

668
00:53:53,520 --> 00:54:00,080
consciousness connection is indeed discussed with ufo craft piloting and we came to a conclusion

669
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,880
even in those days that these are the reason most flying saucers have failed is because our

670
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:11,040
conclusion was that this being is part of the guidance system he's part of that saucer i've

671
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:18,080
just had one of the most senior scientists in the u.s defense department's former admit to me that

672
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:27,440
he was read into a ufo crash retrieval program i've spoken to well over 20 people now what i

673
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:38,080
was told consistently was the technology is mind-blowing and they are not in a position

674
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:46,880
to be able to engineer it yet because it's just light years beyond what we have it's it's a

675
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:53,520
completely new type of physics is what one person said to me and you might be interested in this j

676
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:03,280
because of the sort of direction that your interests have taken without expanding on it

677
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:10,720
one of the people i spoke to told me that it had a lot to do with a mind interface connection with

678
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,560
the engineering that it was driven by some kind of consciousness or some kind of

679
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:23,680
intelligent connection with machinery that was beyond our understanding shockingly we can add

680
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:29,280
even more context these claims by analyzing the files of the legendary lennard stringfield

681
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,400
and take a look at a report of a possible recovered vehicle or alien reproduction vehicle

682
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:40,880
that utilized headband transceivers to operate quote lenn spoke to a mr hinds who had a source

683
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:46,000
from bell labs the informant stated that he was on the flight line at a california air force

684
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,320
base in the early 1950s and saw a ufo retrieval brought in he allegedly saw a cutaway of the

685
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:57,760
recovered craft plus the headband transceivers worn by the aliens anyone involved with the

686
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,960
retrieval was subject to intense scrutiny and search apparently one man must have kept a part

687
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,800
of the craft and he mysteriously disappeared he was never seen again the source feels that the

688
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:14,560
man was eliminated end quote chief corso somehow stumbled upon information that the soviets were

689
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:20,320
running their own parallel tuo exploitation program this may have stemmed from soviet

690
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:25,360
spies in new mexico tipping off stalin to the roswell crash where stalin allegedly gathered

691
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:32,000
the ussr's brightest to discuss the captured saucer quote some of the items found and analyzed by the

692
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,360
russians possess a similarity of items gathered in the united states others closely resemble

693
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:42,640
material collected by the u.s army soon after the crash end quote impactful statement as

694
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,640
recently dr eric davis confirmed the soviets did indeed observe and collect at least one crash

695
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:54,320
retrieval in their own territory it is unknown how exactly corso came across this intelligence

696
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:00,160
regarding the soviets but it is no surprise after the words of david grush grush says the united

697
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:08,000
states is not the only country that's encountered nhi and their technology he says our geopolitical

698
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,400
rivals have their own crash retrieval programs which they are also secretly exploiting for

699
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,640
military purposes we're in a competition with their adversaries to understand this

700
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,680
and it's a it's a multi-decade cold war that has been under our nose for so long and

701
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,920
you know there is no good way to level the playing field and hold other nation states accountable if

702
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:38,320
they're doing unethical or illicit activity as it relates to this subject however far down the line

703
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:44,560
in 1993 corso would ask old acquaintances to acquire about recovered materials from a kgb

704
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:51,520
general while much of the information was still held as top secret by kgb and gru corso was given

705
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:57,040
a list of materials you can see on screen now let's temper our expectations as this list could

706
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:02,240
easily have been disinformation given to corso however one piece that stands out to me was a

707
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:10,320
silvery tube found in the u.s in 1975 i wonder if this possibly relates to the august 1974 chihuahua

708
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:15,680
mexico crash i covered in which a u.s rapid recovery team relieved a deceased mexican army

709
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:21,440
squadron of a recovered craft possibly the soviets traced this recovery and found materials missed

710
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:27,440
by the convoy the foreign technology division was working with lasers anti-missile missiles

711
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,960
and directed energy weapons near the tail end of corso's career lieutenant general trudeau

712
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,720
retired in 1962 and the lieutenant colonel followed him shortly in 1963

713
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:49,120
now what more can we learn about the foreign technology division and general arthur trudeau

714
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:54,400
trudeau is a member of the military intelligence hall of fame the general served in world war two

715
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:00,560
in the korean war trudeau served as chief of army intelligence but was relieved by alan dolez director

716
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:06,880
of the cia possibly for his extremely rigorous anti-communist stance the general was shortly

717
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:14,080
reinstated and eventually in 1958 the golden age of army r&d began according to corso trudeau would

718
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:19,600
then return to washington as director of army research and development the general was so

719
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:25,920
influential to the army he was one of eight former generals included in the army's 1970s oral history

720
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,600
project funny enough when trudeau was interviewed for this project corso was found to be spending

721
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:36,720
time with his friend trudeau in his kitchen this speaks to the close relationship of the two and

722
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:42,880
their friendship during and after their service and outside of corso we have only one interesting

723
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,960
piece to link the general to uap let's remember all the way back to forbidden science where dr

724
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,760
eric davis claimed bush senior stated he was indeed briefed by trudeau at the 1968 mendel rivers

725
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:01,360
congressional hearings now i'm sure many are familiar with the united states air force's

726
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:08,640
foreign technology division that operated out of right patterson from 1961 to 1991 to reiterate

727
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:15,280
the office created by trudeau and chiefed by corso was not this infamous division the air

728
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:21,200
force program evolved from air technical intelligence center in 1961 and was assigned

729
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:26,400
under air force systems command the division reportedly operated on recovered russian mig

730
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:32,080
jets however due to the stove piping of ufo legacy programs it would not be shocking to

731
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:37,360
think perhaps this program also engaged with technologies of unknown origins parallel to

732
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:44,080
its army department let's reference us army colonel john b alexander's book ufos myths

733
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:49,760
conspiracies and realities i know i've had my problems with alexander before and his discussion

734
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:56,720
of the som 101 majestic 12 special operations manual however this quote is important quote

735
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,520
corso stated that he had been transferred back to the pentagon under trudeau and a division had been

736
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:06,240
created for him called the foreign technology division this is not to be confused with the

737
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:11,680
large foreign technology division of the u.s air force at right patterson ohio it was learned that

738
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,120
the army foreign technology division was formed as corso stated and then disappeared shortly after

739
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:23,040
his retirement end quote this is a fascinating point as after general trudeau four star general

740
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:29,280
dwight e beach took over command of army rnd and from there on out we find nothing of foreign

741
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:36,800
technology division why is this army rnd office proven to exist yet zero foya documents newspapers

742
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:42,400
or online articles exist about the correct program numerous references can be found to

743
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,160
the air force's foreign technology division but not the army's i find this very similar to the

744
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,760
army's interplanetary phenomenon unit which was discovered through foya to exist only throughout

745
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,680
institutional memory in the army i do believe this inability to track down the army's foreign

746
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:06,640
technology division to be of extreme consequence if corso's testimony is indeed true there is much

747
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:13,120
value we can extract here regarding uap legacy program operations this would mean the office of

748
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:19,440
the chief of army rnd created a very real program hidden and shadowed from the public eye by the

749
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:25,040
publicity of its big air force brother at right patterson throughout the manuscript corso would

750
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:30,560
even comment passively on this difference stating project moon dust and blue fly reported materials

751
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:35,600
and intelligence directly to the air force's foreign technology division out of right pat

752
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:41,040
and we can do some really interesting research by reading a primer on research and development

753
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:47,680
in the u.s army we can see in 1958 under trudeau the army established the army research office

754
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:53,040
under the ocrd due to pressure from civilian scientists which served as a single contact

755
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:59,920
in the army to maximize army rnd efficiency remember corso stated army rnd truly began

756
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:07,280
to flourish in 1958 when army began doing rnd away from civilian and institutions with prying eyes

757
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:12,400
one can then reason the foreign technology division may have run parallel to the aro

758
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,120
army research office out of civilian and congressional oversight this reasoning can

759
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,920
be further supported when the document states the army chief of rnd would have a parallel

760
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,680
line of authority to handle technical services on matters in his area this would in turn give the

761
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:33,760
chief of rnd trudeau authority on assignment of key personnel and allocation of rnd funds to

762
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:40,800
technical services this rnd primer document also reveals some startling revelations the army's

763
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:46,480
initial needs for managing rnd efforts led to the creation of university research initiatives

764
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:54,000
uri's independent laboratory in-house research ilir and independent research and development

765
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:00,480
programs irads some of you may remember irads as a funding mechanism for legacy programs mentioned

766
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:09,040
by david grush furthermore these uri and ilir programs would eventually lead to uarc and ffrdc

767
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,800
two types of military and federally controlled semi-private groups that likely operate heavily

768
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:20,960
with ufo legacy programs what a fascinating document there is absolutely more to explore

769
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,560
here such as the thesis of how legacy program architecture was born out of army rnd

770
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,920
i do want to spend some time visiting some of the smaller aspects to corso's disclosures we glossed

771
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,600
over discussing the manuscript corso additionally made some extremely interesting claims regarding

772
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:49,680
some information he gathered long after his service corso allegedly learned that in february

773
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:56,240
of 1987 colonel herald e phillips of the defense intelligence agency chaired a pentagon group

774
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:02,640
called the ufo working group this group apparently still in existence at the time of the manuscripts

775
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:11,360
writing in 1993 originally consisted of 17 men one army and three air force generals dia scientists

776
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:17,520
an army colonel three nsa officials a supervisor from the cia's domestic collection division

777
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:23,120
as well as a technical team from the cia science and technology directorate well for one where is

778
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:29,360
the navy here as the navy is likely up to its eyeballs in ufo legacy programs such as the

779
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,880
off-world technologies division housed at the naval surface warfare center in crane indiana

780
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:41,120
it seems strange that between 1987 and 1993 corso and his ufo working group intelligence

781
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:47,120
source would not know or not make mention to the navy's dealings in uap legacy programs

782
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:52,000
but let's go back to the mention of the cia science and technology directorate and how it

783
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,800
is of extreme importance here by numerous accounts the cia ds and t is where the quote

784
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:05,520
unquote ufo portfolio is held according to eric davis as well as chris sharp and many others the

785
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:11,120
director of this position glenn gaffney was the individual who stopped lockheed martin from

786
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:20,080
divesting uap material to osap in 2008 additionally former cia ds and t deputy director doug wolf

787
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:26,640
helped create the cia office of global access in 2003 which was accused by excellent journalist

788
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:32,880
chris sharp as serving as a logistics coordinator agency alongside jsoc joint special operations

789
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:39,360
command for uap crash retrieval corso was way ahead of his time to make mention to this

790
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:46,080
this ufo working group according to corso also received funding from us army inscom intelligence

791
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:51,600
and security command founder major general albert stubblebine in the last few projects

792
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:56,480
i have done i have talked at length about stubblebine and his likely work in uap legacy

793
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:02,880
programs including fort hachuka in the 1960s stubblebine was also allegedly the man who tried

794
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:09,200
to pay off steven greer in the 1990s and the alleged founder of the nsa's men in black

795
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:14,480
treat tactical reconnaissance engineering assessment team we'll skip over this for now as

796
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:20,960
we cover this in depth with edgar fusch and the flying triangle arvs but for now how about this

797
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,720
inscom special forces unit the illustrious intelligence support activity isa was handed

798
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:33,920
over to jsoc in 2003 the same year wolf constructed the cia office of global access which allegedly

799
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:41,440
used jsoc for uap retrievals isa is often known as the most secretive and clandestine of jsoc units

800
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:49,040
even outside of the ufo working group just how intimate is us army inscom with legacy programs

801
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:55,200
and does this working group not sound very similar to a majestic 12 like structure

802
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:00,400
let's take this time to briefly point out another distinction between the book and the manuscript

803
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,080
in day after roswell claims are made of working adjacent to roscoe hillencoder and the infamous

804
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:12,400
majestic 12 personnel list under eisenhower and truman dawn of a new age sees corso recognizing

805
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:18,320
the eisenhower briefing document report but how he never saw the report at the nsc and white house

806
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:28,720
the vast majority of criticism against corso comes from analysis of the day after roswell and his

807
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:34,320
claims of technology seeding the lieutenant colonel's military accolades are beyond question

808
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,520
we have already addressed the stark differences between the manuscript and the book the book

809
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:46,320
clearly added myriad details to spice up the story of corso the manuscript is well it's tough reading

810
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:52,080
but it gives us an unbridled look into corso's experiences the manuscript was also completed

811
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:56,240
prior to the release of the day after roswell colonel alexander and others were shown the

812
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:01,760
completed manuscript around the time of the book's release while alexander joc valet and others are

813
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:08,000
still very critical of corso's they all maintain the lieutenant colonel story never wavered details

814
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,080
were never altered added or subtracted corso sounded like a tape recorder you could rewind

815
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:19,600
or fast forward to parts of his disclosures and always hear the same details never any wavering

816
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:26,320
allegedly corso had but 24 hours to edit the day after roswell book which led to no oversight on

817
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:32,480
all the creative liberties in the piece one must ask why the subject of this non-fiction book

818
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:38,160
was stripped of all creative control of the project in his book john b alexander details a

819
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:43,200
letter he wrote to corso about all the issues related to the day after roswell mind you these

820
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:48,000
criticisms are all leveraged towards the book still interesting to keep in mind and i highly

821
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,640
recommend looking at this nonetheless link in the description many discrepancies regarding

822
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:57,440
technology seeding has been thrown at corso some of which we have already addressed jock

823
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,000
valet for example well versed in computer science stated corso's assertions regarding

824
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:08,080
integrated circuitry were not documented facts colonel alexander himself had specific issues

825
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:14,160
with the passive night vision system mentioned by corso alexander stated the genealogy of infrared

826
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:19,600
and nvg technology can all be accounted for alexander detailed how he spoke to the director

827
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:25,440
of night vision laboratory at fort belvoir virginia dr lou cameron who flatly denied how an

828
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:31,280
eye lens of nhi aided in passive night vision breakthroughs legendary researcher stanton

829
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:37,760
friedman was also extremely critical of corso associating him with bob lazar which in my opinion

830
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:43,520
regardless of skepticism against corso is very inappropriate friedman criticized corso for his

831
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:49,040
grand story absent of evidence this is a viewpoint i can absolutely empathize with but what does

832
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:56,880
stanton have to say now entirely differently in terms of background lieutenant colonel philip

833
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:02,720
j corso came out with the book on the 50th anniversary of roswell first published right in

834
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:12,400
roswell called the day after roswell in which he claims that when he was at the foreign technology

835
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,640
desk of the army research and development command at the pentagon under general trudeau

836
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,880
he surreptitiously slipped a filing cabinet full of advanced technology wreckage from roswell

837
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:29,920
into the hands of american industry and he saved the world that's how we got kevlar and

838
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:37,680
micro integrated circuits and a whole long list of things and uh it was a great story

839
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:44,720
and the forward of the book was by senator strom thurman the oldest serving member of

840
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:53,360
the senate who said nice things about corso but in his intro his forward says nothing about roswell

841
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:59,600
in his manuscript and book corso was indeed what you could describe egotistical but in his memoirs

842
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,920
he never once claimed to have been some sort of world savior he was very patriotic and simply

843
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:11,360
aimed to strengthen the army this is obviously not friedman's fault as the book was his only

844
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:17,440
available analysis on corso at the time well to make a very long story short when you start

845
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:23,360
checking on colonel corso lieutenant colonel corso things just don't check out he provides no

846
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:30,800
validation for any other claims there's no index in the book either they say new documents finally

847
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:36,960
released there's nothing new in there and many people have gone through i know one phd who was

848
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:43,040
a colonel in the military who sent me a list of 92 false claims made in the book

849
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:50,080
92 i mean just technically wrong all over the place well you can blame that on the co-author maybe

850
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:57,520
but uh some of the discoveries of physicists just won a nobel prize for example for work done

851
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:04,800
three years before corso was connected with the army research and development group he's a nice

852
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:16,480
gentleman i met him while he was alive uh but his claims senator thurman withdrew his forward

853
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:20,720
wasn't in the next edition of the book because it was written for an entirely different book

854
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:28,160
about corso's activities corso talked about the fbi his good buddy hoover when his fbi file was

855
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:34,320
released uh hoover had nothing but bad things to say about corso now it muddied the waters

856
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:39,120
and got a lot of attention why would such a distinguished military man well the real

857
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,560
military people will tell you he only made lieutenant colonel after 22 years in a lot

858
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:51,360
of lieutenant colonels not nearly as many full colonels so it's another example of taking

859
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:57,200
advantage opportunism if you will uh he also claimed that he was a member of the national

860
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:01,120
security council and a sworn statement for a lawyer was going to go after the government to

861
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:07,280
spill out all colonel corso's files well i checked with the eisenhower library he not only was never

862
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:12,240
a member of the national security council which is very prestigious indeed he never attended a

863
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,320
meeting of the national security council he was a liaison between the security council and some

864
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:27,520
other groups but it doesn't help ufology to have this kind of thing going on people accept a great

865
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:35,280
deal and his book sold well but i'm sorry it isn't what it claims to be

866
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,440
it's not a real expose of the truth about roswell and flying saucers and

867
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:50,640
government's new technology cut now in july of 2024 john greenwald and the black vault published

868
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:57,200
documents released by the fbi on corso and no no documents discussing ufos a portion of these

869
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:03,600
documents pertain to in 1964 to 65 fbi background check on corso for his perspective position on

870
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:09,600
the immigration and national security subcommittee of the house of representatives corso had allegedly

871
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,080
provided some unfounded claims in the past according to these documents delivering a list

872
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:20,080
of fabian socialists to his good friend arthur trudeau the fbi was unable to validate these

873
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:26,400
claims corso was also investigated for spreading claims garnered from cia sources that lee harvey

874
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:33,600
oswald assassin of jfk was an fbi informant now oswald being either an fbi or cia informant

875
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:39,360
probably does not seem too unlikely to everybody regarding a soviet defector michael golanowski

876
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:45,920
the fbi documents state quote another government agency has characterized corso as a parasite who

877
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,280
has never produced any intelligence through his own efforts but has profited from information

878
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:56,720
developed by dedicated government agents and investigators end quote all of these critical

879
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:02,560
files on corso were cross references and not main files meaning the fbi never officially

880
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:08,160
investigated corso from these files it does appear corso like to quote unquote waste the

881
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:14,800
fbi's time making accusations no content here actually discusses his duties with the foreign

882
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:20,560
technology division let alone the army and of course it is odd the selection of documents

883
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,760
released when they were released why are there no documents on corso's army position and why are

884
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:31,040
there no documents on the foreign technology division my greatest issue with corso arises

885
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:38,240
from a massive firsthand experience relegated to the very end of his manuscript remember corso

886
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:45,040
claimed to have witnessed an extraterrestrial body in 1947 observed ufos on radar at ballistic missile

887
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:51,440
sites in 1958 and 1959 and eventually studied materials recovered from uap crashes for the

888
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:56,880
foreign technology division corso's affidavit says as much without reference to the nike missile

889
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:02,160
site encounters however at the end of this manuscript corso recounts an incident while

890
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:08,080
in command of a missile silo at white sands missile range corso claimed while driving alone

891
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:13,760
in an isolated area he sought shelter from the heat in an abandoned mine within the mine he

892
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:20,240
claimed to have encountered face to face a bean of non-human intelligence the bean was drawn in

893
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:26,080
corso's manuscript and communicated to him telepathically we can also see him relay drawings

894
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:31,920
of this bean in a long lost interview featured on weaponized with george napp the bean wished to

895
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:37,120
leave the surrounding area however active radar interference from nearby installations were

896
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:43,040
preventing its craft's departure a common theory by corso and some roswell researchers is radar

897
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:49,520
systems interfered with craft navigation leading to crashes i am still very skeptical on this point

898
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:56,160
corso asked the bean what he would get in return for lowering the radar coverage the bean responded

899
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:02,640
quote a new world if you can take it and quote corso would then grant the beans wish when he

900
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:08,400
returned to his installation this experience was so profound to him he would often contemplate the

901
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:15,360
meaning of the statement during life corso would even relay this story to john b alexander george

902
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:23,520
napp and possibly others including a film to his grandchildren somehow danny sheehan saw i found to

903
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:30,960
be extraordinarily important the the little eight millimeter home movie that uh that colonel corso

904
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:38,640
actually produced to be shown to his grandchildren after he died this this is this i found to be

905
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:44,800
extraordinarily persuasive that he and i got to see the film uh but it wasn't supposed to be shown

906
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:51,360
till after he died and uh and i was shown the film uh and it shows him talking to his grandchildren

907
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,400
saying that even though i'm gone now i wanted to make sure you understood this and what he did he

908
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:04,000
talked about the fact that back in 1945 in july uh when before we had even dropped the bombs on

909
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,800
hiroshima in nagasaki while they were experimenting with the nuclear bomb uh out in the desert at uh

910
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:18,160
alamogordo and white flats uh that in uh new mexico he he in fact was one of the the security

911
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:25,760
officers there uh and he said that they were seeing ufos he told his grandchildren uh from

912
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:32,560
from the grave basically on the bit and little eight millimeter home movie that he had been there

913
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:38,320
and that saw the ufos and that he took a lunch break to go leave and went off into the hill

914
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:44,080
somewhere to go to lunch and he saw one of the craft that had landed uh it had been somehow

915
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:50,960
disabled by the radar that was up all around the proving grounds uh and he had a direct contact

916
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:58,000
with the ufo occupants of the vehicle and they they communicated to him telepathically to please

917
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:05,920
take down the radar just temporarily to allow them to flee uh and he actually did that he told

918
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:11,840
his grandchildren he went back and as a range officer ordered them to shut down the the radar

919
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:19,280
for just a short time to do some kind of recalibration of it and at that point the ufo craft fled

920
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:25,040
uh shot off into the sky now that's that's corso talking to his grandchildren

921
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:31,840
in a in a private never intended to be made public uh eight millimeter film and so i found

922
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:39,280
that quite convincing about corso uh so when corso reports that he was actually put into possession

923
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:45,040
of some of the technology that had been recovered from the roswell crash i tend to give it a

924
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:52,480
considerable amount of credibility and the fact that the the various uh aero uh aerospace uh

925
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:57,680
corporations try to set forth some sort of a long explanation about how they really developed the

926
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:03,440
silicon chip they really developed the fiber optics they really developed uh the other uh

927
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:10,240
technology that corso attributes to the roswell crash that's exactly what they would do there's

928
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:14,640
any doubt about it that they would obfuscate and they would try to construct some sort of an

929
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:20,080
alternative explanation for how they develop themselves this technology and so i'm just saying

930
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:28,320
that i find the corso uh testimony more credible than many people do i must be very clear here how

931
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:34,400
shehan is indeed incorrect about the 1945 date corso claimed this event occurred when commander

932
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,600
of the ballistic missile firing range at red canyon part of white sands this station was in

933
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:47,840
1957 to 1958 my issue here is this is a truly consequential encounter if true initially i

934
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:53,200
believed this passage to be a dream or metaphor until i read more about how many others corso

935
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:59,120
would tell this story to unfortunately this is an issue that plagues much of the ufo realm

936
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:04,320
witnesses stating disclosures then adding well and then this happened and then that happened far

937
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:10,000
after their initial disclosures one would imagine such an intimate encounter with a non-human

938
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,240
intelligence biologic would be featured in most of corso's disclosures make of this passage what

939
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:21,360
you will however it does leave somewhat of a sour taste in my mouth that such a dramatic

940
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:28,640
encounter is relegated to the very back part of his manuscript hey guys it's uap gerb thank you

941
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:34,000
so much for joining me as we took this 90 plus around 90 minute deep dive into the claims of

942
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,400
lieutenant colonel philip j corso now before we get started and kind of uh give this conclusion

943
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:45,360
a lot of the time you'll see corso mentioned as colonel philip j corso i have never once been

944
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:51,200
able to verify that corso was indeed a full bird colonel so thus i try to stay true to what i know

945
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:56,400
as fact and what i've seen on his military records and call him lieutenant colonel philip j corso

946
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:04,240
so the reason i took on this project quite often i'll see people either pro corso or anti-corso and

947
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:09,680
much of their arguments crux on the day after roswell book a lot of the people who disregard

948
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:14,880
corso or put away his claims have a unsavory taste in their mouth from the day after roswell

949
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:21,520
whether that be to some of the unsubstantiated and wild claims such as um corso forcing a cia

950
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:27,440
guy to self-delete or some of the egotistical megalomania of course so in the day after roswell

951
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:33,280
book about him being a world savior and just some of the uh perfect synchronicities of you know

952
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:39,040
perfect descriptions of the roswell crash and roscoe hillencoder and the majestic 12 so i wanted

953
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:46,000
to take a step back and read the pure manuscript dawn of a new age of course so this is 176 page

954
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,640
manuscript if you ever watch this video again if you're interested i do recommend reading the

955
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:56,080
full thing however it is a very dreadful read most things are talked about eight or nine times

956
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:02,640
throughout the manuscript so it can just be a trudge to get through now i do notice that there

957
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:09,120
are still some differences between corso's affidavit and the dawn of a new age manuscript

958
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:15,920
and this being the description of the encounter at white sands in 57 and 58 which we just touched on

959
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,920
in the end of the video of encountering a non-human intelligence with almost a different

960
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:28,880
physiognomy to the bean he claimed to have seen at fort riley in 1947 so that that description

961
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:34,720
still leaves a bit of a strange taste in my mouth due to reading it after about 120 140 pages into

962
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:41,520
the manuscript at first like i mentioned i did think it was a metaphor a new world if you could

963
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:46,960
take it something to teach his grandchildren to learn from but corso is alleging that this is a

964
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:52,800
true incident he not only wrote this in a film in his manuscript in a film to his grandkids that

965
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:59,360
somehow she handsaw but also told john b alexander joc valet and george napp about this experience

966
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:04,800
so let's kind of dive into some of the things i found very interesting because i do think

967
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,200
there's a lot of very credible statements made in the manuscript now i cannot speak to the

968
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:14,720
veracity of the technology seating claims i'm not an expert in integrated circuitry i'm not an expert

969
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:19,680
in computer science i'm not even an expert in metallurgy that was one of my worst classes

970
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:24,560
material science in the university so i cannot speak to that that is why i tried to put a balanced

971
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:29,520
take of course those claims and some traditional history but what we can speak on is some of the

972
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:35,280
factual accuracies of u.s army r and d at the time you know i know we analyzed that primer quite a

973
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:42,160
bit so it was fascinating to see kind of the army's need for a centralized r and d project under

974
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:48,320
trudeau spearheaded in 1958 just like corso said that's when the golden age of army r and d began

975
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:53,840
it was also very interesting to see back in the late 50s and early 60s the u.s army was trying

976
01:25:53,840 --> 01:26:00,080
to kind of get with semi-private institutions and universities in order to um flourish under army

977
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,560
r and d this is something that we talked about quite often ffr dcs and uarcs and

978
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,040
reverse engineering programs and legacy programs utilizing these sorts of institutions for

979
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,960
probably material study and so forth and also the foreign technology division this is something i

980
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:22,960
think is one of the most crucial aspects of this video that i've seen almost nobody else talk about

981
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:30,000
the foreign technology division under which corso worked was u.s army not air force this is not the

982
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:36,160
infamous foreign technology division out of right pat now we can ask ourselves why is there no

983
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:42,800
information about this foreign technology division why can we see nothing about it except in the

984
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:49,360
actual military documents under corso i myself have some foya documents out to try to investigate

985
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,840
this further but as we've known with the interplanetary phenomenon unit with the u.s army

986
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:59,040
there are some weird institutions that somehow exist through institutional memory

987
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:04,000
i'll be interested in to see if i can pry anything free from foya regarding the army's foreign

988
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:09,440
technology division however my hopes aren't necessarily high that being that if this was

989
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:14,720
indeed one of the first structured u.s legacy programs i'm sure we'll get no information and

990
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:22,640
i do want to touch on that because if corso's claims are indeed true and i look favorably upon

991
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:27,440
the claims of corso we'll just say that there's some claims that still bewilder me like the

992
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:35,200
nhi encounter and so forth but this program started in 1960 would likely be one of the

993
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:41,200
first structured u.s legacy programs utilizing corporations you know bell labs and some of the

994
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:47,440
fortune 500 companies as well as universities and semi-private institutions so if these

995
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:52,640
disclosures and testimonies are indeed fact we can extract a lot of interesting data and

996
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:58,400
worthwhile investigation here seeing how legacy programs were structured and and framework and

997
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:03,440
that is something that could extend to today which i find highly likely seen as i do believe

998
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:09,680
in modern day or at least the early 2000s the army's role in legacy programs has often been rnd

999
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:15,920
to try and equip the modern warfighter with reverse engineered technologies of unknown origin there

1000
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:20,160
will be a lot more to discuss on that in the future and hopefully as we move on over time we

1001
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:25,360
can try and crack into some of these legacy programs and and talking exactly what about the

1002
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:32,640
army air force navy does and what contractors work under them and so forth speaking of contractors

1003
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:38,800
spary rand wasn't that an interesting details the memoirs of true dough and discussed by corso one

1004
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:45,760
of the one of the companies they met with often was spary rand and when spary rand went defunct

1005
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,720
i'm doing this off the top of my head which i believe was 86 much of their information and

1006
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:59,120
engineering divisions were bought up by raytheon northrup honeywell and i believe raytheon as well

1007
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:05,840
as bell labs i think one of the most interesting connections here is bell labs being owned by

1008
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:13,040
at&t who in turn owned say own had ownership of sandia national labs under mandate by truman

1009
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:18,000
sandia is a usual suspect mentioned in the majestic documents mentioned by edgar fuchet

1010
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:23,040
mentioned in the interplanetary phenomenon unit documents that are still disputed to this day so

1011
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:30,480
there's a lot of interesting data here to kind of analyze a hypothetical or very much real us army

1012
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:36,160
reverse engineering program and speaking of that i'm also so fascinated by corso's discussion of

1013
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:41,920
the ufo working group wasn't that interesting mentioning the cia directorate of science and

1014
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:49,120
technology having a major position on this group of about 17 18 people on the board as we know with

1015
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:53,360
the work of chris sharp thank you chris sharp if you ever watch one of my videos i'm honored you're

1016
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:59,520
you're an inspiration but that in 2003 cia oga served as a logistics coordinator for ufo crash

1017
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:05,040
retrieval with the help of jsoc as we have just analyzed the cia directorate of science technology

1018
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:12,160
spawned the oga and then us army inscom founder major albert major general albert stubblebind who

1019
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:19,840
corso said funded the ufo working group under inscom in 2003 the isa the intelligence support

1020
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:28,000
activity known sometimes as the activity the most clandestine of jsoc units was given over to jsoc

1021
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,920
and this was all in 2003 around the time of the oga's creation which is allegedly the time the

1022
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:39,360
oga served as a logistics coordinator for crash retrieval if you don't know much about the isa i

1023
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:46,160
highly recommend watching some videos on them they are some uh true bad people in terms of just their

1024
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:50,640
training and so forth they're really interesting i'm always interested in learning more about jsoc

1025
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:55,280
but i do want to know what everybody thought about the video and corso after analyzing his

1026
01:30:55,280 --> 01:31:00,640
claims in a vacuum purely analyzing his claims without any of the nonsense and extracurriculars

1027
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:05,280
from day after roswell what does everybody think let's get a discussion going if you do not know

1028
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:09,440
i have a discord come join that i'll have the link in the description we'll probably have some

1029
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:13,760
conversations going on about corso and so forth because i would really like to talk about that

1030
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,320
if anybody has any experience or other information on the foreign technology division

1031
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:24,480
let's get talking because i think that if you take one single thing away from this video i i would

1032
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:31,840
like it to be that the army had an rnd program in the 1960s called the foreign technology division

1033
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:36,800
that there are no documents and no data for all we know is that true doe followed upon his

1034
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:42,640
retirement in 62 by dwight e beach four star general um we're in command of u.s army rnd the

1035
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:48,080
office of the chief of army research and development so there are some kind of clues there for us to

1036
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:52,800
work on further but i hope everybody enjoyed this project we're coming up on a year anniversary of

1037
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,920
the channel i got something a little fun to to revisit for that but thank you all for tuning in

1038
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:02,720
again i'd like to know what everybody thought i got a patreon in the in the channel description

1039
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:09,440
i don't keep any content everything i do is for the world to see so if you want to support the

1040
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:14,480
channel only support what you think the channel is worth with that being said guys we will get

1041
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:19,840
working right on the next project and i shall see everybody soon please remember to like and

1042
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,880
subscribe and thank you so much for tuning in bye everybody
