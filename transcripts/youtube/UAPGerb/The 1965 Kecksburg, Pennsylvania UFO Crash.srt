1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
It didn't start or end with Roswell.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,100
The 20th century of the United States saw several now infamous alleged UFO crash cases

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,140
that feature rich paper trails, a wealth of witnesses, and endless mystery.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,220
Today we travel to the Midwest of the continental United States to a sleepy town in Pennsylvania

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:24,860
named Kecksburg, where on the evening of December 9th, 1965, something from the sky crashed

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,740
into the nearby woods, sending the town and the U.S. military into a frenzy, leading

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,620
to one of the most discussed and debated UFO crash retrieval cases of all time.

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,100
Hey guys, it's UAPGurb, today we finally visit one of my most requested crash retrieval

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,100
cases, the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,360
Kecksburg has long been a favorite case of mine, due to the exhausting list of local

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,600
witnesses, extensive press coverage, and fascinating ties to Blue Book and Project

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,960
Moondust.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,160
What if anything crashed into the woods that cold winter evening?

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,480
Was it a meteor as Blue Book claimed, a Soviet satellite like many debunkers have claimed,

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,520
or indeed a craft of non-human intelligence as described by numerous eyewitnesses?

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,120
And a quick note here guys, excellent research has been conducted by respected ufologists

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
on this case.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,400
I will primarily be referencing the work of the most seasoned Kecksburg investigator,

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,480
Stan Gordon, and the legend with whom Gordon shared much of his research and witnesses,

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Leonard Stringfield.

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,480
In the early evening of December 9th, 1965, thousands of residents across Michigan, Indiana,

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,160
Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and Canada observed a fiery, brilliant glow

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,520
streak across the sky, a ball of fire leaving a smoke trail, estimated to be visible for

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,920
20 minutes after the passing of the object.

25
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,940
Numerous ground-based civilians and pilots initially thought the object to be an aircraft

26
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,580
in peril, especially due to pieces of the object seemingly detaching and falling over

27
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,420
Lapeer, Michigan and Elyria, Ohio.

28
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,720
The material would later be recognized and studied within the official Blue Book report

29
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,020
on Kecksburg.

30
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,340
As noted by Clark McClelland, UFO researcher and former NASA Apollo space program member,

31
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,660
as well as Dr. Paul Anir, professor of astronomy, the object would make a change of course roughly

32
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,660
25 degrees when traveling over Elyria, Ohio.

33
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,340
Similar calculations showed the object to be between 40 and 60 miles in altitude when

34
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,300
first observed over Michigan.

35
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,820
McClelland estimated the speed of the glowing object based on the distance of witness observations

36
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,220
to be traveling at roughly 17 miles a minute or 1,062 miles per hour.

37
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:51,060
For reference, meteors travel between 25 and 144,000 miles an hour, so even if McClelland's

38
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,900
calculations were off by a factor of 10, the object was still traveling at much slower

39
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,120
speeds than a meteor in Earth's atmosphere.

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,700
Around 4.45 p.m., the object plunged into the woods of Kecksburg, Pennsylvania.

41
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,780
The object made a turn between Greensburg and Latrobe and was reported from local communities

42
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,740
as it moved towards the south.

43
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,980
Near Laurelville, the object turned again and began to track northeast towards the Kecksburg

44
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,540
area where it reportedly impacted into the woods.

45
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,300
Closely tracking the object, Project Blue Book dispatched a three-man Air Force team

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,900
from the 662nd Radar Squadron at the Oakdale Army Installation near Pittsburgh to investigate.

47
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,440
The squadron was operating under control of the Aerospace Defense Command.

48
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,800
These orders were presumably given by Major Hector Quintanilla, who took the reins of

49
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,020
Blue Book in 1963.

50
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,480
The 33-page report on Kecksburg from Blue Book has Quintanilla's name all over the

51
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,880
memorandum for record, and it is important to note of Blue Book's conclusion of Kecksburg.

52
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,420
Under the Major, the case was designated as a meteor.

53
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,280
And quickly worth mentioning, Blue Book states the three-man team found no materials at the

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,440
crash site.

55
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,280
Blue Book curiously marks this case under ACME, Pennsylvania.

56
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,760
Why is this?

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,480
Researchers are not sure, but one possibility is the Air Force personnel interviewed witnesses

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,300
who lived nearby in the town of ACME.

59
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,400
And speaking of Quintanilla, let's pay special attention to April 5, 1966, where the United

60
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,000
States Air Force Major lied before the House Armed Services Committee, stating that Blue

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,440
Book had no radar cases that were unexplained.

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,560
Scientific advisor to Blue Book, J. Allen Hynek, revealed this deception by providing

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:37,320
three such cases, 1951 Goose Bay, 1956 Lakenheath, and 1957 Shreveport.

64
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,440
Although town residents argue to this day over what crashed in the woods that night,

65
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,160
the town witnesses agree within an hour of the impact, military forces swarmed the area

66
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,400
almost as quickly as the arrival of Penn State Police and the Kecksburg volunteer firemen.

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,860
Twenty-eight years I'm a fireman here in Kecksburg.

68
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,180
It does me good as a young old fireman now that now we know that something did happen.

69
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,060
The military was here.

70
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,060
Everybody here is correct in what they've seen and what they heard.

71
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,780
I think because of the lay of the land and the terrain, there was different points of

72
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,460
vision from wherever they were at that point in time.

73
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,620
The outcome of our town meeting, a majority consensus that something big did happen in

74
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,540
Kecksburg on December 9, 1965, and that despite the official report to the contrary, soldiers

75
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,020
were on site.

76
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,420
Regardless of Yousaf and Blue Book denying the presence of more than three men at Kecksburg,

77
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,020
a statement that will later be contradicted by Dr. Eric A. Walker, Kecksburg residents

78
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,420
gave descriptions of multiple types of military men, U.S. Army soldiers equipped with M1 rifles,

79
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,780
Yousaf personnel with blue fatigues and blue berets, and men in civilian clothing seemingly

80
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,100
barking out orders, and some witnesses even described men in hazmat suits labeling them

81
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,980
as moon suits.

82
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,420
There are also myriad local press articles, like these from the Pittsburgh Press on December

83
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,180
10, that also contradict the military's denial of a presence at Kecksburg.

84
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,440
The description of Air Force men may be paramount to investigating this crash recovery case.

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,960
Referred to as blue berets, Leonard Stringfield made numerous mentions to a UFO crash recovery

86
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,400
intelligence team, stemming from the Air Force donned in blue fatigues and blue berets.

87
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,080
In Crash Retrievals of the Third Kind, a case study of alleged UFOs and occupants in military

88
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,040
custody, Stringfield stated he had been made aware from other military forces of a rapid

89
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,280
reaction special forces unit named Blue Berets who can, quote, operate secretly and effectively

90
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,500
by using diversionary tactics to prevent public interference, end quote.

91
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,220
This unit was housed at certain military bases as rapid reaction units in a constant

92
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,060
state of ready to address downed or crashed UFOs.

93
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,160
Stringfield even stated to have met a former member of the elite Blue Berets when visiting

94
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,580
the University of Dade City, Florida for a lecture, quote,

95
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,980
We talked about the elite force, its makeup and functions, and some of his experiences

96
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,580
in Vietnam behind enemy lines.

97
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,780
Although he had never participated in a UFO crash retrieval, he was aware that one of

98
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,380
his fellow members had the experience.

99
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,180
Details were scanty, but Cam recalls that his friend referred to his participation in

100
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,720
the recovery of a, quote, unquote, big head from an alien craft, end quote.

101
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,780
In UFO Crash Retrieval Status Report 4 Fatal Encounters at Fort Dix, Maguire, Stringfield

102
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,460
met with a man named Jeff Morse, who claimed to be a former Blue Beret.

103
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,940
Morse would tell Stringfield in 1985 to 1987 about an incident at Fort Maguire Air Force

104
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,940
in which a non-human entity was shot to death by U.S. forces.

105
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,180
Quite a bit to discuss about the Blue Berets, so maybe we will save that for another video.

106
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,140
But I do want to mention Air Force Blue Berets were made famous with the creation of the

107
00:07:53,140 --> 00:08:00,340
USAAF 1041st Security Police Squadron, which operated during 1965 to 1967.

108
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:06,100
The 1041st and their Blue Berets were implemented in Operation Safe Side, in which the Air Force

109
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,460
deployed a highly trained unit of Combat Security Police, known as Active Defense,

110
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,400
to repel raids on air bases in Vietnam.

111
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,340
But the origins of USAAF personnel in Blue Fatigues and Blue Berets can be traced back

112
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,700
to 1956, with the creation of the Strategic Air Command Elite Guard under General Curtis

113
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,060
LeMay, who I have spoken about many times.

114
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,460
The SAC Elite Guards operated as Air Police from 1956 to 1966 within the time of our Kexburg

115
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,820
case, serving as part of the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Department of Defense.

116
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,140
The Blue Beret SAC Elite Guard were tasked with providing security at headquarters of

117
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,840
Strategic Air Command of the U.S. Air Force.

118
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,160
One such SAC base is Lockbourne Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio.

119
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,340
Remember the mention of this base, as we will later discuss a witness who claimed to have

120
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,700
briefly guarded the crashed UAP from Kexburg at Lockbourne AFB.

121
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,640
Let's get back to Kexburg and analyze the events around the time of an object crashing

122
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,880
in the woods.

123
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,880
With news media starting to swirl about stories of a fireball crashing in the area, local

124
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,560
news director John Murphy, out of WHJB, Greensburg, Pennsylvania, received a call from a startled

125
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,280
mother, who claimed she and her children had observed a fiery object fall into the woods

126
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,960
where a cloud of blue smoke began rising after impact.

127
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,960
After listening to many such calls through the past years, it's fairly easy to tell

128
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:53,360
Murphy, a key player in this story moving forward, arrived to the woods and investigated

129
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,280
the scene for some time before Carl Metz, a state police fire marshal, and another

130
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,720
investigator arrived to the scene.

131
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,200
The two investigators entered the woods and upon returning and being questioned by Murphy,

132
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,920
told Murphy, quote, you better get your information from the Army, end quote.

133
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,800
Murphy would then arrive to the state police barracks in Greensburg for more information,

134
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,280
where he observed Army and Air Force men swarming the location.

135
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,280
I asked him, did you find anything down there?

136
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,280
He looked puzzled for a second and said, I'm not sure.

137
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:33,280
Then I said, well, let me ask my questions differently after you make your report to

138
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
the captain.

139
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,560
Do you think you or the captain perhaps may have something to tell me?

140
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,360
Though Murphy had covered hard news for decades, he wasn't prepared for the state troopers

141
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
response.

142
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,880
He said, you better get your information from the Army.

143
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,880
This was the first time anyone had made any mention of the military.

144
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,880
To refer me to the Army led me to believe that perhaps there was something in the woods

145
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,880
at that time that showed some significance of military value.

146
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,240
Murphy would interview many town residents about what they saw and experienced in Kecksburg

147
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,200
the evening of December 9th and excitedly pieced together a radio documentary titled

148
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,880
Object in the Woods.

149
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,160
Curiously, Murphy's wife and other WHJB employees would state Murphy was approached by men at

150
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,120
the station, leading to a radical alteration of his program.

151
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,680
Murphy would broadcast a heavily censored version of his documentary, starting the event

152
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
with an odd disclaimer.

153
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,680
This station has not been contacted by any official agency of the state, federal or local

154
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
government.

155
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,680
We have received very good cooperation with the state police and with the military and

156
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,680
we were able to receive all the information we wanted this past week.

157
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,680
We have not had any political or otherwise influence put on us concerning this program

158
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
whatsoever.

159
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,080
And state that many witnesses whose testimony had been taped no longer wished to air their

160
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,680
segments due to fear of reprisals from the US Army.

161
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Yesterday afternoon a woman from Kecksburg area recorded for us what she saw, what she

162
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,680
reported and what the state police and military officers told her the object was.

163
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,680
She described for us on tape what and how it looked.

164
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Late this afternoon she notified this radio station that she was afraid of getting in

165
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,680
the couple and she did not want her description of the object used on the air.

166
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,680
We received other calls very tonight from some other people.

167
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,680
One person said that they were afraid of the state police and another person said they

168
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
did not want to get in couple with the army.

169
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Stan Gordon would even go so far as to state he had received notarized documents from station

170
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,680
employees claiming USG elements were confiscating news tapes of eyewitness accounts and were

171
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,680
not allowing said accounts to be broadcasted.

172
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,680
John Murphy would tragically die in a hit and run incident shortly after the event and

173
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,680
never claimed publicly to have entered the woods and to have seen what crashed in Kecksburg.

174
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,680
But in 2003 John's wife claimed he had told her of entering the woods and witnessed a

175
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,680
strange metallic object on the ground.

176
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,680
What was this object observed by so many and that later witnesses would state was transported

177
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,680
out of the woods in the early morning of December 10th by army trucks covered by a tarp.

178
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Fortunately we have numerous witness testimony to analyze.

179
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:33,680
There was no tail section, there was no motors, there was no windows, there was no doors.

180
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
It was big enough for a grown person to stand up in.

181
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,680
It had like Egyptian writing, like backwards writing on it.

182
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Stars and circles and dashes and lines and things like that.

183
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
It looked like an acorn.

184
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
It was really weird.

185
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,680
A first-hand witness questioned at length by both Stan Gordon and Leonard Stringfield is

186
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,680
James, often referred to as Jim Romanski.

187
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Romanski served as a volunteer fireman whose company was dispatched to Kecksburg to assist

188
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,680
with the search of what was thought to be a downed aircraft.

189
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Romanski first approached Gordon in 1987 to tell his story.

190
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,680
He had previously feared ridicule for years but wanted to finally give his testimony.

191
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,680
On the night of 1965 with the search teams combing the woods, Romanski heard via walkie-talkie

192
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
the crash site had been discovered.

193
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,680
Upon arriving to the scene, the fireman witnessed an object half-buried in the ground.

194
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,680
This object appeared to have descended into the forest at a 30-degree angle, breaking

195
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,680
tree limbs before impacting the ground and leaving a 25-foot-long trench.

196
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,680
There were no signs of fire in the area.

197
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,680
I want you to describe what you saw when you arrived in this field where the supposed downed

198
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
aircraft was.

199
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Well, first of all, we were in a field hunting for a downed aircraft.

200
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,680
And the first rescue team already found it and radioed it into the fire hall, gave the

201
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,680
coordinates, and it was down in front of us.

202
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,680
And we hightailed it out of our search area and went down into there.

203
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,680
And we got there expecting a smashed-up airplane, wings, fuselage, et cetera.

204
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,680
No such character.

205
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,680
Came down through the woods and here's this humongous piece of metal laying there.

206
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,680
I mean, this thing, I've described time and time again as a very large, acorn-shaped object.

207
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,680
The front of it, or I presume was the front of it, was pushed down into the dirt where

208
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,680
the way it came in and landed after it took out the top of the trees and brush and everything

209
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
coming in.

210
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Came back in an oblong shape.

211
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Around the bottom was what I call a bumper, and then the bottom was perfectly flat.

212
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,680
No signs of propulsion or anything.

213
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,680
There was no doors, no windows.

214
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,680
There was no way to get in this thing, at least none that I've seen.

215
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,680
There was no seams on it, no rivets, nothing.

216
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,680
The only thing I've seen was this bumper around it and it had these real strange markings

217
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,680
on it, which I've often referred to as similar to the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

218
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,680
So as a volunteer fireman, we did what we were supposed to do, find the crash site,

219
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,680
do a preliminary investigation for survivors or treat anybody with it, which we didn't

220
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
because there was none that we could see.

221
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
There was no way of getting in this object.

222
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,680
The object appeared to be a large metallic acorn or bell measuring 10 to 12 feet in length,

223
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
8 to 10 feet in diameter.

224
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,680
The raised ring area measured about 8 to 10 inches wide.

225
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,680
The wingless, seamless, and rivetless object was described as Romanski as a bronze off-gold color.

226
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,680
As a seasoned machinist, Romanski stated the object almost looked like it had been made

227
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,680
from a liquid metal mold and told researcher Stan Gordon,

228
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,680
Never in my life have I seen the color of that metal in any shape or form.

229
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,680
The presence of the described hieroglyphic writing has been a point of contention for the Kekberg case,

230
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,680
with some believing the object to be a Soviet space capsule and the writing to be Russian Cyrillic.

231
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Romanski described the writing as,

232
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Characters of broken and straight lines, dots, rectangles, and circles.

233
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Romanski would even explicitly state to Leonard Stringfield,

234
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,680
he was familiar with the Russian language and the markings he observed were not Russian.

235
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,680
My dad is originally from Kyiv.

236
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,680
And I went to him one time and I said, Dad, you can read and write Polish and Russian.

237
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
He said, yeah.

238
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
I said, write me something in both dialects.

239
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
He said, what? I said, just write me anything.

240
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,680
The Polish and Russian writing that I see doesn't come nowhere near.

241
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,680
I think it imperative to include much of Jim's testimony on the 1993 Montell Williams show

242
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,680
due to his fiery and passionate demeanor and discussion of how his presence at the Kekberg case

243
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,680
affected his children's time in the U.S. armed services.

244
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
The first team had already radioed in his position.

245
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,680
We're there 10, 15 minutes all talking around, doing a preliminary search,

246
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,680
wondering what we discovered.

247
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Two gentlemen come down through the woods, trench coats on, ramrod stiff, crew cut.

248
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
All right, this is a restricted area.

249
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,680
You're not ordered to get out.

250
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Wait a minute, I'm a civilian.

251
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
You ain't going to order me nothing.

252
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,680
But as a fireman, I'm being relieved from what I'm doing.

253
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
So I got out of there.

254
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
We're going out through the woods.

255
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,680
We didn't go no more than 15, 20 feet.

256
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,680
And I know from me to you, here come the military.

257
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Full uniforms, equipment, marching right down through the woods with flashlights.

258
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
This is December.

259
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Late in the evening, it's cold, it's wet.

260
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,680
How far away were you from a military base?

261
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,680
Well, the closest base that I knew of was Pittsburgh, which is approximately 45 miles to the west.

262
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,680
So within 15 minutes of your arrival at the site, the military was there.

263
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
You got it.

264
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,680
Okay, all right, all right.

265
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,680
Now what did they say to you after this happened?

266
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,680
I mean, I know there were several members of the report I saw on Unsolved Mysteries.

267
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Several members of the community were there, right?

268
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Other people that were part of the community were there and present and were all told to leave.

269
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,680
There was no press or media at the immediate crash site.

270
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:08,680
What I didn't know up on top of the hill, because I come in through the side,

271
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
the military had taken over a farmhouse.

272
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,680
I mean, from what I understand, military brass.

273
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:21,680
They took over up there, did all their orders and whatever they were doing from up there.

274
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,680
And that's where I presume that the military who came down through the woods came from.

275
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Because when we went out, we had to walk back to the fire hall,

276
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,680
which is approximately the way we had to go, I'd say a good mile.

277
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,680
But by the time we got back to the fire hall, it was wall-to-wall military.

278
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
I mean, there was trucks and jeeps and cars.

279
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
There was guards on the door.

280
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,680
Did anybody say to you, I don't want you talking about this, don't say a word about this?

281
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Were you debriefed?

282
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:55,680
What they did, I mean, these people virtually told us just to shut up, get to your vehicles and be quiet.

283
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,680
I have a daughter and a son that both went into the military within the last two or three years.

284
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,680
One went into Marine Corps, one went into U.S. Air Force.

285
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,680
My daughter came to me from the United States Marine Corps and she said,

286
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
your name come up on a computer as my father.

287
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,680
I had to sign a statement saying I would never ask a request for any information from Kexburg.

288
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
My son had to sign two statements.

289
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Oh, about you, about yourself?

290
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Pardon?

291
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Any information about yourself?

292
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,680
Your daughter had to sign a paper that said she would not ask for any information about you?

293
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Not about me, but about Kexburg.

294
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Okay, but what happened?

295
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
Because my name came up as her father.

296
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Okay, but you know what?

297
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Then, wait a minute, Montel.

298
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Okay.

299
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Then my son in the U.S. Air Force had to sign two papers.

300
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Jim, wait.

301
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Just jump to the chase because part of the chase here is the fact that I spent,

302
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,680
I'm telling you, I had some of the highest clearances this country has to offer.

303
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,680
I've been through files on top of files on top of files.

304
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
I still ain't seen nothing yet.

305
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
But did you have a need to know?

306
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Period.

307
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
But do you agree?

308
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
You didn't have a need to know.

309
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Yeah, but that's also not true.

310
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Now, my son goes into the Air Force and they tell him he can't even request to go to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for duty

311
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,680
because I seen something and that's where my UFO was sitting today.

312
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,680
Wait a minute, maybe his MOS was something that they didn't have a qualification for at Wright-Patterson Air Force.

313
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
His MOS has nothing to do with it.

314
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Okay, all right, hold on a minute.

315
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
The government is covering this up.

316
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
They don't want no one to know.

317
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,680
They don't want no one to get access to anything because they're afraid people will find out the truth.

318
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
During his time spent with Stan Gordon,

319
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Romanski would take the researcher to the exact site of the crash.

320
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,680
This site would line up identically to the description of our next witness, Bill Bullybush,

321
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,680
who to the best of our knowledge had no interaction with Romanski.

322
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Bill Bullybush was driving his car in the afternoon of December 9th, 1965,

323
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,680
where he observed the object streaking over the sky.

324
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Bill stated,

325
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
Witnessing the object's descent,

326
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Bill turned his car and went to the top of the hill now called Meteor Road

327
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,680
where he observed blue lights flashing in the woods.

328
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,680
As the sky was getting dark, Bullybush claimed to walk into the woods to the crash site

329
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,680
where he looked upon a metallic acorn-shaped object embedded into the soil.

330
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,680
The object featured the same strange writing noticed by Romanski,

331
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,680
and Bullybush noted blue arcing light emanating from the object at intervals.

332
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,680
And I stood here and I happened to look up there and there, there it was.

333
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,680
It embedded right into the ground about a foot, foot and a half.

334
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Bullybush's description of the object supports the theory that it was probably not a meteorite.

335
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,680
I was working on a 64 Corvair at home.

336
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,680
I happened to see this red ball of fire going across.

337
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,680
It came up and went towards the mountain just like if it was radio controlled.

338
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:56,680
It made a figure eight and it came right down in here and belly landed right in here.

339
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,680
It knocked the top of the trees out.

340
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,680
It stunk like rotten eggs.

341
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,680
You could smell it, you know, and then just like sizzling and like sparks come.

342
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Just like if it was cooling off, it was red hot.

343
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Bullybush is the only witness I'm aware of to describe the presence of a smell.

344
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,680
The description of a strong smell, in this case rotten eggs, aka a sulfuric smell,

345
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:25,680
reminds me closely of the strong ammonia smell witnesses described in the 1997 Varginha Brazil case.

346
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:32,680
Bill Bullybush, who fled the woods when he heard the firemen approaching, independently described a nearly identical object.

347
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
I could see it pretty good.

348
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,680
There was no welding, no windows, no nothing on it.

349
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:45,680
And then on the back was a ring and it had like Egyptian writing on it and I couldn't figure out what it was.

350
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,680
From his statements, we can piece together Bullybush left the scene upon the arrival of the fire crew,

351
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:56,680
who witnessed the object for a span of 15 minutes until the men described by Romanski ordered the firemen to leave.

352
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,680
And we do have a witness who states he observed the craft and retrieval crew departing the woods.

353
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,680
In the early 1990s, eyewitness Jerry Betters, a Pittsburgh jazz musician, came forward with his testimony.

354
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,680
At 41 years old in 1965, Betters lived near the area of Kexburg in a town called Murraysville.

355
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Jerry noticed the now infamous fireball, which agitated the horses he was feeding and surrounding dogs.

356
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Upon hearing the news report of the object crashing in Kexburg, Jerry phoned his friends to pick him up and head to the town for a look.

357
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Unfamiliar with the area, the men found themselves on a private lane.

358
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,680
After rounding a slight turn, Jerry stated he was halted by a military roadblock.

359
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,680
The soldiers halting traffic appeared to wear army fatigues with cloth berets,

360
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,680
but other soldiers equipped with rifles and helmets stood at attention behind the roadblock.

361
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:54,680
Betters noticed a number of quote-unquote military brass officers, well-dressed civilians, and scattered army star emblazoned jeeps and personnel trucks.

362
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Jerry's attention was commanded towards a large cab and flatbed trailer.

363
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,680
He noticed a domed or acorn-shaped object that was uncovered and being hauled away from the woods.

364
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Quickly, a tarp was placed over the object.

365
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Betters noted the truck seemed to have trouble traversing up through the field.

366
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Jerry Betters also described the truck and his encounter in a notarized document.

367
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:41,680
This officer came down, and he shouted at these soldiers, he said, get these people out of here.

368
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
They did, they put their guns on us.

369
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Betters and friends were ordered to leave, not before catching a glimpse of what was under the tarp.

370
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,680
But he still believes it was a spacecraft from another world.

371
00:25:52,680 --> 00:26:01,680
I could see what it was shaped like, and I could see this hieroglyphic stuff all around the back, and that's when they chased us out.

372
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
There's two things I can remember very clearly.

373
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,680
I can remember when John F. Kennedy was killed, exactly what I was doing, and I can remember this night exactly.

374
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,680
We do have other witnesses who claim to have been held at gunpoint by the attending military forces.

375
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,680
One such individual is local resident David Newhouse.

376
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Certain things you never forget.

377
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,680
First time I ever had a gun pointed at me, kind of hard to forget that.

378
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,680
You know, definitely a rifle, straight up, right at me.

379
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,680
And you got my attention.

380
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,680
That guy was in the Army, and that was a military rifle.

381
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,680
That was an M1 I was looking at.

382
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
I was in the Army, I know what rifles are.

383
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,680
I belong to the NRA, as you see my sticker on the back.

384
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,680
I like guns, I don't like them pointed at me, though.

385
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:52,680
So they told us to get, you know, out of here, and which we just turned around and came right back down the hill.

386
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
We didn't question them.

387
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:00,680
And in fact, there are dozens of witness testimony from Kexburg locals and nearby citizens we could analyze all day.

388
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,680
Like that of then-teenager Bill Weaver, who noticed four men exit a light-colored box truck

389
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,680
dressed in quote-unquote moon suits and head towards the crash area.

390
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Or then 14-year-old Mike Slater, who stated an Army officer told Mike and his friend

391
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,680
they could do a great service to their country by sending curious crash seekers wrong directions.

392
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,680
We even have witnesses who state they observed the craft after it was taken out of the field,

393
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,680
and we will address these shortly.

394
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,680
A bell-shaped craft big enough to fit a man with strange hieroglyphic writing

395
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,680
was described by many civilian witnesses the night of December 9, 1965.

396
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,680
It is interesting how Blue Book contended the object was a meteor and that nothing was found at the crash site

397
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,680
after all of the witness testimony and trajectory and speed calculations conducted

398
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,680
while the object was in the air that are not consistent with meteor travel.

399
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,680
As mentioned earlier, Blue Book did receive some fragmented material that was seen to fall off of the craft

400
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,680
sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

401
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Blue Book declared this material as chaff, which is quote,

402
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:14,680
material dropped by aircraft to confuse radar complexes when participating in interdiction exercises, end quote.

403
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,680
The conclusion of a meteor with presence of this said chaff leads to further inconsistencies in Blue Book's reporting.

404
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Early skeptics of Kecksburg stated the craft may have been the remains of Soviet spacecraft Cosmos 96.

405
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,680
This conclusion was not supported in a 1965 NASA press release,

406
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:37,680
which stated Cosmos 96 had decayed and landed in Canada roughly 13 hours prior to the Kecksburg event.

407
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
This NASA briefing says, quote,

408
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
End quote.

409
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Stan Gordon further concluded the Kecksburg event was not the result of Cosmos 96

410
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,680
when he received documents through FOIA requests from both the US Space Command and Naval Surveillance Center,

411
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:05,680
which verified Cosmos 96 entered the atmosphere at roughly 3.18 a.m. Eastern Standard Time over Canada on December 9, 1965.

412
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Some such as NASA mission specialist James Oberg maintained the object was a capsule of Soviet origin

413
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
recovered in secrecy for its heat shielding.

414
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Joining us now from Houston is space flight engineer and author James Oberg,

415
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:25,680
who has studied the reported sighting in Kecksburg and has his own theory about what landed there in 1965.

416
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Mr. Oberg, first of all, do you believe that something crashed in Kecksburg in 1965 and was it a UFO?

417
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:40,680
If it's anything, it might be something a lot more Earth-like. It might be a spacecraft from Russia and not from Mars.

418
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,680
It turns out, we do know that a Russian probe fell back to Earth that day.

419
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,680
And it was a special kind of probe. It was one of their probes to the planet Venus.

420
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,680
It failed, was trapped in Earth orbit, and eventually fell out of orbit.

421
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,680
What might have been on that Russian space probe that the US would have been so interested in?

422
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Oh, the most important thing about the probe would be the heat shield.

423
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,680
How thick it was, what material it was made out of, how heavy it was.

424
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Once we knew that, we could then analyze how big their warheads would be in their ICBMs.

425
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,680
But in this clip, it is necessary to mention Oberg is still mentioning Cosmos 96.

426
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Others have wondered if the craft was indeed a Gemini or Orion capsule expelled in the area,

427
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:26,680
such as Assistant Chief of Kecksburg Fire Department Jim Mays, who got within 75 yards of the object but didn't get a clear view.

428
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:32,680
But the idea of a man-made space capsule crashing into the Midwest of the continental United States

429
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,680
was further discredited in this May 2000 Leslie Keene conference titled

430
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:42,680
Combating Media Ridicule and Searching for Evidence on the 1965 Kecksburg Crash Case.

431
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Some of you may know journalist Leslie Keene as the writer of the 2017 New York Times article

432
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,680
bringing the Pentagon UAP videos and OSAP slash ATIP to the public zeitgeist.

433
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,680
In this conference, Keene discussed her correspondence with Nicholas Johnson,

434
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,680
NASA Chief Scientist for Orbital Debris at the NASA Johnson Space Center.

435
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Johnson analyzed the orbital data of the Soviet Venus probe Cosmos 96

436
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,680
and determined the object could not have landed in Kecksburg near 5 p.m. December 9, 1965.

437
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Furthermore, Johnson stated no man-made space object landed in Pennsylvania on the day of the crash.

438
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Well, I was able to contact an important scientist from NASA,

439
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,680
probably the leading expert in the world on this issue, and his name is Nicholas Johnson.

440
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,680
He's the Chief Scientist for Orbital Debris at the NASA Johnson Space Center.

441
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,680
He was able to obtain the coordinates of Cosmos 96 so that he could calculate

442
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,680
if part of it had kept state in orbit after the crash that happened that morning,

443
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,680
could it have landed in Pennsylvania?

444
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
And he was able to determine absolutely not,

445
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,680
made the statement for us that it is impossible that that could have been Cosmos 96.

446
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,680
And the more interesting statement he made was that, in fact,

447
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:57,680
there is no man-made object that came down over Pennsylvania at 5 o'clock on that day.

448
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,680
And he said that he has the databases and the knowledge to determine,

449
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,680
even if it had been some kind of secret experiment, he would be aware of it.

450
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:13,680
He was also able to eliminate the project Corona, which was a project that was dropping these canisters.

451
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,680
It was sending out these spy satellites to Russia, photographing things from the sky,

452
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,680
flying back over the United States and dropping canisters, which were then retrieved.

453
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
Some people have thought that that might have been what it was.

454
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,680
He was also able to eliminate that.

455
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Keene's work on retrieving official Kecksburg documents is truly fascinating.

456
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,680
In the early 2000s, working with the Coalition of Freedom of Information, CFI,

457
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Keene took legal action towards NASA for stonewalling files on Kecksburg.

458
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,680
And in 2007, she won.

459
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:48,680
A settlement in October of 2007 required NASA to provide hundreds of never-before-seen documents

460
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,680
to Keene and CFI while paying all legal fees.

461
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,680
NASA's search for documents on the craft was completed by August 2009,

462
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:01,680
where NASA posted 220 pages of Moondust documents with zero relation to Kecksburg.

463
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,680
According to a NASA public affairs document,

464
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,680
We won't spend any time on Moondust, but if you have never heard of the program,

465
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,680
I highly recommend watching my video on Moondust, which covers this program in depth,

466
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,680
along with its fellow programs, UFO and Blue Fly,

467
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,680
tasked with recovering descended foreign space vehicles during the Cold War.

468
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,680
It is a very strange convenience that files relating to Kecksburg were lost forever.

469
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,680
But let's explore what witnesses like Romanski, Bullybush, Betters,

470
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,680
and myriad other witnesses describe crashing into the woods that cold evening.

471
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Many will remember when I covered this Infographics Crash Retrieval Operator video

472
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,680
that contained a fascinating first-hand testimony.

473
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Very rarely do well-known UFO sightings describe a bell- or acorn-shaped craft.

474
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Searching for evidence of the crash was done by a team of scientists

475
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,680
who had been involved in the construction of the spacecraft.

476
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,680
Very rarely do well-known UFO sightings describe a bell- or acorn-shaped craft.

477
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Certainly not one that is bronze, 10 to 12 feet high, with strange writing along the base.

478
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,680
But as it turns out, there are a wealth of similar sightings we can analyze.

479
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Let's take a look at this December 2, 1952 Blue Book case into Quincy, Louisiana,

480
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,680
where multiple eyewitnesses observed an acorn-shaped object emitting pink, green, red,

481
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,680
and yellow lights moving up and down in altitude for a period of two and a half hours.

482
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,680
We can also analyze this November 10, 1956 Blue Book case in Massachusetts,

483
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:58,680
where both civilian and military sources observed an acorn shape featuring a white base, red side, and green glow.

484
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Blue Book labeled this case as probably the planet Venus.

485
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,680
On August 23, 1957, Blue Book reported a sighting of a bell-shaped object

486
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,680
climb and move out of eyesight of observers in New Jersey.

487
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,680
The case was explained away as a weather balloon from Philadelphia Municipal Airport.

488
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Around the time of Kecksburg, November 1965 to be exact,

489
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,680
residents in Manhattan, New York reported a Blue Book of a bell-shaped UFO

490
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,680
hovering above Manhattan during an electricity blackout.

491
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,680
There are over half a dozen other Blue Book cases I can reference off the top of my head

492
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,680
like a seven- to eight-foot bell changing colors in 1965 seen over Bunkie, Louisiana.

493
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,680
In the video description, you can find additional Blue Book cases featuring bell or acorn shaped UFOs

494
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,680
from 1957, 1954, 1965, and 1957.

495
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,680
But I would like to draw your attention to a now deleted Reddit entry titled

496
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,680
quote, I worked on a team that dealt with NHI technology and left in 2018, end quote.

497
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,680
This alleged Reddit whistleblower is another in a long line of enigmatic,

498
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,680
anonymous individuals who make astonishing claims on Reddit,

499
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,680
4chan, or other message boards before deleting their profiles,

500
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,680
leaving users debating endlessly to the validity of their entries.

501
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,680
I will save exploring this testimony for a full video as I find this post fascinating,

502
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,680
but to summarize this post, the leaker became disgruntled and sought to vent about his career

503
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,680
within an agency that dealt with issues related to non-human intelligence.

504
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,680
One paragraph of this perplexing post caught my attention, quote,

505
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,680
Later I worked in a facility, within a facility, just like the one I had tried to inspect.

506
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,680
It stored a craft. Being near the craft for extended periods of time is extremely dangerous,

507
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,680
especially if it is being experimented on with power.

508
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,680
I didn't observe any injuries to anyone while I was there,

509
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,680
but all sorts of long-term nasty injuries were relayed to me through rumors and warnings.

510
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,680
The craft was shaped like a dreidel without the handle.

511
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,680
There was a large exterior piece that went missing when it was recovered.

512
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,680
The theory is it acted as a stabilizer, although some argue it was a crude weapon, end quote.

513
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Before we break this down, the anonymous poster also said, quote,

514
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,680
The shape was directly informed by its purpose.

515
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Every shape is custom molded in a metallic material that would revolutionize the way we travel if we had it, end quote.

516
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,680
This method of molding sounds extremely similar to the statements of first-hand Kexberg witness

517
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
and machinist Jim Romanski.

518
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,680
Because I've been a machinist for almost 30 years now.

519
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,680
And I've cut a lot of metal.

520
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,680
And I've never run into it again. Never.

521
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Discussion of peril to human bodies and cognition when in proximity to UAP is being heavily explored in 2024,

522
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,680
and has even been mentioned in a graphic in Lou Elizondo's book, Eminent.

523
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,680
The craft description, a dreidel without its handle, sounds almost identical to the craft Romanski,

524
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,680
Bullybush, Betters, and others described.

525
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,680
The Reddit user also states a large exterior piece went missing when the craft was recovered.

526
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,680
Well, remember back to our 1965 fireball.

527
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,680
Witnesses discussed pieces falling off of the blazing fireball in the sky.

528
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,680
Blue Book even claimed to have retrieved pieces of chaff from the object.

529
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,680
Interesting, I am once again drawn to whistleblower Steven Lovkin,

530
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,680
who claimed a special classified portion of Blue Book had actually recovered debris from the Roswell wreckage.

531
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,680
Lastly, the writing described as hieroglyphics reminds me of three other cases.

532
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,680
The writing on the Roswell debris described by primary witness Jesse Marcel Sr.

533
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,680
The writing along the lip of a crashed craft Danny Sheehan observed photos of

534
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,680
in the classified files of Blue Book while under order from President Jimmy Carter.

535
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,680
And the writings that appeared to project off of what was considered recovered weapon technology by witness R.A.

536
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,680
at the Offworld Technologies Division.

537
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,680
I will discuss Dr. Eric A. Walker only briefly,

538
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,680
as I have already covered him in my majestic documents project with Ryan Wood,

539
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,680
and in my Robert Saarbacher and the early days of the UFO crash retrieval video.

540
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,680
Robert Saarbacher, physicist and member of the U.S. Joint Research and Development Board,

541
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,680
named Dr. Eric A. Walker in an interview with Stanton Friedman,

542
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:20,680
implicating Dr. Walker as an integral member to UFO crash retrieval and UFO study alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush.

543
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Dr. Eric A. Walker was the president of Penn State University from 1956 to 1971,

544
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,680
a member of many defense boards including chairman of the Institute for Defense Analysis

545
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,680
and the executive secretary of the Defense Research Board from 1950 to 1951.

546
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,680
Throughout the 1980s, Walker would be contacted by numerous UFO researchers,

547
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,680
such as William Steinman and Habib Henry Azadahel, a pseudonym for Armin Victorian.

548
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,680
Walker would confirm attendance at meetings centered on UFO crash and body retrieval efforts in 1949 to 1950,

549
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,680
discuss the validity of MJ-12,

550
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,680
comment on the difficulty of breakthroughs in UFO reverse engineering,

551
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:06,680
and make all sorts of cryptic statements on needing to understand ESP to become involved with UFO programs.

552
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Let's break down this conversation between Armin Victorian and Walker,

553
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,680
where Kecksburg is referenced, and before we do, an interesting note.

554
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Primary Kecksburg researcher Stan Gordon did state there was a report of someone fitting Dr. Walker's description at the crash site.

555
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,680
In the interview, Walker states he went to the Kecksburg crash site with two men from the military that were not on duty.

556
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,680
He also went with a fellow colleague of his.

557
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,680
When asked if it was a UFO recovered, Walker states,

558
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Walker would not comment on if he was at the crash site for long,

559
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,680
but did state he and the other men did not prepare any reports.

560
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,680
Two men from the military, but not on duty,

561
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:55,680
so we can rule out here that these were the three USAAF Blue Book personnel from the 662nd Radar Squadron dispatched to the crash site.

562
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Could Walker and his mentioned off-duty military companions possibly be the men in civilian clothes referenced by numerous eyewitnesses,

563
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,680
or possibly the men in trench coats who ordered Romanski and the firemen away from the UFO?

564
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,680
And we must ask, why did Walker not prepare any reports?

565
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:20,680
Can we take Walker's refusal to comment on the presence of a UFO as an admission that non-human technology did in fact crash in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania?

566
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,680
And last part here, Walker mentions a colleague of his accompanying him to the crash site.

567
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,680
In 1965, Walker was serving as president of Pennsylvania State University.

568
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,680
A shadowy witness I covered and spoke to is TB.

569
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,680
I highly recommend watching my UFO Witness List Redacted video to analyze his entire story.

570
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:50,680
According to alleged emails with Dr. Stephen Greer, TB-stated UFO program USAAF's unacknowledged special access programs are embedded within UARCs,

571
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,680
university-affiliated research centers for the Department of Defense.

572
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:02,680
As it turns out, Pennsylvania State University does indeed have a UARC, the Applied Research Laboratory for the U.S. Navy.

573
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:09,680
In fact, Walker would help create the Applied Research Center at the behest of the U.S. Navy in 1945 following World War II,

574
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,680
where Dr. Walker moved 100 engineers from Harvard to Penn State.

575
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Not only was this ARL awarded the largest research contract in Penn State history, $2.1 billion from the Navy,

576
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:28,680
the ARL also currently specializes in prototyping novel power and energy systems, electro-optics, and directed energy.

577
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:36,680
Could Walker and his colleague have been tasked with investigating the Kexberg crash for UAP programs stemming from Penn State University's

578
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,680
affiliated research center, the Applied Research Laboratory?

579
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:55,680
In his 2024 book, Eminent, Lou Elizondo named Lyndon B. Johnson amongst Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, Carter, Reagan, H.W. Bush, and Trump

580
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,680
as presidents who were briefed into sum to all of the UFO phenomenon.

581
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,680
This statement by Elizondo plus his relationship with Dr. Eric Walker, who self-admitted he was present at the Kexberg crash,

582
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:14,680
leads us to do some serious investigation into Lyndon B. Johnson, who served in office from 1963 to 1969.

583
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:23,680
We can see in Luncheon in the White House, dated August 3, 1964, Eric A. Walker amongst other colleague presidents met with Lyndon B. Johnson.

584
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:32,680
Walker was also the only university president to be invited by Johnson to attend the Clean Air Act signing in the White House in 1967.

585
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:40,680
But we can also find a handful of letters between Walker and Johnson, such as this September 10, 1964 letter in which the president

586
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:47,680
writes Walker thanking him profusely for his service as a member of the Board of Visitors to the U.S. Military Academy.

587
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,680
Some unreferenced actions recommended by Walker were to be instated by the Secretary of Defense at Johnson's request.

588
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,680
This report very well may have nothing to do with UAP, but Johnson and Walker were close enough to exchange personal letters.

589
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,680
Let's also analyze the September 24, 1964 letter addressed to Dr. Walker from Johnson,

590
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,680
requesting Walker to personally recommend a university student to honor as a young leader.

591
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,680
Or how about this May 18, 1966 letter, dated after the Kexberg incident,

592
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:23,680
in which Johnson again profusely thanks Walker for his service as a member and chairman of the National Science Board.

593
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,680
One Dr. Hornig is mentioned here, pay attention to that name for later.

594
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,680
In this letter, Lyndon B. Johnson cryptically says,

595
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,680
I should also like to thank you for the unstinting manner in which you served your government in other areas,

596
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,680
including your recent tenure as a board of the Defense Science Board.

597
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:47,680
Just how deep was this relationship between the president and a man associated with USG crash retrieval efforts?

598
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,680
Johnson also had a provable interest in UFOs during his time in the U.S. Senate before his presidency.

599
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,680
In this article titled, Lyndon B. Johnson Calls for UFO Alert,

600
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,680
we can see Johnson attempted to institute a military subcommittee to report UFO sightings personally to him.

601
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:10,680
Johnson even wrote to Major Donald Kehoe, an excellent ufologist and author of The Flying Saucer Conspiracy,

602
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,680
in 1960 thanking Kehoe for delivering documented evidence on UFOs.

603
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,680
With all of this interest in UFOs and his relationship with the shadowy Dr. Eric Walker,

604
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:27,680
what was Johnson doing during and after the December 9th, 1965, Kexburg event and how much did he know?

605
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,680
In his 2024 release of all of his research files,

606
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:38,680
Grant Cameron has supplied incredibly crucial documents discussing Johnson's actions and meetings around the time of the Kexburg crash.

607
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:44,680
Here we find President Lyndon B. Johnson's schedule for December 9th through the 11th, 1965.

608
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,680
Since the time of the Kexburg event occurred around 4 to 5 p.m. Eastern Standard,

609
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,680
we will begin to analyze late appointments on the 9th and meetings the following day.

610
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,680
The evening of December 9th, the president seemed to partake in many leisure activities,

611
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,680
dinner, driving around the Texas White House, watching the evening news, etc.

612
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,680
On the morning of December 10th, 950 to be exact, solely an hour after waking,

613
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,680
we see a massive roster of guests arrive for an exhausting day of meetings.

614
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:20,680
The arrivals include the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or JCS as I'll refer to them, the secretary and undersecretary of defense,

615
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:28,680
doctors such as the aforementioned Dr. Donald Hornick, high-up USG officials, NASA Director James Webb, and more.

616
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:34,680
While no meetings this day make explicit mention of Kexburg, Soviet spy satellites, or ICBMs,

617
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:40,680
every single one of these names offer crucial insight and a key piece to the puzzle of the Kexburg mystery.

618
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,680
In the possibility of a read-in president addressing a pressing UFO crash retrieval.

619
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,680
Almost immediately upon the guests' arrival, the president began his meetings.

620
00:46:50,680 --> 00:47:01,680
For over two hours from 10.10 a.m. to 12.51 p.m., Johnson met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bill Moyers, Joe Califano, Secretary McNamara, and Secretary Vance.

621
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,680
There is a lot to break down here as each name warrants investigation.

622
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:14,680
The Joint Chiefs of Staff include U.S. Navy Admiral Donald L. McDonald, who was in 1965 serving as the Chief of Naval Operations,

623
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:21,680
and General Wallace M. Green, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. Not much to analyze about these gentlemen.

624
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,680
But during LBJ's presidency, USF General J.P. McConnell served as Chief of Staff for the U.S. Air Force.

625
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:35,680
Upon taking his position on February 1, 1965, he relieved General Curtis LeMay.

626
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,680
If that name sounds familiar, we have discussed LeMay earlier in this video,

627
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,680
and at length as the general who denied Senator Barry Goldwater to the Blue Room at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,

628
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,680
and congratulated Harry B. Cooper for his work on the quote-unquote UFO program.

629
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,680
LeMay's ties to ufology are vast.

630
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,680
Also among the JCS was U.S. Army General Earl Wheeler, who sat as the chairman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

631
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,680
worth noting Wheeler shot to the top of the ranks of the U.S. military without much combat experience,

632
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,680
eliciting criticism from many including none other than General Curtis LeMay, who called Wheeler quote,

633
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,680
Paulie Parrott, end quote.

634
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,680
A small detail worth noting, after the meeting, all of the Chiefs of Staff took a car ride with Johnson,

635
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,680
all but the under-qualified Wheeler.

636
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:27,680
The last Chief of Staff present in the early meetings is General Harold K. Johnson, Chief of Staff for the U.S. Army.

637
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,680
Johnson spearheaded the 8th Cavalry Regiment, which in Vietnam was a component of the 1st Cavalry Division,

638
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:40,680
the division I suspected in the Infographics Whistleblower video to contain the soldiers who witnessed the crashed UAP.

639
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:45,680
These Joint Chiefs of Staff were all overly qualified to be associated with the program

640
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,680
and briefed Johnson on the crashed UFO from the evening before, but this trail goes even deeper.

641
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,680
As previously mentioned, including in the morning meetings were Bill Moyers, the personal assistant to Lyndon B. Johnson,

642
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,680
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance,

643
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:08,680
and Naval Veterans Special Assistant of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense Joe Califano.

644
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,680
Califano would attend many of the meetings with Johnson the day of the 10th,

645
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:18,680
but here let's make special notice to Califano's duty as a member of the Federal Radiation Council.

646
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:25,680
Califano had a history of dealing with aerial collisions and crashes that required the Atomic Energy Commission's involvement,

647
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,680
such as this December 4th and 5th, 1965 case of a mid-air aircraft collision.

648
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:36,680
What is interesting to note here is a subsequent off-record meeting with Califano and Buford Ellington,

649
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:43,680
Director of the Office of Emergency Planning, on December 13th, 1965, four days after Kecksburg.

650
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:50,680
Why was this off-record meeting sent to Grant Cameron from the Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum considered off-record?

651
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:58,680
Following the JCS car ride excluding Wheeler, the guests engaged in lunch before Johnson met with McNamara, Vance, Bill Moyers,

652
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,680
and Dr. Donald Hornig, as well as Secretary Orville Freeman.

653
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:09,680
Donald Hornig served as Presidential Science Advisor to Johnson after also serving the late John F. Kennedy Jr.

654
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:17,680
The Presidential Science Advisor was a position first held by Dr. Vannevar Bush to Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman.

655
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,680
This should ring a bell to anybody familiar with the majestic documents.

656
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:25,680
The last member of this post-lunch meeting included Secretary Orville Freeman,

657
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,680
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture under Johnson from 1961 to 1969.

658
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:38,680
Why would a former Marine and Secretary of Agriculture be present at a meeting with three Secretaries of Defense and the Science Advisor to the President?

659
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:44,680
What is even weirder here is the presence of James Webb alongside an Undersecretary of Agriculture.

660
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:49,680
I take you to July 9th, 1947, just two days after the Roswell crash,

661
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:58,680
where James Webb, sitting as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, made late-evening calls to Norris E. Dodd, Undersecretary of Agriculture.

662
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,680
This may very well be a stretch here, but we must pursue all research angles.

663
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:11,680
Was Webb discussing the Roswell event with Dodd and do positions like Secretary of Agriculture entwine more with UAP programs than we might think?

664
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,680
I won't spend too much more time on the meetings, as we have already discussed the significance of most of the members in their grouping,

665
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,680
and I have glossed over some of the other interesting players like Dr. Glenn Seaborg,

666
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:28,680
who was a Nobel Prize-winning chemist and Atomic Energy Chairman from 1961 to 1971.

667
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,680
They could make an entire video on the significance of this day of meetings,

668
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:37,680
but the JCS and every single individual summoned to Johnson's Texas residence the day after Kecksburg

669
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:43,680
holds massive importance and possibly signifies a day of briefings and meetings on the crash.

670
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:54,680
To further our investigation of Kecksburg, we can analyze multiple witnesses claiming to have observed the Kecksburg bell

671
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,680
after it was dragged from the woods that cold winter night.

672
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:04,680
One such witness contacted Stan Gordon before the airing of a 1990 Unsolved Mysteries broadcast on Kecksburg

673
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,680
and provided detailed information on his experience with the Kecksburg craft.

674
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:15,680
According to this witness, as a member of the Air Force security team at Lockbourne Air Force Base near Columbus, Ohio,

675
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:23,680
he guarded the object on the early morning of December 10, 1965, after the object had been transported from Pennsylvania.

676
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,680
According to this witness, after arriving on a truck, the craft was backed into a hanger

677
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,680
and security was greatly tightened around the base.

678
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,680
The object, whose description matched the 10- to 12-foot bronze bell,

679
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,680
apparently stayed at the base only a short time the morning of the 10th,

680
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,680
before being transported to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio.

681
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,680
And we do have witnesses who claim to have observed the bell at Wright-Patt.

682
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:54,680
This witness Myron first contacted Stan Gordon after the airing of the 1990 Unsolved Mysteries broadcast

683
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,680
and was interviewed and investigated by the legendary Leonard Stringfield.

684
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:03,680
The trucker claimed the only reason he would discuss his experience was due to thinking

685
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,680
it would be okay to discuss what he saw since it was now on TV.

686
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,680
The word of Stringfield carries much weight for myself and others,

687
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,680
and regarding Myron, Stringfield stated in UFO crash retrievals the inner sanctum status report 6,

688
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,680
after a number of lengthy interviews and getting his testimony on videotapes at his home

689
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,680
by a medical friend and research associate, Dr. Brian Thompson,

690
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,680
I feel convinced of Myron's sincerity.

691
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,680
Stringfield's analysis of Kexberg would remain extremely balanced.

692
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,680
We can take, for example, Stringfield's discussion of an insider known as Uncle,

693
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,680
who spoke to Stringfield through an intermediary,

694
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,680
as noted in 1993's Status Report 3, amassing the evidence.

695
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,680
Uncle told Stringfield he was on the right track with his research but cautioned of disinformation.

696
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,680
Among Uncle's statements were claims of understanding alien biological structures,

697
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:00,680
that UFOs were of benign origin, and that the Kexberg case involved a crashed spy plane,

698
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:06,680
while the heavily contested Fort Riley and Johannesburg, South Africa crash cases were true.

699
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,680
All this is to say that Stringfield did in fact note opinions against Kexberg

700
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,680
but still pursued the case for well over a decade.

701
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,680
Anyways, back to Myron. As noted for the record by Stringfield,

702
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:23,680
Myron stated he and his cousin J.S. worked for a family-owned shale and tile brick business in Ohio.

703
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,680
Two or three days following the Kexberg crash,

704
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:31,680
the company was contracted for a large order of special glazed bricks to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

705
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,680
The customer, the U.S. Navy, according to Myron,

706
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,680
sent a representative to the business to select and inspect the bricks.

707
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:43,680
Myron claimed receipts of this transaction were lost when the business was sold to new owners.

708
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,680
The specialty brick in question was a, quote, double-glazed engineered brick, end quote.

709
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,680
Myron would later state the purpose of these bricks were to build a double-thick,

710
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,680
lead-lined protective structure around the Kexberg UFO to protect against radiation.

711
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,680
The shipment of bricks was delivered at a designated gate

712
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,680
where Myron and J.S. arrived in different flatbed trucks.

713
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,680
Once outside Wright-Patt, a two- or three-star general dressed in a blue uniform

714
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,680
led the delivery men to a warehouse ahead.

715
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,680
The destination for the bricks was a brick warehouse, 50 to 80 feet inside,

716
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:21,680
accessible by a narrow blacktop driveway surrounded by rows of offices and a power plant.

717
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,680
To quote Myron, nearby the building was a, quote,

718
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:29,680
army 35-foot-long tri-axle low-boy that I later learned transported the object.

719
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,680
A tarp was still draped over its midsection, end quote.

720
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,680
Myron noticed four or five frantic personnel outside the building,

721
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,680
equipped with white coveralls, visored headgear, rubber gloves and boots,

722
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,680
and a Colt .45 pistol, quote,

723
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,680
who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, end quote.

724
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,680
From Myron's point of view, the people inside the warehouse were solely concerned

725
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,680
about the object inside the building.

726
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,680
The personnel and delivery men unloaded the bricks by hand from trucks to pallets,

727
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:01,680
where Myron noticed the men were Navy, not Air Force by insignia on their uniforms.

728
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,680
During a break from unloading the shipment,

729
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,680
Myron somehow managed to approach the warehouse's door undetected and peer inside.

730
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,680
He observed metal scaffolding around a large, strange object with men at work.

731
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,680
Puzzling to Myron, parachute silks were suspended from the ceiling,

732
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,680
partially enshrouding the object, lit by one floodlight directed downward.

733
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,680
The object was bell-shaped, measuring an estimated 10 feet tall and less than 10 feet wide,

734
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,680
appearing metallic with a dull copper or bronze color,

735
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,680
but was charred or covered in a sooty residue.

736
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,680
Finding pursuing this mystery any further irresistible,

737
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,680
Myron asked one of the personnel about his use of an acetylene torch.

738
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,680
Myron told Stringfield, quote,

739
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,680
Probably thinking that my presence there meant I had a proper clearance.

740
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,680
The man who was wearing a visor told me he was trying to get inside, end quote.

741
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,680
Myron further explained to Stringfield the man told him all attempts to gain entry failed,

742
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,680
whether torch, diamond-headed drill bits, or acid.

743
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:03,680
This reminds me closely of the testimony of R.B. I covered in UFO Whistleblowers 2,

744
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,680
who stated he guarded a hamburger-shaped saucer in 1963 for two weeks,

745
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:13,680
where a science team tried and failed with endless methods to gain entry to the craft.

746
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,680
Myron then went on to explain, quote,

747
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,680
I was surprised when he told me that if there were bodies inside,

748
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,680
they might be too hot for the mortician to handle, end quote.

749
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,680
Bodies are always a contentious and interesting aspect of UAP retrieval.

750
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,680
We will address this point shortly.

751
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,680
Myron was then startled by the voice of a guard who said,

752
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:36,680
Forget what you've seen or we'll lock you up and throw away the keys.

753
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:43,680
And we found the base and they took us from the backside of the Wright-Patterson Air Base

754
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,680
all the way through the main part of the base, out the other side,

755
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:55,680
down Maple Street to the old training center for World War II.

756
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,680
When I walked in the facility I seen the bell shaped.

757
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:05,680
It was sitting there on stilts and it had a very big parachute

758
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,680
or something draped down over the top with a light up underneath the parachute

759
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,680
trying to cover this thing up so no one could see it.

760
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,680
And you could see a ladder leaning against the bell

761
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,680
before they were trying to get into one of the openings.

762
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,680
And the guard said that you weren't allowed to be in here,

763
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,680
but now I've already seen everything in there.

764
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,680
So it didn't bother me when he ran me back out.

765
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,680
The spaceship looked like a large acorn.

766
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:41,680
It ran about 14 feet to the top and about 10 to 12 feet wide at the bottom with a collar on it.

767
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:48,680
It had writing on the collar and it had a triangle on it

768
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:53,680
and it looked like the triangle was put on there with a welder

769
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,680
by sticking the welder against the metal to shape the writing

770
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,680
and the writing was all the way around the bell shape of it.

771
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,680
The bottom of the bell shape was completely black

772
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,680
and around the top of the edges was smoke covered

773
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,680
and the space thing looked like it was copper or bronze.

774
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,680
Stringfield contacted Myron's cousin on October 3, 1990.

775
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,680
J.S., as he'll be referred to, was reluctant to get involved due to family reasons.

776
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,680
He did confirm delivering glazed bricks to right pat with Myron,

777
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:33,680
remembered guards wearing protective clothing, and a technician with a blowtorch.

778
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,680
When Stringfield asked J.S. if he had seen the craft in the building,

779
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,680
J.S. stated, quote, I don't remember many details on that trip.

780
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,680
My partner probably knows more because he was more inquisitive.

781
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:50,680
Fast forward to 1991, Myron told Stringfield J.S. was willing to finally discuss his observations

782
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,680
that fateful December day in 1965.

783
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,680
On March 30 to April 1, 1991, Stringfield again interviewed J.S.

784
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,680
J.S. told Stringfield a new story.

785
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,680
He did in fact see the object the day before.

786
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,680
He and Myron went to right pat.

787
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,680
He had made the trip solo with an initial delivery of bricks

788
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,680
and clearly recalled an object shaped like the Liberty Bell

789
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,680
sitting upright under a tarp aboard a low-boy trailer.

790
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,680
J.S. estimated the craft to be 8 to 10 feet tall and 8 to 10 feet wide,

791
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:28,680
quote, I didn't ask any questions, but it probably arrived a short time before I did, end quote.

792
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:33,680
J.S. discussed activity in the area, men wearing fatigue suits, and there were armed guards.

793
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,680
But he didn't see anyone carrying any sort of rifle or machine gun.

794
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:42,680
Unlike the next day's trip, quote, there was nothing unusual at the entrance gate.

795
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,680
I gave the guard my identification and showed him my bill of landing

796
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,680
and was directed to the area for unloading near the big red brick building, end quote.

797
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,680
Like most cases, the discussion of bodies is the most controversial aspect of Kecksburg.

798
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,680
In his appearance in the 2003 annual crash retrieval conference proceedings,

799
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,680
Stan Gordon discussed the subject of bodies present at the crash.

800
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:13,680
To quote Stan, in more recent years I have heard rumors that are not widely known,

801
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,680
that two small bodies were supposedly found at the impact location in 1965.

802
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,680
I have generally accepted this as hearsay,

803
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,680
since there has never been any evidence to back up these claims.

804
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,680
One such testimony actually came from Myron, the trucker we just discussed,

805
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,680
who spoke to Gordon offering new details in 1998.

806
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,680
In poor health, Myron agreed to meet with Gordon for a documentary Gordon was working on

807
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,680
titled Kecksburg the Untold Story.

808
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,680
Stan says as the two were discussing what Myron saw in 1965,

809
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,680
Myron suddenly mentioned something which caused Stan and the video production crew

810
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,680
to look at the man with astonishment.

811
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,680
Myron added to his previous testimony delivered to Gordon and Stringfield,

812
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,680
stating when he peeked inside the warehouse he observed the bell propped up by scaffolding,

813
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,680
but he also saw a body lying on a workbench in the same room.

814
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:08,680
Myron added this body was covered in a white sheet measuring 4 to 5 feet tall.

815
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:13,680
The only feature seen was lizard-like skin from a left hand sticking out from under the cover.

816
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,680
I walked in the building and seen the bell shaped there and they were working on it.

817
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,680
I also seen an object laying on the workbench over there

818
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:25,680
and the workbench runs about 10 to 12 feet long and about 32 inches wide

819
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,680
and about 36 inches off the floor.

820
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:37,680
I seen the left hand of whatever was in there sticking out underneath the sterile white pad

821
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,680
and he only had three fingers.

822
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:46,680
It was about 4 foot 9 or 4 foot 5 inches tall if it was standing up,

823
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,680
but it looked like it weighed about 80 pounds.

824
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,680
And it had dark green or brownish skin and it was just like a lizard.

825
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,680
I have no doubt in my mind that the body laid on that table

826
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:10,680
and the left hand of him was sticking out underneath the white sterile pad that they had placed over him

827
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:17,680
and he had the three index finger and his skin looked like lizard.

828
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:24,680
I asked Myron why he waited so many years to divulge what he had seen in 1965.

829
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:29,680
Well, for the reason I never said anything before because Uncle Sam said

830
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,680
if it were ever leaked out and they had to come and lock you up and throw the keys away

831
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,680
or give you a bullet to satisfy you, no one will ever talk about it.

832
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,680
Right now is the time to tell it before something drastic happens.

833
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:49,680
And my son, he's 24 years old and he said, why are you going to do it now?

834
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,680
And I said, well, I may not live till tomorrow the next day to tell it,

835
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,680
so I'll tell it all tonight and be done with it.

836
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:01,680
The only thing I've got now is a bad heart and high blood pressure and sugar

837
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:08,680
and on oxygen once in a while and walking around taking nitroglycerin.

838
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:12,680
And the only reason I'm telling it now is because I may not be here tomorrow.

839
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:17,680
Why add this onto a story after nearly a decade after his initial testimony?

840
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,680
Another witness, Joel, contacted Stan after hearing local news covering

841
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,680
Leslie Keene and the CFI's attempts to pry free Kexburg documentation.

842
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:31,680
Gordon would meet with Joel at his home in late 2002, seeing Joel go back and forth

843
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,680
on whether or not to proceed with the interview in fear of getting in trouble for what he saw.

844
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:40,680
Joel claimed on the day of the Kexburg crash he entered the woods to investigate the crash zone.

845
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:46,680
His attention was drawn to a metal object emanating bright clashes of colors like electricity.

846
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,680
Joel hid in the woods to observe Army and Air Force personnel,

847
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,680
men in civilian clothing, and men in suits and hats enter the crash area.

848
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,680
Joel claimed to have observed an Army general hop on top of the metallic object

849
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,680
with a probe in his hand similar to an officer's billy club.

850
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,680
The general smacked the object and the tool flew out of his hands.

851
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:11,680
Gordon noted at this time Joel's expression changed to a far more somber and uncomfortable tone.

852
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,680
Joel stated soon after striking the object, a hatch opened that swung from right to left

853
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,680
at the front of the object, accompanied by a whirling, hissing sound.

854
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,680
Joel described as seeing what looked like, quote,

855
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:27,680
two fingers and an unusually long arm, end quote, inside the hatch before it closed again.

856
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,680
The concept of bodies may be supported by the testimony of Bill Weaver I mentioned earlier in the video.

857
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,680
Weaver, a teenager, observed men exit a large light-colored box truck

858
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,680
in what he described as moon suits.

859
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,680
The men carried a box-shaped device measuring four to five feet square,

860
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,680
resting upon a stretcher with four handles.

861
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:52,680
A little while later there was a large truck pulled in, a light-colored truck, a box van type.

862
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,680
Out of it there was four guys come out.

863
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,680
They had what we called moon suits at the time.

864
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,680
They were white coverall type suits.

865
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:07,680
They took a box out of there, a box maybe four or five foot square.

866
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:13,680
They carried in four handles and they carried that down to the object.

867
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:20,680
About just right after that there was a military man come over to the car and he told us to leave.

868
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,680
And I got into an argument with him.

869
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,680
I told him I didn't, you know, I wanted to stay, I didn't want to leave.

870
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:30,680
At that point he told me that he would confiscate my car if I didn't.

871
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,680
What's going on everybody? It's UAP Gerb.

872
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:41,680
Thank you so much for joining me today as we took a deep dive into the 1965 Kexburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash.

873
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,680
Now, what would you say if I told you today we just started to scratch the surface of this case?

874
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:53,680
Like I mentioned earlier in the witnesses tab, there are so many witnesses who have more to add to this story.

875
01:06:53,680 --> 01:07:04,680
The reason I covered Bulabush, Romanski, Betters, Weaver and so forth is because I think their testimonies offer the most complete picture and insight into the Kexburg story.

876
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:13,680
There are other residents who talk about a military base being set up in a home near them, kind of like Romanski discussed in his interview on Montell Williams.

877
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:22,680
There's other witnesses who talk more about the military presence and how it might have been obfuscated from a certain point of view when the military had reached up on Meteor Road and so forth.

878
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,680
So there is just so much rich testimony to pursue.

879
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:38,680
The Kexburg case has also seen so much coverage as we saw with Kexburg, the new Roswell and Kexburg, the untold story and Kexburg, the unsolved mysteries episode in Stan Gordon's 1993 documentary.

880
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,680
There has been so much coverage on this case.

881
01:07:41,680 --> 01:08:00,680
That is why I tried to take a more focused approach on breaking down the crash, focusing on a select few witnesses, focusing on the overall story and kind of narrowing in on what happened to the craft, the bell, after the case, as well as focusing on Eric Walker and Lyndon B. Johnson.

882
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,680
Now, those of you familiar with the case will know there are a couple of things I didn't discuss here.

883
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:14,680
One of these was de Glock, the alleged Nazi wonder weapon that was the exact same shape as the Kexburg bell, a similar shape to the Liberty Bell.

884
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:23,680
And that is because I would like to cover that and cover sort of Nick Cook's work in the hunt for zero point and the Nazi connection to UAP in a whole nother video.

885
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:33,680
I also left out claims of Kexburg and affirmation of Kexburg from the witness Clifford Stone, who testified in the 2001 NPC conference under Stephen Greer.

886
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,680
I did this because, of course, Clifford Stone carries with him a little bit of controversy.

887
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:45,680
So I want to analyze his claims and his merits before I put them into a Kexburg case in their own video.

888
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,680
Now, what were your favorite parts of this investigation?

889
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:53,680
For me, I must say I just I adore Jim Romanski.

890
01:08:53,680 --> 01:09:02,680
I think he's an incredible witness, probably my favorite eyewitness of any case, the way in which he passionately talks about the case in any interview he has, especially Montel Williams.

891
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,680
I really appreciate his demeanor.

892
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:15,680
I think he offers valuable insights into this case and especially the Montel Williams show where he discusses kind of how his children faced issues with his experience at Kexburg.

893
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:21,680
Also, I hope everybody enjoyed kind of the oblique look into the Blue Berets.

894
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,680
I think that's one of the most crucial aspects of this investigation.

895
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:29,680
They need to be investigated much more, and I will continue to do so over the course of my videos.

896
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:35,680
Investigate there the incident at Fort Maguire Dix, as Leonard Stringfield's supposed Blue Beret insider has claimed.

897
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:48,680
Try to kind of focus in on the security police and Air Force police aspect of the Blue Berets and see if these guys might be used as a rapid reaction unit for kind of domestic or even foreign crash retrieval efforts.

898
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:56,680
Also, of course, I've talked about it in many videos, and he's a person I view as sort of a linchpin to the whole UAP phenomena, Dr. Eric A. Walker.

899
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:17,680
Of course, in this video we saw, we talked about this in the Saarbacher video, but we re-went over his claims about saying he was in fact at the Kexburg case and that he did know about Majestic 12 and Robert Saarbacher was correct in terms of Dr. Eric A. Walker being a crucial member in UFO crash retrieval.

900
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:24,680
But what was new to me here was the UARC, the University Affiliated Research Center, and the ARL at Penn State University.

901
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:29,680
I think there's some great connections there to explore and I will continue to do so as well.

902
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:37,680
Also, I found the Lyndon B. Johnson connections with Dr. Eric Walker as well as Johnson's meeting scheduled the day after Kexburg, fascinating.

903
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:49,680
Now, if you'll look in the show notes and you can also find these PDFs posted in my Discord if you don't want to go to the link of Grant Cameron's files, but you will see all of the files I referenced because I really recommend following along.

904
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:57,680
I just gave a brief sample of some of the content we went over in this video, but there's pages and pages and pages of Grant Cameron covering this case.

905
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:06,680
I also really recommend reading crash retrievals 1 through 7, Stringfield's work, and seeing how he approached the Kexburg case over a span of 10 years.

906
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:21,680
It's really fascinating to see him kind of reference Uncle, the alleged insider he talked to through an intermediary with, and just him interview Pete, who is now of course Jim Romanski, interview Myron, and so forth.

907
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,680
Speaking of Myron, I find this witness so interesting.

908
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:36,680
Initially, I found it to be quite a red flag that Myron initially approached Stan Gordon in the late 80s and also spoke to Leonard Stringfield.

909
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:52,680
And it wasn't until 1992, 1993 for Stan Gordon's newest documentary that Myron touched on the topic of bodies when he had only commented on what a personnel at the base had said to him before about it being a hot issue for autopsies.

910
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:57,680
I think this case is a little different than something like the 1955 Del Rio case with Robert Willingham.

911
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:11,680
As Robert Willingham initially stated, he saw no such bodies and then changed his tone in about the Jeff Rents episode, maybe in 2008, 2012, I want to say, around the time of the book by Noah Torres came out.

912
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:20,680
Watching Myron was very interesting because that was a late pop-up in my research, seeing his interview in the 1993 Stan Gordon documentary.

913
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:27,680
He of course, as he claimed, felt much fear and that's why he kind of omitted the topic of bodies before.

914
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:34,680
Now there are a couple other witnesses who claim or are adjacent to body claims here such as Don Sebastian.

915
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:49,680
I didn't cover him just because I didn't see how his story really gelled with other witnesses because he described when he approached the scene and saw military men and was kind of hiding around observing the military operations, he heard a loud scream from the forest.

916
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:56,680
No other individual in the present area has also admitted hearing this scream, so I left that out.

917
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:02,680
What did you guys think of the Kexberg case? I want to know everybody's thoughts. This of course is such a famous case.

918
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:12,680
Of course, I think it's pretty self-evident this crash case has something very tangible, something that actually crashed in the woods in Kexberg and this was not a meteor as Blue Book claimed.

919
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:21,680
I think the discussion of the chaff discovered alongside the meteor where the Blue Book team from the 662nd radar squadron is extremely interesting.

920
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:27,680
I also am unsure about the claims of a Soviet capsule or American capsule.

921
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:33,680
I think there's plenty of evidence and discussion to dispute the landing of a human-made space object.

922
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:41,680
I was really excited to relay this bell shape to the infographics whistleblower and that Reddit whistleblower post.

923
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:46,680
All too often in crash cases, we mainly hear about saucers or egg shapes.

924
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:56,680
So it's really cool to focus some attention on this kind of almost a Liberty Bell shaped craft with strange hieroglyphic writings on it.

925
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:04,680
I think it's such a unique type of craft, especially as described by many of the witnesses, just big enough to fit an individual, maybe two.

926
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:16,680
The off-white, the off-yellow bronzish color and the fact this alongside other craft descriptions seems like it was made out of a single piece of metal, like pouring liquid metal into a cast.

927
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:22,680
I love this case. Right now, I lean towards this being a legitimate UAP retrieval case.

928
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,680
I think there's a lot of evidence here, a lot more evidence that needs to be pursued.

929
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:37,680
Of course, the only thing missing from this case with all of the witness testimony with Johnson, with Walker, with all the witnesses after the fact is some official documents.

930
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:42,680
And those, of course, are very scant in this case because apparently NASA lost them in 1987.

931
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:48,680
But again, let me know what you guys think. I want to appreciate every single person here watching this video.

932
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:55,680
Thank you so much for giving me your time. I can't believe you guys will sit through about an hour and a half, I think, at this time video.

933
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:01,680
Please remember to leave a like and subscription. It means the most. Leave some comments. Let me know what you think.

934
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:09,680
Remember, guys, I have a Patreon. I don't charge for any extra content. I don't gatekeep content on there. Only support what you think the channel is worth.

935
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:17,680
We got big things coming for the channel. Of course, regular viewers will know that we're doing about one live a week. I want to start doing some more interviews on the channel, too.

936
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:24,680
I know right now that interviews I've had usually take three weeks or so to conjure up because there's so much editing involved.

937
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:33,680
I do want to do some pure interviews as well. But of course, I'll be in the lab working on my my interview skills because I can get very tripped up with my words, as you all know.

938
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:37,680
But thank you so much for watching, guys. I will catch everybody on the next show. Thank you.
