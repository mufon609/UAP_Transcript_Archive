1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
For decades, humans around the world have reported sightings of dark, triangular-shaped

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,600
UFOs, often featuring three bright white lights at each corner and a dull red light or structural

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,800
features on the middle surface.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,320
Unlike classic flying saucers, orbs, egg-shaped craft, tic-tacs, and strange organic shapes

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,880
like the controversial jellyfish UAP, triangles have historically not been associated with

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,200
non-human intelligence but instead with deep-sixth, black-budget human reverse engineering efforts.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,360
This is somewhat due to triangular craft lacking many of the hallmarks of what some would consider

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,840
NHI craft.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,840
No visible means of propulsion, a lack of harsh angles and surface features, missing

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,120
rivets, bolts, and seams, as well as many triangular sightings occurring in concentrated

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,200
periods over populated regions and military bases.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,240
Triangular craft were further touched upon in the Fall 2024 UAP hearings, in which the

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,080
shadowy unacknowledged special-access program Immaculate Constellation saw its public report

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,900
released to Congress and the American people.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,580
At least some of the triangles among the rarest UAP configurations reported in the Immaculate

16
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:19,660
Constellation report have been confirmed by the USAP to be ARV, Alien Reproduction Vehicles,

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,360
the same term used by presiding program members to label the Fluxliner Flying Saucer Reproduction

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,340
Vehicle observed by Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Show.

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,280
And Representative Eric Burleson told me this was not the first time, in fact, he had heard

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,900
the term ARV.

21
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:45,420
And I've seen, listened some conversations about this with people from the UFO community

22
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,800
that will say that there's two types of aircraft, there's craft that is truly extraterrestrial,

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:59,540
and then there's craft that we have reverse engineered and created and were reproduced,

24
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,540
right?

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,220
And so that report, what is unique about the Immaculate Constellation report is it talks

26
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,660
about these reproduced, you know, basically us reproducing what is crashed.

27
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,460
What are these triangles whose descriptions are often time near identical indeed human-made?

28
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,260
What can we make of the whistleblower testimony of Edgar Fouchet, who described these craft

29
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,500
in great detail, including a name, the TR Tactical Reconnaissance 3B?

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,060
What valuable evidence can we gather from slightly different triangle variations seen

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,860
from the 1980s and 1990s?

32
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,380
And why would the X-Files TV show contract a triangle designed from an artist who drew

33
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,380
an alleged reverse engineered craft called the X-F-131 Super Sentinel, instructed by

34
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,340
two Lockheed Martin and two Northrop Grumman engineers?

35
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,140
Hey guys, it's UAP Grub, and I am thrilled for you to join me on another investigation

36
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,700
into alien reproduction vehicle, this time focusing on the black triangle seen throughout

37
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,700
the globe for decades.

38
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,700
Let's venture into the full story of the TR-3B ARV, a possible parallel joint Northrop

39
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,100
and Lockheed ARV hailing from the Lockheed Martin-Hellendale plan, and strange possible

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,660
ARV prototypes seen throughout the 1980s and 1990s with odd features.

41
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,040
Let us investigate the origins, configurations, and purposes of these craft allegedly built

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,980
from NHI technology.

43
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,980
On November 13th, 2024, the term ARV was entered into the Congressional Hearing Record with

44
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,060
the Immaculate Constellation Report.

45
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,500
No, this term did not originate with Stephen Greer in 2001, it can indeed be traced back

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:52,300
to 1988 with alleged first-hand witness Brad Sorensen, who observed DoD and private industry

47
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,580
attempts to reverse engineer anti-gravity flying saucer craft.

48
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,560
And now, the Immaculate Constellation unknown anonymous whistleblower report has labeled

49
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,140
another craft configuration as alien reproduction vehicles, the triangle.

50
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,640
The report, whose historical data tracked back to 2009, discussed a large equilateral

51
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,100
triangle directly appearing over intelligence-collecting vessels.

52
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,380
Captured by Indo-Paccom, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the triangle hovered and rotated

53
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,140
slowly 500 to 1,000 meters above the ocean.

54
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,780
Three bright points were seen at each bottom corner of the horizontally rotating triangle

55
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,160
with the horizontal bar of sweeping lights partially observed.

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,200
And intelligence revealed this triangle was a reproduction craft.

57
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,720
A second Indo-Paccom entry detailed a fighter jet-sized equilateral ARV triangle of unknown

58
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,600
origin hovering less than 200 meters above a vessel.

59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,760
At least two lights were observed on the craft with at least one more obstructed on the underside

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,920
of the craft with the triangle slightly positioned at an upward angle.

61
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,680
In their 2023 and 2024 historical reports, Aero listed triangles as solely 3 to 4 percent

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,120
of all reported UAPs, a morphology that is indeed quite uncommon.

63
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,920
Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official UFO investigation program from 1952 to 1969,

64
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,960
cataloged over 12,000 cases of varying quality.

65
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,800
Let's reference this paper titled The Blue Book Unknowns by Don Berliner, which utilizes

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,000
numerous criteria to analyze only the most unexplained of Blue Book cases.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,280
In the 1950s, we find solely four recorded anomalous triangle sightings.

68
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,100
These triangles are often described as colorful, a far cry from our dark gray, black craft

69
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,280
with three lights, the subject of today's analysis.

70
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,080
Although Aero and Blue Book are not necessarily trustworthy, we can form a strong observation

71
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
here.

72
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,400
Using historical UFO reporting trends, thank you to UFOsearch.com and Richard Geldreich,

73
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,640
we can directly observe the time period of 1940 to 1970 and 2000 to modern day, see few

74
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,280
triangular craft sightings reported.

75
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:16,400
1970 to 2000, particularly the 1980s and 1990s, see an overwhelming number of reported triangular

76
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,920
UFO sightings.

77
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,380
Not only does this confirm the data and claims made further in this video, but this also

78
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,780
suggests a worldwide multi-decade UFO flap of triangle-shaped craft.

79
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,260
With the cases and testimony we will explore in this video, a strong thesis could be constructed

80
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:39,980
that sometime in the 1970s, legacy UFO programs began constructing triangular alien reproduction

81
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,500
vehicles based on non-human triangular craft, and iterated on and tested such craft over

82
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,700
military bases during the 1980s to 2000s.

83
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:56,140
And let's also reference the controversial Majestic 12 document titled SOM 101, or the

84
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,800
special operations manual I covered at length with Ryan Wood.

85
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,940
In the description of craft from this document, allegedly dated 1954, we can find description

86
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,160
of triangular-shaped craft amongst the saucers, spheres, cigars, etc.

87
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,620
The triangles read, quote,

88
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:17,500
This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and recency of observations.

89
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,100
Radar indicates an isosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in

90
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,100
length.

91
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,020
Little is known about the performance of these crafts due to the rarity of good sightings,

92
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,400
but they are believed to be capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to or

93
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,820
exceeding the performance attributed to types A and C.

94
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,340
In the midst of a slew of anonymous triangular sightings with strange lights and fixtures

95
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:47,180
in the 1980s and 1990s, which we will discuss later, the 1989 Belgian UFO wave arose.

96
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,540
All too often associated with the Patrick M. hoaxed photograph or labeled a case of

97
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,900
mass delusion, the Belgian triangle UFO wave has incredible amounts of worthwhile investigation.

98
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,020
The wave is not the subject of today's video, but let's briefly discuss.

99
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,780
In November of 1989, hundreds of reports surfaced from Belgium of a large, flat, triangular-shaped

100
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,360
craft with lights underneath flying at low altitudes.

101
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,820
The event culminated on the night of March 30, 1990, where an unknown object was tracked

102
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:22,980
by radar and pursued by two Belgian F-16 fighters who were unable to locate the triangle.

103
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,520
Internal DoD documents once classified revealed U.S. authorities investigated the case and

104
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,980
even confirmed to the Belgian Air Force and Ministry of Defense that no USAAF stealth

105
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,660
aircraft such as the B-2 or F-117 were used in the region.

106
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,420
But what if this wave of sightings strangely caught on radar on March 30, 1990, was a series

107
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:50,880
of tests over an allied nation of a stealth craft even more secret than the B-2 and F-117?

108
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,380
What if this aircraft program was deep-sixed and embedded within special access programs,

109
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,180
within reach of only those with need-to-know access in the highest clearances the U.S.

110
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,660
had to offer?

111
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:13,180
What if this craft was the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle?

112
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,060
In at least three of my projects, I have mentioned the testimony of USAAF Master Sergeant Edgar

113
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:24,420
Fouchet and his claims of anti-gravity reverse engineered triangular craft called TR-3B.

114
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,780
Black budget operations involving Nellis, Slash Area 51, and Edwards Air Force Base

115
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,980
and involvement of contractors such as Lockheed Martin in non-human intelligence technology

116
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
exploitation.

117
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,500
Well, now is finally the time to explore his entire testimony.

118
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,380
Edgar Albert Fouchet, sometimes referred to as Edgar Rothschild Fouchet, was born in 1948

119
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,100
in South Central Georgia to fifth generation Americans.

120
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,540
His family history consisted of numerous individuals in military intelligence and classified projects.

121
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,660
During the Vietnam conflict while attending college, Fouchet worked as a machinist making

122
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,740
bombs.

123
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,160
In 1968, the young man was drafted into USAAF for para-rescue basic training.

124
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,400
After fracturing his ankle at Fort Benning, Edgar completed training in electronics, communication,

125
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,060
intelligence, and cryptological methods.

126
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,440
From 64 to 74, Fouchet was stationed at myriad tactical air command and air training command

127
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,280
bases including 3.5 years stationed in Vietnam and surrounding Asian bases.

128
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,300
Within USAAF, Fouchet earned degrees in electronics and avionics engineering as well as a bachelor's

129
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,540
in business and enjoyed numerous awards and a prestigious reputation for his advanced

130
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,840
skillset often sought after by military brass.

131
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,680
In the late 1970s, Fouchet would see a series of USAAF mandated stations at the now infamous

132
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,640
Groom Lake Area 51 facility with a top secret clearance with crypto access.

133
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,680
Fouchet was considered an Air Force expert with classified electronic countermeasure

134
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,200
test equipment, cryptological test equipment, and automatic test equipment.

135
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,580
All while receiving around 4,000 hours of technical training from USG and DoD, half

136
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,600
of which was classified.

137
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,560
Late in his career, working eight years as a defense contractor and engineering manager,

138
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,360
Fouchet dealt with classified black programs developing state-of-the-art electronics, logistic,

139
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,540
and technical data and automatic testing equipment.

140
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,320
The Master Sergeant participated as a hand-picked key member to work on USAAF fighters such

141
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:32,280
as the F-15 Eagle air superiority fighter, the A-10 Warthog, the P-1 Lancer bomber, and

142
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,140
the F-117A stealth fighter.

143
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,320
Fouchet claimed to have worked alongside the Defense Advanced Research Center in 1979,

144
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,200
which he stated was a minimum 10-story underground facility between Area 51 Groom Lake.

145
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,000
Fouchet was recruited to Groom Lake out of a station at Edwards Air Force Base Jet Propulsion

146
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Laboratory, which he claimed also consisted of deep underground facilities.

147
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,360
The Defense Advanced Research Center, DARSS, not to be confused with DARPA, the Defense

148
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,500
Advanced Research Project Agency, was actually a proposed institution.

149
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,580
Let's reference this Declassified Advanced Project Research Agency, ARPA, a lot of acronyms

150
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,660
I know, study written in 1973.

151
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:19,220
This study was written as a historical evaluation of the R&D management institution ARPA, who

152
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,620
at this time had established remarkably little in the way of official record or institutional

153
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,620
memory.

154
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,960
In page 82 of the document under ARPA Laboratories Discussing Advanced Aerospace Projects, we

155
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,480
find a DOD directive showing the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was considered for transfer

156
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,600
into the Defense Advanced Research Center, linking the department to the aforementioned

157
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,620
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

158
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,560
And it is worth noting the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was commanded by Nazi V-2 rocket

159
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,480
scientist and Operation Paperclip Transfer Wernher von Braun.

160
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,640
Von Braun's mentor was father of German rocketry Hermann Oberth, who performed extensive

161
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,620
study on UFOs.

162
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,220
But back to Fouchet, it was here at DARSS he would work with advanced digital technologies

163
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,660
and gain knowledge of human-made reverse engineered craft.

164
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,840
Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet made his first public disclosures regarding reverse engineered

165
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:25,140
anti-gravity triangular craft called TR-3B in his 1998 book Alien Rapture, and presented

166
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,200
this data for MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network and IUFO-C, the International UFO Congress

167
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,840
after years of interviews, research and preparation.

168
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,960
These disclosures were sourced from five close friends within DOD and classified programs,

169
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,200
as well as Fouchet's first-hand experience at Area 51 Groom Lake in the DARC.

170
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,920
We will focus mostly on his 1998 IUFO-C presentation, as it serves as an extremely comprehensive

171
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,700
baseline summary of Fouchet's testimony, while also pulling clips and contextually

172
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,200
relevant data from other sources and Fouchet interviews.

173
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,640
His book Alien Rapture is extremely similar to Secret Machines by Tom Delonge, where alleged

174
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:12,080
non-fiction events are shrouded in a guise of fiction to protect names, dates and locations.

175
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,160
Fouchet's 1998 testimony revolved around the revelations of secret government technology

176
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,480
and reverse engineered extraterrestrial artifacts.

177
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,600
Edgar set out with the specific goal of informing the public on the facts behind the infamously

178
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,200
cited flying triangles.

179
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,020
Form 3, you'll know exactly what the flying triangle is, the one that's been cited around

180
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
the world.

181
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:39,420
It's the most exotic and classified aerospace vehicle that's ever been built, and it may

182
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,380
be stealthily hovering over Phoenix, Belgium, or your city.

183
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,940
And we must note, outside of his own personal sightings of the craft while in service, Fouchet

184
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,500
did not work on the TR-3B.

185
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,340
He relayed much of the data he gathered around the TR-3B from his five close sources.

186
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,180
Let's discuss these five close sources who build much of the foundation for Fouchet's

187
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
disclosures.

188
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,860
Edgar's closest ally was Gerald, a former National Security Agency investigator and

189
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,900
TREAT team member.

190
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,140
TREAT stands for the Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team, aka what we might

191
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,300
call the Men in Black.

192
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,380
I can find only one publicly available mention of TREAT, and this is from Liechtenstein's

193
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:31,680
Crown Prince Hans Adams in a letter to Dr. Stephen Greer dated August 31, 1997.

194
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,720
This letter from an unknown sender discusses Hans Adams and his mention in a book by author

195
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Tom Bowers called Nazi Gold.

196
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,760
Hans had previously spoken and collaborated with Greer on UAP issues to an unknown degree.

197
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,680
This sender accused the Crown Prince of having supported counterintelligence operations against

198
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,800
the American people on the subject of UFOs.

199
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,920
And in this letter, the sender directly accused Hans Adams of funding TREAT.

200
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,400
Adams' funding should be focused on his support for TREAT and its Grand Dame, who

201
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:11,400
is wed to a former U.S. Army General, ex-head of Army Intelligence and Security Command.

202
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,480
The general in question here is U.S. Army General and founder of the U.S. Army Intelligence

203
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,560
and Security Command, INSCOM Albert Stubblebine.

204
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,840
Now I have good reason to believe Army INSCOM is likely associated with UFO crash retrievals,

205
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,760
but we will discuss this in a future project.

206
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,720
Major General Albert Stubblebine himself allegedly intimidated Stephen Greer to discontinue investigating

207
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,640
UFO black projects.

208
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,280
And the level of corruption is worrisome.

209
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:48,780
Now in 92, General Albert Stubblebine III, Burt, who had been head of Special Forces

210
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:57,060
and Army Intelligence, Fort Wachuca, he intercepted me after we had this major contact event

211
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,480
out in Florida and near Pensacola.

212
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,900
And he subsequently, about a month later, personally offered me $2 billion to not pursue

213
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,780
what I was doing and become part of his team.

214
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:17,460
And Stubblebine is currently witness 10658 in Greer's witness log.

215
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,420
His witness description reads, quote, has been involved since the 1960s, former head

216
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:28,500
of Fort Wachuca Army Intelligence where ET craft and bodies are stored, end quote.

217
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,380
What we can learn here is that quite possibly TREAT is the real life men in black housed

218
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,380
within U.S. Army INSCOM.

219
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:41,300
Okay, but back to Fouche and the first of the five disclosure advocates and team members, Gerald.

220
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,900
TREAT stands for Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team.

221
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,780
I think some of you call them men in black.

222
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,020
He worked for the Department of Energy and the National Security Agency.

223
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:00,580
This was his cover, but ultimately the National Security Agency controlled all his movements

224
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,780
and everything he did.

225
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,780
His job required him to watch employees with top secret and cue clearances and other classified

226
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:16,860
clearances at the Nevada test site, the Nellis range, Los Alamos, Sandia and many other bases.

227
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:22,580
He spent a lot of time out at Area 51 for years before I even knew what he was involved in.

228
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:28,460
This is where previously the most classified aerospace testing in the world took place.

229
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,740
You may know it as Groom Lake, Watertown, the ranch, our dreamland.

230
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,020
He was found dead of a heart attack a year after our last meeting.

231
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,860
The second individual, Sal, worked directly with the National Security Agency with Electronics

232
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,820
Intelligence and became a defense contractor upon his retirement.

233
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,660
Sal worked for the company that created the TR-3B gravity disruption device called the

234
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,460
Magnetic Field Disruptor.

235
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,660
More on this later.

236
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,620
The third friend, Doc, was an SR-71 spy plane pilot and USAAF test pilot at Edwards Air

237
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,020
Force Base.

238
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,940
Those who have watched my reverse engineering project at Edwards video will immediately

239
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,900
recognize the importance of Edwards and the 412th test group comprising the Edwards Test

240
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,140
Pilot School.

241
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,860
If you haven't, I recommend watching that, but we'll explain more during Fouche's testimony.

242
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,940
The fourth friend, Del, served with Fouche during Vietnam.

243
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,420
Del's father worked for the NSA for over 25 years and sent Fouche a host of Majestic

244
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,980
12 documents.

245
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,780
The fifth member, Ran Budd, was a DoD contractor electronics engineer who worked on top secret

246
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,300
R&D programs with electronic countermeasures.

247
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,180
The men were perturbed by the fact each had been privy to unusual phenomena, extremely

248
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:48,020
advanced technology and unidentified aerial vehicles that had not been reported.

249
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,980
As we sat at a table in a dark corner of the Silver Dollar Saloon in Las Vegas, discussing

250
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,980
our experiences and swapping knowledge, each of the group of five assured me that they

251
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,980
trusted me enough to write about their secrets and protect them.

252
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,180
We agreed to get together the next year with an understanding that I would contact each

253
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,060
of them and set up the meeting.

254
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:16,700
In the meantime, I wrote down all of our notes and their input and their contacts from other

255
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,220
friends about unusual phenomena and their personal sightings.

256
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,380
Many of the things the group revealed to me were startling, even to me, who had worked

257
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,700
25 years on black programs.

258
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,860
But before we continue, let's walk things back and get to know Fouche and his station

259
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,140
in black programs a little bit better.

260
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,900
In 1979, after working at Nellis with top secret crypto access clearance, Fouche received

261
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,060
a request for temporary reassignment to a place with no name.

262
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:50,020
Fouche's commanding officer had no idea where he was going, who he would be working with

263
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,420
or what he would be working on.

264
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,300
And while we're here, let's take a longer look at this document obtained via FOIA, discussing

265
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,980
a promotional recommendation for Fouche.

266
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:06,100
Fouche was assigned to Detachment 3, AFFTC, which is the Air Force Flight Test Center

267
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,940
Detachment from Edwards Air Force Base that runs operations at Area 51, Groom Lake.

268
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:18,020
Remember how Witness Ed stated he was read into UAP programs at Nellis and Area 51 S4

269
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,140
before moving on to become a test director of reverse-engineered craft at Edwards.

270
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,740
Edgar left on a Monday morning at 4.30am and boarded a dark blue USAAF bus with blacked

271
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,740
out windows.

272
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,580
28 other people sat on the bus, not including two security policemen.

273
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,200
All personnel were ordered not to speak to one another.

274
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,900
After several hours, the bus came to rest and Fouche knew immediately where he was,

275
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,440
Groom Lake, Area 51.

276
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,160
According to the Master Sergeant, the top-secret SR-75, SR-74, and TR-3B operated out of Groom

277
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,280
Lake and have historically been misidentified as UFOs.

278
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,580
Upon reaching Groom Lake, the bus entered a hangar and the doors were shut.

279
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,240
Security personnel checked in Fouche and the others.

280
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,760
He was given a pair of heavy glasses, similar to welder's goggles, that obscured his peripheral

281
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,040
vision and restricted vision to within 30 feet.

282
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,520
For the next 10 consecutive days and further on follow-up visits, Fouche's routine was

283
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
the same.

284
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,480
Leave Nellis before sunrise and return to Nellis after dark.

285
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,360
Fouche would write down everything he saw and heard at Groom Lake, including hearing

286
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,920
topics discussed such as pulse detonation, cyclotronic radiation, quantum flux transduction

287
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,380
field generators, quasicrystal energy lenses, and EPR quantum receivers.

288
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,020
Pulse detonation may remind you of the Aurora pulsar craft seen by Brad Sorensen at the

289
00:22:42,020 --> 00:23:02,860
1988 Norton Air Force Base show.

290
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:09,300
His station at Groom Lake is also where Fouche would meet Treet aka Men in Black agent Gerald.

291
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,680
According to Fouche, on Area 51 is the super secret laboratory named the Defense Advanced

292
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,520
Research Center, of which we can only find one official mention.

293
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,240
DARS consists of 10 underground stories next to a mountain near Papoose Lake south of Groom

294
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,640
Lake and is nestled next to a hangar in the side of a mountain, which stores the TR-3B

295
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,380
reverse engineered craft.

296
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,180
The DARS's objectives were fully realized in the mid-1980s according to Fouche, when

297
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,680
it was bolstered with SDI money under the Reagan administration.

298
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,200
Viewers of my channel will recall multiple times in which I have discussed sources commenting

299
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,400
on the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI, under Reagan, serving a secondary purpose

300
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,800
to protect the U.S. mainland from ballistic missiles.

301
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,720
This secondary purpose being the detection of and offensive capabilities against UAP.

302
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,320
Fouche claimed his sources estimated up to 35% of SDI's funding was siphoned off to

303
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,500
support USAAF black programs starting in 1982.

304
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,660
First-hand ARV witness Brad Sorensen was additionally told in 1988 by the men in charge of the ARV

305
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,100
exhibit they were requesting funding to build more of these reverse engineered craft.

306
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,900
The Reagan admin placed extreme importance on the building of ARVs.

307
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:30,020
Shockingly, Fouche stated defense contractor EG&G not only provided classified R&D for

308
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,500
black projects, technical and scientific support for nuclear and energy R&D, but also

309
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,880
EG&G built these hidden bunkers, mountain hangars, and vast underground facilities at

310
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,140
Groom Lake, Papoose, and Mercury for the government housing facilities such as DARS.

311
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,060
The mention of these facilities ties into the topic of DUMs, deep underground military

312
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,940
bases, which I will explore in the future.

313
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,380
Alongside EG&G, the Rand Corporation more than likely has a hand here.

314
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,460
Liger would also claim he gathered knowledge EG&G was awarded an indefinite contract for

315
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,740
Project Red Light to support the Department of Energy and Military.

316
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,540
This contract gave them responsibility to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials

317
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,260
in cases of mishaps and to provide aerial and ground security for highly classified

318
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,460
government and military sites.

319
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,380
One's mind may be drawn here to the nuclear emergency support team supported by EG&G,

320
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,300
Project Red Light was also relayed to Leonard Stringfield in his crash retrieval status

321
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,140
reports by a witness claiming the project served to test NHI and reverse engineered

322
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:40,380
craft on the Nellis test range after the craft had been shipped from Edwards Air Force Base.

323
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,040
Sources of the Master Sergeant claimed, as of 1992, the Air Force conducted a contingency

324
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,000
plan due to so many public eyes on Area 51.

325
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,940
This would see the majority of exotic aircraft platforms relocated to Utah, likely Dugway

326
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:01,260
Proving Grounds, Colorado, Alaska, Greenland, Diego Garcia, and south of Area 51 to S-4.

327
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,540
But at Papu's, where they store one of the TR-3Bs and they maintain these as their depot,

328
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,020
it's built into the side of a mountain cut out of stone.

329
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:15,060
They have a holographic generator that generates the side of the mountain and when you're ten

330
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,140
feet from the side of this mountain and looking into the hangar, you can only see a mountain.

331
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,620
And that's why when the Russian satellites fly over to verify the SALT Treaty, when they're

332
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:29,660
infrared and other spectral scanners shoot down at Groom, they only see stone because

333
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,180
that's all that's there.

334
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:37,040
Just before this date of 1992, there is strangely enough evidence to show a heavy focus on strange

335
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,140
exotic aircraft programs out of Area 51, possibly UFO related.

336
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:47,160
In 1990, Jane's defense writer James Goodall revealed a thesis of at least eight black

337
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,140
programs flying out of Area 51 Groom Lake, including a silent triangle utilizing unconventional

338
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,580
technologies.

339
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:00,180
A source Goodall knew for 12 years was stationed at Groom Lake and explained that UAP positively

340
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,780
exists at the base while another source of his stated, quote, we have things out there

341
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,500
that are literally out of this world, better than Star Trek or anything you can see in

342
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,040
the movies, end quote.

343
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,020
And now we finally get into a full body description of the TR-3B craft.

344
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:23,140
Finally, I've saved the best for last.

345
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,500
The operational model of the TR-3B, a friend of mine said he had never forget the sight

346
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,840
of the alien looking TR-3B landing at Papoose, south of Groom.

347
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,060
The pitch black triangular shaped TR-3B is rarely mentioned and then all in whispers.

348
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:46,460
This craft, the most classified aerospace development program in existence at the time,

349
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:53,180
codename Astra, Advanced Stealth Technology Reconnaissance Aircraft, saw 200 feet diameter

350
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,660
testing models and three and 600 feet diameter operational models.

351
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,740
The tactical reconnaissance TR-3B operated as the most exotic model under the Aurora

352
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,820
program according to Fouché.

353
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:12,260
The same program umbrella that oversaw the Pulse Detonation UAV Pulsar craft observed

354
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,080
by Brad Sorensen.

355
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,840
And we may have some clues regarding this family of Aurora craft in previous DoD budgets.

356
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,500
In DoD procurement programs, we can find an Aurora project that DoD planned to spend $80

357
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,660
million on in fiscal year 86 and $2.3 billion on in fiscal year 87.

358
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,180
This 25 times increase in spending is enormous and at the time was double the cost of the

359
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,580
B-2 Spirit Bomber program.

360
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,020
The Aurora program may have included the reverse engineered TR-3B, Lockheed Pulsar as seen

361
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:52,900
by Sorensen, and a little known craft titled the SR-33A introduced by Dr. Michael Wolf,

362
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:58,020
an alleged UAP consultant to the National Security Council's special subcommittee.

363
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:04,400
Similar to TR-3B and Pulsar, the SR-33A allegedly utilized conventional fuel and anti-gravity

364
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,500
field propulsion systems to operate under a secret space program.

365
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,320
The first flight-ready operational model of TR-3B occurred in the early 1990s, built through

366
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,220
SDI and black budget monies.

367
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:23,440
By 1994, at least three of the billion dollar plus operational models were flying.

368
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,320
But Fouchet had seen the prototype model, or a different model, three times previously

369
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,500
far before 1994, and according to his sources, there were numerous prototypes with the first

370
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,800
anti-gravity warping craft flying in the early 1970s.

371
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,040
Not only did he claim to have seen photographs of TR-3B from a C-130 flying mission support

372
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,620
for the reverse engineered craft, but Fouchet also claimed to have observed the triangles

373
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:56,420
one night in 1975, high in the atmosphere over Edwards Air Force Base, as well as 1976

374
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,720
within the southern part of Nellis Range, and lastly in 1979 at Groom Lake.

375
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,780
This prototype model looked fairly similar to Fouchet's official model, but with different

376
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,040
engines on the tip and no rotable crew compartment.

377
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,500
I do recommend checking out part 6 of author Andrew Johnson's interviews with Fouchet

378
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,340
to hear more about his sightings.

379
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,920
For the interest of time, I will not show these long clips here.

380
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,140
But let's hear about more aspects of the TR-3B Fouchet learned from sources within

381
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,180
Black Programs and his five disclosure comrades, and then discuss how the propulsion and engineering

382
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,660
system allegedly functioned.

383
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,900
According to these sources, the original TR-3B craft design was reverse engineered by Sandia

384
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:41,240
National Labs in Livermore Laboratories from a non-human intelligence crash recovery from

385
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,100
an unknown date or location.

386
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,740
Sandia may be familiar to some, as the laboratory nestled within Kirtland Air Force Base, New

387
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:54,500
Mexico has been often historically implicated with UFO material recovery, seeing numerous

388
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,780
mentions within the MJ-12 documents such as the Eisenhower briefing document and Interplanetary

389
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,340
Phenomenon Unit reports.

390
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,020
Livermore Labs, now called Lawrence Livermore, is one of three National Security Enterprise

391
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:15,060
FFRDCs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, sponsored by the DOE to support U.S.

392
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,180
Nuclear Deterrence.

393
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,260
The other two locations are Los Alamos National Labs and, of course, Sandia.

394
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:29,780
I myself have been told alongside UARCs, University-Affiliated Research Centers, FFRDCs are semi-private

395
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:36,300
institutions that serve to operate alongside DOD and corporate legacy programs for material

396
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,580
exploitation, reverse engineering, etc.

397
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:45,060
Other FFRDCs include Oak Ridge National Laboratory, owned by Battelle, where our good friend Sean

398
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,460
Kirkpatrick ran off to after Arrow, as well as numerous institutions run by the MITRE

399
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,180
Corporation and RAND Corporation.

400
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,940
MITRE and RAND will receive their own projects in the near future, as I believe these semi-private

401
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,760
institutions are integral corporations involved in legacy programs.

402
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,760
For those unfamiliar with UARC, just need to look back at my work on the 1965 Kecksburg

403
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
crash.

404
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,520
Dr. Eric A. Walker, President of Penn State, self-admitted he oversaw the Kecksburg crash

405
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
site.

406
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,480
Walker had also previously set up Penn State's UARC, the Applied Research Laboratory, at

407
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,700
the behest of the U.S. Navy.

408
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,640
And let's not forget, as of 2024, the untrustworthy Arrow, under new leadership of Dr. Kozlowski,

409
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,720
a likely whistleblower honeypot with contracts with Sandcorp, a company built to prevent

410
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,720
whistleblower leaks, stated Arrow works alongside UARC and FFRDC.

411
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Sure.

412
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,200
Right now, most of our collaborations that are veering towards academia are with university-affiliated

413
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,560
research centers associated with universities or with FFRDCs.

414
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,120
All this is to say, Fouchet's accusations that Sandia and Lawrence reverse-engineered

415
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,720
is a sober and rational statement.

416
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,400
Edgar would also state the TR3B program was managed by the NRRO, CIA, and NSA, and the

417
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:13,240
craft was built primarily by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne Ryan, and a number of other

418
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,360
defense contractors to keep R&D compartmentalized.

419
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,920
There is a lot to break down here.

420
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,800
One, due to the excellent work of Chris Sharpe and an upcoming interview that I have with

421
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,560
Dr. Eric Davis, yes, of the Wilson Davis Memo, we can implicate the CIA Directorate of Science

422
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:35,720
and Technology with support agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office, National

423
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,240
Underwater Reconnaissance Office, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and likely

424
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,760
the National Security Agency as leading teams behind UFO crash retrievals.

425
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,560
Fouchet mentioning Lockheed Martin needs no further explanation.

426
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,640
I do recommend checking out both my Mark McCandlish video and Lockheed Martin investigation.

427
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,040
I'll link them in the video description.

428
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Now, Boeing is indeed an interesting mention.

429
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,120
Director of Edwards 412th Electronic Warfare Group, Ed, stated he worked alongside Boeing

430
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,920
and Lockheed on reverse-engineered craft systems at the Nellis Range.

431
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,080
Boeing will additionally receive a video of its own, but for now let's reference a fascinating

432
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,280
2013 project by stealth aircraft researcher John Joseph.

433
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,120
Joseph claims Boeing served as the primary contractor in Project Brilliant, an SDI program

434
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,000
with the goal of setting up an electromagnetic shield around the U.S. using a boomerang-shaped

435
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,880
craft that could loiter over cities.

436
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,000
Northrop Grumman has as much as Lockheed Martin been historically implicated with the creation

437
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
of TR-3B.

438
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,720
Let's hold off on discussing them for now, as later I would like to tackle a possible

439
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,200
triangle variant constructed by Northrop Grumman.

440
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,320
Fouchet knew the TR-3B housed a crew of four and served as logistics support and transport

441
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,720
for a secret space command.

442
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,680
These pilots were top graduates of Navy and USAAF test pilot schools, mainly out of the

443
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,040
Edwards 412th test school.

444
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,920
Edwards witness Ed additionally made these same claims.

445
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,960
The craft employed two nuclear reactors, was comprised of advanced composites, metal materials

446
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,360
and titanium, and employed variable-vectored intake and thrusters on the edges and advanced

447
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,920
multi-mode propulsion engines on each tip of the triangle.

448
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,820
The triangle has three lights on each tip, a large diffuse light on the bottom center

449
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,560
due to the MFD drive and featured almost no sound bar a magnetic humming.

450
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:35,360
The TR-3B outer coating was reactive to electrical radar stimulation and can change reflectiveness

451
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,000
radar absorption.

452
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Fouchet described the outer skin slash panels as electrochromatic, which would camouflage

453
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,320
the craft for daytime stealth operations.

454
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,960
Let's further dive into the propulsion system from Edgar's own words.

455
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,200
The circular plasma field accelerator ring, called the magnetic field disruptor, surrounds

456
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,360
a rotatable crew compartment.

457
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,040
It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology.

458
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,680
Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed a reverse engineered MFD, and I believe the

459
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,840
government will go to any lengths to protect this technology, but you're not going to be

460
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,920
able to build one of these from what I tell you, nor am I.

461
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,920
The government will go to any lengths, believe me.

462
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,440
The plasma in this accelerator is mercury based, it's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres

463
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,720
at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin superconductivity and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per

464
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:36,220
minute to create a superconductive plasma with the resulting gravity energy.

465
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:41,520
The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field which disrupts and neutralizes effects of

466
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,080
gravity on mass within proximity by 89%.

467
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,360
Do not misunderstand, this is not anti-gravity.

468
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,480
Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force.

469
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,240
The mass of the circular accelerator and all the mass within the accelerator, such as the

470
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:04,200
crew compartment, avionics, MFD systems, fuels, environmental systems, and nuclear reactor,

471
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,080
are reduced by 89%.

472
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,880
This causes the effect of making an aircraft extremely light and able to outperform any

473
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,080
aircraft yet constructed, except of course those we didn't build.

474
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:25,360
TR3B is a high altitude stealth reconnaissance platform with indefinite loader time.

475
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Once you get it up there at speed, it doesn't take much propulsion to maintain altitude.

476
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,320
With the vehicle's mass reduced by 89%, the vehicle can travel at Mach 9 vertically or

477
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
horizontally.

478
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,200
So, for those that have had sightings of things making right, and they're not perfect right

479
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,800
turns obviously, nothing can make a perfect right turn.

480
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,920
It's against the laws of physics.

481
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,520
But it sure looks like a right turn at a distance.

482
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,720
For those that have seen it, that's how they do it.

483
00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:01,320
TR3B uses three multimode thrusters mounted on each corner of the triangular platform.

484
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,240
The multimode propulsion system can operate in the atmosphere with thrust provided by

485
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,520
the nuclear reactor, and in the upper atmosphere with hydrogen propulsion, and in orbit with

486
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,240
combined hydrogen-oxygen propulsion.

487
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:19,520
A key component of TR3B, propulsion as described by Fouche, states its MFD technology built

488
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,520
from reversed engineered UAP is not anti-gravity necessarily.

489
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,760
Anti-gravity by definition provides a repulsive force that can be used for propulsion.

490
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,840
The MFD creates a quote-unquote disruption of the Earth's gravitational field upon

491
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,920
the mass within the circular accelerator.

492
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,000
Such systems leveraged from non-human technology may indeed be present in highly secret but

493
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,440
acknowledged aircraft systems.

494
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,400
One such example may be the Northrop Grumman B-2 stealth bomber.

495
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,360
UFO researchers such as Dr. Richard Boylan have reported three-star generals and retired

496
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:00,080
Colonel Donald Ware have disclosed the B-2 carries onboard electro-gravitic systems to

497
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,080
cause internal mass reduction on the wings and fuselage of the craft, which directly

498
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,040
leads to the over $1 billion price tag for each craft.

499
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,440
The question is, and Mark talked about this before, is there more going on to the B-2

500
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,160
than meets the eye?

501
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:24,000
Aviation Week Space Technology, March 9, 1992, had a very interesting article from people

502
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,080
who worked at Northrop who were very upset that the technology associated with the B-2

503
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,960
program was not being trickled down to the public industry.

504
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,300
They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges the leading edge of the wing to reduce the

505
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,800
radar cross-signature, that's what you see in this diagram right here, and then negatively

506
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,500
charges the exhaust gases to reduce the infrared signature.

507
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,500
This is the same type of electro-gravitic technology that T. Townsend Brown had originally

508
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,000
proposed in the 1930s.

509
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So this technology might date back a lot earlier than we originally thought.

510
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,360
And before we move on, remember earlier when Edgar Fouchet mentioned Astra, Advanced Stealth

511
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,280
Technology Reconnaissance Aircraft, served as the codename for TR-3B?

512
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,160
Well we may in fact have a crash retrieval of this craft.

513
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,160
In Ryan Wood's masterpiece, Magic Eyes Only, we can find a case dated September 26, 1994

514
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,460
from Boscombe Down, England.

515
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,980
This case file references a publication from the November 1994 edition of Air Force Monthly

516
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:31,060
which discusses an unusual crash landing on the runway of the UK government's highly

517
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,780
secret Boscombe Down facility.

518
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:39,140
Rumors quickly circulated the crash was of a flying triangle seen by UFO witnesses for

519
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,380
decades.

520
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,700
The Air Force Monthly article reads, quote,

521
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:57,100
visited and two days later the wreck was loaded onto a CC-5 Galaxy and flown to Air Force

522
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,220
Plant 42 at Palmdale, California.

523
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,480
The secrecy surrounding the incident has led to speculation that the aircraft involved

524
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,180
was a TR-3A, the existence of which the US government has yet to officially acknowledge.

525
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,340
End quote.

526
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,980
While this publication mentions the crash of a TR-3A, and Fouchet does indeed state

527
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:23,220
the TR-3A exists but is remarkably different from TR-3B, it's worth noting quite often

528
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:29,340
in the public realm TR-3A and TR-3B are often used almost interchangeably so perhaps this

529
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,780
crash case is referencing TR-3B.

530
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:38,940
And this distinction is key to explore further as terminology around TR-3A is quite confusing.

531
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,980
Quite often I have seen the TR-3A referred to as the pumpkin seed, a craft utilizing

532
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,060
pulse detonation engines.

533
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:50,260
The same unmanned craft Brad Sorensen saw in 1988.

534
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:56,380
While other sources refer to TR-3A as a delta-shaped fighter featuring a cockpit, pulse detonation

535
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,320
engines and electro-gravitics for internal mass reduction are complementary field propulsion

536
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,860
for high speeds.

537
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:08,220
But while exploring this A and B distinction under Codename Astra, there is a fascinating

538
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,460
tangent I want to cover.

539
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,380
Let's reference Secret Machines by Tom Delonge and A.J.

540
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:20,420
An extremely famous science fiction novel in the UFO community that fuses the imagination

541
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,420
of Delonge with actual events obtained from U.S. military and government sources.

542
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,340
A literary device known as a Romana clay.

543
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,580
Facts in this book were allegedly given to Delonge by advisors such as the commander of

544
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:38,460
the Air Force Research Lab at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, multiple Lockheed Martin

545
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,260
Skunk Works officials such as Eric Schrock and others.

546
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:47,220
This excellent book makes numerous mentions to an astro-black triangle reverse engineered

547
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,220
craft.

548
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,220
Quote,

549
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:54,780
The craft itself, according to its data manual, was triangular and was named the Astra 3B,

550
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,260
but we just call it the Locust, said Beaker with a smile.

551
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,140
He was proud to be connected to it.

552
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:05,700
The Locust had control layouts unlike those used in any aircraft he had ever seen.

553
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,140
Controls that were not just familiar, but counterintuitive to anyone with a basic sense

554
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,780
of aviation or aerospace physics, end quote.

555
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,820
But what I really want to draw attention to here is the description of the Astra's control

556
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,820
mechanism.

557
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:24,940
When characters in the film operate the Astra TR-3B Locust, the pilot's chair looked disappointingly

558
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:30,900
like that from an F-16, but on the left armrest of the pilot's seat sat a red sphere sitting

559
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900
in a cradle.

560
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,900
Quote,

561
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,380
Alan turned the sphere under his hand and the craft rotated cleanly, too cleanly in

562
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,380
the air.

563
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,820
He then applied a little thrust and was moving.

564
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,140
The landmarks of Paris, including the Eiffel Tower, zipping past them in a blur.

565
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,500
He pursed his lips.

566
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,500
State of the art it may be, but it didn't feel like flight.

567
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,460
No aircraft could pivot on a dime like he had just done, end quote.

568
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,460
Quote,

569
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,900
He engaged the manual system and cupped his hand over the red trackball on his armrest.

570
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,780
He rolled it gently and the Locust pivoted in place.

571
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,780
Quote,

572
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:07,500
He engaged the manual system and cupped his hand over the red trackball on the armrest.

573
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,380
He rolled it gently and the Locust pivoted in place.

574
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,380
He did it again, applying a little thrust with his other hand, and the ship changed

575
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,220
direction again, leaping hard to the west and then climbing in a dizzying spiral before

576
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,580
screaming back to the southeast.

577
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:26,260
Of course there was no screaming, except perhaps inside Alan's head, as the laws of physics

578
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,460
seemed to implode with each movement the craft made.

579
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,460
No sound.

580
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,460
No torque.

581
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,460
No g-force.

582
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,460
No inertia.

583
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,460
End quote.

584
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:39,060
Now of course this passage material is interesting, but why do I bring this up?

585
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,940
Well because the control scheme in this is the exact same sphere mechanism primary witness

586
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:49,140
Brad Sorensen and aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish claimed the alien reproduction

587
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,540
vehicle Fluxliners utilized.

588
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:56,820
See on screen Mark McCandlish's drawing of the trackball used to control the flying saucer.

589
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:02,940
Countless comparisons to the 1988 saucer ARV encounter have been made so far in this project.

590
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,620
Perhaps the Fluxliner and TR-3B are born of the same programs.

591
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,300
With disclosures as impactful and spellbinding as Fouche's, his story attracted a great

592
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,660
deal of attention and controversy.

593
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,620
So I'd briefly like to mention the contentious arguments that waged war against Fouche in

594
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,100
the early and mid 2010s.

595
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,260
This controversy is quite complex and I have zero skin in this game, so we will simply

596
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,140
try and analyze the statements made criticizing and supporting Fouche and the story of the

597
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,620
TR-3B.

598
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,540
Let us draw out a few key players here.

599
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:46,460
Jeremy Ries, aka Alien Scientist, David Hamilton, author of secret space program Andrew Johnson,

600
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,900
UFO researcher Dan Benkert, and Master Sergeant Fouche himself.

601
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:56,300
On his website, alienscientist.com, Jeremy Ries posted some startling opinions on Fouche

602
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:01,020
after discussing Edgar's autobiography and very real military documents.

603
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,900
Jeremy stated the TR-3B testimony was, quote,

604
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,700
"...information that has no technical value and was likely fabricated by Ed in an effort

605
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:15,180
to combine stories about the Nazi Bell device with the Belgian wave of triangular UFO sightings,

606
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:20,260
so that his story would be more believable to the UFO research community," end quote.

607
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:26,240
This claim was based off criticism of Ed stating the TR-3B utilized mercury-based plasma systems

608
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,780
alongside strong opinions after years of friendship with the Master Sergeant.

609
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,260
After meeting Edgar in 2009, Jeremy would view the veteran as a close friend and legitimate

610
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,100
whistleblower for years, quote,

611
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:41,700
"...after having known Edgar Fouche for the past four years, I must say that he is one

612
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:47,020
of the most deceitful and manipulative people that I have ever met personally," end quote.

613
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,980
Jeremy would accuse this behavior as stemming from PTSD-driven rampant alcoholism.

614
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,340
Jeremy would even state Edgar claimed to have flown a TR-3B one night whilst intoxicated,

615
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,260
however, he provides no evidence or receipts of this statement.

616
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,780
Fouche's father, Andrew Johnson, who conducted numerous interviews with Fouche and formed

617
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,340
a close friendship on the contrary, spoke very highly of the man.

618
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,100
Positions against Edgar from Jeremy Rice and an individual known as David Hamilton

619
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,740
crutch on a few key points outside of what Jeremy viewed as a lack of compelling physics

620
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:23,480
behind the TR-3B – faked military documents and a photo of the F-117A stealth fighter.

621
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,300
On an undisclosed date, Edgar sent Jeremy an image alleging to picture Fouche alongside

622
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:35,140
a crew observing the F-117 prototype at Area 51 between 1977 and 1981.

623
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,620
Rice claimed Ed stole the photo from an article titled F-117A Senior Trend.

624
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,420
The photographer of this image would even respond, quote,

625
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,540
I cannot tell you who is in that photo, but I can tell you that Mr. Fouche doesn't know

626
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,780
what he is talking about, end quote.

627
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,420
My issue here is actually Jeremy's initial emails to the photographer, Dan.

628
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:59,500
The scientist's email was overwhelmingly charged with leading statements against Edgar,

629
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,660
providing links to his full disclosures on TR-3B while stating, quote,

630
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:07,820
Ed has constructed a series of lies around this picture being and stationed at Groom

631
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,820
Lake.

632
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,020
Many of us do not believe Ed at all, end quote.

633
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:16,100
This is not how one elicits an unbiased and objective response.

634
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:22,620
In 2013, YouTuber David Hilton posted a video titled Edgar Fouche – Faked Documents, which

635
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,580
saw subsequent videos posted by Jeremy.

636
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:30,140
It is worth noting both of these projects have been unlisted and removed from YouTube.

637
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,780
Whether this is due to walking back the statements or to prevent further controversy, I am not

638
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,780
sure.

639
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,500
Hilton constructed a group email with Jeremy Rice, Dan B, and Andrew Johnson, author of

640
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,060
Secret Program and supporter of Fouche after a series of extensive interviews with the

641
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,980
witness, to discuss the video allegedly exposing Fouche.

642
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,180
Hilton stated, quote,

643
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:54,740
After knowing Ed on a personal level since February of 2012, it is my opinion that he

644
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,100
made up slash lied about everything.

645
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,060
I've caught him in so many lies and contradictions that I can't keep up with them all.

646
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:05,460
It's not really something that can be completely hashed out in an email, end quote.

647
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,420
This statement is rather shocking to me, as alongside historical documents provided by

648
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:14,860
Fouche, numerous documents highlighting Fouche's military service were pried from FOIA by Hilton

649
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,020
himself.

650
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:20,300
While we cannot view this video or further context of Hilton claiming Fouche is a liar,

651
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,220
we can analyze Edgar's response on the Outpost Forum in July of 2014.

652
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,120
Here, Edgar addressed the points Hilton seemingly made in his video.

653
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,580
By his response in defense of the documents, it appears Hilton attempted to address only

654
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:39,400
small inconsistencies within the documents, such as small indentations, variable pressure

655
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,020
on letters, physical degradation of source documents and copies.

656
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,580
Due to Hilton and Rice retracting their video, I must conclude they conceded these claims

657
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,420
against Fouche.

658
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,900
Hilton additionally made some startling comments to the aforementioned Dan B in a June 2012

659
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,180
Skype conversation.

660
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,780
Now, Dan B is not to be confused with Dan Barish.

661
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,900
This is UFO researcher Dan Benkert, who has co-authored excellent work with Michael Schrat.

662
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,260
Benkert has been a staunch reporter of Fouche after knowing him personally, and once offered

663
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:14,900
a fascinating and worthy counter-explanation to a March 19th, 2016 article titled,

664
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,500
Edgar Fouche's TR3B is most likely a hoax.

665
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,100
Anyways, speaking to Dan B, Hilton would make some extremely startling remarks, such as

666
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,100
quote,

667
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,880
Actually, I work for an agency that monitors things you shouldn't do.

668
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,340
Go ahead and tell people.

669
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,400
They won't believe you, end quote.

670
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
And quote,

671
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,580
I now control Ed, not you.

672
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,340
Funny how things work out, isn't it?

673
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,540
The exposure becomes a tool of control, end quote.

674
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:51,380
Historically, accounts of witnessing NHI craft or NHI crash retrievals contain uniform elements.

675
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:56,620
These craft and technologies of unknown origins seem almost perfect.

676
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,660
No seams, no rivets, no bolts, almost as if the craft are 3D printed.

677
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:06,300
Some of these craft feature entirely smooth bodies or what humans would describe as windows.

678
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,220
Yet, some of the craft often appear beautiful and perfect in appearance.

679
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,300
This is almost never seen in triangular craft sightings.

680
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,620
Let us analyze some of these cases.

681
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,960
They've been seen almost in every country by every possible culture.

682
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,180
So it's a worldwide phenomenon.

683
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:29,500
We've got a case over here of a red one with this exhaust port here.

684
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,220
We've got a case in Detroit.

685
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,380
We've got Belgium cases.

686
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:38,460
A brief cross section of these aircraft have been seen all around the world.

687
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,500
The primary features of these triangles, they usually have a white light on the corner of

688
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,340
each of the triangle.

689
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,320
Some of these are between 200 and 300 feet across.

690
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,220
This midsection is generally about 20 feet across.

691
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:57,520
And then there's always this interesting structural work on the bottom and probably a red or amber

692
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,960
light in the center of the bottom section of the craft.

693
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,320
That's kind of the overall view of what we see here.

694
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:10,560
Let's travel back to October 28, 1993 to Crodon Falls, New York in the midst of the Hudson

695
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,720
Valley UFO flap and analyze the testimony of Jim Cooke.

696
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,600
Cooke, a biomedical engineer, was driving to his Hudson River Valley home when he encountered

697
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,120
a truly bizarre craft.

698
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:27,500
Near the Crodon Falls Reservoir, Cooke spotted aircraft lights approach the water level dropping

699
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,920
very fast.

700
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,600
The lights appeared to hover before blinking out.

701
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,600
Cooke, walking out of his car to the shoreline, spotted a triangular object hovering 200 feet

702
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,200
away 15 feet above the water.

703
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,880
Nine red lights appeared on the triangle side and a red break of light from the underside

704
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,920
began to probe the water.

705
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,240
Now let's move to the year 2000 in the town of St. Clair in southern Illinois, where numerous

706
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:56,440
small town residents and police officers reported a triangular-shaped craft.

707
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,400
On the early morning of January 5, police officers reported a UFO near Scott Air Force

708
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
Base.

709
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,880
The craft was massive, an elongated black triangle, roughly 75 feet long and 40 feet

710
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,880
wide.

711
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,080
At each corner sat a bright white light underwaving in luminosity.

712
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,400
One smaller flashing red light sat just below the object's midline, near the rear two

713
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,400
lights.

714
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,640
The back of the object appeared rectangular and illuminated in white light.

715
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,160
Through the middle of the light running lengthwise was a band of multicolored illumination.

716
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,640
It was stated there were no individual colored lights visible, rather it appeared as a band

717
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,600
of various colors which blended into each other.

718
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,920
A second police officer reported the object heading in a westerly direction, matching

719
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,360
the description of initial reports.

720
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,000
This officer, Martin, added he believed the object to be maybe 75 to 100 yards in width

721
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,400
at an altitude of 1,000 feet.

722
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,480
The object was estimated to travel at a loitering speed of 15 miles per hour before accelerating

723
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,080
to 100 miles per hour.

724
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:01,040
Let's also jump to Madison, Wisconsin on November 22, 1985, where multiple eyewitnesses

725
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,120
described a triangular, dull, roughly 40 foot across craft.

726
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:10,280
Excellent researcher Michael Schrat extracted a quote from one of the eyewitnesses who stated

727
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,720
the underside of the craft resembled, quote,

728
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,920
The back of a refrigerator, like a collection of condensation pipes that ran back and forth,

729
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,000
end quote.

730
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,920
One can't help but wonder here if this craft seen was an alien reproduction triangle utilizing

731
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,800
prototype propulsion systems requiring a massive heat exchanger apparatus.

732
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,280
Similar oddities can be observed in the United Kingdom's infamous sighting by Colin Saunders

733
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,480
in March of 1999.

734
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,140
Saunders and his family, upon driving home from dinner, observed a 50 foot long triangular

735
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,540
shaped craft that pitched up and down at roughly a 15 degree angle.

736
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,540
Colin claimed the craft bobbed as if it were submerged in water.

737
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:54,040
The exterior of the craft was described as a flowing liquid mercury, which reminds me

738
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:59,700
closely of Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan's UFO crash retrieval case, in which Wagan observed

739
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,400
a crashed UAP with skin described as the mother of pearl effect.

740
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,260
The top of the craft was not flat, but more angled with a strange raised pattern on top

741
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:14,020
Saunders believed to be some sort of docking mechanism with a larger craft.

742
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,380
And this same pattern existed on the underside of the craft.

743
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,260
Parasitic aircraft are not uncommon in human-made airplanes.

744
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:26,580
In fact, in the 1970s, Yousef proposed a Boeing 747 airborne aircraft carrier to house an

745
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,660
array of fighter jets.

746
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:34,640
This sloping top also sounds very dissimilar from the TR-3B, but may sound extremely similar

747
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,500
to the craft we're about to discuss.

748
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:42,420
Between the strange lights, fixtures, systems, and appearances of these triangles seen throughout

749
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:48,260
the 1980s to early 2000s, we must ask, were these craft human-made?

750
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:51,940
Were they prototypes or iterations of TR-3B?

751
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:56,080
Or were these all the result of separate legacy programs?

752
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,580
Or were these flying triangles somewhere in between?

753
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:10,540
This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.

754
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:14,140
Now I know you don't believe that story, but just hear me out.

755
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:18,540
Now Ellen's Air Base, the same base that we're at right now, the same base that for some

756
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:23,300
strange reason doesn't appear on your US government map, is supposedly one of the six sites where

757
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,860
parts from the wreckage were shipped.

758
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:28,740
Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs?

759
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,940
Planes built using UFO technology.

760
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:38,780
Fascinating lines of research, fully independent of Fouche's TR-3B, leads to a very similar

761
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:45,820
reverse-engineered triangular craft known by disgruntled engineers as the XF-131 Super

762
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,820
Sentinel.

763
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:52,100
Let's visit respected artist Bill McDonald, an old-school freelance commercial illustrator,

764
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:56,700
concept designer, forensic reconstruction illustrator, and current sworn law enforcement

765
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,700
professional.

766
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,460
We have featured McDonald's work in multiple projects, most notably his designs with Dr.

767
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:08,260
Robert Wood of the extraterrestrial entities known as EB-1 and EB-2, described within the

768
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:13,540
Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual, as well as his fantastic work on the Roswell

769
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:18,020
craft and the 1976 Tehran-Iran UFO incident.

770
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:22,940
McDonald additionally featured in a fantastic four-part series on Michael Schratz's YouTube

771
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,700
channel titled Roswell Revisited.

772
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:30,540
I myself have had the pleasure of speaking with Mr. McDonald and hold an extremely high

773
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:36,620
opinion of him, including speaking on the drawing and case we are about to discuss.

774
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:43,340
And here I present to you the beautiful piece titled Tehachapi Triangle, 1992.

775
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:48,500
McDonald met with four old engineers at a Denny's in Antelope Valley, California in

776
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,940
the spring of 1992.

777
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,580
All four engineers, two from Northrop Grumman and two from Lockheed Martin, were fed up

778
00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:00,260
with egregious security impositions negatively impacting their lives.

779
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:05,480
All four engineers were subject to extreme project compartmentalization, with each having

780
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:10,500
a piece of the puzzle for the name of the triangular craft Antelope Valley residents

781
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:16,300
had been reporting for numerous years, the XF-131 Super Sentinel.

782
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,580
Each of these engineers wanted their story told without threats to their lives.

783
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:25,660
Jail time or stripping of pensions, does this sound familiar to anybody about the

784
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,320
current state of UAP whistleblowers?

785
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,740
The four men had found each other over a number of decades while being employed at various

786
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,220
facilities surrounding the California high desert.

787
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:42,700
The two Northrop employees hailed from a facility called Tehan or Tehachapi Ranch by UFO researchers.

788
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,900
McDonald claims he was able to confirm this testimony through friends of his father and

789
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:51,620
his father's mentor, Robert Scandrett, who worked for Rockell International Strategic

790
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,200
Systems Division.

791
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,420
The other two claimed to work for Ben Rich at Lockheed Skunk Works in Glendale, California

792
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:03,020
and worked the radar cross-section range known as Hellendale.

793
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:06,300
First off, let's quickly recall a similarity to TR-3B.

794
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:11,580
When Fouchet asked if Kelly Johnson was the senior project designer for TR-3B, he responded

795
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,580
quote,

796
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:20,340
Second, the Hellendale facility located very closely to Edwards Air Force Base in Palmdale

797
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:26,860
USAP Plant 42, two locations I have directly accused of housing reverse engineering programs,

798
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:31,700
would later be accused by Stephen Greer and others as a currently ongoing black budget

799
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,900
Deep Six UAP reverse engineering location.

800
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:39,300
Now, interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and other senior

801
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,680
officials had no idea of this.

802
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:48,120
The top people in special forces who are outside this illegal black project system

803
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,320
didn't know about it.

804
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,880
I had known about it since the 90s, but I'd never, of course, flown directly over it because

805
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,960
it's classified airspace and very sensitive.

806
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:04,320
So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.

807
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:11,560
It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building since 1954-55 come

808
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,560
out.

809
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,640
They go up and they hover, they're silent, they're electro-gravitic, anti-grav.

810
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,920
The diamond on the left, you see that looks like a runway with a diamond, it's not a runway

811
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,160
because they don't need to run and get, there's not an aerodynamic, they just go boom, up.

812
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,040
But they're placed on different diamonds.

813
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,840
I have a whole series of video and pictures of these that I don't have time to go through.

814
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:39,560
And that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon

815
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:45,120
to see if it's hardened enough to withstand conflict, right?

816
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,320
Five years before Greer would first label the Lockheed Martin Hellendale plant as a

817
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:54,160
program location, McDonald's stated the location was designed to be hidden in plain

818
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,160
sight.

819
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:59,660
Utilizing the cover of a radar cross-section facility, the location's exterior features

820
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:05,600
a storm drainage flood-controlled channel, which allegedly truly serves as a short runway

821
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,440
or platform for the testing of these craft.

822
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,800
And here is where things get very, very, very interesting.

823
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:18,560
As I mentioned earlier, I have spoken to McDonald about the XF-131, and he maintains the four

824
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,800
engineers were indeed delivering true testimony.

825
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,740
I even asked for the individual's identities or leads on the case so I might contact and

826
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,180
interview them myself.

827
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,660
He has sworn to protect their identities.

828
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:35,960
In the Tehachapi Triangle drawing, McDonald exclaimed if viewers recognized the craft.

829
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,640
Fox Network contracted McDonald's work and made a computer render of the vehicle

830
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:46,920
for the first regular season episode of The X-Files in the episode titled, Deep Throat.

831
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,220
This fantastic episode, probably my favorite of the whole series, follows the main characters

832
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,480
investigating the disappearance of a USAAF test pilot.

833
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,840
A mysterious informant tells one of the lead investigators, Mulder, to stay away from the

834
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,000
case.

835
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,280
Utilizing research and testimony I played at the beginning of this section, Mulder learned

836
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:10,080
that the craft, the Super Sentinel, was a reverse engineered craft from the 1947 Roswell

837
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,460
New Mexico case.

838
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:16,520
Investigating the airfield late at night, a triangular-shaped craft darts and hovers

839
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:42,720
over Mulder before rapidly speeding away.

840
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,000
Mulder is then captured by Air Force personnel and given a cocktail to forget about what

841
01:02:47,000 --> 01:03:07,680
he saw, but not before he caught a glimpse of the craft in a hanger.

842
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,960
Rumors persist of the X-Files screenwriter Chris Carter mentioning he had been approached

843
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,880
by unknown military brass who asked how he knew so much.

844
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,920
However, I can find no credible sources here.

845
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:24,520
But what I can find is reference paranormal writer and 25-year FBI investigator veteran

846
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:28,480
and inspiration for much of the X-Files, John D'Souza.

847
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:34,760
In 2023, D'Souza put out a video on YouTube titled, John D'Souza 25-year veteran of FBI

848
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,800
John D'Souza is exposing the truth of the UAP invasion.

849
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:43,560
And while I voraciously disagree with the Project Bluebeam fake invasion narrative,

850
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:49,200
D'Souza does make some very interesting remarks directly stating the first season of the X-Files

851
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,160
was based off true cases he investigated.

852
01:03:52,160 --> 01:04:02,600
Okay, the craziest one that I'm still not supposed to talk about, but I can say that

853
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:10,600
I think it was about the first episode of the X-Files or maybe it was the second of

854
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,480
the first season.

855
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,680
By the way, they used my stories during the first season of the X-Files and then after

856
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:22,280
that they went to other, they no longer used my cases.

857
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:29,880
However, the rest of the X-Files was all based on true stories as well.

858
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:41,960
However, I would say the craziest UFO, the craziest paranormal case was when I was sent

859
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,440
to a military base.

860
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:49,040
I mean, I can say in general terms, I was sent to a military base.

861
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:57,920
We observed a military base where they had had several disappearances that were associated

862
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,960
with the appearance of UFOs in the area.

863
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:06,720
And there were UFOs that the military base said, the commander said, I don't know what

864
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,720
to do with this.

865
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,640
I mean, I'm at my wits end.

866
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:18,840
And so we went to observe these UFOs that had been coming to the outskirts of this military

867
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,480
base and on a regular basis.

868
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,800
And they were filled with light, they were filled with light, almost like they didn't

869
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,520
even appear metal anymore.

870
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,520
And they would just come, they would come to the edge of this forest.

871
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:37,520
And there was a group of people who would just do a regular observance of these things.

872
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:42,560
And so myself and my partner, we went and we were with those people.

873
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:49,800
And for some reason, one of the UFOs picked us out, for some reason, and came directly

874
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,560
at us, came directly at us.

875
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:59,160
It appeared to land on us at some point, all the people ran, everyone ran, including us.

876
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:05,880
But it appeared to land on us, but then it didn't because it disappeared somehow.

877
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:15,720
And then we had people from the base who took me in, who took me in against my will.

878
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:22,640
They took me in and they interrogated me as to what my knowledge was of the UFOs.

879
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:28,280
It is endlessly fascinating Chris Carter of The X-Files specifically contracted McDonald's

880
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:35,360
Tejachapi Triangle, an allegedly real reverse-engineered ARV, for an episode based on true events.

881
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,640
This case is seen further investigation from myself behind the scenes.

882
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:44,720
Hey guys, it's UAPGirb and thank you so much for joining me today into this dive into

883
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,040
the flying triangles and alien reproduction vehicles.

884
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,840
Guys, I know it's been a while and I want to thank each and every one of you for sticking

885
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,840
by me.

886
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,800
This November has been one heck of a month with going out to see and do a show on Jesse

887
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,880
Michaels, to going to the hearings, to going to Seoul.

888
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,440
It's been insanely busy, so I appreciate everybody sticking by me.

889
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,560
Please look forward to the Jesse Michaels interview or kind of project and the Eric

890
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,120
Davis interview, which I think everybody will find fascinating.

891
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:15,360
I'll probably use clips from in every single project I do from now on here coming shortly.

892
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:18,320
So let's kind of break down what we discussed today.

893
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:23,280
I for one was super excited to take on this project because I think whenever people think

894
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:29,080
of triangular shaped UAP to ARV to anything, they associate it with TR3B and a lot of the

895
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:33,400
time people don't really know the full story of Edgar Fouchet and kind of the story behind

896
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,400
TR3B.

897
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,280
I know when getting kind of b-roll and footage and images for this video, quite often the

898
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:46,520
The XF-131 Super Sentinel, the TR3A, and another craft called the TR3E are often confused

899
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,520
for TR3B.

900
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:53,760
Now, the reason I didn't cover TR3E is this is often used as kind of a toy model based

901
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,040
off recovered, based off reverse engineered craft, and I have actually talked to some

902
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,620
artists who have drawn this TR3E.

903
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,360
For those of you kind of listening right now say, what the heck is he talking about?

904
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:09,120
This is the triangle design that almost has sort of a concave lines in between the vertexes

905
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:14,120
with kind of fins and grates similar to the TR3B and a smallish dome on top.

906
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:20,160
So maybe we'll visit TR3E at this time, but I didn't see too much evidence or worthwhile

907
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,400
study here.

908
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,200
So I know sort of the breakdown of these craft can be quite complex, so let's just go through

909
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,600
that real fast.

910
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:32,360
On one hand, we have XF-131 Super Sentinel, which varies greatly to the TR3B and other

911
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:37,520
triangular designs due to the almost pyramid shape on top that is most similar to the 1999

912
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,400
Kirby England sighting.

913
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:43,660
And on this side, we have the Aurora program, let's just say.

914
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:49,400
Within Aurora, there's codename Astra, which is the TR3B, Astra standing for Advanced Stealth

915
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:55,200
Technology Reconnaissance Aircraft and the TR and TR3B standing for Tactical Reconnaissance.

916
01:08:55,200 --> 01:09:01,000
The TR3B is the reverse engineered craft that is gravity resistant with companies such as

917
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,040
Lawrence Livermore, Lockheed, Northrup, spearheaded by CIA, NSA, et cetera, et cetera.

918
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:14,640
Also in that same Aurora program, possibly, is the TR3A, which may use advanced stealth

919
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:20,660
concepts and advanced concepts such as electro-gravity for internal mass reduction or something like

920
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,480
pulse detonation engines.

921
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,440
But let's remember that this craft is generally considered more prosaic with a cockpit and

922
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,440
so forth.

923
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,900
And this may have been what crashed at Boscombe down in 1994.

924
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:35,620
So there's the TR3A, the TR3B, and possibly the TR3E.

925
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,620
Remember what Fouche said?

926
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:41,700
He said there's a whole host of craft in the TR, the Tactical Reconnaissance line, just

927
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:46,900
the same with the Strategic Reconnaissance, the SR line, you know, there's the SR-71.

928
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:52,540
And Fouche alleged that at least concepts of an SR-74 and 75 were in development while

929
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:56,140
he worked within the defense world and so forth.

930
01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:05,700
So I almost find the description that Ed gives of DARS and other kind of contractors

931
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:09,000
almost more interesting than the TR3B itself.

932
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,700
For example, looking at his FOIA Pride documents and seeing the AFFTC, the Air Force Flight

933
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:21,220
Test Center, is really critical for me to be able to analyze this story and start to

934
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:24,200
relay this to other stories or other investigation I've done.

935
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:30,760
Him talking about Project Red Light with EG&G for the DOE while EG&G runs Area 51, we can

936
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:36,560
also see that Sandia and I think it's Lawrence Livermore were partners for NEST, Nuclear

937
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,060
Emergency Search Teams or something like that, but NEST teams.

938
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:45,280
So there's all these delicious little tie-ins, especially when Fouche mentions treats.

939
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:51,800
As we saw, there's one mention publicly available of treat I could possibly find.

940
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,600
This could be the Army INSCOM under Stubblebind's version of the Men in Black.

941
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:02,920
But sticking to the video topic, I don't know enough about the physics of TR3B to dispute

942
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,000
the craft like Jeremy Rice does.

943
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,800
And speaking of that guys, I'm not looking to get involved in any drama or throw my hat

944
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,880
in the ring and defend or criticize Fouche.

945
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:19,360
I simply thought it important to, when you have disclosures as impactful and key as Fouche's,

946
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,560
to say, hey, there have been individuals who have brought up issues with certain things

947
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:24,720
he's done.

948
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:30,440
And I just thought it important to relay those and kind of throw in my opinion of what I

949
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,600
thought about some of the criticisms.

950
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,480
I'm not really trying to get involved or squabble with any of the players still active.

951
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,960
So just know that.

952
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,080
I do that in good faith by just kind of talking about the arguments.

953
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:51,080
So TR3B XF-131 Super Sentinel, TR3B there's 200 foot test models and 600 foot operational

954
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,080
models.

955
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,680
The description of the craft down to the diffuse red light on the bottom is very similar to

956
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:59,880
what numerous people have relayed seen.

957
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,080
I mean, I'll scroll through any YouTube video of a triangle sighting or I'll talk to anybody

958
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:09,680
at Jujitsu and they'll all say that, yeah, I've had a UFO sighting or my uncle or somebody

959
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,680
I know did.

960
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,680
They saw a triangle.

961
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,560
Three white lights and a red one.

962
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,360
These sort of sighting seem almost ubiquitous.

963
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,360
They seem very common.

964
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:23,080
And then there's something like the XF-131 Super Sentinel whose size is much smaller,

965
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:29,400
whose underside is far more intriguing with the, you know, we didn't really dive into

966
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,700
the physics or the engineering because that information is unavailable to myself.

967
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:40,480
But with a large light that seems almost maneuverable on bottom, followed by three pairs of lights

968
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,440
kind of on each side of the triangle.

969
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,040
I hope everybody enjoyed seeing that in X-Files.

970
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,280
I myself am kind of a new X-Files fan.

971
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:54,880
So I've seen that episode and watching Mulder kind of pursue this subject about the Air

972
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,000
Force test pilots who have gone missing just to encounter the triangle, which was reverse

973
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,240
engineered from technology at Roswell is so intriguing to me.

974
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:11,000
I myself put a lot of weight on both Fouche and the TR-3B as well as the XF-131 Super Sentinel.

975
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:18,720
I have been and will continue to be investigating that specific craft and that specific story

976
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:25,280
as it is just extremely, extremely, extremely intriguing to myself.

977
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:29,480
But I do want to know what everybody thought about TR-3B.

978
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:34,400
You know, after analyzing the full extent to which Fouche gave testimony, I don't think

979
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:40,040
his story is as simple as he saw the Belgian UFO wave and he's trying to glom on.

980
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,200
I just I don't think it's as simple as that.

981
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:47,960
Now, the most valid criticism of Ed is besides his three sightings, which were not under

982
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:53,920
program operations, he did not work firsthand on the TR-3B.

983
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,600
Much of this information was relayed from Gerald, from Bud, from Doc, from Sal and so

984
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:02,720
forth. So he is ultimately relaying secondhand information.

985
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:07,480
Now, of course, Gerald died pretty soon after their first meeting.

986
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:11,600
But if any of these other gentlemen are still around, Fouche has not.

987
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,200
He has passed and can share this information.

988
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,360
Please reach out to me.

989
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:21,320
Let's kind of let's discuss this a little more, because the way I see things right now

990
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:28,480
is that there's likely not one, at least two types of ARV that DOD, the Air Force

991
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,240
412 test group and legacy programs have.

992
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,800
This is something like the flux line or the flying saucer craft that either operates

993
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,640
off of electro-gravitics, magneto hydrodynamics or zero point energy systems.

994
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:45,560
And then there's something a little less pretty in the triangles.

995
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:50,960
And these likely operate off of electro-gravitics or MFD devices, MHD devices, as

996
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,840
Fouche talked about. You know, the triangles are not are not capable of what we would

997
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:01,160
assume NHI and what we analyze NHI craft are capable of with the six observables.

998
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,400
Fouche will talk about the TR3B doing impossible maneuvers, right turns that are

999
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,920
very close to actual right turns.

1000
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:13,000
However, the speed limitations of this craft and so forth, all of these things, the

1001
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,920
internal inertial dampening, none of these things are too extreme.

1002
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,560
And this is one of the things that stuck out to me about the flux liner as well, you

1003
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:26,640
know, the F4 Phantom jump seats, the off the shelf components with this really

1004
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,120
interesting reverse engineered or copied propulsion system.

1005
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:36,160
The TR3B and the triangles, the, you know, the XF-131 super sentinel to

1006
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:41,120
extent seem very similar, that it's a human attempt to reproduce something fantastic.

1007
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,000
Now, what are the NHI triangles?

1008
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:51,440
Why, if it's true, did SOM 101 in 1954 say that these triangles are new and little is

1009
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,800
known about them? You know, we can start to analyze the the triangle programs in

1010
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,280
the eighties, nineties, possibly even earlier in the seventies.

1011
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:03,560
But, you know, in the fifties, these triangles, are they NHI or are they a

1012
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:07,600
breakaway civilizations, a precursor to programs?

1013
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,200
These questions still exist.

1014
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,720
These questions are super interesting.

1015
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:15,760
How many prototypes of TR3B or XF-131 super sentinel or possibly these triangles are

1016
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,960
called something else completely that we are none the wiser to.

1017
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,280
How many prototypes were they?

1018
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:24,920
You know, the heat exchangers underneath the pyramid shaped top in Kirby England as

1019
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:29,520
a docking mechanism, the sightings in southern Illinois with these interesting

1020
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,400
strips of lights.

1021
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:37,120
The triangles are are fascinating for the error reporting trends of triangles

1022
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,920
comprising one to four percent.

1023
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:43,560
You would be astonished at how many people have reported seeing triangle

1024
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,000
triangular shaped craft.

1025
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,960
So I'm chewing up a lot of time here, guys.

1026
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,680
I'm just so excited to be back.

1027
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,200
I'd like to thank everybody for watching.

1028
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,560
And we are back to our regular regularly scheduled programming.

1029
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:00,440
Thank you all so much for joining me into this look into Fouche, into TR3B, into

1030
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,240
flying triangles, into ARB.

1031
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,600
I'll catch everybody next time.

1032
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,600
Thank you so much.

1033
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:04,960
Bye.
