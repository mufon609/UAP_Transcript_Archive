1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
The propulsion of these UFOs is unique, their ability to hover, their ability to accelerate

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,580
very rapidly, their ability to move at very high speeds, very much higher than anything

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,600
that we have achieved even with our supersonic aircraft.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,160
All of these things, and particularly interestingly without sonic booms and the things that we

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,400
don't like about our supersonic aircraft, all of these things indicate a type of propulsion

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,440
which is unique, different than anything we know anything about, and which would be a

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,120
tremendous value if we could develop it and use it.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,280
That's the reason I feel with a number of others who have studied it, that it is a subject

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,360
which deserves the highest type of scientific study and at an early date.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,320
The advantages to be gained are perfectly enormous.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,880
And how long do you feel it will be before we are flying in UFOs?

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,240
Well, this probably is a $64 question without a question of a doubt.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,560
I think it depends a great deal on how rapidly we take them seriously and how soon we really

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:12,160
set up a scientific study team to work on the subject.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,160
This is where we push the laws of physics.

16
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,880
You see, the technology we make is what makes the impossible possible.

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,120
And it doesn't stop there.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,560
So far on this channel, we have devoted entire investigations towards Battelle Memorial Institute

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,000
and their possible work on shaped memory alloys recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
crash, as well as Lockheed Martin and their intimate decades-long involvement in UFO legacy

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
programs.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,080
After all, high-profile U.S. defense contractors have for decades been accused of actively

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,680
engaging in material exploitation and reverse engineering programs, focused on technologies

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,160
of unknown origin in conjunction with various factions within U.S. government, intelligence,

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
and military.

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,920
Overall, you know, the government has been the custodian of a lot of this, right?

27
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,400
And they'll hand receded out to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis, which I find

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,480
highly unethical.

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,320
You have basically a sole source arrangement, and you allow certain private corporate elements

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,000
to look at this, develop a potential insight, and then sell it back to the government for

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
profit.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,920
And I think that's totally unethical.

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,760
Lockheed Martin and others do quite a bit of work, both in our atmosphere, in space,

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,760
and even underwater.

35
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,360
There are certain efforts to...

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,680
It's a tough question, you guys.

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,920
I left the Air Force and was sent out to California at that time to begin establishing my cover

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,760
basis for an independent, as an independent contractor, so that I could serve what was

39
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,800
coming down the line next for me.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,440
And that is the path which led to the UAP subject.

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,720
These claims are not without merit, as since the inception of the U.S. military-industrial

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,860
complex, private defense industry has worked in tandem with military and intelligence to

43
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,540
bolster U.S. military might, protected by waived, unacknowledged special access programs.

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:26,420
I have directly accused Lockheed Martin, Battelle, Boeing, SAIC, and many other private institutions

45
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,700
and semi-private institutions, such as UARCs and FFRDCs, possessing, experimenting with,

46
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,860
and possibly successfully harnessing non-human technologies.

47
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,900
Today we focus our sights towards the U.S. aerospace and defense colossus and father

48
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,060
of the B-2 stealth bomber, Northrop Grumman.

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,020
Often overshadowed by the infamy of Lockheed and their involvement in the 2008 failed attempt

50
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:58,580
to divest recovered NHI materials to the OSAP program, Northrop Grumman has largely successfully

51
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,660
distanced itself from the spotlight of defense contractors engaging with UAP legacy programs.

52
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,140
In fact, focused discussion on the alien reproduction vehicle, Fluxliner, as relayed

53
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,900
by Brad Sorensen and the TR-3B reverse-engineered triangle discussed by USAF Master Sergeant

54
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,520
Edgar Fouchet, seemed to primarily focus on Lockheed.

55
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,960
These testimonies highlight the defense contractor successfully reverse-engineering non-human

56
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,640
craft to operate under human control.

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,260
But throughout such disclosures, Lockheed isn't the sole contractor accused of such

58
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,340
highly classified efforts.

59
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,300
Hardly mentioned, but always alongside in the shadows, is Northrop Grumman.

60
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,500
Could Northrop Grumman truly be involved in material exploitation of technologies of unknown

61
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,620
origin TUOs?

62
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,500
Just how far does their involvement with UFO studies go?

63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,140
Join me today as we peer into the shadows to find out.

64
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,060
Hey guys, it's UAP Grubb and thank you so much for joining me as we touch back to UFOs

65
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,540
in the private sector, this time to Northrop Grumman.

66
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,660
The contractor I believe alongside Lockheed is the Paramount Aerospace Corporation entrenched

67
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,000
in UFO legacy programs.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,220
From whistleblower testimony to analysis of Northrop's numerous acquisitions over

69
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,120
the decades, let's thoroughly dive into the legendary Northrop Grumman and their involvement

70
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,860
in UFO legacy programs.

71
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:31,140
Let's start by analyzing the history of Northrop and its many, many, many acquisitions

72
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,380
over the decades.

73
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:38,220
Northrop Grumman is an American aerospace and defense company employing over 95,000

74
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,000
employees with an annual revenue of $30 billion.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,020
The industry giant has achieved extraordinary engineering feats such as aiding in the development

76
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:53,600
of the James Webb Space Telescope and directly creating the B-2 Spirit Bomber and B-21 Raider,

77
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,620
the world's only known stealth bombers.

78
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,540
Northrop Grumman operates in four major divisions, aeronautics, defense, space, and mission systems.

79
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,080
Outside of military, aircraft, space systems, and weapon development, Northrop also engages

80
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,900
in cybersecurity, information technology, and radar and sensor systems.

81
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,020
Briefly, I do take an extreme interest in Northrop's C4ISR, Command Control Communications

82
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,340
Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance, which falls under Northrop's land-based

83
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,260
critical technology services, sustainment, and modernization.

84
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:34,180
C4ISR is essentially the military's nervous system consisting of various electronic equipment

85
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,220
and technologies serving to aid the modern warfighter through data and intelligence.

86
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:45,580
I am currently working on a thesis that select contractors' C4ISR programs engage in deep-sixed

87
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,200
waved USAPs for crash retrieval and ARV testing, data, and analysis.

88
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,600
Let me explain.

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,580
Northrop was one of the premier contractors operating C4ISR for the Strategic Defense

90
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,360
Initiative instituted under Reagan in 1983.

91
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,060
Northrop created the first laser radar used in space for SDI.

92
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,300
I have discussed numerous times lines of research which state SDI focused on Soviet ICBM nuclear

93
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:18,100
defense, secretly studied and employed offensive capabilities against UAP, and siphoned program

94
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,740
funds to UAP legacy programs such as the DARS, Defense Advanced Research Center proposed

95
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,060
to exist in an ARPA document.

96
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,780
SAIC, Science Applications International Corporation, frequently secures massive hundreds

97
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,580
of million-dollar contracts for C4ISR at the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane.

98
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,300
I have published extensive research SAIC runs an off-world technologies division to house

99
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,160
recovered NHA artifacts at the crane naval location.

100
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,180
When discussing witness Ed in the existence of a joint ARV testing program out of Edwards

101
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,980
Air Force Base in Area 51 under the Edwards 412 test group, I made reference to a Lockheed-Martin

102
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,960
ISR case study.

103
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,660
In this study, Lockheed was tasked with updating the system used by USAAF Warfare Center for

104
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,880
Intelligence Collection and Data Processing.

105
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,160
Lockheed reconfigured a two-phase security classification system used by the National

106
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,480
Geospatial Intelligence Agency.

107
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,240
Yes, the same agency GRUSH was a part of when liaison to the UAP task force and the same

108
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,800
agency recently mentioned by respected journalist Chris Sharpe as participating in undersea

109
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,000
UAP crash retrievals.

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,440
The system was implemented to the Combined Air and Space Operations Center at Nellis

111
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,360
Air Force Base, which is tasked with processing information for exploitation of time-sensitive

112
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,500
targets.

113
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,120
At the time I speculated, although this Lockheed project arose from challenges in the Nellis

114
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,560
Red Flag Advanced Aerial Combat Training exercise, could such systems be used to monitor

115
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,000
UAP and UAP crash retrievals?

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,320
Although C4ISR is common and the nervous system of the armed forces, I do think analyzing

117
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,360
Defense Corporation C4ISR contracts and projects with USAAF Army and Navy can lead to knocking

118
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,800
on the door of UAP program operations.

119
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,640
And after that long discussion, finally back to the history of Northrop Grumman, NG arose

120
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,880
from the merging of two military aircraft companies, the Grumman Aircraft Engineering

121
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,460
Company and the Northrop Company in 1994.

122
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,860
Throughout its storied history, Northrop made a few very key acquisitions we will continue

123
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,860
to reference over and over and over again throughout this project.

124
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,560
One such acquisition occurred in 1999 with procurement of Teledyne Ryan, developer of

125
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,300
surveillance systems at Unmanned Aircraft.

126
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:43,740
In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired TRW Inc., a corporation involved in aerospace, electronics

127
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,460
and the automotive industries.

128
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,560
Outside of computers, systems engineering, integrated circuits, TRW was a true trailblazer

129
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,700
in spacecraft construction, building Pioneer 1, 10 and numerous space-based observatories.

130
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,280
The defense giant considered TRW its quote-unquote capstone acquisition, signaling the end to

131
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Northrop Grumman's aggressive purchasing streak.

132
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,120
Why was TRW considered the crown jewel of Northrop's purchases?

133
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,620
Well there is evidence to suggest this was due to TRW operating a portfolio of UAP legacy

134
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,680
programs upon purchase.

135
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,600
I think the investigation must be done to discover the UFO program portfolio Northrop

136
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,000
may have inherited from TRW.

137
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,600
TRW has long been associated with a rumored crash retrieval program run out of Wright

138
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,280
Patterson Air Force Base, a topic even touched on by Luella Zondo in his book, Imminent.

139
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,800
And let's mention that in June of 1960, TRW spawned the Aerospace Corporation.

140
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,840
The Aerospace Corporation has additionally been implicated in UFO legacy programs and

141
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,000
served as a place for employment for OSAP physicist and member of the Wilson Davis meeting,

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
Dr. Eric Davis.

143
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,680
I would additionally like to draw attention to the year the Aerospace Corporation was

144
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,000
founded in 1960 and relate this founding to the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Philip

145
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,520
J. Corso.

146
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:11,560
Corso stated 1958-1962 oversaw the golden age of U.S. Army R&D where Army assets, universities,

147
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,320
laboratories, and private industry were leveraged to reverse engineer non-human technology

148
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,040
to bolster the U.S. war machine.

149
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,680
Analyzing Army primers from around this time highlight a period of massive innovation in

150
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,580
Army research and development.

151
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,400
The MITRE Corporation was born during this time in 1959 with lines of research to suggest

152
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,680
its formation was to engage in such research and development projects alongside Bell Labs,

153
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,600
Sperry Rand, etc.

154
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,080
The Aerospace Corporation founded just one year post-MITRE, maybe one additional corporation

155
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,280
spawned from TRW for U.S. Army legacy operations.

156
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:55,240
And worthy to note, both MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation are both known as FFRDCs, Federally

157
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,800
Funded Research and Development Centers.

158
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,040
Present day, the Aerospace Corporation manages the Aerospace FFRDC for the Department of

159
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,120
Defense and Air Force to support, quote, national security space programs, end quote.

160
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,400
We are truly the only space enterprise that exists in the United States.

161
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,820
And I mean this at the agency level in the government, the FFRDCs, and private industry.

162
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,040
There is no other organization that does national security space, civil and commercial, and

163
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,020
international as well, that ties these all together with both the breadth and the depth

164
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,120
that we bring to this problem.

165
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:37,480
I have spoken at length about FFRDCs, semi-private institutions that play a crucial hand in UAP

166
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
legacy programs.

167
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,240
I recommend any of my previous four investigations to hear more on the subject.

168
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,080
It is intriguing Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson Davis Memo all but admitted the Aerospace

169
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,860
Corporation built from TRW is actively involved in UAP legacy programs.

170
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,800
And that up to that point, TRW had been a primary contractor in such UFO programs.

171
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,880
So all this talk about private contractors, you know, the big Lockheed Martin, what about

172
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,120
federally funded research and development centers such as MITRE, RAND, Triad, Oak Ridge,

173
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,200
and UARCs, University Affiliated Research Centers, where do they fall into this?

174
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:21,000
Only one, and I won't name it, started out as a contractor in the 1960s, starting not

175
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,360
too long after it was born, it was actually a spinoff of TRW.

176
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:32,480
So TRW was the principal investigator for the first roughly, what, almost 30, yeah,

177
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,600
practically 29 years.

178
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,320
Before we keep discussing TRW, let's highlight a former U.S. premier electronics manufacturer

179
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,320
implicated in TUO exploitation by Lieutenant Colonel Corso with possible ties to MITRE

180
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,640
and the Aerospace Corporation.

181
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,400
This being the company I just mentioned above, the Sperry RAND Corporation.

182
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,080
In his manuscript, Corso would reference the personal memoirs of Lieutenant General Arthur

183
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,680
Trudeau, chief of U.S. Army R&D and founder of the Army's Foreign Technology Division,

184
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,520
and how Trudeau would engage in frequent meetings with Sperry RAND's board, including legendary

185
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,680
General Douglas MacArthur.

186
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,120
Sperry RAND went defunct in 1986, and its former divisions became part of Lockheed Martin,

187
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,080
Raytheon, Honeywell, and you guessed it, Northrop Grumman, all companies implicated in UFO

188
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,920
legacy programs.

189
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,960
But let's get back to TRW.

190
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,400
TRW features some familiar faces of this channel many will recognize.

191
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:37,280
Remember if you will, Dr. Eric Walker, the scientist named by physicist Dr. Robert Sarbacher

192
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:44,000
as participating in UFO crash retrieval meetings alongside Vannevar Bush in the 1950s.

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,200
Walker started Penn State's University-affiliated research center, self-admitted he knew about

194
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,160
the Majestic 12 and was present at the 1965 Kexburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash.

195
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,520
I have always talked about how Walker is one of the most crucial names in UFO crash retrieval

196
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,140
and reverse engineering programs in the 1950s and 1960s.

197
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,960
Much intrigues me about Walker, including his position as former chairman of TRW.

198
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:17,580
TRW has also been discussed at length by respected researchers such as Richard Dolan as the primary

199
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,860
contractor running a crash retrieval program under the project name Zodiac.

200
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,860
Project Zodiac, an MJ-12-like entity, is not our subject today, however we may discuss

201
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,940
it soon as the story of Zodiac by pseudonym Sej Masters is utterly captivating.

202
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:41,020
And with TRW, we may just have a paper trail to connect them and Northrop to legacy operations.

203
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,980
In 2004, former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Catherine Austin-Fitz

204
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,340
wrote a paper called The Black Budget of the United States.

205
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,800
This paper stated a large portion of the nation's wealth had ongoingly been illegally diverted

206
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,340
into secret, unaccountable channels to support clandestine military research and development,

207
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,380
some to a majority of which had been suggested to be UAP-related.

208
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,960
While at the HUD department, Fitz came across information various high-profile defense

209
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,720
accounting systems were responsible for scrubbing and obfuscating the direction of these funds.

210
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,560
Although in 1990 federal law mandated every single U.S. government agency be audited,

211
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,080
the Pentagon never publicly faced a comprehensive audit until one was launched in December of

212
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,680
2017.

213
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,040
And not to mention since, the Pentagon has never passed an audit.

214
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,000
And this 2017 audit may have happened solely due to another Catherine Austin-Fitz university

215
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,880
paper detailing $21 trillion in unauthorized spending in the DOD and Department of Housing

216
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,880
and Urban Development from 1998 to 2015.

217
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,700
In the Wilson Davis memo, which I have talked about so many times, Admiral Thomas Wilson

218
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,080
relays to Dr. Eric Davis, the Watch Committee, the gatekeepers of the UAP legacy program

219
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:11,280
portfolio, told Wilson they are organized after an audit in the 1990s almost blew their

220
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
cover.

221
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,800
What this means is essentially a failed audit led to UAP programs being reorganized under

222
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,680
the Special Access Program Oversight Committee Senior Review Group.

223
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,200
Here is where we circle back.

224
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:31,320
In 2003, Northrop Grumman settled a lawsuit from the U.S. government for $111 million,

225
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,560
almost $200 million today.

226
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,480
This settlement was due to Northrop subsidiary TRW overcharging for government work done

227
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,940
on space projects in the early 1990s.

228
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,840
This suggests TRW's inflated space project contracts were implicated and uncovered in

229
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,840
the failed audit mentioned in the Wilson Davis memo that took place in the 1990s.

230
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,520
Timelines indeed match up, as the beginning roots of this lawsuit can be traced back to

231
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
1994.

232
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,400
TRW's likely involvement with UAP legacy waived unacknowledged special access programs

233
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,680
appeared as contract overcharging to the wider DoD auditing officials, leading to the lawsuit

234
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,160
against TRW settled by Northrop utterly fascinating.

235
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,840
If this hypothesis is accurate, Northrop settled the suit and reorganized their UAP portfolio

236
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,400
under the SAPOC Senior Review Group program reorganization that was relayed to Wilson.

237
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,160
To make Northrop's purchase of TRW even more interesting, shortly before Northrop

238
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:43,920
bought TRW in 2002, TRW had purchased BDM, Braddock Dunn & McDonald in 1997.

239
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,200
BDM was a technical services firm that headquartered at Fort Bliss, Texas, White Sands Missile

240
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,720
Range, New Mexico, and Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.

241
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,640
BDM specialized in and worked primarily with missile guidance, application optics, electronic

242
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,520
instrumentation, and radiation physics.

243
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,520
BDM was also founded in 1959, around the same time as MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation.

244
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,720
BDM was mentioned specifically by Commander Will Miller of the Wilson Davis Memo in the

245
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,280
year 2000.

246
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,760
The former U.S. Navy commander stated numerous government individuals such as Defense Intelligence

247
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,600
Agency directors, who in this case would have been Vice Admiral Thomas Wilson, were isolated

248
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,320
from UAP knowledge.

249
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,880
The quote-unquote keepers of the secrets resided in DoD middle management and civilian contractors

250
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,320
like Boeing, Lockheed, and BDM.

251
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,560
To learn more about Miller and why his words carry weight, I highly recommend watching

252
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,240
my video on the Wilson Davis Memo, sure it's my first video and it's very amateurish

253
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,560
but there's still some good information there.

254
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,400
BDM could warrant its own video, but for now, I leave you with this.

255
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,000
Just like FFRDC's, I have talked ad nauseum of Major General Albert Stubblebine and how

256
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,160
his department, U.S. Army InSCOM, and their previous special forces unit, the Intelligence

257
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,280
Support Activity, have been historically involved with UAP crash retrieval.

258
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,720
In 1984, Stubblebine was replaced as head of InSCOM and went on to serve as vice president

259
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,480
for BDM.

260
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,080
The following year in 1985, BDM would host an advanced theoretical physics conference

261
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,360
to discuss UFO reverse engineering opportunities.

262
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,280
And actually, let's not stop there with BDM.

263
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:34,020
In 1989, NASA mission specialist Bob Eshler was introduced to retired Rear Admiral Sumner

264
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,600
Shapiro from Bobby Ray Inman.

265
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:44,040
Inman was then board member of SAIC and Wackenhut, and former NSA director and CIA deputy director.

266
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:49,080
I have reason to believe Inman engaged with UAP programs in each of these four positions,

267
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,040
but that is not our topic for today.

268
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,920
Shapiro told Eshler factions within the U.S. possess extraterrestrial vehicles and that

269
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,240
he had even studied one at close quarters.

270
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,800
According to Shapiro, teams would take apart craft, pack them up, and ship them across

271
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,300
the country to different locations.

272
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,800
These craft featured unique interlocking components that had to be dissembled in an exact sequence

273
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,760
to be put back together.

274
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,360
Rear Admiral Shapiro was not only former director of Naval Intelligence, but also BDM international

275
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,440
board member at the time, 1989.

276
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,180
To this day, Northrop Grumman maintains a major corporate presence in Tyson Corner near

277
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,680
the former BDM headquarters.

278
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,920
All of this commentary on TRW, Teledyne Ryan, which we will get to shortly, and BDM serve

279
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:41,160
to highlight how Northrop Grumman and its many acquisitions interweave intimately, with

280
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,040
numerous cases we have covered on this channel.

281
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,600
If the claims of Philip J. Corso are indeed true, Northrop's modern-day legacy program

282
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,320
operations can likely trace its roots back to the U.S. Army's golden age of research

283
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,820
and development in 1958 to 1962.

284
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,840
This would also mean many of Northrop Corporation and Northrop Grumman's acquisitions were

285
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,180
to purchase companies that had active, ongoing UFO legacy programs.

286
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,780
This sort of context is crucial to establish before we explore whistleblower claims of

287
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,960
Northrop's operations in these programs.

288
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,920
And last thing before we continue, many individuals think of Lockheed Skunk Works division when

289
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,500
they picture UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation programs in the private sector.

290
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,300
Well in 1992, Northrop created its own quote-unquote answer to Skunk Works.

291
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,900
Northrop created the N.A.T.D.C., Northrop Advanced Technology and Design Center, to

292
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:45,580
focus on the company's core key defense programs.

293
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,700
While we have already discussed many of N.G.'s acquisitions and their ties to UFO legacy

294
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,420
programs from the 1960s to 1990s, let's back up and trace mentions and claims surrounding

295
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,980
specifically the Northrop Corporation and later Northrop Grumman.

296
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,900
I often think back to the words of U.S. Army Colonel and advisor to U.S. Army Futures

297
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,540
Command, Carl Nell, who once stated,

298
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,920
Non-human intelligence exists.

299
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,860
Non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity.

300
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,980
This interaction is not new and it's been ongoing.

301
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,780
And there are unelected people in the government that are aware of that.

302
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,900
And so, Carl, that is quite a bold statement.

303
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:33,380
I'm wondering, and I'm curious, how confident are you that that is true?

304
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,700
There's zero doubt.

305
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,620
Nell has served as an outspoken advocate for David Grush and the existence of technologies

306
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,440
of unknown origin.

307
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,780
One has to wonder if this absence of doubt arose from Nell's position as Deputy CTO

308
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,500
and Director of Systems Engineering and Integration for 13 years on Northrop Grumman.

309
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,820
After all, while serving as Northrop's Deputy CTO, Nell was additionally serving as Command

310
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,580
Representative to U.S. CENTCOM for Army Foreign Material Program.

311
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,820
Northrop's earliest contributions to legacy programs may trace back to 1968.

312
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:15,500
M.S. Kahn and G.M. Andrew of Northrop Noir Air published a paper on the electro-aerodynamics

313
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,140
in supersonic flow, suggesting Northrop was researching methods to reduce drag of an aircraft

314
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,860
by creating an electrostatic field around the craft.

315
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,980
This may remind some of T. Townsend Brown and Electrogravitics.

316
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,100
In Nick Cooke's excellent book, The Hunt for Zero Point, one Dan Marcus is mentioned,

317
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,380
a pseudonym for a source in the British aerospace industry.

318
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,380
Marcus relayed to Cooke that in 2002, the Pentagon pulled the specific paper and, quote,

319
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,780
made it disappear, end quote.

320
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,820
Marcus would suggest the B-2 Spirit bomber applied these concepts to employ an electrostatic

321
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,800
field around the aircraft to reduce drag.

322
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,820
In fact, some UFO researchers such as Michael Schrapp and Dr. Richard Boylan take this a

323
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:05,460
step further, suggesting the B-2 employs reverse-engineered possibly electro-gravitic technology, leading

324
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,020
to the massive cost of the systems.

325
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,420
The question is, and Mark talked about this before, is there more going on to the B-2

326
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,140
than meets the eye?

327
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:23,020
The 18-week space technology, March 9, 1992, had a very interesting article from people

328
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,100
who worked at Northrop who were very upset that the technology associated with the B-2

329
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,980
program was not being trickled down to the public industry.

330
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,300
They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges the leading edge of the wing to reduce the

331
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
radar cross-signature.

332
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,220
That's what you see in this diagram right here.

333
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,500
And then negatively charges the exhaust gases to reduce the infrared signature.

334
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,500
This is the same type of electro-gravitic technology that T. Townsend Brown had originally

335
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,980
proposed in the 1930s.

336
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,860
So this technology might date back a lot earlier than we originally thought.

337
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,540
The first true mention of Northrop engaging with NHI technology comes from the work of

338
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,540
UFO researcher William Hamilton.

339
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:09,880
Hamilton's book, Cosmic Top Secret, is, in my opinion, the most underappreciated book

340
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,920
in all of ufology.

341
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,980
It is a truly excellent piece, decades ahead of its time.

342
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:22,160
For example, the 1992 book makes the first recorded mention to the term ARV and discussion

343
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,080
of the flux liner, which wouldn't rise to fame until Stephen Greer's 2001 Disclosure

344
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,720
Project event.

345
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,240
Mind you, Hamilton did misquote the ARV acronym, stating alien replicated vehicle instead of

346
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,880
alien reproduction vehicle.

347
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,280
However, my research has shown Hamilton spoke to Bill Scott of Aviation Week in Space Technology

348
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,060
to discuss the Brad Sorensen flux liner testimony in the early 90s.

349
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,920
The next time someone tries to say Stephen Greer coined the term ARV, send them this

350
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
passage.

351
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,120
And Hamilton actually told Greer about the 1988 Norton Air Force Base show flux liner

352
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,240
incident and actually passed along both primary witness Sorensen and aerospace illustrator

353
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,560
McCandalish to Greer.

354
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,160
Hamilton was one of the first to draw serious research to the Antelope Valley, California,

355
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,480
near Edwards Air Force Base.

356
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,760
Hamilton drew attention to Lockheed's Gunkworx, Rockwell, McDonnell Douglas, and Northrop

357
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,960
all having plants in Palmdale, California.

358
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,160
The nation's then chief center of aerospace technology.

359
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:29,360
In the middle of these complexes sat Air Force Plant 42, a name many associate with UAP programs.

360
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,400
The author of Cosmic Top Secret does not draw attention to the Northrop facility near Palm

361
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:41,440
Dale, but instead to a secret underground installation north in the Duhachapi Mountains.

362
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,160
Hamilton accuses the Northrop Tehan Ranch radar cross-section facility and accompanying

363
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,360
underground installation as a UAP program facility.

364
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,760
Very little is known about this facility and the underground extension, but let's see

365
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,380
what we can dig up.

366
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,280
This site officially serves as a radar cross-section range.

367
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,320
Quickly, what exactly is a radar cross-section facility?

368
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,640
To summarize, these facilities utilize high-frequency radio waves to test aircraft radar signatures.

369
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,640
The sites utilize large runways and pylons raised from underground on concrete diamonds

370
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,920
as mounting pads to blast craft and materials with radar.

371
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,780
Many RCS facilities saw construction during the Cold War.

372
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,440
This led the majority of installations being built underground to hide RCS pylons, equipment,

373
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,440
and technologies away from Soviet spy satellites.

374
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,280
In Cosmic Top Secret, William Hamilton discussed numerous statements recounted to him, such

375
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:44,000
as a 1988 sighting of a giant boomerang over the Northrop facility and a flying saucer seen

376
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,600
taking off from a building on the property.

377
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,840
The Northrop RCS facility has recorded several anomalous sightings throughout history, oftentimes

378
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,560
glowing orbs seen around the facility.

379
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,080
According to some researchers, the facility sees a disproportionate amount of sightings

380
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,160
compared to the Lockheed and MacDonald Douglas RCS facilities nearby.

381
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,800
And this isn't the first time I've discussed this Northrop location.

382
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:14,440
Remember back to my work on the triangular alien reproduction vehicle, the XF-131 Super Sentinel.

383
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:21,060
Let's reference forensic artist Bill MacDonald's 1992 piece, the Tuhachibi Triangle, in which

384
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,560
the artist drew a reverse-engineered triangular craft detailed to him by disgruntled engineers

385
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,440
from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.

386
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,620
The engineers hailed from the Northrop RCS facility at Tehan and Lockheed Martin Hellendale

387
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,760
RCS plant.

388
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,760
According to their testimonies, the facilities doubled as UFO reverse engineering and material

389
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,960
exploitation locations.

390
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,360
If you have not seen this investigation, I highly recommend watching as the XF-131 Super

391
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,320
Sentinel is absolutely fascinating research, and RCS locations have actually seen much

392
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,360
discussion in ufology, with the contentious Stephen Greer in particular labeling the Hellendale

393
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,120
plant as a staging ground for electro-gravitic ARV, and a forward operating base employing

394
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,560
EMP weapons for ARV testing and downing of non-human vehicles.

395
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,220
Now, interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and other senior

396
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,600
officials had no idea of this.

397
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:26,040
The top people in the Special Forces who were outside this illegal black project system

398
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,240
didn't know about it.

399
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,800
I had known about it since the 90s, but I'd never, of course, flown directly over it because

400
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,880
it's classified airspace and very sensitive.

401
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:42,240
So you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.

402
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:49,480
It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come

403
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,560
out, they go up and they hover, they're silent, they're electro-gravitic, anti-grav.

404
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,840
The diamond on the left, you see that looks like a runway with a diamond, it's not a runway

405
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,080
because they don't need to run and get, there's non-aerodynamic, they just go boom, up.

406
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,960
But they're placed on different diamonds.

407
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,760
I have a whole series of video and pictures of these that I don't have time to go through,

408
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:17,480
and that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon

409
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:23,400
to see if it's hardened enough to withstand conflict, right?

410
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,880
Now this may seem extreme, but there is quite a bit of valid research to discuss weapons

411
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,520
that have been designed to down a UAP.

412
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,760
But what more can we factually learn about the underground portion of the Tehan RCS facility?

413
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,000
The Northrop site would then be discussed in Dr. Richard Sauter's excellent book,

414
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,720
underground bases and tunnels, which takes an evidence-based approach to studying subterranean

415
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,880
facilities, aka deep underground military bases, DUMs.

416
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,000
This is my absolute favorite book on the subject of DUMs, as Sauter tackles the subject often

417
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,640
associated with conspiracies with rigorous fact-based research.

418
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,360
Sauter states Northrop alongside numerous Fortune 500 companies such as Lockheed Martin

419
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,040
employ high-tech underground centers in California, and claims with a high degree of certainty

420
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:20,600
these facilities are, quote, heavily engaged in non-conventional high-tech aerospace research,

421
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
end quote.

422
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,880
Dr. Sauter is equally confident the underground portion of the Northrop RCS facility engages

423
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,160
in the same non-conventional research, but is unsure just how far beneath the earth Northrop's

424
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,880
activities extend.

425
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,720
Rumors persist under the site there exist as many as 42 underground levels and connective

426
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,440
tunnels to nearby facilities as well as Edwards Air Force Base.

427
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,120
The validity and very real existence of these locations and tunnels will be another topic

428
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,900
for another day, as there is quite a volume of valuable research to speak to the legitimacy

429
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,760
of interconnected deep underground military bases.

430
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,620
As a yes, I do plan on using Dr. Sauter's research for a full deep dive into DUMs, but

431
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:11,260
I would just like to say that TRW, Northrop's golden child, also has a storied history in

432
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,240
connected subterranean facilities.

433
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,000
In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. National Committee on

434
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,480
Tunneling Technology, USNC slash TT, conducted myriad studies, reports, and patents on underground

435
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,480
ICBM-based design, tunneling technologies, tunnel boring machines, tunnel depths, etc.

436
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,440
TRW engaged and published a number of studies determining the viability of high-speed ground

437
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,600
transportation tunnel design.

438
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,400
For example, we can analyze this 1968 report where TRW discusses high-speed underground

439
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,400
transportation vehicles in tunnel diameters ranging from 80 to 40 feet, at a depth of

440
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,280
400 to 2,500 feet.

441
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,400
Another topic for another day as I stated.

442
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,960
Analyzing McDonald, Sauter, and Hamilton, the question must be asked, does Northrop

443
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:10,060
Grumman test and operate reverse-engineered NHI vehicles out of an underground facility

444
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,880
beneath the Tehan RCS site?

445
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:18,400
The Northrop, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas RCS locations do, after all, reside in close

446
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,160
proximity to Edwards Air Force Base, the former Norton Air Force Base, and Palmdale-USAF Plant

447
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
42.

448
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:31,000
Norton and Plant 42 are integral pieces to the flux liner ARV testimony of Brad Sorensen

449
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,660
and Mark McCandlish.

450
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:38,280
And carefully connecting research and analyzing the testimony of Lt. Col. Ed, I have accused

451
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,320
Edwards Air Force Base and their 412th test group as running a UFO reverse-engineering

452
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:53,240
testing program between Edwards and the Nevada Test and Training Range.

453
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,040
Several testimonies over the decades outside of Eshler, Miller, and McDonald's four anonymous

454
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:04,020
engineers have labeled Northrop Grumman directly as participating in UFO crash retrieval, reverse

455
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,760
engineering, and material exploitation.

456
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,760
Many will recall the testimony of Edgar Fouchet and the TR3B reverse-engineered Triangular

457
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,840
Craft.

458
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,400
Many write off Fouchet due to the absence of hard physical proof of his claims.

459
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,380
However, I do highly recommend viewing my piece on Triangle ARVs in general, as a tremendous

460
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,040
amount of research resulted from Fouchet's disclosures.

461
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:33,180
The 250-foot prototype and 600-foot operational TR3B models, according to Fouchet, saw test

462
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:39,480
flights over Edwards Air Force Base, conducted by the AFFTC Air Force Test Center, which

463
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,840
oddly enough operates under the 412th test group which we discussed above.

464
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,320
Strange as near Edwards, where these test flights allegedly occur, Northrop has nearby

465
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,260
installations both near Palmdale USAF Plant 42, as well as a mysterious underground location

466
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,800
where anomalous craft have been reported over the decades.

467
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,440
Fouchet also outright named the contractors responsible for the construction of TR3B.

468
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,640
FFRDC's Sandia and Livermore Labs reverse-engineered the propulsion device.

469
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,560
But the primary contractors of the project were listed as Lockheed, Boeing, Teledyne

470
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,640
Ryan and Northrop.

471
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,200
I would now like to shift to a fascinating few details from the whistleblower testimony

472
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,360
of Colonel Steve Wilson.

473
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,960
Wilson's testimony was made public around 1997, shortly before his death, through researcher

474
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,080
Dr. Richard Boylan.

475
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,760
Boylan has historically published some claims I approach with skepticism, so I tried multiple

476
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,360
times to connect with him regarding Wilson, but have heard nothing.

477
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:43,160
Colonel Steve Wilson does deserve his own video, as this enigmatic figure is well worth

478
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,560
investigating.

479
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,520
And disclaimer, we cannot 100% prove Wilson's 40-year military background, as numerous articles

480
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,600
exist on the web detailing his DD-214 in education, training and medals.

481
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,600
However, we do not have any scans or copies of Wilson's official records or images of

482
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,960
him in service.

483
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,500
For this reason, I do also recommend reading Kevin Randall's skeptical take on Wilson

484
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:12,580
and Boylan's reporting, which raises concerns, such as 40 years of service listed on Wilson's

485
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,380
DD-214, as well as seemingly misreported medals.

486
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,900
To summarize Wilson's disclosures, Wilson claimed in 1963, as a captain in the Tactical

487
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,620
Fighter Squadron out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, he was assigned to the Majestic

488
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,060
12 and promoted to major.

489
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:34,420
Here the then major learned of the Majestic 12's modus operandi, to control, quote,

490
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,740
UFO surveillance and interdictions, retrievals and analysis of records of extraterrestrial

491
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:45,220
spacecraft and occupants, and public access to any information about these matters, end

492
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,220
quote.

493
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,340
As part of his duties, Wilson would be assigned to the 1st Special Forces Air Command and

494
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:55,220
would undergo special training with Delta Force and the then Black Berets.

495
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,300
For 9 years, Colonel Wilson claimed to visit nearly every Air Force base in the world and

496
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,180
make contact with key people for the Majestic 12 unit.

497
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:09,020
Wilson states, whilst a Lieutenant Colonel in 1972, he was reassigned from 1st Special

498
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:14,620
Forces Air Command at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to Area S-4, near Papoose

499
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,620
Lake south of Area 51, by men with CIA credentials.

500
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,100
I am skipping a tremendous amount of detail here, as this is not our subject for today,

501
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,900
but Wilson would travel 30 stories underground in the facility where he witnessed 8 different

502
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:35,540
kinds of non-human craft, as well as an extremely tall woman that appeared to be extraterrestrial.

503
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:41,300
According to Wilson, S-4 operated to test anti-gravity reverse engineered vehicles.

504
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:47,060
The first successful flight had allegedly occurred on July 18th, 1971, a year before

505
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:52,100
his station, which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test.

506
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,580
Interesting connection to Eshler, Inman and Shapiro, as we stated above.

507
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,700
After some time at S-4, Wilson would claim to head Project Pounce, an elite Air Force

508
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,220
NRO Special Forces unit which retrieved downed UFOs.

509
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:11,580
Oddly enough, Project Pounce can be observed in the disputed Majestic 12 Project Aquarius

510
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:17,540
document and, oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel report.

511
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:23,060
Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel to reduce public concern regarding

512
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,300
UFOs.

513
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,540
So Wilson has a big, unprovable testimony.

514
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,880
What does any of this have to do with Northrop Grumman?

515
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,140
In his disclosures to Dr. Boylan, Wilson additionally named US aerospace vehicles that had been

516
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,500
created utilizing reverse engineered non-human technology.

517
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,780
Many of these vehicles would feature anti-gravity systems, and after all of the research we've

518
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,820
done on this channel and the words of Jake Barber, maybe this isn't so far-fetched.

519
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:55,260
The implications of what you're saying also are that potentially there is some kind of

520
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,460
capacity to draw incredible amounts of energy from the quantum back end.

521
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,460
I've seen it.

522
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,460
You've seen it.

523
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,460
I've seen it.

524
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:10,020
There's also, obviously, the capacity to use propulsion systems that are far beyond what

525
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,020
we're describing.

526
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,180
Yeah, that seems to be the case as well.

527
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,180
Anti-gravity.

528
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,180
Anti-gravity.

529
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,460
They know about it.

530
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,220
Zero point energy.

531
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,900
Those secrets are being suppressed from our knowledge.

532
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:28,540
Wilson would state US clandestine military operations began flying the TR-3B reverse

533
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:34,340
engineered triangle but also discussed an anti-gravity disc that glowed intense orange

534
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,420
golden during flight.

535
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:41,820
Wilson claimed this craft was made by Northrop Aerospace at their secret facility northeast

536
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,320
of Lancaster, California.

537
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,120
This location is quite interesting, as it matches the underground Northrop Range we

538
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,240
discussed earlier in this investigation.

539
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,840
Wilson would even state the Northrop, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas RCS facilities were

540
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:04,200
connected alongside Area 51 and other sensitive locations via underground train systems.

541
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,700
Wilson claimed these tunnels were excavated by nuclear subterranes, which is actually

542
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,760
very interesting.

543
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,040
Nuclear subterranes are massive tunneling machines that work by melting rock with heat

544
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,400
supplied via a compact nuclear reactor.

545
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,160
Numerous patents for such machines were designed by Los Alamos National Laboratories in the

546
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,520
1970s, and don't worry, we will fully dive into this in the dumb video.

547
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,360
Boylan had reportedly witnessed this craft in test flight over Area 51 in the Northrop

548
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,920
complex near Edwards, dubbing it Northrop's Great Pumpkin Disc.

549
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,460
These two siding locations are another fascinating connection to ED and the joint reverse engineering

550
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,680
effort between Edwards, Contractors, and Area 51.

551
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,360
Wilson made additional mentions to a reverse engineered craft designated the XH-75D or

552
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,320
the XH Shark.

553
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:03,200
This craft is allegedly an anti-gravity helicopter designed by Teledyne Ryan San Diego Division.

554
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,340
Wilson claimed these craft were assigned to Delta Force slash the NRO for UFO crash retrievals.

555
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,880
This mention of NRO and Delta is indeed intriguing.

556
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,320
Delta Force, part of the Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC, has been accused of participating

557
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:24,720
in foreign UFO crash retrievals under the CIA Office of Global Access, as has indeed

558
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,000
the NRO.

559
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,480
In fact, the NRO was one of two intelligence agencies, the other being the National Geospatial

560
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,400
Intelligence Agency we discussed above with C4ISR, David Grush worked on as liaison to

561
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:43,220
the UAP Task Force, where he discovered the existence of UAP legacy programs.

562
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:49,440
The NRO was also one of three intelligence agencies alongside the CIA and NSA mentioned

563
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,680
by Edgar Fouchet as managing the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle.

564
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:00,560
Very little has been discussed on this craft, the XH-75D, original drawing by Wilson on

565
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,120
screen now, and almost no actionable investigation can arise from Wilson's incredibly brief

566
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,040
testimony on this craft.

567
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:14,320
The Colonel never discussed the intended application or function of the onboard anti-gravity system.

568
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:20,400
What I do find interesting is a 2019 design concept created by one of Lockheed Martin's

569
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,160
subsidiaries, the Sikorsky Raider X.

570
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,520
Dual rotor helicopters are not rare.

571
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,100
They are often implemented on helicopters designed for heavy lift.

572
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:36,500
One would have to ask why the XH-75D would need dual rotors with an anti-gravity system.

573
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,700
But the Raider X, cancelled in 24, sought to create a quote, agile, survivable compound

574
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,740
coaxial helicopter that will equip future aviators to address evolving peer and near

575
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,540
peer threats in the most difficult environments, end quote.

576
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,220
No further linkages beyond design exist between these platforms.

577
00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:01,040
However, I do find it interesting the XH-75D, drawn by Wilson in 97, looks almost identical

578
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,900
to the concept craft proposed by Lockheed in 2019.

579
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,220
So is the anti-gravity disc and helicopter proposed by Wilson real?

580
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,980
Well, this is unfortunately a dead end of investigation.

581
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:18,340
As I said, Wilson's testimony must be considered little more than third party research.

582
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:23,760
Because while it is fascinating and ties intimately to some claims made regarding UAP legacy recovery

583
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,520
programs throughout history, there is little evidence or actionable data to pursue.

584
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,040
I would, however, like to leave discussion of Wilson with a chart he made regarding the

585
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,360
structure of UAP legacy programs.

586
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,220
Please note, the rendition I am showing now is a recreation of Wilson's 97 chart published

587
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,760
in 2001.

588
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,120
Numerous spelling errors can be observed here, such as in Lockheed.

589
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,760
This chart is titled Star Wars City in reference to the Strategic Defense Initiative, the program

590
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,040
we mentioned above, and a program I have discussed many times, instituted by Reagan

591
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,040
in the 1980s with possible ties to Eisenhower.

592
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,720
To state again, the SDI program instituted to protect the United States from ballistic

593
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,700
nuclear attacks has been referenced by numerous witnesses who have stated the program had

594
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:17,720
a backdoor functionality to act offensively against UAP and backchanneled funds to fund

595
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,220
UFO legacy programs.

596
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,660
From the chart, Star Wars City, located under the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado

597
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,700
Springs, Colorado, oversees the U.S. space counterintelligence headquarters within the

598
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,380
SDI as the nexus of UAP legacy programs.

599
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,900
Within this chart, there are numerous institutions one might expect to be associated with UAP

600
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:44,340
retrieval and exploitation programs, the NRO, National Security Council, National Security

601
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,500
Agency, CIA, NORAD, and Majestic 12.

602
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,300
Adhering to the SDI Colorado HQ and MAGI, there exists a list of contractors alleged

603
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,420
to engage with the UAP portfolio.

604
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,580
Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin Marietta, Lockheed, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and IBM

605
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,780
are mentioned.

606
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,860
We also find Decision Science Applications Inc.

607
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:13,260
DSAI was led by former Admiral and recurring character of this project, Bobby Ray Inman,

608
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,280
and most likely had its assets handed over to SAIC.

609
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:23,400
A contractor I believe is as involved in legacy operations as Northrop or Lockheed.

610
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,760
Another project for another day, as DSAI is quite a worthy investigation.

611
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,680
DSI, according to the chart and Wilson's testimony, consists of directors of relevant

612
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,400
UAP black budget divisions from the aforementioned contractors as well as Ford Aerospace, which

613
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,600
is now part of Northrop Grumman, and Teledyne Ryan, which was one of Northrop's premium

614
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,600
purchases.

615
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,580
While Teledyne Ryan did indeed play a vital role in the Strategic Defense Initiative,

616
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,640
the contractor was well regarded for designing and producing high-performance aerial targets,

617
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,200
which were crucial for testing and evaluation potential for missile defense systems as well

618
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,520
as developing advanced sensors that could be used for detecting and tracking incoming

619
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,960
ballistic missiles.

620
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,640
TRW, Northrop's crown jewel, additionally aided in the SDI program, such as using its

621
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,160
locations for high-powered chemical laser testing.

622
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,000
And as we mentioned above, Northrop itself takes great pride in aiding in the SDI program

623
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,440
in 1983, creating the first laser radar used in space.

624
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,440
It is fascinating, even in a testimony like Wilson's, we can still find links to Northrop's

625
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,800
many acquisitions and UAP legacy programs.

626
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,640
And now onto a whistleblower by the acronym of AH that appeared on Stephen Greer's 2001

627
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,560
disclosure briefing document.

628
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,600
And I must state again regarding Greer's witnesses.

629
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,920
Let us analyze the quality and claims of the whistleblower instead of the platform.

630
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,840
Unfortunately, Greer's poor operational security is ever-present, as clips of AH are listed

631
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,800
in the DPI archive as Arnold House.

632
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,640
I believe I have located this individual and have reached out to talk to him.

633
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,640
I have heard nothing.

634
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:08,760
Arnold's testimony revolves around the significant information he gained regarding UAP programs

635
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:14,280
while a surface technician at the Boeing Aerospace Company, as well as insights gained from

636
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,820
friend and four-star general Curtis LeMay.

637
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:23,280
As we dive in, it is crucial to maintain awareness House's disclosures are indeed second-hand.

638
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,540
As far as his testimony, House never participated directly in program operations.

639
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:35,720
His information was handed to him from friends at NSA, CIA, NASA, JPL, Office of Naval Intelligence,

640
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,220
USAAF, Northrop, Boeing, and various generals.

641
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:46,000
This information was so complete according to Greer, House briefed Bill Clinton in 1990.

642
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,640
I have no evidence to confirm this briefing.

643
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,480
The only possible link I can find is a letter to Clinton from Greer marked 9 July 2000,

644
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,640
where Greer requested the sitting president to disclose UFO-related USAPs at the suggestion

645
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,360
of their mutual friend.

646
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,360
I do find House very worthy of discussion as we can find correspondences with him and

647
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,800
Greer as recently as 2018 and as old as December 2000.

648
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,200
Perhaps House, like William Hamilton, has served as one of Greer's primary sources

649
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,560
of information over the decades.

650
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:24,200
In his taped testimony link in description, House stated one day around 1987 at the home

651
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:30,200
of General Curtis LeMay, the infamous general confirmed the Roswell, New Mexico crash.

652
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,200
House also learned from his NSA friend that Henry Kissinger, George Bush, as well as Ronald

653
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,720
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev were all aware of the UAP subject.

654
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:46,480
His friends and CIA relayed to House that they, along with USAAF, had downed NHI craft.

655
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,120
Arnold even claimed he learned from a friend in the FBI that the Bureau had radar testing

656
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:55,480
that was causing interference with some of the craft resulting in crashes.

657
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,920
This echoes Lieutenant Colonel Corso's sentiments regarding the crash of the Roswell,

658
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,720
New Mexico craft.

659
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:08,600
House also learned and relayed there are underground bases testing and maintaining TUOs, likely

660
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:14,080
Dugway, Palmdale, California, Edwards Air Force Base, Eglin Air Force Base, and others.

661
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,800
Interesting we see Palmdale and Edwards pop up once again.

662
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,040
But now let's focus directly on Arnold's information regarding Northrup.

663
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,440
House's entire testimony could lead to an entire video, so maybe we will save that for

664
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,600
Whistleblowers Volume 3.

665
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,800
A.H. stated while at Boeing he met a man in the Army Criminal Investigation Division,

666
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:41,040
CID, who was involved in several crash recovery since 1947 and had served in Army CIC, Counter

667
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,160
Intelligence Corps, capacity.

668
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,360
The gentleman handpicked one of House's friends at the Boeing Aircraft Company to become

669
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:52,720
part of a UFO crash recovery team in northern New Mexico starting in 1980.

670
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,120
This friend of A.H. would somehow relay information regarding his time and legacy program operations

671
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,960
from 1980 to 1997, 17 years.

672
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,440
The time of these disclosures is not given, however as investigators we must assume that

673
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,280
his friend informed Arnold after leaving program operations in 1997.

674
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,380
House's friend was ultimately stationed and helped with reverse engineering efforts and

675
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,820
testing of non-human craft at Area 51.

676
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,860
He was not working for the US government or military, however.

677
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:28,300
His paychecks during these years in legacy programs came directly from Northrup.

678
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:33,600
The source would illustrate Northrup, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing all engaged in UFO reverse

679
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,200
engineering efforts at Area 51.

680
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:42,260
The facility itself from 1980 to 1997 held a tremendous amount of extraterrestrial debris

681
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,420
in a containment area.

682
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:49,820
This source would also tell House some of the program was shifted to a location in Utah,

683
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,100
likely Dugway Proving Grounds.

684
00:51:52,100 --> 00:52:02,620
They moved most of the stuff from Area 51, at least 35% to 40% of Area 51 to Utah, just

685
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,260
basically those companies and of course Lockheed and Northrup.

686
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:11,960
This is very interesting as USF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet said the exact same thing.

687
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:17,440
Some Area 51 legacy programs were relocated to Dugway in the early 1990s.

688
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,780
I myself have talked about Dugway previously and plan to revisit with a contractor witness

689
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:28,340
who claimed to stumble upon a floating saucer craft within a classified testing area on

690
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,720
base.

691
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:35,120
Here is where House's testimony regarding Area 51 and Northrup gets really interesting.

692
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,300
This same friend told Arnold the A51 program to test NHI vehicles and exploit technological

693
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,280
materials was called Project Red Light.

694
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:53,240
There's a base near Lancaster and Palmdale area and near, this is very funny, it's near

695
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,580
Northrup.

696
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:59,420
There's an underground area out there too that he was aware of.

697
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:05,440
But he particularly mentioned and stayed focused on ANSA California.

698
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,480
There's some underground areas up there too that they're researching some of this technology

699
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,140
and at March Air Force Base through Project Red Light.

700
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:20,080
This should immediately become familiar to many of my viewers as I have referenced this

701
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,100
Project Red Light on numerous occasions.

702
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:27,960
I have traced first mention of this project to the files of the late legendary researcher

703
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:33,160
Leonard Stringfield, author of Crash Retrieval Status Reports 1 through 7 and relayed by

704
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,600
excellent researcher Michael Schratt.

705
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:42,960
In a letter dated April 5, 1980, one Mr. D. L. Dobbs discussed one M.H., a witness identity

706
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,480
Schratt chose not to disclose.

707
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,720
M.H. allegedly performed radio maintenance at the Atomic Proving Grounds in Nevada during

708
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:56,960
1961-1963, along with top-secret radio work for USAF.

709
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:04,320
According to M.H., he participated in a top-secret operation at Area 51 titled Project Red Light.

710
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,920
Test flights were conducted under this project on a recovered UFO shipped from none other

711
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,160
than Edwards Air Force Base.

712
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,960
The craft was not conventionally powered and stayed silent during operation.

713
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,720
Security was so tight on the project, program personnel were rotated every six months.

714
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,880
M.H. claimed to have heard rumors of a West Coast American defense contractor encountering

715
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,600
difficulties in reverse engineering many of the components comprising the craft.

716
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,800
I have drawn a parallel between Red Light and the testimony of Ed we have referenced

717
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,880
numerous times throughout this project, a joint Edwards Area 51 reverse engineering

718
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,880
program out of the Edwards 412th test group.

719
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,920
Well, Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet additionally mentioned Project Red Light.

720
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,320
Fouchet claimed he gathered knowledge defense contractor E.G.N.G. was awarded an indefinite

721
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:58,040
contract for Project Red Light to support the DOE and military.

722
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,760
If you have not heard of E.G.N.G., this is the contractor historically implicated with

723
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,840
UAP programs made infamous in the story of Bob Lazar as the contractor that hired him

724
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,000
to work out of Site 4.

725
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,720
This contract gave E.G.N.G. responsibility to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials

726
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,640
in cases of mishaps and to provide aerial and ground security for highly classified

727
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,760
government and military sites.

728
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,560
If the testimony of Arnold House and his legacy program connections are indeed true, Northrop

729
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:34,160
Grumman could have indeed served as a project manager for Project Red Light, testing non-human

730
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,480
intelligence and alien reproduction vehicles in a joint contractor Edwards 412th test group

731
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,600
operation.

732
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,920
Absolutely incredible links to ponder.

733
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,960
Hey guys, it's Gerb and thank you so much for joining me and sitting through this entire

734
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:56,360
investigation into Northrop Grumman and their involvement in legacy program operations.

735
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,560
By this point I think the video will be about an hour long so I really appreciate you joining

736
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,800
me through this journey.

737
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,160
As you probably noticed and if you've seen my other work on Battelle and Lockheed, you

738
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,860
know we have a lot less tangible paper trails to work with here with Northrop.

739
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:19,480
We have no Project Stork, we have no direct mention of Lockheed and so forth.

740
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,960
But almost in a way I find that a little more intriguing for my research.

741
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,120
You know with Northrop we devoted so much time to look specifically at Northrop Grumman's

742
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,120
acquisitions.

743
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:36,840
TRW, Teledyne Ryan, BDM, connections to Aerospace Corporation and FFRDCs.

744
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:44,760
And I find this so fascinating how Northrop's involvement outside of mentions of Fouche and

745
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,240
a couple other mentions here and there and comments from Jack Northrop at the beginning

746
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:55,440
of the video, they seem to purchase buy up companies that had legacy operations.

747
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,680
You know TRW and its implication in the Wilson Davis Memo and the Phil Pentagon audit that

748
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:06,440
almost outed the senior review group, $200 million today Northrop paid to settle that

749
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,440
lawsuit for TRW.

750
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,600
Now they acquired them I believe for $6 or $7 billion, so that's a drop in the bucket

751
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,840
but it's interesting that a year after the acquisition Northrop's still okay with you

752
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,820
know what TRW you're implicated in this massive lawsuit but don't worry we'll pay for it.

753
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:27,480
So I find that sort of research absolutely scintillating instead of just direct confirmations

754
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,780
and direct ties like we had with Lockheed and Battelle, I also find all of the whistleblower

755
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:39,540
testimony of Northrop to be incredibly fascinating you know I wouldn't be surprised to see full

756
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:45,300
projects on Steve Wilson and Arnold Howe soon and like I mentioned I've tried to connect

757
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,100
with Howe because I do believe with a high degree of certainty I have found that individual

758
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:57,040
and Colonel Steve Wilson is no longer with us he passed in 1997 but his testimony is

759
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:03,980
still shrouded in mystery and his legitimacy in USAF is still surrounded in mystery so

760
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,860
a lot more to explore there but I find it really interesting from the work of William

761
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:16,300
Hamilton to the testimony of AH that there's still these little comments that are ubiquitous

762
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:23,180
around testimony that I still find to be quite accurate mentions of the SDI and UAP legacy programs

763
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:28,620
mention of Northrop's involvement in underground facilities mention of underground facilities

764
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:34,540
mentioning you know dating to Fouche as well projects being moved from Area 51 to Dugway

765
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:39,460
Proving Grounds even mentions of Area 51 and Edwards as we see in Arnold Howe's Red Light,

766
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:46,140
Fouche, etc. So the question must be asked why is Northrop's involvement in legacy programs

767
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:53,180
legacy programs operations so shrouded why do they pass under the radar alongside companies

768
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:59,500
like Boeing and Raytheon while Lockheed Martin while Battelle these guys I mean even General

769
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:05,260
Electric to a certain degree are always labeled as the prime contractors well I do have somewhat

770
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:12,700
of a thesis there I think Battelle bar biological storage at probably Fort Detrick or Fort Belbois

771
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:17,420
is a little bit out of the game they're a little bit said and done I think the three

772
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:24,300
four primary players if we want to say are Lockheed Boeing who is likely a project manager

773
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:30,860
for operations Northrop and Raytheon I think these are the big guys I think that

774
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:39,260
Lockheed is sort of like a hound dog Lockheed will respond to a beck and call they will do

775
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:47,100
what is required of them they are the loudest in the room etc. I think Lockheed is they will

776
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:51,260
take advantage of a situation and they are opportunists the reason I say this is the

777
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:58,700
2008 material transfer to OSAP that was blocked by again Glenn Gaffney and the CIA Directorate

778
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:06,620
of Science and Technology Lockheed itself offered to divest itself of materials now was this to

779
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:13,580
get in the good graces of the CIA the OGA the DS&T the NRO probably

780
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,620
did Lockheed give up materials they could reverse engineer did Lockheed give away

781
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:25,500
materials that they think that any other corporation or agency could reverse engineer

782
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,140
and garner insights from probably not this was probably materials they thought well if we can't

783
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:35,900
figure it out no one else can so we might as well you know get in good favor with some people and

784
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,060
get rid of these materials which is likely from the 1953 Kingman Arizona crash but that's a whole

785
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:48,300
another conversation Northrup their work seems to be shrouded in much more secrecy they are not

786
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:53,260
offering to divest themselves of material they are often staying in the shadows they are often

787
01:00:53,260 --> 01:01:01,340
tag-lined in testimonies like Fouches as the person in the shadows so that begs the question

788
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:07,100
what work are they doing well I believe it's material exploitation reverse engineering and

789
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:13,020
testing of ARV and likely project managerial responsibilities for the red light project if

790
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:19,900
that is still ongoing or if that has shifted since Ed's time around Nellis and Edwards and I ending

791
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:28,380
in about 2006 to 2008 so if that project is still ongoing I think that Lockheed operates similar to

792
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:33,420
and I forgot one on the mountain rush more of legacy operations SAIC I think lock I think

793
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:39,420
Northrup alongside Lockheed alongside SAIC Boeing and perhaps Raytheon they operate across all

794
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:47,020
segments of US military I've commented numerous times that the army the air force and the navy

795
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:52,460
their programs are extremely compartmentalized stove piped as Eric Davis said and don't really

796
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:57,020
have much interaction with each other the common threads here are the contractors that interact

797
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:04,060
in programs across compartments and possibly the UARCs and FFRDCs that do as well there might be

798
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:10,860
some some small contractors that help out with air force responsibilities here and then one such

799
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:17,580
company might be alien science and technologies helping Ed and the project red light if you want

800
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:22,860
to call it that out at Edwards but the project managers the the companies that seem to do quite

801
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:29,260
a bit and engage in all facets of legacy program operations operate across all of these boards

802
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:35,900
so is Northrup still ongoing in research I would probably say yes and Northrup has is up to their

803
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:41,580
eyeballs just like SAIC just like Lockheed and just like Boeing but these are my personal opinions I

804
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:46,940
think that even though much of the research we have studied today is still whistleblower testimony

805
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:54,300
and a bit nebulous at some points like Steve Wilson I still think there are numerous fascinating

806
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:00,860
ties I mean again I want to harken back to Northrup's many acquisitions and even date that

807
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:06,700
back to Sperry Rand when it went defunct its departments going to Northrup Grumman and Lockheed

808
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:12,940
and others and connections to the Corso testimony all of these neat little threads that kind of tie

809
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:19,180
Northrup and its purchasing streak interwoven into stories of legacy program operations it's

810
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:24,220
very fascinating in a sense this project was almost a little bit more conclusive to me than

811
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:31,020
even Lockheed or Battelle I would like to know what everybody else here thinks you know perhaps

812
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:36,860
Northrup's silence is a sign of danger we don't know all we can do is continue to investigate

813
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:42,700
and if you have any other insights into Northrup or or testimony I would love to hear from you and

814
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,940
to tell me what you think in the comments with that guys we will move on because I think I've

815
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:52,540
been ranting now for about eight minutes please remember to like and subscribe always look forward

816
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:58,540
to the next project we'll get back in live soon because I would like to talk a little bit about

817
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:06,540
concurring events you know with the whistleblower testimony of Jake Barber, Dr. John Blitch, Don Paul

818
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:12,860
Bales and so forth and Fred Baker but I don't want to make that my channel I'm not a news of

819
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:17,500
the day type of guy as you all know you know there's a lot of space between the videos so

820
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,340
we'll figure out something there so please remember to like and subscribe guys I do have

821
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:26,380
a Patreon you can find that on the channel page I don't gatekeep content all of my research as

822
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:32,540
everybody knows is open source so only support what you think the channel is worth you're not

823
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:36,700
getting much extra there it's just going to help me out make these investigations purchasing better

824
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:41,420
camera equipment because ever as everybody can see this camera isn't great and you know maybe

825
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:46,780
funding my trips to go speak to witnesses which I do plan to do quite soon so thank you so much

826
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:50,940
again for joining me and I will catch everybody on the next show later everybody thanks
