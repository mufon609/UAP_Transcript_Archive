1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
It didn't start or end with Roswell.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,360
In fact, many countries around the world have stories of crashes of non-human intelligence

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,600
that rival the intrigue, cover-up, and credibility of the infamous crash that occurred in the

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,400
New Mexico desert in 1947.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,420
Whether this be Shag Harbor, Canada, MagÃ©, Brazil, or others, tantalizing and perplexing

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,840
stories of UFO crashes are not isolated to the United States.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,440
So today, let's investigate a severely underexplored UFO retrieval case that may give us the greatest

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,760
insights into U.S. craft recovery protocol that allegedly occurred in northern Mexico

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,360
in Coyame, Chihuahua in the summer of 1974.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,800
Hey guys, it's UAPGurb, and thank you so much for joining me today as we dive into

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,520
a gripping and underrepresented crash retrieval case commonly referred to by authors as Mexico's

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,980
Roswell.

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,740
This case features an astounding tale to rival any case of a downed UAP, a classic crash

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,500
disc, U.S. special forces recovery, a mysterious leaked report describing the event, the death

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,940
of the Mexican military retrieval force, and much, much more.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,260
Is this case that has hardly seen any covering fact or fiction?

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,120
Join me today as we try and find out.

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,060
And before we get started, it is worth noting primary sources for this case are few and

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,420
far between.

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,900
I will primarily be referencing the work of authors and first-hand investigators into

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,980
the Coyame case, Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte, and their book, Mexico's Roswell, the Chihuahua

22
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:39,020
UFO Crash, and follow-up piece, the Cayome Incident, as well as Leonard Stringfield's

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,020
UFO crash retrieval status report 7 part 9 and Ryan S. Wood's masterpiece Magic Eyes

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,620
Only, which gives this case a medium to high level of authenticity.

25
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:00,820
In the early 1980s, whispers of a 1974 collision between a small private plane and disc-shaped

26
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,900
UFO occurring near Coyame, Chihuahua, Mexico began circulating.

27
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,100
Tales of dead Mexican soldiers who initially recovered the craft and an American recovering

28
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,580
team who relieved the corpses of the craft wreckage began to rise and follow these whispers.

29
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,900
In 1994, legendary UFO crash retrieval researcher Leonard Stringfield would state, quote, I heard

30
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,020
of the Chihuahua case before, either in the late 1970s or early 1980s.

31
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,140
The only detail I vaguely recall is that the U.S. military team had covertly crossed into

32
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,940
Mexico to retrieve the object, end quote.

33
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,540
It wasn't until 1992, on an electronic bulletin board, an anomalous document titled, quote,

34
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,300
Research Finding on Chihuahua Disc Crash, end quote, would be posted, commonly referred

35
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,900
to as the Deneb Report, which we will discuss in much greater detail later.

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,540
This shadowy, possibly leaked or purposefully leaked memo of unknown origin details the

37
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,940
communications of 1JS to all Deneb team members.

38
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,860
In early summer of 1993, paper copies of this document would be mailed anonymously to UFO

39
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,260
researchers such as Elaine Douglas, who shared the original documents with Stringfield.

40
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,780
This anonymous mailing to select researchers reminds me strongly of the origins of the

41
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,140
MJ-12 documents.

42
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,780
The Deneb Report serves as our primary document describing this case.

43
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,460
I find it crucial to read this document in its entirety, as it serves as the greatest

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,180
analysis of this mysterious case.

45
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,020
Afterwards, we will investigate some of the key aspects of this report and even further,

46
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:38,380
so without further ado, let's dive right into this 1974 recovery story.

47
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:45,780
To all Deneb team members from JS, date 23rd March, 1992, subject.

48
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,580
Research Findings on the Chihuahua Disc Crash, text.

49
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:56,860
On 25 Aug 74 at 2207 hours, U.S. Air Defense radar detected an unknown approaching U.S.

50
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,820
airspace from the Gulf of Mexico.

51
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,780
Originally the object was tracked at 2200 knots, on a bearing of 325 degrees and an

52
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:12,260
altitude of 75,000 feet, a course that would intercept U.S. territory about 40 miles southwest

53
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,460
of Corpus Christi, Texas.

54
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,580
After approximately 60 seconds of observation at a position of 155 miles southeast of Corpus

55
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:25,500
Christi, the object simultaneously decelerated to approximately 1700 knots.

56
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,680
Turning to a heading of 290 degrees and began a slow descent, it entered Mexican airspace

57
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,900
approximately 40 miles southwest of Brownsville, Texas.

58
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,260
Radar tracked at approximately 500 miles to a point near the town of Coyame in the state

59
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,060
of Chihuahua not far from the U.S. border.

60
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,260
There, the object suddenly disappeared from the radar screens.

61
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,340
During the flight over Mexican airspace, the object leveled off at 45,000 feet, then descended

62
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,860
to 20,000 feet.

63
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,080
The descent was in level steps, not a smooth curve or straight line, and each level was

64
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,140
maintained for approximately 5 minutes.

65
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,780
The object was tracked by two different military radar installations.

66
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,660
It would have been within range of Brownsville civilian radar, but it is assumed that no

67
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,260
civilian radar detected the object due to a lack of any such reports.

68
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,900
The point of disappearance from radar screens was over a barren and sparsely populated area

69
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,340
of northern Mexico.

70
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,540
At first, it was assumed that the object had descended below the radar's horizon, and

71
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,580
a watch was kept for any reemergence of the object.

72
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,860
None occurred.

73
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,940
At first, it was assumed that the object might be a meteor because of the high speed and

74
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,980
descending flight path, but meteors normally travel at higher speeds and descend in a smooth

75
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:43,300
arc, not in steps, and meteors do not normally make a 35-degree change in course.

76
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,500
Shortly after detection, an air defense alert was called.

77
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,180
However, before any form of interception could be scrambled, the object turned to a course

78
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,280
that would not immediately take it over U.S. territory.

79
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,880
The alert was called off within 20 minutes after the object's disappearance from the

80
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,140
radar screen.

81
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,660
Fifty-two minutes after the disappearance, civilian radio traffic indicated that a civilian

82
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,860
aircraft had gone down in that area, but it was clear that the missing aircraft had

83
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,020
departed El Paso International with the destination of Mexico City and could not, therefore, have

84
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,500
been tracked over the Gulf of Mexico.

85
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,140
It was noted, however, that they both disappeared in the same area at the same time.

86
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,140
Within daylight the next day, Mexican authorities began a search for the missing plane.

87
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,040
Approximately 1035 hours, there came a radio report that records from the missing plane

88
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,580
had been spotted from the air.

89
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,780
Just immediately came a report of a second plane on the ground a few miles from the first.

90
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,340
After a few minutes, an additional report stated the second plane was circular-shaped

91
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,300
and apparently in one piece, although damaged.

92
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,860
A few minutes after that, the Mexican military clamped a radio silence on all search efforts.

93
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,980
The radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA.

94
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,820
Possibly as many as two additional government agencies also received reports, but such has

95
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,260
not been confirmed as of this date.

96
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,800
The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team.

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,820
The speed with which this team and equipment was assembled suggests that this was either

98
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,140
a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to this event.

99
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,960
In the meantime, requests were initiated at the highest levels between the United States

100
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,340
and Mexican government that the U.S. recovery team be allowed onto Mexican territory to

101
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,640
quote-unquote assist.

102
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,780
These reports were met with professional ignorance and a flat refusal of any cooperation.

103
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,720
By 2100 hours, 26 August 74, the recovery team had assembled and been staged at Fort

104
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,280
Bliss.

105
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,260
Several helicopters were flown in from some unknown source and assembled in a secured

106
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,680
area.

107
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,300
These helicopters were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings.

108
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,660
Eyewitness indicates that there were three smaller craft, very probably UH-1 Hueys from

109
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,100
the description.

110
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,140
There was also a larger helicopter, possibly a sea stallion.

111
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,060
Personnel from this team remained with their craft and had no contact with other Fort

112
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,820
Bliss personnel.

113
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,380
Satellite and reconnaissance aircraft overflight that day indicated that both the crashed disk

114
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,540
and civilian aircraft had been removed from the crash sites and loaded onto flatbed trucks.

115
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,220
Later flights confirmed the convoy had departed the area, heading south.

116
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,340
At that point, the CIA had to make a choice, either to allow this unknown aircraft to stay

117
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,080
in the hands of the Mexican government or to launch the recovery team, supplemented

118
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,020
by any required military support to take the craft.

119
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,020
There occurred, however, an event that took the choice out of their hands.

120
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,820
High altitude overflights indicated that the convoy had stopped before reaching any inhabited

121
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,140
areas or major roads.

122
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,640
Recon showed no activity and radio contact between the Mexican recovery team and its

123
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,580
headquarters had ceased.

124
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,820
At low altitude, high speed overflight was ordered.

125
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,700
The photos returned by that aircraft showed all trucks and jeeps stopped, some with doors

126
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,680
open and two human bodies laying on the ground beside the two vehicles.

127
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,020
The decision was immediately made to launch the recovery team, but the actual launching

128
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,940
was held up for the arrival of additional equipment and two additional personnel.

129
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,980
It was not until 1438 hours that the helicopters departed Fort Bliss.

130
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,740
The four helicopters followed the border down to Bracido, then turned and entered Mexican

131
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,340
airspace north of Candelaria.

132
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,140
They were over the convoy site at 1653 hours.

133
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,380
All convoy personnel were dead, most within the trucks.

134
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,260
Some recovery team members dressed in bioprotection suits reconfigured the straps holding the

135
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,420
object onto the flatbed truck, then attached them to a cargo cable from the Sea Stallion.

136
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,780
By 1714 hours, the recovered object was on its way to U.S. territory.

137
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,040
Before leaving the convoy site, members of the recovery team gathered together the Mexican

138
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,660
vehicle and bodies, then destroyed all with high explosives.

139
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,740
This included the pieces of the civilian light plane which had been involved in the mid-air

140
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,940
collision.

141
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,360
At 1746 hours, the Hueys departed.

142
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,580
The Hueys caught up with the Sea Stallion as it re-entered U.S. airspace.

143
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,940
The recovery team then proceeded to a point in the Davis Mountains, approximately 25 miles

144
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,660
northeast of Valentine.

145
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,540
There, they landed and waited until 0225 hours the next morning.

146
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,900
At that time, they resumed the flight and rendezvoused with the small convoy on the

147
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,700
road besides Van Horn and Kent.

148
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,380
The recovered disc was transferred to a truck large enough to handle it and capable of being

149
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,380
sealed totally.

150
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,900
Some of the personnel from the Hueys transferred to the convoy.

151
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,060
All helicopters then returned to their original bases for decontamination procedures.

152
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,180
The convoy continued non-stop, using back roads and smaller highways and staying away

153
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,620
from cities.

154
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,660
The destination of the convoy reportedly was Atlanta, Georgia.

155
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,780
Here the hard evidence thins out.

156
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,780
One unconfirmed report says the disc was eventually transferred to Wright-Patterson Air Force

157
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Base.

158
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,140
Another says that the disc was either transferred after that to another unnamed base or was

159
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,060
taken directly to this unknown base directly from Atlanta.

160
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,820
The best description of this disc was that it was 16 feet, 5 inches in diameter, convex

161
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:29,540
on both upper and lower surfaces to the same degree, possessing no visible doors or windows.

162
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,360
The thickness was slightly less than 5 feet.

163
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,660
The color was silver, much like polished steel.

164
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,560
There were no visible lights nor any propulsion means.

165
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,220
There were no markings.

166
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,320
There were two areas of the rim that showed damage.

167
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,960
One showing in a regular hole approximately 12 inches in diameter with indented metal

168
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,240
around it.

169
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,220
The other damage was described as a quote-unquote dent, about 2 feet wide.

170
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,440
The weight of the object was estimated as approximately 1,500 pounds.

171
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,320
Based on the effect of the weight on the carrying helicopter and those who transferred it to

172
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,800
the truck, there was no indication in the document available as to whether anything

173
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,080
else was visible in the quote-unquote hole.

174
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,800
It seemed likely that the damage with the hole was caused by the collision with the

175
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,640
civilian craft.

176
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,080
That collision occurred while the object was traveling at approximately 1,700 knots or

177
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,260
1,955 miles per hour.

178
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,440
Even ignoring the speed of the civilian craft, the impact would have been considerable at

179
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,820
that speed.

180
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,720
This is in agreement with the description of the civilian aircraft as being quote,

181
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,800
almost totally destroyed, end quote.

182
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,840
What was being taken from the crash site was pieces of the civilian craft.

183
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,000
The second damage may have resulted when the object impacted with the ground.

184
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,520
The speed in that case should have been considerably less than that of the first impact.

185
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,240
No mention is made of the occupants of the civilian craft.

186
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,200
It is not known if any body or bodies were discovered.

187
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,380
Considering the destruction of the civilian light aircraft in midair, bodies may well

188
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,720
have not come down near the larger pieces.

189
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,000
Unfortunately, what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is not known.

190
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,720
Speculation ranges from a chemical released from the disk as a result of the damage to

191
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,180
a microbiological agent.

192
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,660
There are no indications of death or illness by any of the recovery team.

193
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,640
It would not have been illogical for the recovery team to have taken one of the bodies back

194
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,600
with them for analysis, but there is no indication of that happening.

195
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,960
Perhaps they did not have adequate means of transporting what may have been a biologically

196
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,880
contaminated body.

197
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,920
Inquiries to the FAA reveal no documents concerning the civilian aircraft crash, probably because

198
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,840
it does not involve a U.S. aircraft, nor did it occur over U.S. airspace.

199
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,640
It should be noted that the above facts do not tell the complete story.

200
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,320
Nothing is known of the analysis of the craft nor its contents.

201
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,800
Nothing is known about the deaths associated with the foreign recovery team, nor is it

202
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,040
known if this craft was manned or not.

203
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,120
Other questions also remain, such as why would a recovered disk be taken to Atlanta, and

204
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,760
where did the disk come from?

205
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,240
It was first detected approximately 200 miles from U.S. territory, yet U.S. air defenses

206
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,020
extend to a much greater distance than that.

207
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,920
If the object descended into the atmosphere, perhaps NORAD's space tracking has some record

208
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,480
of the object.

209
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Alternate possibility is that it entered the Gulf of Mexico under radar limits, then quote

210
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,480
unquote jumped up to 75,000 feet.

211
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,280
Considering prior behavior exhibited by disks of this size, it is probable that the entry

212
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,560
was from orbital altitude.

213
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,360
The facts that are known have been gathered from two eyewitness accounts, documentation

214
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,140
illegally copied and a partially destroyed document.

215
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,320
This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead.

216
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,200
Only in February of this year did the notes and documents come into the hands of our group.

217
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:06,160
End of document

218
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,320
Very little, and I mean very little, is known about the origins of this mysterious Dinev

219
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
report.

220
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,640
As mentioned above, the document first appeared on early message boards in 1992 before being

221
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,440
anonymously mailed to researchers such as Elaine Douglas and Nick Redfern.

222
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,080
Immediately, copies made their way into the hands of Leonard Stringfield in his sublime

223
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,240
crash retrieval status report stating quote,

224
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,920
Reviewing the text of the report initial JS which follows, I find that it is authoritatively

225
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,840
written using correct military terminology and of note and unlike a hoax, draws the line

226
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,960
between so-called hard evidence and that which is speculative, end quote.

227
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,640
What is crucial to remember here is Stringfield had heard rumors of this case around a decade

228
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,600
prior, and let's note in Stringfield's own words, when presenting his initial retrievals

229
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,360
of the third kind at MUFON in 1978, he was quote unquote, informed circuitously by the

230
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,880
CIA several days in advance.

231
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,240
It would be inadvisable for him to discuss crash information in Mexico or West Germany.

232
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,880
So the author of this piece, JS, seems to have intimate knowledge gathered by primary

233
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,600
sources about the incident and desired the release of evidence to interested parties,

234
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,580
i.e. the Dinev team.

235
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,280
Is JS an acronym or a name?

236
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,480
While Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte hypothesized JS as an acronym for a department within the

237
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,760
US government such as Joint Staff or Joint Services, perhaps the Dinev team was a name

238
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,200
for an internal USG investigation group during the quote unquote, dark ages of UAP as I like

239
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,520
to call them.

240
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,680
We know there is a massive gap of any official UAP programs within USG from the ending of

241
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:55,080
Blue Book in 1969 to the creation of OSAP slash ATIP in 2007, and from the words of

242
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,440
Lou Elizondo, we do know unknown UAP programs were operating in the 1980s.

243
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,400
Or with recent revelations of the UAP task force utilizing top secret online forums to

244
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,320
discuss UAP, maybe the Dinev team was a similar group of intelligence community professionals

245
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,240
who used the early internet message boards to discuss obfuscated data on crash retrieval

246
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,500
cases.

247
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,820
What is also interesting to note is the quote file UFO 3263 end quote indicating the Koyame

248
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,820
report is one of many studied by Dinev and JS.

249
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,780
Whether JS is an individual or group with intimate knowledge into the Koyome incident,

250
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:39,420
it seems the author does not have a direct line of information from the named CIA, NORAD,

251
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,640
or other agencies we kind of guess such as the NRO or NGA.

252
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,640
The facts were quote, gathered from two eyewitness accounts, documentation illegally copied and

253
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,800
a partially destroyed document.

254
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,480
This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead.

255
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,740
Only in February of this year, 1992, did the notes and documents come into the hands of

256
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,280
our group end quote.

257
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,600
JS even states multiple times he or they are unaware of the analysis of the craft, the

258
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,880
craft's ultimate destination, and other details such as the inclusion of bodies.

259
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,640
Dinev itself is a highly luminous blue star originated in the constellation Cygnus, one

260
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,760
of the eldest constellations recognized by early civilizations.

261
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,880
The star is a supergiant with luminosity equal to 60,000 souls or earth's suns.

262
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,400
The Milky Way's Great Rift, a critical junction in the galaxy where the Milky Way splits into

263
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,360
two long sides, begins near Dinev into Cygnus.

264
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,860
This particular area held special significance to ancient stargazers and of particular note,

265
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,940
southern Mexico shamans who referred to the rift as Zibalba B, the birth of all life.

266
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,700
The Dinev report describes an extremely unlikely chance of a collision between a UFO with a

267
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,180
civilian light plane, which is one of the most key aspects to this case.

268
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,780
According to the report, civilian air traffic had indicated the crash of a civilian aircraft

269
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,580
along the route of El Paso, Texas to Mexico City.

270
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,740
The Dinev team made inquiries into the FAA to identify the airport, but received no documents

271
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,540
concluding the plane was of Mexican origin.

272
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,040
And unfortunately, examining U.S. 1974 aircraft crashes such as aircraft accident reports

273
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,580
from Embry-Riddle University yields no results either.

274
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:35,060
Aviation Safety Network additionally lists no crashes in the year of 1974 occurring in Mexico.

275
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:40,420
Many researchers such as Torres and Uriarte believe the craft to have been a Cessna 180

276
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:47,420
This is due to the last detection of the UFO by U.S. Air Defense Radar at 20,000 feet or under.

277
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:53,460
Since this aircraft has a service ceiling of 17,700 feet, the authors of Mexico's Roswell

278
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,460
guess the craft to be a perfect fit for a covert, low-altitude, and slow-speed craft.

279
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,500
So if this case is real, that likely leaves us with a craft performing illegal operations

280
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,580
in a Cessna 180 such as drug smuggling operations.

281
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:14,580
In 1974, anti-drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico was an extremely pertinent issue.

282
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,660
Let's reference this discussion between U.S. President Gerald R. Ford and Mexican president

283
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:25,620
that occurred on October 21, 1974, just two months after our crash story.

284
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,580
The Mexican president states, quote,

285
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:35,620
Along the 3,000-km border, it is very easy for small planes to take off and land in small private ranches.

286
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,220
According to Torres and Uriarte's follow-up book to Mexico's Roswell the Coyame Incident,

287
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:46,940
the two mention the August 1974 death of a 50-year-old Mexican pilot Enrique Riviera Gutierrez,

288
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,140
as reported in El Fronterizo of Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua.

289
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,500
I've personally been unable to track this paper, but the authors discuss that the man died

290
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:03,020
on August 30, 1974, from horrific injuries sustained in a plane crash on an unknown date prior to the article.

291
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,660
The authors argue this could possibly be the pilot mentioned in the Deneb report,

292
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:14,020
but I find that highly unlikely, due to the collision of a UFO and private plane at thousands of feet altitude.

293
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,580
Besides some alleged aircraft parts discovered in the crash region by Torres and Uriarte,

294
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,420
we really have nothing to work with here in terms of tracking down this plane.

295
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,420
The Deneb reports makes numerous mention to the CIA, quote,

296
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,140
The radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA.

297
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,860
Possibly as many as two additional government agencies also received reports,

298
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,580
but such has not been confirmed as of this date.

299
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,780
The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team.

300
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:51,820
The speed with which this team and its equipment was assembled suggests that it was either a well-rehearsed exercise

301
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,060
or one that had been performed prior to this event, end quote.

302
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,660
I am once again drawn to this article by the incredible Christopher Sharpe,

303
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:05,900
which accuses the CIA's Office of Global Access of playing a central role in UFO crash retrieval since 2003.

304
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:13,340
The article states the OGA coordinates with Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC, amongst others to collect craft.

305
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,780
The implication of the CIA in the Deneb report leads us to suspect departments within the CIA

306
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,820
have engaged in crash retrievals far before the OGA's creation in 2003.

307
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:30,180
And unfortunately, we can find CIA FOIA requests such as F-2007-00637,

308
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:37,860
alleged midair collisions near Coyame, Mexico on 8-25 or 26-1974, with no results.

309
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,420
However, we still do have some really interesting clues to pursue.

310
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,020
The role of the OGA in UFO crash retrievals as described by Sharpe's anonymous source

311
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,620
closely resembles the role of the CIA in the Deneb report.

312
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,700
According to Sharpe's source, quote,

313
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,420
They are basically a facilitator for people to get in and out of countries.

314
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,100
They are very clever at being able to get anywhere in the world they want to, end quote.

315
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,660
And an additional source of Sharpe stated, quote,

316
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,860
The task at hand is simply to get into the custody and protect the secrecy of it.

317
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,140
The actual physical retrieval is done by the military,

318
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,980
but it's not kept under military control because they have to keep too many records.

319
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,180
So they start moving it out fairly quickly into private hands, end quote.

320
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,540
In the Deneb report, the CIA gathered intelligence on the UFO

321
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:30,580
and assembled a recovery team who we will later learn may have all been retired U.S. armed forces.

322
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,460
The UFO was then taken covertly by an unknown convoy to Atlanta, Georgia where,

323
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,660
by the way, we can find a Lockheed Martin complex located in Air Force Plant 6,

324
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,900
less than 30 miles outside of Atlanta.

325
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,620
In Lockheed's own words, this location offers, quote,

326
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,860
Skunk Works work in advanced development, end quote.

327
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,940
And while Lockheed Martin was founded in 1995,

328
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,860
we can clearly see one of its precursors, the Lockheed Company,

329
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,660
engaged in C-130 work in Marietta, Georgia since the 1950s.

330
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,940
And what's even stranger here is the existence of the Lockheed Martin Georgia Nuclear Aircraft Laboratory

331
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:12,060
known as AFP number 67, which served as Lockheed's lab for investigating the feasibility of nuclear aircraft.

332
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,980
The site was closed in 1971 and acquired by the city of Atlanta,

333
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,740
but this is still a very interesting connection.

334
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,700
Two sources in the Daily Mail told Sharp, alongside JSOC,

335
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,820
nuclear weapons experts such as the Nuclear Emergency Support Team, or NEST, perform retrieval operations.

336
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,860
With this in mind, the Koyame case reminds me of another case we covered a lot earlier,

337
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,620
Jonathan Weygandt.

338
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,940
Let's remember the details of this testimony.

339
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:46,420
What is confirmable here is the CIA's involvement in 1997's Operation Laser Strike in Peru to engage counter-narcotics.

340
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:52,460
According to Weygandt, the personnel he encountered after observing a crashed UAP in the jungles of Peru

341
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,700
approached him from a nearby landed CH-47 twin-rotor copter.

342
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,700
The men's uniforms ranged from black fatigues, DOE rain jackets, and hazmat suits.

343
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,780
In this video, I went into why NEST were likely candidates for the team Weygandt encountered.

344
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,660
A key relation to Koyame here is the presence of hazmat suits

345
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:19,180
and the adverse mental effects Weygandt claimed to have suffered, such as intense and unexplainable fear when close to the craft.

346
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,900
According to the report, this rapid-reaction team was flown from their staging area in Fort Bliss, Texas

347
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,580
to the crash site from four helicopters,

348
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:34,140
guessed by JS to be UH-1 Hueys and one larger helicopter like a CH-53 Super Stallion.

349
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,580
The helicopters were flown in from an unknown location and assembled in a secure area.

350
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:45,620
Crucial to note, JS states these craft were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings,

351
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,300
signifying the vehicles may have been utilized specifically for clandestine operations.

352
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,740
Fort Bliss may sound familiar to some, and in fact may be crucial to research moving forward.

353
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,620
Fort Bliss is mentioned by Colonel Philip J. Corso in his book, The Day After Roswell.

354
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,380
According to Corso, debris and bodies from the 1947 Roswell crash were shipped to Fort Bliss, Texas.

355
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,060
There aren't many other connections to Fort Bliss and UAP besides a handful of bluebook sighting,

356
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,220
but this really could be some interesting research going forward.

357
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,540
And a quick side note, the team was allegedly given intelligence by the CIA,

358
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,660
gathered from satellite and reconnaissance aircraft overflight of the disk and plane collision.

359
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:31,100
Intelligence via plane may have come from the El Paso Intelligence Center, known as EPIC,

360
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:38,100
established at Fort Bliss in 1974, possibly an EP3E established in 1972,

361
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,180
and the satellite imagery, as discussed by Noah Torres,

362
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,660
likely came from the fleet of keyhole spy satellites put into orbit around 1971.

363
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,820
These satellites were primarily operated by the NRO.

364
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,660
Perhaps this is one instance of highly classified, high-res satellite imagery of crashed UAP,

365
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,420
David Grush has referred to.

366
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,940
Curious to me here is how the DNAP report states one surveillance showed the Mexican convoy

367
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,660
had stopped an aerial photography show two soldiers laying motionless on the ground.

368
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,020
The recovery team's departure was delayed for the arrival of additional equipment,

369
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:15,340
presumably hazard protection and explosives, and two additional personnel.

370
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,860
Who were these additional personnel and were they possibly munitions experts

371
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,860
sent to scrub contaminated crash sites?

372
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,340
Upon securing the craft, the team loaded the vehicle onto a large truck

373
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,620
and proceeded to original base for decontamination.

374
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,020
But before leaving the site, the DNAP report states the Mexican vehicles, bodies,

375
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,460
and civilian light plane were all destroyed with high explosives.

376
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,140
This haste to destroy the site, delayed departure for additional crew,

377
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,580
and refusal to bring Mexican bodies back for analysis

378
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,460
lead to me to believe the American recovery team were possibly aware of the contamination

379
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,660
that killed the soldiers beforehand and had highly trained explosive experts to sanitize the site.

380
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:59,540
Noah Torres wonders if the explosive used was an MK54 SADM suitcase nuke.

381
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,260
Carrying the smallest yield of 10 tons, such an explosive would effectively sterilize the site

382
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,740
while keeping residual effects and damage to local population almost null.

383
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,820
After all, in his 2000 paper,

384
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:16,300
Radiation Neutralization of Stored Biological Warfare Agents with Low-Yield Nuclear Warheads,

385
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,300
Hans Kruger argues fissile debris and fireballs can actually destroy biological agents.

386
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,660
Initially, when reading the DNAP report, and still partly to today,

387
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,540
I wonder if the US recovery team had killed the Mexican soldiers.

388
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:39,660
JS and DNAP do not have the full picture here yet seem to have some understanding what happened to the men.

389
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,780
Unfortunately, what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is not known.

390
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,180
Speculation ranges from a chemical release from the disk as a result of the damage

391
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,780
to a microbiological agent.

392
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,980
There still remains the possibility that the US team did in fact kill the soldiers

393
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,140
in a hasty decision to prevent them from returning to base with UAP debris,

394
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,580
and this does warrant further investigation.

395
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,820
I can't help but think back to David Grush,

396
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,340
who mentioned numerous times crimes had been committed to maintain UAP secrecy.

397
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,980
So, if we adhere to DNAP,

398
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:15,740
some contaminant from the downed saucer led to the deaths of all soldiers on the Mexican recovery team.

399
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,420
Possibly this was due to handling of bodies,

400
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,340
reminding me of the police officer who allegedly died after touching a non-human intelligence bean

401
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,300
in the Varginha, Brazil case.

402
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,700
But the report makes specific mention it is unaware if the disk was manned or not.

403
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,060
Possibly the contaminant leaked from the, quote,

404
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:37,100
a regular hole approximately 12 inches in diameter with indented metal around it, end quote,

405
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,220
observed on the crashed craft.

406
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:44,060
Fantastic enough, we do have some absolutely fascinating references here.

407
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:49,540
Nestled within the MJ-12 first annual report lies a passage within Section F,

408
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,380
Government Policy of Control and Denial.

409
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,780
Here the Majestic 12 panel cites their concern regarding several SED,

410
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,900
Sandy and National Labs personnel,

411
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,380
who came in contact with UFO debris and bodies.

412
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,820
One technician collapsed while attempting removal of a body.

413
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,900
One went into a coma for four hours when attempting to place an NHI body in a bag.

414
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,340
All four technicians who suffered effects were rushed to Los Alamos,

415
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,020
but all four died of seizures and profuse bleeding.

416
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,660
The report states upon inconclusive autopsies,

417
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,420
it appeared all four suffered from some form of toxin or highly contagious disease.

418
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,540
Extremely disturbing here is Point 13, which states, quote,

419
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,140
in the opinion of the Senior Atomic Energy Medical Advisor,

420
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,060
current medical equipment and supplies are wholly inadequate

421
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,500
in dealing with a large-scale outbreak of the alien virus, end quote.

422
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,660
But that's not all.

423
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,660
I recently spoke about the U.S. Army's brief Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit,

424
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,100
denied to exist but proven through FOIA requests

425
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,500
and only remembered by the Army through institutional memory.

426
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,540
This unit was an Army in-house project and an interest item

427
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,420
for an unnamed Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence.

428
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,860
Well, within Ryan S. Wood's Majestic 12 files,

429
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,340
we can find an IPU summary report.

430
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,820
This document discusses that all military and civilian personnel

431
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,460
dealing with recovery operations

432
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,780
operated on strictly need-to-know intelligence.

433
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,620
Besides mention of the Kirtland crew performing functions very well,

434
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,660
the report discusses severe nervous breakdowns and suicides by MPs.

435
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,660
The report then goes on to state,

436
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,900
ground personnel from Sandia experienced some form of contamination

437
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,020
resulting in the deaths of three technicians.

438
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,620
So as far back as the 1940s, according to the Majestic documents,

439
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,820
technicians and other personnel have actually died

440
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,340
from biological or toxic effects from craft and bodies.

441
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,540
One of the most fascinating and possibly fruitful aspects of this investigation

442
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,220
comes from the open-sourced encyclopedia site Wikipedia.

443
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,980
Since 2008, Wikipedia featured a brief report on the Koyama UFO crash

444
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,540
referencing the Deneb report, a UFO casebook article, link in the description,

445
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,580
and one of our references, Mexico's Roswell by Torres and Uriarte.

446
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,300
The entry featured nothing new or noteworthy,

447
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,260
and that remained the case until September of 2012

448
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,980
when user Mercy11 radically altered the article,

449
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:18,380
adding names and intriguing details for the US recovery team and crash in general.

450
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,860
At the US military radar airbase, four Huey helicopters were readied up

451
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,940
as well as a 15-man recovery team headed to Koyama, Mexico.

452
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,980
The American group included Captain Lawrence Murley,

453
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,660
Lieutenant Randall Bishop, Lieutenant Eduardo Ramirez,

454
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,020
Lieutenant Benjamin Rhodes, Sergeant Terrence Miles,

455
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,820
and Lieutenant Jerome Smith, all retired US Armed Forces personnel.

456
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,940
The group entered Mexico surreptitiously after intercepting

457
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,020
a Mexican radio communication giving away the location of the crash site.

458
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,100
Besides the names listed, which we will explore shortly,

459
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Mercy11 added two spectacular pieces of information.

460
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,620
The recovery team included 15 members and all were retired US Armed Forces personnel.

461
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,860
This suggests the recovery team was not involving active military,

462
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:12,140
but some experienced, assembled, possibly private industry-seasoned operators

463
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,420
adjacent to US military and the intelligence community.

464
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,900
But Mercy11's additions don't stop here.

465
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,820
The user seemingly adds names for all four deceased Mexican soldiers.

466
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,380
A short distance from the wreckage was also an olive green jeep

467
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,180
belonging to the Mexican military and containing the bodies of four Mexican soldiers in it.

468
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,260
The soldiers were Captain Rogelio Arguelles Gonzalez,

469
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,260
Sergeant Teofilo Margarito Puebla, Corporal Jose Trinidad Naraz,

470
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,340
and Corporal Ricardo Velasquez.

471
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,500
Their bodies displayed signs of death by asphyxiation, end quote.

472
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,580
And here is where the story gets strange.

473
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,780
The author of Mexico's Roswell attempted to reach out to Mercy

474
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,580
to discover where the user sourced this information.

475
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,740
Especially due to the fact existing citation for this section on a history

476
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,020
and events cited the UFO casebook article mentioned above

477
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,220
in a documentary titled UFO Hunters Unexplained Mexico's Roswell the Koyame Crash.

478
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,660
Neither of which featured any of this information.

479
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,700
Yuri Arte and Torres received a response from Mercy11

480
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,620
in regards to where he found this information,

481
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,700
but Mercy doubled down linking once again to this UFO Hunters episode.

482
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,140
Upon following up, Mercy11 stated, quote,

483
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,660
I suspect what happened is that I saw the information at some other site,

484
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:31,020
which I had on my screen at the moment, but in another window,

485
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,380
which I failed to attribute and record properly, end quote.

486
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,980
But again, does not link to this information which I nor any other researcher can find.

487
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,260
Soon after these 2013 correspondences, we find the entire page for the incident

488
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,940
deleted in 2014 by admin Scotty Wong, who shortly after retired his account.

489
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,980
The entirety of this Wikipedia page's existence is incredibly suspicious,

490
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,700
but let's try to analyze the data given.

491
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,220
We are given a list of American names and to be honest, very little to work with.

492
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,460
I can find almost nothing about Captain Florence Murley.

493
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,260
Discovering only one Utah-based individual

494
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,780
who left for the armed forces near the tail end of World War II,

495
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,260
no rank or detail of service are given.

496
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,420
Similar data or lack thereof is available for Lieutenant Randall Bishop.

497
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,900
We can find an Indiana man who lived from 1932 to 2020.

498
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,060
Bishop was a Pershing Rifles member while attending the University of Kentucky.

499
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,620
He left University to join the US Air Force,

500
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,940
where he served in the Korean War as a war zone air traffic controller.

501
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,740
After his service, Bishop moved to Indiana to be a teacher,

502
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,580
but let's take a second to remember the significance the infographics whistleblower

503
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,260
put on the Korean War in the program, as well as the significance of this general area of Indiana.

504
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:54,060
Lieutenant Benjamin Rhodes has almost zero footprint outside of a famous US Civil War soldier.

505
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,660
The only somewhat modern-day reference I can find to a Benjamin Rhodes

506
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,180
exists within a 1989 issue of American Legion.

507
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:06,220
One Mr. Rhodes out of Delafield, Wisconsin served as a post commander for the Legion.

508
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,660
However, it is unknown whether he was armed forces or not.

509
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:16,220
We can find an active-duty reference for one Terrence Miles at the time of April 21, 1993,

510
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,540
in this edition of the Guantanamo Bay Gazette.

511
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,380
Senior Chief Petty Officer Terrence Miles is mentioned here.

512
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,260
Of course, this breaks Mercy 11's claims that all operators were retired US armed forces.

513
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,660
However, is it possible the sergeant re-enlisted thus furthering his rank?

514
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,060
Zero records are available for one Jerome Smith,

515
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:39,020
but if this was a misprint and we are looking at Lieutenant Jerome Smith, we can find a record.

516
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:44,460
Deceased in 2006, Lieutenant Colonel Jerome Smith served in the US Army and was a World War II

517
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,820
veteran. Smith transferred branches of service in 1970 to US Public Health Service,

518
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,740
where he achieved the rank of commander before retiring in 1985.

519
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:58,780
We can find a private first class Eduardo Ramirez who served in World War II and earned

520
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,420
a Distinguished Service Cross for bravery in destroying German machine gun nests with

521
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:09,500
explosives and incendiaries. There is no record I can find of any promotion to Lieutenant.

522
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,420
And it's key to note, some of these names could be legitimate, all could be legit,

523
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,820
or all made up nonsense from Mercy 11, we just don't know at this time with all

524
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,780
of our source references. But I am working with prestigious author Ryan S. Wood to

525
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,260
really learn how to track down actual service records of previous soldiers who have served,

526
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,340
so I may have some update on this in the future.

527
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,500
There is only one real lead of the Mexico soldier's demise and this comes from Mexican

528
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,020
UFO researcher Alfonso Salazar. I am unable to locate this article, but Salazar found a

529
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:45,020
newspaper story from El Geraldo de Chihuahua, dated October 27th, 1974,

530
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,980
that detailed the death of a group of Mexican soldiers in the crash of a quote-unquote military

531
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,620
transport.

532
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,580
With Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte's fieldwork on this case, such as finding a piece of airplane

533
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,220
debris near the supposed crash site, we do have some witness testimony to analyze,

534
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,700
regardless of this crash site being an estimated 60 miles from the nearest town.

535
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,780
One such group of witnesses approached Torres in 2012 at a festival in Presidio, Texas.

536
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,940
School teacher Johnny Chambers and her 10-year-old son at the time

537
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,980
remembered seeing a strange fireball, a quote,

538
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,540
big explosion in the sky, end quote, on the Mexican side of the border near the

539
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,700
Coyame incident. The two had thought a plane had crashed in the mountain.

540
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,580
When interviewed by Torres, John Chambers stated,

541
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,460
Within a day of the fireball, several residents observed a group of military helicopters

542
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,980
traveling back into the U.S. from the Mexican side, including a large twin rotor helicopter.

543
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,980
And I do think it's important to state these witnesses did appear in 2012,

544
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,900
five years after Torres and Uriarte's initial reporting on the case.

545
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,020
These could be false witnesses, but we really have no way to prove.

546
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,660
Myriad other witnesses have contacted Torres, such as Melissa P. from Facebook,

547
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,980
full name withheld by Torres, who stated, quote,

548
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,660
But without names or further evidence, there really isn't much to explore here.

549
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,380
And this is kind of the case for many of the witnesses Torres

550
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,820
met along his field investigation of the Coyame site.

551
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,940
Many people told of strange fireballs, strange events that occurred around August of 1974,

552
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,580
but we really don't have too much to work off of.

553
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,020
In a frustrating recent event, we can look to Jesus Alberto,

554
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,620
Mexican government official who sets up legislation and hearings.

555
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:42,140
Alberto is currently tasked with UFO disclosure and is intimately tied to the Nazca mummies.

556
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:47,580
On March 16th of 2024, J. Alberto posted a now-deleted tweet translated to,

557
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,660
I have the vid at your time. It's a shit from another world.

558
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:56,700
Some context around this tweet showed it to be referencing the 1974 Coyame incident.

559
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,700
I asked J. Alberto if he was indeed referencing the Coyame incident,

560
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,260
and if so, would he share the video with me?

561
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,900
The only response I got was a thumbs up about the video referencing the crash.

562
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,580
In follow-up messages, I inquired how I might get my hands on the video,

563
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,980
or if Alberto had any witnesses, military or civilian I could speak to,

564
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,900
or any military documents on the case he might be able to share with me.

565
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,300
All requests were met with no response.

566
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,420
I'm hoping this video can put some pressure on him

567
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,140
to indeed release whatever video he is referring to.

568
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:34,300
What's up guys, thank you so much for watching and joining me as we did this deep dive into the

569
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:43,260
1974 Coyame UFO crash. If you're anything like me, this story is fascinating and super perplexing

570
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,860
with so many interesting details that lead into ufology at large. But at the same time,

571
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,100
we're left with very little documentation and resources to investigate this further.

572
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,860
Part of the purpose of this video was to lay out the facts as we know of this case,

573
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:05,260
the Dineb report, the alterations to the Wikipedia page, the eyewitnesses, some aspects of the

574
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,460
American recovery team and the CIA's involvement in other retrieval operations, allegedly,

575
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,700
according to Chris Sharpe. Put that all out there and see where this investigation can go.

576
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,900
I know when this video goes live, I will be tweeting this video at Jesus Alberto,

577
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,500
really putting some pressure and asking him to release this video.

578
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,700
This case is so interesting, whatever video this is, whether it's reconnaissance aircraft

579
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:35,100
overflight or any internal Mexican government documents on this case, any sort of video evidence,

580
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:40,780
even if it is a truck convoy of Mexican soldiers entering up north from Coyame around the same

581
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,260
date could prove paramount in adding to this case. I know I said it in the video, but I'm also

582
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,380
trying to learn from Ryan S. Wood, who I met by the way, which was awesome, I'll tell you guys

583
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,820
all about that more, but in how to access actual service records and personnel archives to learn

584
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:01,100
more about the names listed on the Wikipedia site. And isn't that interesting? Those names added,

585
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:05,020
you know, I have scoured the internet, I've gone through every avenue I can trying to find any

586
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:10,620
mention of those names. And when all these names were uploaded together, and from what reference

587
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:18,700
Mercy 11 was citing here. Ryan S. Wood is also in contact with Noah Torres and Ruben Uriarte. So

588
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,260
I will be trying to talk to these authors to learn more and actually talk to them. Hey,

589
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:28,060
did you guys follow up with Mercy? I know Mercy shut them down, trying to actually get to know

590
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:33,180
him and so forth. But, you know, let's see what they have uncovered, because that document and

591
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:39,500
their connection with Mercy occurred back in 2011. So who knows what they have uncovered since.

592
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,660
What do you guys think of the case? Are there any details I am missing? I still like to play

593
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:51,100
with the fact the US recovery team actually killed the operators, the Mexican recovery team. I know

594
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,900
that the Deneb report states that there was likely the chemical or biological agent that killed these

595
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,940
guys. And we also have the IPU and majestic documents to kind of reference there. And isn't

596
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,420
that interesting? The Sandia lab technicians, I know the MJ 12 likes to reference Sandia at

597
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:10,540
Kirtland Air Force Base quite a bit. As we saw in the Eisenhower briefing document in the 1950s

598
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:19,500
slash 1955 El Indio slash Del Rio crash retrieval cases, which are pretty interesting. But you know,

599
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:25,660
the idea of being contaminated by craft and suffering ill effects is something I'd like

600
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:30,540
to explore further. Remembering the whistleblower, the infographics whistleblower video, this

601
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:37,020
whistleblower stated one of the first things that people do upon receiving a downed craft is send in

602
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:43,020
a team to analyze for any toxicity or any hazardous chemicals surrounding the craft. Stands to reason

603
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,340
this Mexican recovery team, if they had never recovered a craft, went in with soldiers with

604
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:53,260
no additional protective gear and thus died from exposure. But what if the American recovery team

605
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,060
did kill these soldiers? But let me know what you guys think about the involvement of the American

606
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:03,020
recovery team and the case at large. I'm willing to bet a lot of you guys haven't really heard of

607
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:09,340
this case or just kind of heard it in passing a little bit. I can't exactly remember the first

608
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,460
time I ever heard of this case, but I think it was when the UAP caucus listed a list of crash

609
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:20,380
retrieval events to kind of pay attention to and to bring before Congress. And I think either from

610
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,860
there or from an offshoot of there, I heard of this case and quickly afterwards I dove into it

611
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:31,740
and found it so fascinating, especially just some of these details like a craft and a small passenger

612
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:37,980
plane colliding. I know this story just requires a couple pieces of evidence to help verify further.

613
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:43,820
That's why it's so frustrating as well as diving into the origins of the Deneb report. Elaine Douglas,

614
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:48,860
the researcher I spoke about who actually received the Deneb report, she passed away in 2014. She had

615
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:55,020
a website. It was www.elainedouglas.com that actually had documents. I think it had a scan

616
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,900
of the original Deneb report. When she passed, apparently her family was going to maintain

617
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:07,100
her website, but no, the website is available in the web archive. I will link it in the video

618
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,820
description, but if you try and go to the links to the Koyame incident, those are all missing. So

619
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:16,940
that's very frustrating in itself. Ryan S. Wood also doesn't have the copies of the original document

620
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,820
because it would be very great to put these kind of through a forensic test as Wood does with the

621
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,980
MJ-12 documents. But anyway guys, again, let me know what you think about the case. Do you

622
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,660
have any other details I glossed over in this because I've really tried to scrounge as much

623
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:35,180
as I can for any information on this case. Coming up guys, a lot of interesting videos,

624
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,380
a lot of crash retrievals. I'm going to focus on a lot of hidden programs. I'm going to do a

625
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:43,660
video on the IPU. Now that I've met with Ryan S. Wood, we are going to do a video on the MJ-12

626
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:50,460
documents, a very kind of comprehensive documentary, an overview of the MJ-12 using

627
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,780
his expertise. I also want to make a video solely on the Majestic 12 special operations
