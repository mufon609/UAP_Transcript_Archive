1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
Officially designated as the Dugway Proving Ground, this military facility covers an astounding

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,120
1,250 square miles of the Great Salt Lake Desert.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,260
Dugway's official mission is to test top-secret weapons and aerospace systems, but UFO researchers

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,700
believe the true purpose of Area 52 is even more sinister.

5
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,720
When you imagine UFO legacy program operations focused on the retrieval and exploitation

6
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,940
of technologies of unknown origin, what kind of facilities come to mind?

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,740
Is it Area 51 and its alleged legendary auxiliary site S-4?

8
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,060
Maybe you think of the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane and its possible off-world technologies

9
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,060
division.

10
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,320
Or perhaps you reference China Lake Weapon Center, Edwards Air Force Base, Wright-Patterson

11
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,200
or any number of U.S. Department of Defense installations that are steeped in UFO lore.

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,220
Maybe, just maybe, when imagining UFO legacy program locations, you picture Dugway Proving

13
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:39,900
Ground, an enormous 1,300 square mile U.S. Army installation nestled between three mountain

14
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,680
ranges in remote Utah that specializes in the testing of biological and chemical weapons.

15
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,800
Being referred to as Area 52, Dugway Proving Ground rose to prominence in the late 90s

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,800
as the successor to Area 51's UFO programs due to heavy public exposure on the once-denied

17
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,280
Nevada site.

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,240
Ever since, the Utah site and accompanying two premier MRTFBs have been the focus for

19
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,480
Deep Six's clandestine UAP operations.

20
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,160
But this spotlight doesn't solely focus on the enormous facilities sprawling across

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,560
the Utah desert.

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,120
Dugway has additionally been accused as the location of a DUM, a Deep Underground Military

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Base.

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,520
Today, we shed light on Dugway and discussion of its technologies of unknown origin, exploitation

25
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,120
programs and subterranean presence, through analysis of the facility's intriguing Army

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,440
and Air Force MRTFBs, study of defense contractors present on site, and careful evaluation of

27
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,400
the witness testimony of one MS, who I have covered on this channel before, who stumbled

28
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,720
upon a craft of likely non-human origin at the infamous Dugway range.

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Hey guys, it's UAPGurb and I am thrilled for you to join me as we venture into the

30
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,780
world of legacy UFO programs to analyze Dugway Proving Ground.

31
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,580
How deep does the rabbit hole go between the United States' premier biological and chemical

32
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,360
weapons testing facility and non-human technology?

33
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,360
What individuals, military units and corporations possibly engage with Dugway and UFO reversals

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,080
force engineering and material exploitation programs?

35
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,000
And does Dugway operate such UFO programs above and below the Earth's surface?

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,240
Join me today as we find out.

37
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,320
Dugway Proving Ground is located 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City in Tewila County,

38
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Utah.

39
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,640
It encompasses over 1,250 square miles and it is larger than the US state of Rhode Island.

40
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,440
The site itself is ideal for seclusion and privacy free from urban encroachment, light

41
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,720
pollution and excess acoustic and electronic noise.

42
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,920
Dugway is surrounded by mountains, salt flats and desert terrain.

43
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,840
These geological features combined with a defense retainer that will apprehend approaching

44
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,040
civilians with armed personnel and black-op helicopters.

45
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,800
Make the Utah Proving Ground perfect for clandestine and classified military test and evaluation.

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,000
Dugway was founded in 1942 with the mission to test US and allied chemical and biological

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,840
defense systems and perform nuclear, biological and chemical survivability testing and training

48
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,360
of defense material using chemical and biological agents and stimulants.

49
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,800
The Utah Proving Ground uses its state-of-the-art laboratories and chambers to conduct testing

50
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,160
and training under environmentally controlled conditions.

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,480
Dugway's inception arose from the 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks which quickly saw the United

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,200
States military increase military capabilities in numerous areas including chemical and biological

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
warfare.

54
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,420
The infamous site has participated in the never-ending global war on terrorism, employing

55
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,860
special forces mission rehearsals, classified testing and biochem urgent need equipment testing.

56
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,140
Dugway has a laundry list of significant accomplishments including unmanned aerial systems test support

57
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,660
but we will skip over exploring this entire list of accomplishments.

58
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,620
According to a 2021 US Army Dugway Proving Ground Mission and Capabilities Overview public

59
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,420
Dugway is a massive contributor to Utah's economy, employing a total of 2,120 employees

60
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:42,480
and residents, 784 of which are primarily Army and Air Force contractors, 622 of which

61
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,340
consist of primary mission and installation contracting command, think on-site security

62
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,460
personnel, and 486 of these military or defense agency civilians.

63
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,700
Dugway or DPG as we'll refer to it throughout this project partners with myriad US military,

64
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,980
government and intelligence agencies including many that harbor our interests throughout

65
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:12,260
this investigation, US Army Airborne, Navy, SOCOM aka Special Operations Command, the

66
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,660
388th Range Squadron out of Hill Air Force Base, Departments of Justice, Homeland Security

67
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,620
and Interior, NASA and three universities.

68
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,020
Out of these three universities I would like to draw specific mention to Utah State University.

69
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,220
USU employs a university affiliated research center, UARC, for the Missile Defense Agency

70
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,700
known as the Space Dynamics Laboratory.

71
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,740
In numerous projects I have spoken on UARC's and their similar counterparts federally funded

72
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,980
research and development centers, FFRDCs.

73
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:51,900
FFRDCs and UARCs are semi-private DOD driven research and development institutions I have

74
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,700
spoken ad nauseam are key contributors to UAP legacy programs.

75
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,780
While not the topic of today, UARCs and FFRDCs likely exist as a sort of project manager

76
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,620
serving as subject matter experts and research and development leaders for joint corporate

77
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,900
and US government UAP programs.

78
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,960
In fact, I believe these two types of institutions to be exponentially more knowledgeable on

79
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,760
and crucial to UFO exploitation programs than most defense contractors through their

80
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,040
sole source contracts.

81
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,760
Another topic for another day, however, FFRDC will come up again throughout this presentation.

82
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,560
For this investigation we will primarily be focusing on two locations on Dugway known

83
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,720
as MRTFBs, Major Range Test and Facility Bases.

84
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,800
MRTFBs are known as the quote, core set of DOD test and evaluation infrastructure and

85
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,720
associated workforce that must be preserved as a national asset to provide T&E capabilities

86
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,400
to support the DOD acquisition system, end quote.

87
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,320
The quote, unquote, critical core of test bases comprise over 10 million acres of land

88
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:10,780
in the United States, employ over 25,000 people annually and receive over $4 billion in acknowledged

89
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,420
funding annually.

90
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:19,620
There exists a total of 23 acknowledged MRTFBs, 8 Army including Yuma Test Center Arizona

91
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:26,340
and White Sands Missile Range, 6 Navy installations including Naval Air Warfare Center Pax River

92
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,620
and China Lake Naval Warfare Center and 7 Air Force bases including Edwards 412 Test

93
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,480
Wing, Nevada Test and Training Range and the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg and 2 Defense

94
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,360
Agency Bases.

95
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,860
Army here will associate all listed locations with mentions of UFO legacy programs.

96
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,260
I myself have extensively published on Witness Ed, who spoke of a joint UFO reverse engineering

97
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:58,140
operation between the Nevada Test and Training Range and Edwards 412 Test Wing in California.

98
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,300
I strongly recommend viewing this project if you have not already.

99
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:09,460
Dugway Proving Ground possesses one such MRTFB, the US Army's West Desert Test Center and

100
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,880
also shares the South Range of the Air Force's MRTFB, Utah Test and Training Range with nearby

101
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,960
Hill Air Force Base.

102
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,760
Pay close attention to these two major bases as when we analyze the testimony of MS, we

103
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,880
will be exploring a thesis of a joint Army and Air Force legacy program comprised of

104
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:37,560
the WDTC West Desert Test Center and the UTTR Utah Test and Training Range that extend deep

105
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,980
below the Earth's surface.

106
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,340
And while on the subject of MRTFBs, we will dive into much more detail later on, including

107
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,780
discussing the Avery Technical Center and shared Michael Army Airfield which I believe is the

108
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,740
operational above-ground testing location of this joint UFO project.

109
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,780
But before we venture into Dugway's history with UFO, let's touch on one more thing while

110
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,700
the West Desert Test Center is fresh in your mind.

111
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,120
The questions at WDTC are spearheaded by Army Test and Evaluation Command.

112
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,080
As we begin to implicate Dugway and thus ATEC as engaging in UFO legacy programs, I find

113
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,560
the Army Test and Evaluation Organization structure well worth referencing.

114
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,120
Analyzing the reporting structure of ATEC, far up the food chain we can observe the Secretary

115
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,800
of the Army as well as the Chief of Staff and Vice Chief of Staff of the Army answering

116
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,160
directly to the US Secretary of Defense.

117
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,140
Numerous subsets pertain to these four positions including Director of Operational Test and

118
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,580
Evaluation.

119
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,700
But what is interesting here is oversight and T&E policy as well as USA Tech Command

120
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:52,940
is independent from conventional Army Research and Development Test and Evaluation structure.

121
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,900
This independence is mandated by the Office of Management and Budget as well as the Office

122
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,180
of the Secretary of Defense.

123
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,720
This separation exists apparently to ensure warfighter safety through unbiased evaluation

124
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,560
as well as credibility with decision makers.

125
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,200
But I can't help but to think here, such a structure could quickly lead to a lack of

126
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,800
oversight on ATEC programs and thus a lack of oversight on West Desert Test Center programs

127
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,680
at Dugway Proving Ground.

128
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:31,500
Let us pause and reflect on historical mentions of Dugway and analyze how and why this site

129
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,060
has often been referred to as Area 52.

130
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,580
Serving as the United States premier biological and chemical weapons facility, it is no surprise

131
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,860
the secrets of Dugway and its decades of classified operations are held close to the chest of

132
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,300
US military and intelligence.

133
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,860
I would like to briefly discuss a fascinating alleged 1953 UFO crash retrieval case that

134
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,860
occurred less than one month after and solely 200 miles north of the infamous 1953 Kingman,

135
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,360
Arizona crash.

136
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,300
The Garrison, Utah, UFO crash retrieval was investigated at length by UFO researcher Steve

137
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,000
Jones and relayed as a moderate confidence case in Ryan S. Wood's masterpiece, Magic

138
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,240
Eyes Only.

139
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,280
Steve Jones was first introduced to the case by a group called the Phoenix Project in 1993.

140
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:30,040
A group member, Al, discussed the case with 10-15 large aerial photos dated June of 1953.

141
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,880
These images apparently depicted a large valley with a triangular-shaped area on the ground.

142
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,200
A remote station resides alongside the feature called the Desert Range Experimental Station

143
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,120
or D-RES, which is located on the southwest of Dugway's West Desert Test Center extending

144
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,360
from Tooele to Millard County.

145
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,800
D-RES is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an arm of the Department of Agriculture.

146
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,620
The Phoenix Project group presented to Jones a D-RES logbook dated 1979-1980 that featured

147
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:08,000
peculiar entries such as USAF at Army personnel from Fort Carson, Colorado, USAF Command Center

148
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,440
and representatives from a defense contractor.

149
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,000
Phoenix Project believed the D-RES to be a front for a secret research facility that

150
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,120
studied a crashed UFO that was buried, resulting in the surrounding geology.

151
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,960
During his many visits to the site, Steve Jones was indeed able to track down witnesses

152
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,120
who claimed to see such a crashed object.

153
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,560
Local resident Bart Wright claimed as a child living eight miles outside of Garrison he

154
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,440
saw a strange blue light streak across the sky and crash near the side of the valley

155
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
containing D-RES.

156
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,520
According to Wright, the impact caused the ground to shake and sky to light up.

157
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,540
Steve Jones hired a geologist in 1999 named Lamont Sorenson to conduct magnimeter and

158
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,420
seismic tests on the triangular formation where the craft allegedly crashed.

159
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,700
The geologist found no evidence of underground anomalies but did claim he did not think the

160
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,820
formation was made by nature.

161
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,920
He thought that some kind of artificial digging process did in fact take place.

162
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,720
Whenever a buried UFO is mentioned, this leads to an interesting case but ultimately the

163
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,480
Garrison, Utah crash is a dead end.

164
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,100
I would also like to reference the story of the flux liner alien reproduction vehicle

165
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,900
many viewers of this channel will be quite familiar with.

166
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,680
During his decades of investigating into the copy vehicles observed by primary witness

167
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,720
Brad Sorenson at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Air Show, the late Mark McCandlish would

168
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,480
encounter multiple witnesses who had encountered and seen crafts similar to the instantly identifiable

169
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,100
flux liner.

170
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,520
Of note were two photographs McCandlish obtained possession of from USAAF Captain Harvey Williams.

171
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:56,880
Williams photographed this disc in 1967 while flying a C-47 at 12,000 feet over Provo, Utah.

172
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,200
The object bears striking resemblance to the flux liner and possibly details an intriguing

173
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,800
evolution in imaging technology from 1967 to Brad's observation in 1988.

174
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,920
Let me explain.

175
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,960
Brad and McCandlish claimed the ARV flew via a synthetic vision system, overlapping cameras

176
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,920
that allowed for a pilot inside the craft to access full 3D view when operating the

177
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
craft.

178
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,480
The cameras were housed in protective acrylic bubbles, almost appearing as off-the-shelf

179
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,840
components.

180
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Due to cameras being much larger in 1967, if the USAAF Captain did indeed photograph

181
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,920
an early model of the flux liner, this would feature a larger synthetic vision system to

182
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,800
accommodate larger camera technology.

183
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,160
But I am equally if not more interested in the location of this sighting at a low altitude

184
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,000
of 12,000 feet.

185
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,380
Provo, Utah is only 100 miles from Dugway and less than 75 miles from Hill Air Force

186
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,380
Base.

187
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Remember what we discussed earlier.

188
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,800
Dugway and Hill Air Force Base share runways such as the Dugway-Michael Army Airfield and

189
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,420
operate together in the Utah Test and Training Range southern area.

190
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:14,620
Also recall the numerous mentions of MRTFBs and how two such critical cores reside on

191
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,620
Dugway.

192
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,020
I would once again like to reference Witness Ed and the Joint Reverse Engineering Program

193
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,000
between the Edwards 412th Test Wing and the Nevada Test and Training Range.

194
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,520
Both the 412th and NTTR are Air Force MRTFBs, just as the UTTR is.

195
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,840
The testimony of Ed explores two MRTFBs working in conjunction to test reverse engineered

196
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,120
vehicles.

197
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,960
USAAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet stated the TR-3B reverse engineered triangle saw

198
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,580
operations at Area 51, which is part of the NTTR, and pilots inside the triangle were

199
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,340
pooled from Edwards Air Force Test Pilot School, part of the 412th.

200
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,180
The Fluxliner alien reproduction vehicles were allegedly shown at Norton Air Force Base

201
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,620
in 1988, which is within extreme proximity to the fabled USAAF Plant 42 and Edwards Air

202
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,860
Force Base.

203
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,820
If Harvey Williams did indeed image early iterations of the Fluxliner, this would imply

204
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:18,860
a UFO reverse engineering and ARV testing program between two MRTFBs.

205
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,500
Utah Test and Training Range and Edwards 412th Test Wing.

206
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,060
This is incredibly similar to the claims of Ed and Fouchet.

207
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,340
Further in this exploration, we will investigate a possible UFO legacy program operating across

208
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,860
both Army and Air Force MRTFBs at Dugway, but we will save this for later.

209
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,960
In June of 1997, Popular Mechanics Magazine published a stunning monthly issue.

210
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:50,160
The titular article titled The New Area 51 discussed the Air Force abandoning its once

211
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,160
most secretive site for top-secret testing and moved to a new, more private location.

212
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,120
Let's of course dive into this intriguing article to discover the quote-unquote New

213
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,080
Area 51 and its secret airbase operations.

214
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,400
Right off the jump, the images in this piece are fascinating.

215
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,600
We see a sticky note that says Call Admiral Inman at Science Applications International.

216
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,800
Now I know this isn't the subject of the video, but for an article that mocks the idea

217
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,760
of UFO reverse engineering programs by claiming those who believe the X-Files and existence

218
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,840
of a dress collection by former FBI Director Edgar Hoover are the type of people to believe

219
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,800
in UFO crash retrievals, why is Bobby Ray Inman mentioned?

220
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,440
Members of this channel may recall recent mention of Inman in the Northrop Grumman Project.

221
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,160
Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, former NSA Director, CIA Deputy Director, and Science Applications

222
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:52,160
International Corporation SAIC board member, once discussed UFO recovered vehicles to NASA

223
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,760
mission specialist Bob Eschler.

224
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:01,200
Inman also referred Eschler to retired Rear Admiral and BDM board member Sumner Shapiro,

225
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,720
who informed Eschler UAP retrievals would see teams take apart craft, pack them up,

226
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,920
and ship them around the country to different laboratories.

227
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,720
Inman is an integral figure in the discussion of UFO crash retrievals in the 1980s.

228
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,920
And I do not need to go into SAIC and their likely involvement in an off-world technologies

229
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,480
division at NSWC Crane.

230
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,800
This tiny sticky note in a rather deprecating article is incredibly interesting.

231
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,260
The Popular Mechanics piece states due to overexposure as America's worst kept secret,

232
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,320
Area 51 shut down.

233
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,960
This is of course objectively false, however, later individuals we will discuss in this

234
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,000
project reference a percentage of up to 40% of Area 51's clandestine operations moving

235
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,340
to Dugway.

236
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,220
One primary reason for the move out of Area 51 according to the Popular Mechanics author

237
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,180
Jim Wilson was the need for a different type of proving ground for ultra-high performance

238
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,160
military aircraft.

239
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,160
After some impressive sleuthing including referencing Air Force Base Command General

240
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,140
Howell Estes and NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin's 1997 agreement to share quote-unquote

241
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:17,300
redundant assets, as well as a 1996 NASA announcement stating Michael Army Airfield would share

242
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:23,420
as a runway for several X-33 missions, Popular Mechanics narrowed in on Utah.

243
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:29,340
In a quick side note, the X-33 aircraft capable of Mach 15 was a Lockheed Martin Skunk Works

244
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,120
production formed out of the Palmdale facility.

245
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,260
Both Michael Army Airfield, which sits nestled on Dugway's West Desert Test Center within

246
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,120
the Avery Technical Center and don't worry much more on this later, as well as Green

247
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,560
River Utah Launch Complex part of White Sands Missile Range were ideal installations for

248
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,880
the new Area 51.

249
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,840
Michael Army Airfield possessed an equally, if not more, deterring surrounding area than

250
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,400
Area 51.

251
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,880
Not only is the Airfield situated on 1,300 square miles of Dugway ranges, but it is also

252
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,500
bordered by numerous mountain ranges and salt flats.

253
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,340
The Airfield did, however, lack adequate landing runways according to Popular Mechanics, which

254
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:17,940
is why Utah Launch Complex, situated only 200 miles away, served as the ideal dance

255
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,460
partner for the Michael Army Airfield.

256
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,680
The magazine attempted flyovers of the Airfield to snap images of the surrounding area, but

257
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,240
were warned of being shot down.

258
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,680
Additionally, the magazine attempted to purchase satellite imagery of the Utah Launch Complex

259
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,400
but was denied due to security reasons.

260
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:44,280
The claims of a new Area 51 are not isolated to mainstream publishers like Popular Mechanics.

261
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,120
Let's revisit the testimony of Edgar Fouchet in the TR-3B.

262
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,780
Like I said in the Northrop Project, many are critical of Fouchet due to his claims

263
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:58,100
of a reverse-engineered triangular alien reproduction vehicle with little in the way of physical

264
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
proof.

265
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,860
However, his disclosures have led to incredibly actionable intelligence and worthwhile investigation.

266
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:12,160
In his 1998 IUFO-C International UFO Congress presentation, Fouchet presented comprehensive

267
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:19,860
disclosures of TR-3B, Area 51, NSA's Men in Black Treat, EG&G, and Project Red Light,

268
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,880
as well as the DARSS Defense Advanced Research Center, which I have talked about numerous

269
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,420
times on this channel.

270
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,560
In the presentation, Fouchet made mention to a source informing him beginning in 1992

271
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,380
the Air Force conducted a contingency plan due to massive public contention on Area 51.

272
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,920
This would see the majority of exotic Air Force platforms relocated to Utah, Colorado,

273
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,160
Alaska, Greenland, Diego Garcia, and south of Area 51 to S4.

274
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,280
And there is evidence to show a heavy focus on Area 51 and UFO programs in the early 1990s,

275
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,940
which may in fact have seen projects moved out of Area 51 Groom Lake.

276
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:03,120
In 1990, Jane's defense writer James Goodall revealed a thesis of at least eight black

277
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,380
programs flying out of Area 51 Groom Lake, including a silent triangle utilizing unconventional

278
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,700
technologies.

279
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,460
An unnamed source Goodall knew for 12 years stationed at Groom Lake later explained that

280
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,460
UAP positively existed at the base while another source stated quote,

281
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,980
We have things out there that are literally out of this world, better than Star Trek or

282
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,960
anything you can see in the movies, end quote.

283
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,920
Claims of Area 51 moving clandestine operations to Dugway were additionally made by

284
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,880
One A.H.

285
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,840
A.H. claimed to be a former Boeing employee who leveraged significant knowledge on UFO

286
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:47,060
legacy programs from friends at the NSA, CIA, NASA, JPL, ONI, NRO, Area 51, the Air Force,

287
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,420
Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and others.

288
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,020
A.H. appeared as a primary witness on Stephen Greer's 2001 excellent disclosure briefing

289
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,020
document and had his testimony taped in the year 2000.

290
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:04,160
Now it's worth noting as I discussed in the Northrop Project, A.H. is likely a primary

291
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,280
source of information for Dr. Stephen Greer, similar to UFO researcher William Hamilton.

292
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:16,360
As A.H. has been in contact with Greer for decades, and Greer repeats much of what A.H.

293
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,200
has stated in the past.

294
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,440
Greer talks often of Dugway as a primary UFO legacy program site, discussing a Utah underground

295
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,700
complex south of Salt Lake City accessible only by air in the 2001 disclosure briefing

296
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,140
document and again in a 2016 presentation.

297
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,820
In this 2016 presentation, Greer discussed black program locations and code names which

298
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,180
relate to the testimony of Ed.

299
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:46,180
In this discussion, Greer tags Dugway as quote, the most critical one, end quote, when discussing

300
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,940
black program facilities.

301
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,580
And in Utah, one of the most critical, and this is the most critical one that's new,

302
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,120
is the Dugway proving grounds outside of Provo.

303
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,120
And this is classified airspace above and no access by ground.

304
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,440
Above ground, you don't see much and everything is underground.

305
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,200
Richard Foesch, this Naval Research Labs official, was out there with some Generation Five or

306
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,840
Six or whatever night scopes doing an operation.

307
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,680
And he looked out and he saw these objects coming out from underground that then zipped

308
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,260
over and that were these massive disk in triangular shape, anti-gravity objects that

309
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
were ours.

310
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,020
And some were just sitting out there watching him.

311
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,280
And that's outside of Provo out in the desert.

312
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,120
It is not inconceivable many of Greer's early ideas on Dugway were disclosed to him

313
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,200
by witness A.H.

314
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:46,100
After all, in 2000, A.H. did in fact reference an underground Utah installation southwest

315
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,220
of Salt Lake City accessible only by air that tests and maintains extra-terrestrial

316
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,220
technology.

317
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,300
We're incorporating this technology from these crafts at Area 51.

318
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:04,220
And I also found out that they are moving a lot of the personnel and some of the equipment

319
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:13,940
and some of the extra-terrestrial technology equipment and the craft to base up in Utah.

320
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:29,180
However, we can find some extremely interesting pre-2000s discussion of Dugway by Greer.

321
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:35,540
See on screen now a March 1998 email exchange with Greer and UFO investigator Steve Jones.

322
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:42,740
Yes, the same investigator we discussed above with the alleged 1953 Garrison, Utah UFO crash.

323
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,380
In these initial exchanges, Jones details his field notes while near the Desert Range

324
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,940
experimental station studying the retrieval case.

325
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,340
Jones mentioned he had learned that work from Area 51 Groom Lake had indeed been moved to

326
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,880
Dugway in an area called Dog, west of the main gate.

327
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,740
Jones himself had collected data since the 1980s on tarped trucks left in the middle

328
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,580
of nowhere in Utah.

329
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,740
These truckloads were left between Hill Air Force Base north of Salt Lake and Wendover,

330
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,760
Utah bordering Nevada.

331
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,180
This between Area is of course Dugway and the Utah Test and Training Range.

332
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:25,440
Recall also that Dugway and Hill Air Force Base share airstrips in the UTTR, Hill itself

333
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,880
and its 388th Range Squadron operate on the Dugway-Michael Army Airfield.

334
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,560
What is more intriguing to me is an even earlier 1996 exchange of emails between Greer and

335
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,200
one A.J. Cradock with the subject line, quote,

336
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:48,000
Area 51, insiders say area southwest of Tuwila, Utah deserve a look, end quote.

337
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,320
A.J. aka Tony Cradock once did work with Greer, serving as webmaster for Seaseti.org.

338
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,400
Cradock is also the founder and CEO of Cradock, an oil and gas service provider in Libya.

339
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,420
Why did a CEO with 40 years' experience in the international petroleum industry engage

340
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,680
in UFO research with Greer in the 90s?

341
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,400
Anyways, in this email addressed to Greer, Cradock links a discussion with an insider

342
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,640
source.

343
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,680
The sender or insider had their credentials withheld but claimed to work on several sites

344
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,440
checking badges and running ground surveillance equipment, tremor sensors, ground surveillance

345
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,000
radar, etc.

346
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,440
The source additionally discussed EMP weaponry that could fry vehicle computers or electronics.

347
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,280
We live in a world where EMP devices are often discussed as legacy program weapons to shoot

348
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,100
down non-human craft, so this inclusion is interesting.

349
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,400
The source claims Cradock and others, implying Greer, were looking in two obvious directions

350
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,360
for UAP programs.

351
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,720
Although Area 51 did indeed have legacy programs, the source advised Cradock to look in the

352
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,120
state of Utah to the southwest of Tuwila County and west of Salt Lake City.

353
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,440
In this described area existed nine exclusion zones, four of which featured underground

354
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,000
locations, and this area, of course, is Dugway Proving Ground.

355
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,560
The Cradock-Greer connection here is fascinating and well worth exploring more.

356
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,240
However, remember this discussion of Dugway, Area 51, and mysterious programs took place

357
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:29,520
before the 1997 Popular Mechanics article on the new Area 51, Fouché's disclosures,

358
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,100
and A.H.'s film testimony.

359
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,680
Very pertinent, this insider source claimed to have knowledge of Dugway Proving Ground

360
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:45,760
and UFO legacy programs before any public exposure.

361
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,200
In June of 2023, the contentious Stephen Greer held his first whistleblower symposium at

362
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,640
the National Press Club since his 2001 panel that featured the legendary Mark McCandlish

363
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,520
amongst other first-hand witnesses.

364
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,180
Viewers may remember this panel as featuring the first public disclosures of Michael Herrera,

365
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,420
and we now know UFO whistleblower Jake Barber was in attendance.

366
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:13,840
One witness featured was not present at the event and had his story told by Greer.

367
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,600
This was a witness known by the pseudonym M.S.

368
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,480
So there's another gentleman, I'm going to run through these very quickly, we'd be here

369
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,440
for 30 hours if I didn't, I'm just giving you a tip of the iceberg, right?

370
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,520
This is a guy who was at the Dugway Proving Grounds for a key facility, M.S. we call him.

371
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:38,880
He was a work for C. Martin Corporation contractor, and he was in a facility that had an extraterrestrial

372
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,160
vehicle that was being studied by scientists, he knows the chief scientist involved, he

373
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,960
has named that individual to us, and they can all be subpoenaed now.

374
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,840
So this object was there in 2009, he didn't know the date of acquisition, but he thought

375
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,720
it was fairly recent.

376
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,060
Next.

377
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:03,920
He also was read into and had the chief scientist show him the location which we now have of

378
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:10,560
a dumb deep underground military base that is in the Dugway sector, so called Avery Sector

379
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:18,880
A-V-E-R-Y, and it has huge capacity for parking, you go in and there's a vast underground complex

380
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,320
in that location.

381
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,600
That location has been handed off to investigators with the U.S. government.

382
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Next.

383
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,960
This gives an illustration of the size of this, you could put easily on the platform

384
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:36,000
that goes down the Air Force One, it's a very large elevator that goes down underground.

385
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,240
Upon release of the DPI archive, I investigated all files relating to this fascinating case.

386
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,000
Files on M.S. can be found under witness ID 10655.

387
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,220
Due to lapses in site security and data presented in the documents, I was able to track down

388
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,180
witness M.S. and hear his incredible encounter at Dugway first-hand.

389
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,820
Viewers of my channel may recall an interview with M.S. in UFO Witnesses' redacted list.

390
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,720
This project was deleted to respect the privacy of other witnesses covered in the project,

391
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,000
however, I would now like to revisit the testimony of M.S. with exponentially greater focus on

392
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
his claims.

393
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,960
The purpose of this investigation will be to identify specific buildings and military

394
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,460
units operating UFO legacy programs at Dugway Proving Ground as well as explore any and

395
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,640
all evidence to the enormous facility likely beneath the ground of the Utah site.

396
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,040
And before we get started, I would like to add, M.S. was approached by elements of the

397
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,720
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to testify regarding his claims, and I can confirm

398
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,920
this as he shared with me the screenshots of their outreach.

399
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:47,080
M.S. turned down the requests as he is a current railroad employee and was unable to break

400
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,200
away from work for a week plus even when SSCI offered to pay for his travel.

401
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,960
I have a tremendous amount of respect for M.S. and find great value in researching his

402
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
testimony.

403
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,640
Witness M.S. served in the U.S. Navy and was even stationed in the Auxiliary Division of

404
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,040
the USS Teddy Roosevelt from 1990 to 2000.

405
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,760
During his service, M.S. entered into government contracting work.

406
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,640
From 2009 to 2013, he worked as a maintenance painter and sign technician for the C. Martin

407
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,720
Company.

408
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,580
C. Martin is a DoD contractor whose mission is to, quote, provide a fine-tuned approach

409
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,660
to managing people, time, and resources to provide quality services while creating value

410
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,580
for our customers, end quote.

411
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:36,100
C. Martin operates as a prime subcontractor with DoD in myriad capacities, specializing

412
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:41,500
in facility operations and maintenance, logistics, construction, range operation and maintenance,

413
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
etc.

414
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,220
And C. Martin does indeed have a location on Dugway located near the Administration

415
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,220
Center.

416
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,860
C. Martin's range and facility operations and maintenance contracting pertains greatly

417
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:58,340
to areas of interest for this investigation, specifically for Avery Technical Center, which

418
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,680
resides on Michael Army Airfield shared with Hill Air Force Base in the 388th Range Squadron

419
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,240
as well as locations a stone throw away called Ditto Technical Center.

420
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,620
Ditto contains the heart of the West Desert Test Center, which alongside ATEC tests chemicals

421
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,240
and biological weapons across the Utah Range.

422
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:22,600
In fact, the Army Test and Evaluation Command Major Range and Facility Base West Desert

423
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:28,080
Test Center is majorly funded by the Joint Services Chemical and Biological Defense Program

424
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
CBDP.

425
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:35,520
A lot of acronyms I know, but remember the term CBDP as we will discuss it again both

426
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,080
in relation to a specific contractor of interest at Dugway and for MS's story.

427
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,880
Now MS's experience begins in 2009, four months into his work for C. Martin at Dugway.

428
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,760
MS held a level 5 proximity badge, which allowed him access to myriad facilities across Dugway

429
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,560
to perform DoD contractor work.

430
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,640
And crucial to note, MS did not have a security clearance even though he occasionally states

431
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,400
level 5 clearance instead of badge.

432
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,080
MS would often ride into Dugway Proving Ground from Kaysville, Utah in a van where all other

433
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,120
travelers held top-secret clearance.

434
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:17,400
One normal day on the job, MS was tasked with electrical meter reading to allow the US government

435
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,320
to bill various contractors working on site.

436
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,960
There was a kid that was underneath me as my apprentice, because I was one of the maintenance

437
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
painters.

438
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,040
We took care of every facility out there.

439
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,440
And so he called in sick one day, I had to go read meters for him because that's what

440
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
they do.

441
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:54,440
So the government is in control of about 48% of that, and then 52% of it is private contractor.

442
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,800
And that's why they don't have to disclose anything.

443
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,600
So I had to go out and read his meter that day to get everything turned in to the government.

444
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,440
And I can't remember how many facilities there were.

445
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:14,760
There's probably a good 15, but those 15 took me to places where I've never really been

446
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,920
out there and opened my eyes up to a lot of different things.

447
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,880
This led MS to the Avery Technical Center where he entered into the quote-unquote Ghost

448
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,440
Building, a building nicknamed for having no numbers and no insignia.

449
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,600
Initially, I believed these facilities may be the material test facility or defensive

450
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,720
test chamber just south of Avery across the road from Ditto Technical Center.

451
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:47,280
After all, MS will soon describe the incident location as a clean room of sorts, and these

452
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,960
are high-profile CBDP test areas on site at the West Desert Test Center.

453
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,880
However, these installations are well-known and indeed named and numbered.

454
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,480
On the other hand, Avery Technical Center yields very few search results and quite often does

455
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,680
not appear in numerous U.S. Army and A-Tech documents.

456
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,240
In fact, Avery is curiously missing from DPG visitor guides while other areas of interest

457
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,040
such as Ditto are clearly mentioned.

458
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,080
Last time I covered MS's testimony, I had very little to work off regarding Avery, bar

459
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:29,040
a September 2017 DTTF facility description document and image from Facebook.

460
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,560
Before we investigate Avery, I must clearly state I am not revealing any classified information.

461
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:41,360
All locations and installations to be discussed can be referenced in public domain materials.

462
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,640
Let's reference a July 2012 unclassified report titled Environmental Assessment of

463
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,920
the Continued Exclusive Use of Department of the Army Land Located at U.S. Army Dugway

464
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,280
Proving Ground by members of the U.S. Air Force that offers incredible insights and

465
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,960
exploration into Avery Technical Center.

466
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,120
As mentioned numerous times so far, Avery Borders, Michael Army, Airfield and both the

467
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:11,600
Airfield and 40-acre Avery area are the focus of the 388th Range Squadron out of nearby

468
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,120
Hill Air Force Base.

469
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:18,000
Avery partly serves as air testing slash training for the 388th.

470
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,080
Historically, Avery had conducted numerous radiological studies and investigations into

471
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:28,720
the handling of radioactive material, including utilizing their radiobiological warfare laboratories

472
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,680
for the Atomic Energy Commission.

473
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:37,020
Avery employs an internal rail system for the transportation of radioactive materials.

474
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,240
This mention of an internal rail system is truly massive as we further on investigate

475
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,960
Dugway's alleged deep underground military base.

476
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,120
Aerial views of Avery yield no building descriptions unlike the nearby Ditto area where facilities

477
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,960
like the Diner, Contractor Jacobs, etc. are mentioned.

478
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,120
However, this environmental assessment document offers us a gorgeous detailed overview of

479
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,480
Avery locations, see on screen now.

480
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,320
Locations of interest include the 10-02 Avery Tunnel Entrance, 10-12 Photo Operations and

481
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,840
Maintenance, 10-38 General Storage and 10-16 Classified Storage.

482
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:20,520
Now other buildings outside of this map not marked Developed slash Unclassified exist,

483
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:27,300
however, I am willing to bet this experience took place at building 10-10, Test Operations.

484
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,740
With enough investigation, let's hear from MS as he entered this ghost building.

485
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:37,300
I walked into one that they called the ghost building because it just kind of came out

486
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,300
of nowhere.

487
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,820
No numbers on it, no nothing.

488
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:48,220
And opened up the door and basically had a M16 stuck in my chest and I had my level five

489
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,220
badge on.

490
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,820
I think that was the only thing that saved my tail that day.

491
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,780
There were what I call white coats, you know, they're kind of like doctors type set up

492
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:07,300
inside the building, kind of like a little clean room area and, you know, I'm sure,

493
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:12,340
I don't know if you've ever been in a car accident or not, but when you have your light

494
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:19,140
kind of flash before your eyes, everything starts to slow down and you start really taking

495
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,420
in a lot of information very quickly.

496
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,300
And so that's what I, you know, what happened to me is with the gun and everything else,

497
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:34,660
it just kind of, everything just started to fall into place.

498
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:41,460
That thing was on its own power, when I hover in, there's kind of a, I don't know if you've

499
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,100
seen the rendering or not.

500
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Yes.

501
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:50,740
Well, the door, there was no door, it was just kind of open on the bottom, but everything

502
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:56,220
it just kind of just fall in there on its own power.

503
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,620
No noise, no, no anything.

504
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:05,660
But the white coats walk around it, analyze it, do all their stuff, I don't know.

505
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:11,540
There's, you know, a few gift arm guards in there at the time.

506
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:17,300
And I, like I said, I don't know if they were getting ready to move or, you know, what have

507
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,300
you.

508
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:24,260
Before we discuss this incredible craft, who were these armed guards that held MS at gunpoint?

509
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:29,940
Will numerous US facilities actually contract security personnel instead of enlisted men?

510
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,060
This is done through sole source contracts, a contract method Dr. Eric Davis has stated

511
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,100
is used for UAP legacy programs.

512
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:43,420
These contracts were given to private security companies post 9-11 to bolster US Army and

513
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,940
other military installation security.

514
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:51,380
I have found a 2006 General Accounting Office report titled, quote, Army's Guard Program

515
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,260
Requires Greater Oversight and Reassessment of Acquisition Approach, end quote.

516
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,860
This document discusses all contracted security personnel issued by the Army.

517
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,940
Dugway Proving Ground utilized Chenega Integrated Systems.

518
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:10,100
In future projects, I will be interested in exploring both Chenega and their subcontractor

519
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,820
Vance Federal Security Services.

520
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:17,620
Wackenhut Services, which Admiral Bobby Ray Inman was formerly a board member of, is a

521
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:24,100
private security corporation I highly suspect was involved in UAP legacy program security.

522
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:29,740
Wackenhut, like Vance Federal Security Systems, were used as subcontractors to Army installation,

523
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,860
not primary contractors.

524
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,860
Now unless contractor security personnel were highly cleared security specialists, I highly

525
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,460
doubt these private security companies could do more than scan vehicles and check badges

526
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,060
for access to legacy program sites.

527
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:49,620
Therefore, while I do reckon security services like Wackenhut and possibly Chenega have historically

528
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:55,740
performed installation and access security for UAP legacy program locations, I must conclude

529
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:01,460
the armed guards within proximity to the saucer were known as industrial security Indusec

530
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,900
personnel.

531
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,140
Now why that conclusion?

532
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,020
Industrial security, quote, conducts risk management activities with respect to the

533
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:14,100
U.S. government's defense industrial base, including critical technologies and the defense

534
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:19,580
supply chain through oversight of the National Industrial Security Program, issuance of facility

535
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:25,060
security clearances, foreign ownership, control, and influence mitigation measures, information

536
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:30,060
system cybersecurity oversight, and other activities related to protecting classified

537
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,820
and controlled unclassified national security information and related technology, end quote.

538
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:42,420
See on screen now an ATAC security specialist role for Dugway detailing an Indusec position.

539
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,820
Numerous responsibilities are listed for this role, including one such task, which is to

540
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,460
provide backup as the alternate special security officer for sensitive compartmented information

541
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,660
SEI programs.

542
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:00,140
Moving forward, investigating industrial security alongside UAP legacy program installations

543
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,420
will be paramount to my research.

544
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:08,780
Anyways, MS observed a saucer, roughly 10 feet tall and 20 feet in circumference.

545
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,260
The craft was hovering 10 to 12 inches off the ground.

546
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:17,860
The disc had no seams or fasteners and appeared to be made out of one piece and featured a

547
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,980
brushed metal appearance.

548
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,540
Around the craft were six lab technicians, I believe these to be ATAC and Battelle Memorial

549
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,740
Institute scientists, and more on this later.

550
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:33,140
MS believed this craft was in the process of being dismantled due to a bottom section

551
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,100
of the saucer being removed featuring a conical structure.

552
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:42,260
This conical section appeared to be floating and was almost independent of the craft.

553
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:47,580
One cannot help but draw parallels to Bob Lazar's drawn extraterrestrial reactor model

554
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,900
that he claims served as the propulsion mechanism for the sports model flying saucer.

555
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:58,380
Appearing by the craft was a flat screen television type of electronic, displaying a mapping

556
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,380
system.

557
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,380
More on this shortly.

558
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:34,660
That component area, that triangle, it's like it's floating.

559
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,300
Like it's generating a power.

560
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,500
I don't know, like a lot of, everything happened very, very quickly and just trying to take

561
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,980
in everything as fast as I could.

562
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,340
That section is basically doing its own thing.

563
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:58,900
When I stand in, you know, like, I don't know if you're fairly with something or just,

564
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:04,820
that's what I said, is it in transition to where it's like, you guys have it out in this

565
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:10,060
building out in the middle of nowhere, but then, you know, you have military vehicles

566
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:15,580
around, you have regular civilian vehicles around, but if this thing's on its own power

567
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,420
doing its own thing, what are you guys going to be doing with it?

568
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:24,020
Are you guys going to move it underground, more stuff going on, or have you taken what

569
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,020
you've wanted?

570
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,900
MS was taken by the guards to the nearby Ditto Technical Center to the garrison building

571
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,300
where two men in civilian clothing immediately began interrogating him.

572
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,180
The men were clad in black suits, and MS guessed these individuals to be FBI or CIA.

573
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:46,180
Quite possibly, these men could also be the infamous alleged NSA men in black treat.

574
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,740
For six hours, MS was harassed and interrogated.

575
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,620
The entire duration, MS maintained he had no idea what he saw and he was just doing

576
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,620
his job.

577
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,380
Eventually, he was let go.

578
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,420
I didn't say a word to these guys when they sat me down.

579
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,020
So I don't know if they knew that I saw something.

580
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,900
I don't know how they, you know what I mean?

581
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,660
But we, I still worked out there, so I still had a confidential agreement with them.

582
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,620
I still had all that, but I don't know where it would stand nowadays.

583
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:17,880
In the months and years following the incident, MS would discuss his encounter with family

584
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,100
and friends and ask around to find more.

585
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:26,700
MS reached out to various individuals affiliated with Dugway, including one such person.

586
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:32,380
MS stated, quote, I reached out to him and got him to talk about my situation by accident,

587
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,380
end quote.

588
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:39,580
This individual, pseudonym GP, worked in legacy operations at Dugway and possibly still does

589
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,580
today.

590
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:46,480
GP was a senior chemist involved in Dugway's UAP legacy programs both above ground and

591
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,860
in the subterranean facility where he claimed a light rail system connected the Dugway dumb

592
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,500
to numerous others around the country.

593
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,120
GP commented little about himself.

594
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,900
He primarily discussed with MS what he went through at Avery.

595
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:07,060
What we do know about GP, according to MS, is he is a DOD chemist by degree and was moved

596
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:12,140
to DPG after being promoted to work in UAP legacy programs.

597
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:18,020
MS lost connection with GP when he left C. Martin in 2014, but we are attempting to get

598
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,440
in contact with him today.

599
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,260
Often when discussing legacy program operations, we discuss research and development.

600
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:30,780
Engineers, physicists, military brass, the discussion of a chemist is indeed intriguing.

601
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,580
However, high level DOD chemists involved with technologies of unknown origin would

602
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:40,540
most certainly be stationed at Dugway, the nation's premier chemical and biological

603
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,140
testing facility.

604
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,900
What exactly did GP do at Dugway?

605
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:49,520
This is unknown, but speculating possibly his position could have seen him operating

606
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,880
with chemistry concepts surrounding the craft's propulsion system.

607
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:59,260
Analyzing biologics, studying metallurgy, the list is truly endless, but GP did have

608
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,980
enough knowledge to inform MS of the mapping system he saw near the craft.

609
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:09,500
And you'd have, you'd almost have like coordinates on there, is what I can describe.

610
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,020
So the way that, the way that that's set up to me is what it looked like in the mapping

611
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,020
system.

612
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:21,300
When I talked to the gentleman that was over top of a lot of that stuff out there, he said

613
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:30,220
they're basically able to put on that system two points of, you know, references or whatever

614
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:34,660
that they're going to do on reference points and basically generate a wormhole and drop

615
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,660
through.

616
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:42,820
And so that's where he says that interstellar travel is how they get from point A to point

617
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,820
B so quickly.

618
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:50,020
In short, GP stated the craft was extraterrestrial and operated via gravity displacement but

619
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,620
wouldn't comment further.

620
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:58,020
Now, MS received confirmation from both GP and a current railroad co-worker of a massive

621
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,660
underground facility beneath Dugway.

622
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:05,340
The co-worker even claimed to have assisted in digging out the tunneling system beneath

623
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,340
DPG.

624
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:11,220
MS and myself are currently setting up time to meet with this individual as well.

625
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:17,660
Deep underground military bases, DUMs, aka subterranean facilities or STFs, are a keen

626
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:22,620
interest of mine especially in relation to UAP legacy programs.

627
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,060
DUMs do indeed exist.

628
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:30,980
Quite often planned as underground ICBM facilities, underground command bunkers, corporate facilities

629
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,340
or COG continuity of government installations.

630
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:38,820
Indeed, even deep underground tunnel systems have been planned to connect these facilities

631
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,780
like in studies conducted by TRW.

632
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:46,200
Massive machines called tunnel boring machines and nuclear subterranes have historically

633
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,820
been associated with such intriguing underground work.

634
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:54,360
In fact, the United States National Research Council has historically published special

635
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,960
projects on the creation of DUMs.

636
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:03,360
Such as this 1981 and 1982 workshop on technology for the design and construction of deep underground

637
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,000
defense facilities.

638
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,880
DUMs are not our focus today besides under Dugway, but again I have discussed such underground

639
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,240
facilities before and plan to tackle the subject fully in the future.

640
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,560
For now I'll leave you with numerous underground tunnel systems in western states detailed

641
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,400
by the US Bureau of Reclamation.

642
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,080
Many tunnel systems listed in this report feature tunnel distances of tens of thousands

643
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:32,000
of feet of length, tens of feet of diameter covered by hundreds or thousands of feet

644
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,120
of earth.

645
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,200
Now many such tunnels serve as waterways and aqueducts, however it is fascinating to see

646
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,640
such a volume of massive underground tunnels.

647
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:47,160
It is critical to mention the Bureau of Reclamation was one of the key members on the 1981 and

648
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:53,080
1982 joint project discussing deep underground defense facilities we mentioned above.

649
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:59,520
GP would state this underground facility at an undisclosed depth spanned 1300 square miles

650
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,720
which is the size of Dugway Proving Ground itself.

651
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,280
The tunnels connecting Dugway to other underground installations were wide enough to transport

652
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,440
enormous aircraft such as a 747.

653
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:16,960
These rail systems operated off of magnetics, popularly referred to as maglev trains.

654
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,880
It's 1300 square miles underneath and then there's a light rail system is what he said.

655
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,840
He goes that light rail system is connected to every base in the nation and can transport

656
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:32,880
the president's plane basically anywhere they need to without putting it in the air.

657
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,800
Maglev trains are a type of rail system levitated by electromagnetics rather than employing wheels.

658
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,000
Maglevs feature numerous benefits to conventional railroad systems including higher speeds,

659
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:49,200
superior acceleration and deceleration, lower maintenance costs, improved gradient handling

660
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,880
and lower noise.

661
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,600
But are much more expensive compared to traditional systems.

662
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,360
Maglevs have even reached top speeds of 375 miles per hour.

663
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:05,920
Now the implementation of maglev train systems connecting dumps is often seen as conspiracy however.

664
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,680
This is an incorrect assumption.

665
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,440
In 1986, FFRDC Los Alamos National Labs published a study titled,

666
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,920
The intriguing study discussed the creation of subsurface lunar tunnels connecting manned

667
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,800
installations that would feature maglev or other high-speed train transportation systems.

668
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:37,200
And while discussing specifics of the dump, I must once again state I am not releasing

669
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,320
any classified information.

670
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,000
Everything discussed from here on out is all public domain.

671
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,520
The entrance to the subterranean facility is accessible from a tiny building in the

672
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,560
middle of the West Desert Test Center near German Village Dugway.

673
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:57,820
According to GP, the entrance is solely an elevator to take personnel to the installation.

674
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:04,120
This entrance does not supply the Dugway dump with materials, food, supplies, logistics,

675
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,120
etc.

676
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,920
Instead, the dump is internally supplied from tunnels connecting the base to other subterranean

677
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,200
facilities.

678
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,800
When I last discussed MS and UFO witnesses' redacted list, I did not cover the supposed

679
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,040
entrance to the Dugway subterranean facility.

680
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,160
Since covering MS's story, Stephen Greer has taken it upon himself to leak this supposed

681
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,760
entrance himself.

682
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:33,560
See on screen now the critical update displaying the Dugway dump entrance on the DPI archive.

683
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,440
As mentioned above, this remote entrance is indeed on Dugway's West Desert Test Center

684
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:43,720
and is quite close to the Avery Technical Center and Michael Army Airfield, while lying

685
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:49,120
between properties considered as Air Force lease rentals on Dugway Proving Ground.

686
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,920
Analyzing Google Earth historical imagery, it appears this entrance was constructed sometime

687
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,320
between 1993 and 2006.

688
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:02,020
It could however be much older, as satellite resolution does not allow us to see clearly

689
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,900
at these older dates.

690
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:09,620
According to GP, much of the Dugway dump operations reside under nearby Granite Peak, which sits

691
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:14,340
just west of the alleged entrance in Avery and Ditto areas.

692
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:19,100
What is quite interesting to me is the fact the 388th Range Squadron out of Hill and Michael

693
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,300
Army Airfield runs multiple sites on and just north of the mountain.

694
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:28,300
I'd like to focus specifically on the mini-mute stations 10 and 2.

695
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:33,340
Mini-mutes are threat emitter systems commonly utilized to train pilots to recognize and

696
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:36,280
respond to various enemy radar threats.

697
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:41,600
One must wonder if the Granite Peak South Station has entrances to or interactions with

698
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,100
a supposed facility under the mountain.

699
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:49,740
MS's disclosures are truly astonishing, and I must preface I am speculating here, but

700
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:54,100
from MS's testimony, a strong thesis can be extracted.

701
00:55:54,180 --> 00:56:01,980
MS stumbled upon a Joint Army and USAAF MRTFB UFO legacy operation operating between Atec

702
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:07,220
and the 388th Range Squadron with the aid of white coat contractors such as Battelle

703
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:11,380
Memorial Institute and Jacobs Solutions, more on them later.

704
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:15,300
This program operates above and beneath Dugway Proving Ground.

705
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:20,300
The clandestine program utilizes the Avery Technical Center's internal rail system to

706
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:25,500
transport non-human craft and materials onto unmarked secretive Avery buildings such as

707
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,380
the test operations and classified storage buildings.

708
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,540
Program scientists and the 388th Range Squadron utilize the southern part of the Utah Test

709
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:39,860
and Training Range to test extraterrestrial vehicles or alien reproduction vehicles.

710
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:44,800
This would operate similarly to what Witness Ed described with the Joint UFO Reverse Engineering

711
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,900
Program between the Edwards 412th Test Wing and Nevada Test and Training Range.

712
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:55,460
The program also utilizes top chemistry and biology subject matter experts from Atec

713
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,900
and DPG's Chemical and Biological Defense Program to either study biologics or engage

714
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,260
with any relevant aspects of non-human craft.

715
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:09,620
The Dugway DUM communicates and operates alongside other DUM locations across the continental

716
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:16,940
United States, likely hidden within and below major military installations and MRTFBs.

717
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,460
A truly incredible thesis, but one that can be reasonably constructed based upon the

718
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:25,940
testimony of MS and study of Dugway Proving Ground.

719
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:34,580
Lastly, I just want to briefly touch on some contractor operations at Dugway.

720
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:40,340
Remember, MS claimed over half of Dugway's operations related to contracting work.

721
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:46,380
In fiscal year 2013, according to the GAO, Dugway's West Desert Test Range saw about

722
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:52,700
77% of acknowledged work conducted for the CBDP, Chemical Biological Defense Program

723
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,700
Enterprise.

724
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:59,540
Now, what contractor might come to mind that deals in-depth with chemical and biological

725
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,540
concepts?

726
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,540
That's right, Battelle Memorial Institute.

727
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:08,220
I have covered Battelle at length before, including their project STORK, which was tasked

728
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:13,260
by USG to study UAP, parallel but independent to Project Blue Book.

729
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:18,060
I have also investigated Battelle and their curious links to nickel-titanium alloys which

730
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:23,500
may just have been the shape memory alloy recovered from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico

731
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,500
crash.

732
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,100
I highly recommend viewing that project.

733
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:32,100
Battelle runs a host of biochem facilities, including the Battelle National Biodefense

734
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,920
Institute at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

735
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,640
This location has recently become entwined with UFO lore as a possible location where

736
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,280
non-human biologics are stored.

737
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,680
There is additionally now the alleged infamous exobiospheric organism molecular biologist

738
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,840
Reddit whistleblower testimony focused on this Battelle location.

739
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,740
But these claims are absent from this investigation as they require much more research.

740
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:02,040
To add further intrigue, at Fort Detrick, Battelle manages the National Biodefense Analysis

741
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:07,560
and Countermeasures Center FFRDC for the Department of Homeland Security, specifically

742
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,440
the DHS Undersecretary for Science and Technology.

743
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,640
I would once again like to draw attention to a primary thesis of this channel that FFRDC

744
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:23,560
and UARC often act as project managers, serving as subject matter experts performing R&D work

745
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:28,040
in joint USG and contractor UAP legacy programs.

746
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,600
And remember how we previously discussed the CBDP programs at Dugway?

747
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:38,880
While analyzing this joint multinational and interagency CBDP test and evaluation partners

748
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,920
chart we can see Dugway and Battelle are both listed as select few program locations.

749
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,720
In fact, the West Desert Test Center and Fort Detrick's National Interagency Biodefense

750
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:55,520
Campus at which Battelle operates are additionally quite intimate, serving as two of four of

751
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,640
CBDP's primary research and development and test and evaluation facilities.

752
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,560
Now I know that's a lot, but Battelle has historically also worked closely with Dugway,

753
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:11,880
including operating the Chemical and Biological Defense Information Analysis Center, CBIAC,

754
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,000
that operates at Dugway.

755
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,840
According to excellent UFO researcher Anthony Bregalia, Battelle additionally has a design

756
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,520
slash build division with capabilities for creating laboratories and other specialized

757
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,680
facilities.

758
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:29,880
In one article, Bregalia referenced multiple open source documents that discussed Battelle's

759
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,160
facility design and construction management work at Dugway.

760
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,160
According to these documents, Battelle has engineered enclosed testing facilities and

761
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:42,480
sealed structures at DPG that according to one technical report, quote, meet stringent

762
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,800
containment standards providing a degree of protection that has never been achieved before,

763
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,800
end quote.

764
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,600
Battelle's facility design services also include specialized locations such as clean

765
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,600
rooms.

766
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,240
Battelle also referenced back to the testimony of MS and the clean room that held the UFO.

767
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,920
Perhaps a full investigation into Battelle's construction work at DPG is warranted.

768
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,800
DPG and Fort Detrick's connections with each other and Battelle are quite interesting,

769
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,560
but this is where things get downright strange.

770
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:16,960
The director of Dugway's West Desert Test Center is one Mr. Ryan W. Harris.

771
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,560
Harris is, quote, responsible for the overall planning, directing, and evaluating all aspects

772
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:27,560
of work for the chemical, biological, and other acquisition test and training programs

773
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,240
executed by the test center, end quote.

774
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,800
Harris received a bachelor's in chemical engineering and served in the army as a chemical

775
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,800
officer.

776
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,280
In the year 2000, Harris would accept a project manager position working with Battelle at

777
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,480
Dugway.

778
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:47,320
This Battelle work saw Harris overseeing several testing and training programs and in 2004,

779
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:52,040
Harris would accept a project manager position with Dugway and work his way all the way up

780
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:58,120
the ranks until 2012, where he achieved the position as WTC test director, where he now

781
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:03,760
evaluates all aspects of the work for the chemical, biological, and other acquisition

782
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,000
test and training programs executed by the test center.

783
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,940
Interesting how a Battelle project manager becomes director of an MRTFB where witnesses

784
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:18,440
have claimed a UAP legacy program employing DOD chemists takes place.

785
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,920
But we don't stop there.

786
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,520
U.S. Army Chemical Engineering Corps member Greg Frank.

787
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,560
Frank served as a chemist for the Chemical Laboratory Division at Dugway Proving Ground

788
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,000
from 1984 to 1985, quote.

789
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,440
He directed and performed chemical studies and developed procedures for chemical testing

790
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,160
and analysis utilizing modern analytical instrumentation, end quote.

791
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,540
While serving as test officer, Frank would branch out into numerous vehicle and chemical

792
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:50,020
munition programs, developing material test plans and test operational plans.

793
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:55,260
When he left service in 1985, Frank joined Battelle as a project manager and principal

794
01:02:55,260 --> 01:03:04,340
investigator where he, quote.

795
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:09,980
As of 2008, Frank operated as executive vice president for Battelle Science and Technology

796
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:16,580
and is responsible for over 5,000 scientists, engineers, and supporting staff.

797
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:21,660
But believe it or not, these are not the only connections we can make with WDTC leadership

798
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,760
and Battelle.

799
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:28,300
We can also take a keen look at Anders Weyborg, former director of Special Programs Division

800
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,320
at the West Desert Test Center.

801
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:36,200
Now working for the DOE, Weyborg once served at Dugway, ensuring execution of daily operations

802
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,220
within the test center.

803
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:42,900
Before working at Dugway, Weyborg worked at Battelle, serving as a test director responsible

804
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,860
for T&E of chemical and biological defense equipment.

805
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:51,980
Battelle and Dugway share intimate connections, likely Mirian more than we have just scratched

806
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:52,980
today.

807
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:57,340
Other contractors at Dugway are of extreme interest as well and will likely serve as

808
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:02,820
suspects of future investigations, such as Jacob Solutions who performs range testing

809
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:05,900
and lab services at WDTC.

810
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:11,400
This contractor operates a premium facility at Dugway Ditto and sees strong ties to its

811
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,820
board of directors and the Carlyle Group.

812
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:19,100
However, due to the intense focus of Dugway on biochem weapons programs, Battelle will

813
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:24,700
remain our primary suspect in UAP legacy programs at Dugway Proving Ground.

814
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:29,400
Hey guys, it's Gerb and I'd like to thank you all so much for joining me today as we

815
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,060
took this extended look into Dugway Proving Ground.

816
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,020
Why did we partake in this investigation?

817
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:41,060
Well, for one, something I've noticed and I'm sure many others have, is discussion

818
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:46,580
of Dugway around UFOs and legacy programs are quite intertwined.

819
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:53,540
However, there is barely any other discussion or research or claims or testimony involving

820
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:54,540
Dugway.

821
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:59,780
I think the perfect example of this is the beginning Quest TV video featuring Nick Pope

822
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,700
talking about Area 51 to Area 52.

823
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:07,500
This entire 10-15 minute video on YouTube, of course the link will be in the description,

824
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:13,260
discusses Area 51 and Dugway and talks about it being the new Area 51.

825
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:19,540
This video even features words from Richard Dolan, however, zero evidence or testimony

826
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,220
or anything is presented here.

827
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:27,100
So after having the testimony of MS, after having some of the words of Stephen Greer,

828
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:33,340
AJ Craddock and others, I thought it very pertinent to actually dive into Dugway.

829
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:38,580
Now I have reason to believe that Dugway is indeed a premier legacy reverse engineering

830
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:41,140
material exploitation program.

831
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:46,180
So I wanted to sift through all of this information and present an argument, especially as we

832
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:52,180
started to look into Dugway structure and how Dugway is comprised of two major range

833
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,620
test facility bases, a huge piece of this investigation.

834
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:02,380
As we know with the testimony of Ed, his claims of a reverse engineering program covered

835
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:09,420
two Air Force MRTFBs, the Edwards 412 test wing and the Nevada test and training range.

836
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:14,700
Dugway gives us an interesting look because due to the testimony of MS, we can conclude

837
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:21,380
of a joint reverse engineering program versus two branches of the military MRTFBs, the Army's

838
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,900
West Desert Test Center and the Air Force's Utah test and training range.

839
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:31,780
This of course, that involves Army ATEC and their Joint Chemical Biological Defense Program

840
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:37,380
and the 388th range squadron out of nearby Hill Air Force Base.

841
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:43,620
I tried to do many connections between the 388th rands range squadron as it's listed

842
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:46,260
and the Edwards 412 test wing.

843
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,580
Unfortunately there is very little to chew on there.

844
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:53,060
I do think the argument presented here is strong enough and there's enough valuable

845
01:06:53,060 --> 01:07:00,180
data and listed data here for any policymaker or any individual with influence to conduct

846
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:04,100
a comprehensive analysis of MS and others claims.

847
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:10,820
Now, of course, twice in this video around the stiff sub training facility location,

848
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:15,540
I list the disclaimer that I was using only publicly available information.

849
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:22,820
Now, I do this because all the way back when discussing NSWC Crane in the testimony of

850
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:27,380
RA or we now know Randy Anderson, I caught a little bit of flack and a little bit of

851
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:34,420
fright for mentioning Crane and the possibility that this could be a catastrophic disclosure

852
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:38,580
and could be a breach of national security due to this being an underground location.

853
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:43,380
Therefore, when discussing the dumb locations, I needed to preface by saying this information

854
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:48,900
was all public domain and I thank you Stephen Greer for leaking that on the DPI archive

855
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:52,340
because that finally gave me a chance to talk about these locations.

856
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:58,500
Seen as the last time I covered MS, I was privy to these locations but did not think

857
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:02,340
it appropriate to list them but Greer took it upon himself to list Granite Peak in the

858
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:08,980
alleged dumb location by German Village himself so thank you for that and I must state once

859
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:16,500
again as I did in the last project, do not under any circumstances go looking for that location.

860
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:22,180
Dugway Proving Ground is protected land and protected airspace. These are military assets.

861
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:27,540
Do not go to the location, okay? If that is a location to a deep underground military base,

862
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:32,740
which I highly wager it is, do not go there, okay? I'll just make that very clear. Just

863
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:41,620
do not for your own safety, please. Don't. So there's other data to discuss surrounding

864
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:51,060
Dugway. As we saw with the Dugway history, there's not much linking Dugway to UAP legacy programs

865
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:57,380
unlike something like Edwards or Norton or even China Lake or White Sands Missile Range.

866
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:02,260
One of the biggest features of this project was of course the Garrison crash and then some of

867
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:07,620
the claims of Area 51 being moved to Area 52. Conversely for a place like Edwards we have the

868
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:13,140
story of Kent Sellen and the ARV and you know numerous craft and operations being cited at

869
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:19,060
Dugway. There is more in this video I wasn't able to include. One such story is the testimony of

870
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:24,660
Air Force Colonel Weinbrenner. Now Weinbrenner has a very interesting story as if anybody can

871
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:32,100
remember back to the Jesse Michaels interview with James Fox, filmmaker James Fox, Fox discusses a

872
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:40,020
film of the Holloman Air Force Base landing and how his friend Alan Sandler viewed this film

873
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:47,540
and told Fox about it. Well back in the 70s Alan Sandler and his co-video producer Robert Emanager

874
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:54,740
were attempting to make a documentary on UAP. This is when they were sequestered by two enlisted

875
01:09:54,740 --> 01:10:01,380
Air Force personnel and shown the Holloman film and were licensed to utilize the film but that

876
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:06,340
licensing was pulled soon thereafter. One of these individuals was Colonel Weinbrenner.

877
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:14,020
Now on Colonel Weinbrenner's deathbed to close friends and families he allegedly said that Utah

878
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:20,180
is where the alien bodies are stored. Now that's a very interesting disclosure. Where the alien

879
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:25,460
bodies are stored this would be a very interesting place for this to be Dugway. You know of course

880
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:31,140
quite often Fort Detrick is talked about. I do believe Lou mentioned this and imminent as well

881
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:36,820
but as a place for biologics to be stored and this is where much chemical and biological defense

882
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:46,020
systems are ran and there's extreme ties to Dugway with Fort Detrick. So there's also interesting

883
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:54,180
data to explore of Dugway being not just a craft exploitation program on the UTTR but also a

884
01:10:54,180 --> 01:11:00,820
biologic study area. Could this be where biologics autopsies take place? Where biological tissue is

885
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:05,460
studied quite possibly but this would be kept under wraps as any chemical and biological

886
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:11,380
data and information and study is incredibly secretive and incredibly classified as we've

887
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:18,100
seen with Dugway. You know Dugway's projects are not spoken of often and 77 percent of Dugway's

888
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:23,700
programs according to the GAO are conducted for the chemical and biological defense program.

889
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:29,620
I would like to know what everybody else here thought and while you're leaving your comments

890
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:35,220
let's also tuck into the testimony of MS. Of course I had talked to MS all the way back in

891
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:40,820
June of 2024 and those are the clips I have used for the conversation in this video exploration.

892
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:48,900
I do plan to interview MS again hopefully in person if that can be arranged. Hopefully

893
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:55,460
that can also be done with GP and the individual who claimed he helped build the railroad system

894
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:01,460
under Dugway. Such an investigation and interview with these three individuals would truly be

895
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:08,180
consequential. You know I find a lot of value in MS's testimony not because of him being reached

896
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:12,500
out to by the Senate select committee on intelligence which he indeed was. I said in the

897
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:18,900
project that he had received I have seen the outreach from these individuals wishing for him

898
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:27,060
to go to the hill to testify but also because his testimony at Ditto and Avery leads to such

899
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:35,300
fruitful research. As we've seen with Avery it has numerous fascinating buildings that could be

900
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:42,100
used for such operations classified storage test operations photo O&M internal rail system to the

901
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:47,860
Dugway deep underground facility. Just a very fascinating testimony to cover and I must add

902
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:54,020
with the Dugway dumb being just some small type of concrete facility out in the desert

903
01:12:54,020 --> 01:13:00,100
just serving as an elevator to a dumb where it's this entrance point doesn't serve to transport

904
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:08,900
vehicles or armor or logistics or weaponry or food or anything but personnel traveling down

905
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:14,660
I must be quite plain here in my videos I don't generally like to say well a source told me this

906
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:20,820
a source told me this a source told me this but I do have a friend that has formerly served in

907
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:28,980
the United States Army. This was in the early 2010s that has talked to me about traveling in

908
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:36,180
Stiff's subterranean facilities. I cannot reveal these locations but he said he traveled across

909
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:44,820
state lines between Stiff's in an underground rail system that went so fast it reminded him

910
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:51,620
of flying in a plane of which he has great fear. So the fear of a plane's acceleration is what he

911
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:58,580
felt in the train. What was interesting to me is the location to which he traveled the entrance way

912
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:07,140
to that location was a small what you could call janitorial building or kind of potable water

913
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:12,980
treatment building in the middle of nowhere just a small building nestled in a location that

914
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:19,060
accessing these buildings took you to an elevator to a deep underground facility. This is not the

915
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:24,580
only individual I've talked to who has accessed a stiff or a dumb maybe we'll call them stiffs

916
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:28,180
because it carries a little more weight. I've talked to numerous people who have this is why

917
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:33,140
this topic carries such great interest to me especially because dumbs or stiffs are indeed

918
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:40,500
real. As I said oftentimes for corporate facilities such as AT&T who at least in the 90s and 2000s

919
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:46,660
housed many underground server banks and ICBM storage locations underground and possibly

920
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:55,060
underwater under ocean surface as well as continuity of government COG installation. COG continuity of

921
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:59,780
government reminds me a lot of when Colonel John B. Alexander who isn't the most trustworthy in my

922
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:04,740
opinion talked about Majestic 12 being real and serving as a continuity of government type

923
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:10,260
institution. This also reminds me of what also reminds me of continuity of government

924
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:16,500
is the description of the dugway done by GP which can talk about transporting the president's plane

925
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:22,420
to anywhere in the country. So I hope everybody enjoyed this dive into Dugway. I'd like to know

926
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:27,860
what everybody thinks this was a very important project to me because you know just as in every

927
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:36,420
single video I discuss SDI the strategic defense initiative FFRDCs or UARCs I can now incorporate

928
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:42,260
such testimony of major range test facility bases and T&E test and evaluation research and

929
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:48,180
development test and evaluation RDT&E into my projects. Remember guys when he left service

930
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:55,860
witness Ed served on the Pentagon for Air Force RDT&E and this is where he claims that

931
01:15:55,860 --> 01:16:00,820
34 and 40 billion dollars went missing to non-authorized transfer of authority funds

932
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:07,300
in fiscal year I think 2013 and 2014 so Doge if you're watching go look at Air Force and possibly

933
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:13,620
Army RDT&E. Anyways what else can we discuss guys more interesting projects coming down the way

934
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:19,300
as I say in every project I do in fact have a Patreon if you want to support the channel

935
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:23,460
I don't gatekeep any content only support what you think the channel is worth and please remember

936
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:28,500
to like and subscribe guys these investigations are my heart and soul they do take a long time

937
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:34,020
so any comments about your thoughts on the investigation is much appreciated. If you've

938
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:39,060
noticed some oddness with the old eye here I'm dealing with some problems because that is what

939
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:43,220
happens when you grapple with individuals who do not wash their training equipment enough

940
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:50,180
do not wash the rash guard so thank you to that person who decided to wrestle with a very

941
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:56,900
disgusting rash guard I really appreciate that but I'm also quite elated guys because anybody

942
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:01,940
who watches the channel and has interacted with me knows I am an Alexander Volkanovsky superfan

943
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:08,820
and our glorious king has just been booked to fight Diego Lopez blockhead Diego Lopez at UFC 314

944
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:15,540
in Miami come April so I am elated about that that the dangerous power puncher Toporio is moving
