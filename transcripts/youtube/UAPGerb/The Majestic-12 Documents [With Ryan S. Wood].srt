1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
For decades, debate has raged on in ufology about the existence of a committee of elite

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,600
military leaders, government officials, and scientists tasked with the investigation,

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,100
study, and collection of UFOs and their occupants.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,320
This now infamous group was revealed through hundreds of allegedly leaked documents over

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,500
the course of 1984 to 1999 to be titled the Majestic 12 or MJ-12.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,740
Any viewer of my work will know I often reference the Majestic documents in MJ-12, such as my

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,620
Del Rio case where I bring up the Majestic document called the Eisenhower Briefing document,

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,100
in which I reference a December 1950 UFO crash retrieval stated to have occurred near the

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,180
Mexican-Texas border between El Indio and Guerrero.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,920
A crash retrieval Lou Elizondo has now stated to have occurred in his 2024 book, Imminent.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,200
So with the contentious nature surrounding the Majestic documents in ufology, the debunking

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,380
work done by professional skeptic Philip K. Glass and others, alongside the FBI's

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,180
to haphazardly write bogus across one set of documents to label all documents as false,

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,280
why cover the Majestic documents?

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,800
To me, the analysis of MJ-12 and the Majestic documents must consist of studying the documents

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,900
themselves, their origins, content, provenance, and connective tissue to not only other Majestic

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,380
documents but also acknowledged and declassified files, like the work done by the legendary

18
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,960
Stanton Friedman and world-class Ryan S. Wood.

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,100
This is why today I have partnered with fantastic UFO researcher Ryan S. Wood to explore the

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,920
Majestic documents.

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,360
Ryan and his father, Dr. Robert Wood, a former McDonnell Douglas rocket scientist, have spent

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,440
decades painstakingly scrutinizing the entire catalog of Majestic documents to unravel the

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,360
mystery that is the Majestic-12.

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,520
Hey guys, it's UAPGurb and thank you so very much for joining me, author of Magic

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:59,800
Eyes Only, and myself as we discuss the authenticity, origin, and context of the Majestic documents.

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,840
With the revelations of David Grush in the 21st century, the reality of UFO crash retrieval

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,860
and reverse engineering has made its way into the public zeitgeist.

28
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,880
This is why we must take a closer inspection of the highly debated group allegedly first

29
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,040
tasked with UFO crash retrievals, the Majestic-12.

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,220
Before we get into the interview, I want to take a brief moment to introduce the Majestic-12

31
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,340
for any newcomer to the subject.

32
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,740
I highly recommend reading Top Secret Magic by Stanton Friedman, studying Majestic Documents.com

33
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:37,040
written by Ryan and Dr. Bob, my all-time favorite book Magic Eyes Only by Ryan S. Wood, or reading

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,860
the incredible Medium articles by Blocked Epistemology.

35
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,660
The Majestic-12 is a group known from a series of controversial leaked documents to have been

36
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,640
tasked with UFO study, collection, and analysis.

37
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,840
The group seemingly rose to power around the time of the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash,

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,760
but with origins extending even earlier, around 1941 or 1942.

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,440
According to Stanton Friedman, the group allegedly consisted of 12 members, MJ 1-12, consisting

40
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,280
of six civilian and six military personnel.

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,240
Of the military people, two representatives each from the Army, Navy, and Air Force served

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,780
in the MJ-12.

43
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,080
The private sector saw seasoned research and development organizers and very strong intelligence

44
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,220
community leaders participate in the group.

45
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,940
Viewers of my Robert Saarbacher video will remember Dr. Vannevar Bush, head of the Office

46
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,840
of Scientific Research and Development, who was labeled a crucial founding member of the

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,000
Majestic-12.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,760
Other original members named in the Majestic documents include General Nathan Twining,

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,440
the leader of Project Sine, aka Project Saucer, in 1948.

50
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,760
James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy and first U.S. Secretary of Defense, who conveniently

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,600
threw himself out of a hospital window in 1949.

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,880
Donald H. Menzel, astronomer at Harvard and high-security consultant to the NSA and CIA.

53
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,720
Roscoe H. Hillencoder, Admiral, Navy Intelligence, and first Director of the CIA.

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,960
Walter B. Smith, General in the U.S. Army, Ambassador to the USSR, second Director to

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,920
the CIA, and Forrestal's replacement.

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,280
And Hoyt S. Vandenberg, USAF General, second Director of the Central Intelligence Group,

57
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,840
Air Force Chief of Staff.

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,440
And this is just a slice of the total members.

59
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,480
I highly recommend analyzing the MJ-12 master list created by Ryan Wood.

60
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,360
Many over the years have hypothesized what the magic in MJ-12 stands for.

61
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,160
User blockedepistemology hypothesizes this name is derived from the 1945 May Johnson

62
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
Atomic Energy Bill.

63
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,840
Excellent Reddit researcher, user HarryIsWhiteHot, believed magic was some sort of continuation

64
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,440
of a very high classification standard titled MAGIC, used during World War II.

65
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,740
I find myself believing MAGIC is an abbreviation for a Joint Intelligence Committee, possibly

66
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,980
something along the lines of Majority Joint Intelligence Committee 12.

67
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,100
But without further ado, let's talk to Ryan S. Wood and begin to dive into the origins

68
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,100
of the documents.

69
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:21,080
Yeah, well, the broad brush is that there's some 3,500 pages over 19 years from seven

70
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,260
different sources.

71
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:33,740
The first event was in 1984, when Jamie Chanderay, which was an LA TV producer, I believe, received

72
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,580
the Eisenhower briefing document, which Stan Friedman ultimately got in, outlines the

73
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,420
original 12 MJ-12 members in that document.

74
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:55,980
And that's the one that was taken around to the FBI, and several people submitted it to

75
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:02,220
the FBI, because the FBI is responsible for leaks of classified documents.

76
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:10,860
And the FBI took it to a variety of three-letter agencies and said, did you lose this?

77
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:17,140
And they said, well, no, we didn't lose this, we don't know anything about it.

78
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:23,540
And so after their process, they declared it bogus.

79
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,260
And despite the efforts of Stan Friedman to authenticate a whole variety of people that

80
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:43,620
were MJ-12 members, and then the other two different sources for that same document that

81
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:54,740
came into the field years after that, some with different marginalia, some with slightly

82
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,820
different three-hole punching.

83
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:05,260
And so, I mean, they aren't stunningly authentic in original paper or something like that.

84
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:12,580
But there are some other sources of that same document that have surfaced over time.

85
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,860
But it was a briefing for Eisenhower, and that was the first one.

86
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,700
And that sort of kicked things off and got Stan Friedman really pushing along.

87
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,260
Returning viewers of my channel will know the first ever Majestic document quite well,

88
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,260
the top secret Magic Eyes only Eisenhower briefing document.

89
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,260
This document stating to contain compartmentalized information essential to U.S. national security

90
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,380
was organized to brief president incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower on the Majestic 12 group

91
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,100
on November 18, 1952.

92
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:52,180
The document labels Operation Majestic 12 as a top secret R&D slash intelligence operation

93
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,300
reporting solely to the President of the United States, set up by a classified executive

94
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,060
order of President Harry Truman by recommendation of Dr. Vannevar Bush and Secretary Forrestal

95
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,260
on the 24th of September, 1947.

96
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,660
Funny enough, in the daily appointment history of Harry Truman, we can find a meeting with

97
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,100
SecDef James Forrestal and Dr. Vannevar Bush arranged at the suggestion of Forrestal.

98
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,540
The briefing document includes a list of all 12 sitting MJ-12 members, including General

99
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:27,540
Walter B. Smith, who replaced the deceased Secretary Forrestal on August 1, 1950.

100
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,660
And again, we can find an actual appointment held off-record with Truman and Walter B.

101
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,660
Smith on this exact date.

102
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,140
The briefing document discusses the hysteria caused by saucer sightings of Kenneth Arnold

103
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,340
in the summer of 1947 and subsequent failures to pursue these discs in flight.

104
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:50,260
July 7, 1947 oversaw the beginning of the MJ-12 with the Roswell crash.

105
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:56,180
Northwest of Roswell Army Airfield experienced the now most famous UFO crash in history,

106
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,300
which according to the Eisenhower briefing document, saw craft and body collection efforts

107
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,060
by General Nathan Twining and Dr. Vannevar Bush.

108
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,620
A soon-to-be sitting MJ-12 member, Dr. Detlev Brank, performed autopsies on the bodies and

109
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,580
coined the term EBE, or Extraterrestrial Biological Entity.

110
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,180
The Roswell team and Dr. Donald Menzel concluded the craft was of non-human origin and likely

111
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,300
originated from a solar system far removed from our own.

112
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,900
The report discusses forms of writing on the Roswell craft, something primary witness Jesse

113
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,860
Marcel Sr. and Jr. would claim to witness on a small piece of metallic debris.

114
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,140
The Roswell report led directly to the creation of projects Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book with

115
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,300
very limited interaction between these official programs and the MJ-12.

116
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,460
And I'll draw your attention back to a whistleblower I covered, Brigadier General Steven

117
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,580
Lovekin, who claimed to have observed pieces of Roswell debris in a classified portion of

118
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,780
Project Blue Book far removed from the official reports.

119
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:04,260
The document then discusses the 1950 El Indio crash, touched on in 2024 by Lou Elizondo,

120
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,220
and makes specific mention of the Atomic Energy Commission and Sandia National Labs.

121
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:18,980
Curiously, near the end of the document is listed a contingency plan, MJ-1949-04 P-7-8.

122
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,140
And just remember that contingency plan.

123
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,940
Tireless work was done by Stanton Friedman,

124
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,900
authenticating the Eisenhower briefing document in his book Top Secret Slash Magic.

125
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,860
But there are two specific investigations I want to mention.

126
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,180
In 1989, Friedman physically traveled to the National Archives and reviewed

127
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,580
files of the Office for the Secretary of Defense.

128
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,100
Within these documents were numerous November 18, 1952 briefing documents

129
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,340
for President-elect Eisenhower.

130
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,740
None of these briefings mentioned MJ-12,

131
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,780
but it is fact the Truman administration was indeed briefing Eisenhower on this date.

132
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:59,780
Investigation 2 circles around the labeled briefing officer, Admiral Roscoe H. Hillencoder.

133
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,220
Debunkers of the majestic documents claim Hillencoder was sent to Korea in 1950 for six years.

134
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,700
However, Friedman was able to determine Hillencoder was indeed present in Brooklyn,

135
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,540
New York in late 1952 when he was made head of the 3rd Naval District in New York.

136
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,620
So Hillencoder could have indeed been present at the Washington briefings on November 1952.

137
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,020
And many MJ-12 files with Hillencoder as a key individual exist,

138
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,340
though they do require further research.

139
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:34,820
Such as this February 11, 1948 Hillencoder to Truman Majestic Black Book Summaries document,

140
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,900
which makes direct mention to MAGIC.

141
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:44,100
Or this September 19, 1963 CIA Director Hillencoder to Donald Menzel Memo,

142
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,820
which sees the director congratulating his fellow alleged MJ-12 member on his book

143
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,460
regarding what we can assume was successful obfuscation of the UFO reality.

144
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,140
And lastly, we have some key clues on a September 19, 1947 memo from Hillencoder

145
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,300
to Joint Intelligence Committee.

146
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,780
This majestic document memo, allegedly dated just before Bush and Forrestal's request to create MJ-12,

147
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,140
is titled quote,

148
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,940
Memorandum for the Military Assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee, end quote,

149
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,620
aka MAGIC.

150
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,700
The memo requests a classified intelligence project, quote,

151
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,220
We recovered one craft, captured one, end quote.

152
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,180
This memo states no clear coordinated scientific examination was possible until,

153
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,260
quote, unquote, we got a clear directive from the president.

154
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,900
The memo also states Wright Field had a new biological laboratory.

155
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:44,020
The Joint Research and Development Board and the FBI, MI5 and MI6 were helping with the effort.

156
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,260
And finally, guys, back to Mr. Wood.

157
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,580
The other one that's really big is the Special Operations Manual,

158
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,460
Extraterrestrial Entities Technology Recovery and Disposal.

159
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,300
And that was leaked in 1994 to Don Berliner,

160
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,780
who was an Aviation Week and Space reporter in Washington, D.C.

161
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,300
And it was an undeveloped film.

162
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,060
It came in a little green box and they went and my father and I and,

163
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,500
well, not me, but my father and Don went to the dark room and developed it

164
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,180
and got all the original images.

165
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:36,500
I'll just pull a couple sheets out just for fun to show you.

166
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,580
This is, you know, it came in an Echo binder along the edge over here.

167
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,020
And also it came with the change control page, which is difficult to see,

168
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:59,620
but it says Kirkland Air Force Base Unit KB88, Building 21, Kirkland Air Force Base N.M.X.

169
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,700
We found that there was a Building 21.

170
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,740
I think it's now called Building 40 back then.

171
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:16,660
And the fact that the abbreviation for the stamp, Kirkland Air Force Base N.M.X,

172
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:24,580
is the correct postal abbreviation for 1954 for New Mexico.

173
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:32,580
If it said N.M., that would have been a hallmark of bakery or an anachronism

174
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,060
that would be worthy of lots of investigation.

175
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,540
Mr. Wood and myself will speak on the special operations manual throughout this video,

176
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,180
so we will only go into brief detail here.

177
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,340
The manual, according to Ryan Wood, Dr. Robert Wood, and Stanton Friedman,

178
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,980
is equally, if not more authentic than the Eisenhower briefing document.

179
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,180
Friedman has even stated,

180
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,900
quote, the Majestic 12 document's problem is complex and extensive.

181
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,900
On balance, it appears that the EBD, TFM, and CTM are almost certainly genuine.

182
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,780
The SOM 101 memo is very likely genuine, end quote.

183
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,620
Debate has raged on for decades now if the document is a hoax,

184
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,180
real, or possibly Soviet disinformation.

185
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,780
Later in the interview, we will do an entire analysis into the special operations manual,

186
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,820
or the SOM 101 as I'll refer to it.

187
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,220
But for now, understand this manual, allegedly written in 1954

188
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,180
and initially housed in Kirkland Air Force Base,

189
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,540
serves as a comprehensive summary of majestic operations

190
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,660
for quote, unquote, Majestic 12 units, and quote, unquote, authorized personnel.

191
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,460
The manual contains everything from MJ-12 full operational capacity

192
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,700
and MODIS operandi, NHI craft and body descriptions,

193
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,780
to MJ-12 recovery and disinformation protocols.

194
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,340
Similar to his masterpiece, Magic Eyes Only,

195
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,740
Ryan Wood has attributed a weighted authenticity rating to every document

196
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,020
based on factors such as direct firsthand witnesses,

197
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,260
forensic analysis if possible, document source, etc.

198
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,860
The special operations manual and Eisenhower briefing document

199
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,580
are two of the few pieces Wood has rated with the highest level of authenticity.

200
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,540
But are there others with such high confidence?

201
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,140
But I would also add the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit document,

202
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:28,020
because the government's acknowledged the existence of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit,

203
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:33,300
part of the Stephen J. Chamberlain Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence,

204
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,460
Technical and Scientific Directorate, Counter Intelligence Group,

205
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:47,860
IPU, Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, all these hierarchies down in the 40s time frame.

206
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,260
Well, this was 47, where the IPU document.

207
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,140
But what's interesting about the IPU document, which is on majesticdocuments.com,

208
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,020
people can read it.

209
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,300
And in my book, Magic Eyes Only, is details about the Roswell crash.

210
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,020
When it crashed at 2332 Mountain Standard Time, it dropped off radar.

211
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:21,460
And it had discussions of body parts inside the craft in handwritten notes.

212
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:33,140
And it had discussions of autopsies of the aliens done by Dietlef Bronk and Charles Ethan Ray,

213
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,380
which when I started to look around, I said, who's Charles Ethan Ray?

214
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:48,100
And he was a medical corps expert with Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project.

215
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,540
And I called up his daughter in Seattle and said,

216
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,740
do you think your father could have autopsied an alien?

217
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,300
And she didn't hesitate at all and said, yes.

218
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:07,860
Not that she knew that he did it, but it's clear in her mind that,

219
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,220
oh, absolutely, this is the sort of stuff he would have been tapped to do.

220
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:20,100
So I mean, there's just more and more detailed stories about the IPU in that document.

221
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:29,860
And so those three, I mean, each one has its own basket of interesting facts and authenticity.

222
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,980
Viewers of this channel will know recently I have been discussing the Interplanetary

223
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,500
Phenomenon Unit, the U.S. Army's in-house unofficial department in the 50s, for an

224
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,500
assistant chief of staff for intelligence to study UFOs. The IPU, initially discovered through

225
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:53,300
FOIA requests after initial DOD denial, exists only through quote unquote institutional memory.

226
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:59,460
I highly recommend reading Anthony Bregaglia's piece on the IPU. The existence of this division

227
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,540
was first revealed on September 6, 1980, in a FOIA request by Richard Hall and later confirmed

228
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:13,300
in a 1984 FOIA request by UFO researcher William Steinman. It took until the 1990s for the USG to

229
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:19,060
state all records were destroyed. Even though Hall's 1980 request oversaw the Army Director of

230
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,980
Counterintelligence state all IPU records were surrendered to Blue Book. Anyways, as Ryan stated,

231
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,100
on MajesticDocuments.com we can find two IPU documents within the MJ-12 documents.

232
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:38,020
IPU Field Order and IPU Report. The Interplanetary Phenomenon Field Order lists a July 4, 1947

233
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,060
correspondence of a situation occurring the day before the memo requesting personnel including

234
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:48,820
an aeronautical engineer and medical doctor cleared for quote, need to know, end quote.

235
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,020
And this date should ring a bell as occurring right before the Roswell crash. The IPU report

236
00:19:54,020 --> 00:20:00,580
first made its way into the public on July 16, 1995 and lists astonishing information authorized

237
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,900
by Lieutenant General John A. Samford and approved by CIA Director Alan Dulles. Some of you may

238
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,300
remember Samford giving the famous press conference alongside Roswell General Roger Ramey post the 1952

239
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:19,380
UFOs over Washington DC incident. This document explores in great detail the events of the Roswell

240
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,740
UFO crash including initial tracking and assessment of the two sites of the crashed disc.

241
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,820
A very key clue in this document is the mention that some Roswell Army airfield investigators

242
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,180
at LZ-1, the debris field seen by Brazel and Marcel, thought the wreckage may have been a

243
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,980
Project Mogul balloon until Los Alamos personnel determined the wreckage was something quote,

244
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,020
unquote, out of this world. If you know anything about the Roswell crash you'll know it's often

245
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,820
explained away as a Project Mogul balloon. And this was revealed after the initial

246
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,420
weather balloon cover story in the U.S. Air Force's 1994 report, The Roswell Report.

247
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,860
The Roswell Report states the Mogul flight that was misidentified as a large metallic flying saucer

248
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,220
with bodies was Mogul flight number four, which allegedly launched on June 4, 1947.

249
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,060
However, in 2024, Project Mogul's field operations director, Dr. Alan Crary,

250
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:18,100
revealed with evidence, flight number four never took place on this day and was indeed cancelled

251
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:24,100
due to weather. Anyways, the IPU report states a radiobiological team and security detail from

252
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:31,220
Sandia National Labs were summoned by Colonel S.B. Housebrook. Chosen scientists consisted of AEC

253
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,660
personnel including J. Robert Oppenheimer, Werner von Braun, and others. And before you say this

254
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,340
sounds too fantastical, remember von Braun's mentor, Herman Osberth, performed serious analysis

255
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,980
on UFO flight characteristics. Twining, Vandenberg, and others are named within this

256
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,940
report as aiding in the recovery effort and overall operation. And an interesting line here,

257
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,780
quote, it has become known to CIC that some of the recovery operation was shared with representative

258
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,980
John F. Kennedy, end quote. I'm not going to spend too much more time on the IPU report,

259
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,100
but as Wood stated, Detlev Brank is named as assisting in the autopsy. The report then

260
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,620
discusses the NHI bodies, body parts seemingly dissected similar to a frog scattered at the

261
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,300
primary crash site, and the death of multiple Sandia lab techs due to a form of contamination.

262
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:25,620
And I recently discussed this contamination in my 1974 Koyama, Mexico crash retrieval case.

263
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,540
Based on the documents Ryan Wood has the most confidence are in fact legitimate,

264
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,660
I asked him to describe robustly what exactly compromises the Majestic 12,

265
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,620
how various named members fit into the group, and the impact such an organization had on

266
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:48,900
ufology at the time of the initial MJ-12 documents being leaked. Well, it's a top secret research

267
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:55,380
and development intelligence gathering organization that was formed by executive order of the

268
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:06,580
in September 24th, 1947. 1947 was when the Atomic Energy Act was created, when the CIA was created

269
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:14,180
and sort of the OSS was transitioned, Office of Strategic Services, which was the CIA at the time

270
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:20,180
into the CIA, and they formed this top secret research and development intelligence gathering

271
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:25,220
organization. And it was, you know, headed by Vannevar Bush, part of the

272
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,500
Office of Research and Development, OSRD, and this is where

273
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,900
Eric Walker, Dr. Eric Walker lived working for Vannevar Bush and ultimately took over

274
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:50,820
the organization and was widely understood to be familiar with MJ-12, well leading it

275
00:23:51,540 --> 00:24:00,100
in that group. So the names of the people caught a lot of attention and Stan did a lot of work and

276
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:06,500
has written his book Top Secret Magic, I think, which highlights a lot of the research around

277
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:14,260
the various people. He dug into Carl Sagan, which was a person that shouldn't have been

278
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:22,340
on the list, sort of, you know, he was a big debunker. But when Stan finally went to the

279
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:31,060
various archives and dug around, he found lots of correspondence between other MJ-12 members and

280
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:39,540
so that was, you know, interesting and powerful for the authenticity of the document. But it was,

281
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:45,060
again, it was a photocopy, well actually was film, it was undeveloped film, just like the

282
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:52,100
special operations manual that arrived. It might have been from the same source, but it certainly

283
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
wasn't mailed the same way.

284
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:06,980
Eric A. Walker. In my video on physicist Robert Sarbacher, I discussed how Dr. Sarbacher directly

285
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,820
named Vannevar Bush as a key figure studying UFOs within the U.S. government. During conversations

286
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:18,100
with Stanton Friedman, Dr. Sarbacher, who was a member of Bush's Research and Development Board,

287
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,340
mentioned Dr. Eric A. Walker as a key figure connected to UFO crash retrievals. Walker was

288
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,780
contacted by researcher William Steinman and not only confirmed the existence of the MJ-12,

289
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,300
but actually admitted his own presence at the 1965 Kexburg, Pennsylvania, crash retrieval.

290
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,020
I highly recommend revisiting my video here.

291
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:43,140
So, I mean, going to the special operations manual that you mentioned with the Ray Z, there's so

292
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:50,100
many hallmarks of authenticity in that particular document. I can start with the fact that we took

293
00:25:50,100 --> 00:26:02,020
it to a retired government printing officer, General, not General, but McCarter in Washington,

294
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:11,300
D.C. He retired from the U.S. government printing office maybe like six months before we visited

295
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:18,580
him. And we, you know, went to his house and set it up on a card table and slid the document across.

296
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,300
And he looked at it and said, well, you know, by the title, Extraterrestrial Entities Technology

297
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,660
Recovery and Disposal, I would think it's fake. But then he flipped through the documents and saw

298
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,860
that the Zs were raised and said, oh, this is an artifact of hot lead printing press. Besides the

299
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:41,700
fact that he checked it for everything. I mean, he said the fonts are right. The indentations are

300
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:53,300
correct. The use of M dashes in MJ-12 long dash clearance is correct. The capitalization of

301
00:26:53,300 --> 00:27:02,260
first aid was correct for the period. So he went through a bunch of subtleties that we didn't

302
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:10,100
understand or perceive at the time to highlight the fact that it was real in his mind and

303
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,060
ultimately concluded that, yeah, the CIA probably printed it in a cage down on 10th Street.

304
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:24,420
That was his opinion at the time. With Mr. Wood passionately discussing his authentication

305
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,780
methods of the MJ-12 Special Operations Manual, now is the perfect time to discuss the contents

306
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:36,900
of this absolutely mind boggling document. SOM-1 was sent anonymously to Don Berliner in 1994 and

307
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:44,260
consisted of undeveloped 35 millimeter triax film authenticated to 1954. Labeled top secret magic

308
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,580
eyes only, the manual details the full operational capacity and mission of the majestic 12. As

309
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,780
mentioned by Mr. Wood, we see the document control is regressed to a singular stamp of Kirtland Air

310
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:03,380
Force Base, New Mexico. The document control page shows us MJ-12 members, MJ-01 and MJ-04,

311
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:11,540
who altered the document from 1954 to 1958. Initials listed here are EWL and JRT, two names

312
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:16,340
Ryan has actually tracked and we will discuss shortly. And now we get into the meat of this

313
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:22,020
document, quote, this manual has been prepared especially for majestic 12 units, end quote.

314
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:28,100
Its purpose is to present all aspects of MJ-12 so authorized personnel will have a better understanding

315
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,660
of the goals of the group, be able to more expertly deal with UFOs,

316
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:37,700
ET tech and entities and increase the efficiency of future operations.

317
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,980
Section 1 project goals and purposes of this document make some startling revelations.

318
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:50,020
1. MJ-12 considers unidentified flying objects UFOBs to be a matter of the very highest order

319
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,140
of national security. 2. There would be a negative impact on the public with general

320
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:02,580
knowledge of the UFO situation. 3. Danger present if advanced tech falls into the hands of adversaries.

321
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:09,140
And 4. MJ-12 was established on the 24th of September 1947 under recommendation by

322
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,740
Vannevar Bush and Forrestal. The goals of MJ-12 are clearly outlined here as well.

323
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:21,380
1. Recovery for scientific study of all materials and devices of foreign or ET manufacture.

324
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:26,900
Recovery by any and all means by group. This immediately reminds me of the 1974

325
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,420
Koyama case with the American retrieval team finding the craft in Mexico at all costs.

326
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:38,980
2. Recovery for study of all entities and remains of entities of non-terrestrial origin through

327
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,460
independent action by those entities or by misfortune or military action.

328
00:29:51,380 --> 00:30:03,620
3. Establishment and administration of special teams to accomplish the above operations,

329
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:08,980
which reminds me for the third video in a row of Christopher Sharpe's article on the CIA, OGA,

330
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:15,380
and JSOC being behind crash retrieval operations. 4. Establishment and admin of special secure

331
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:21,220
facilities located at secret locations within USA for providing receiving, processing,

332
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:27,300
analysis, and study of any and all materials and entities classified as extraterrestrial.

333
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,580
5. Covert operations carried in collusion with the CIA both home and abroad.

334
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:39,700
And 6. Establishment and absolute secrecy of all operations. As of the time of the alleged creation

335
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:46,340
of this document in 1954, MJ-12 does not consider NHI to be a threat, consisting of a benign presence

336
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:52,020
but with technology far beyond human science. The group had in possession several recovered

337
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:58,980
dead biologics. Section 1 General begins to define the scope of the Majestic-12, determination,

338
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,740
documentation, collection, and disposition of debris, devices, craft, and occupants.

339
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,940
This section defines ET technology as aircraft not manufactured by human power,

340
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,740
objects that appear as one of several shapes and configurations and exhibit

341
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:20,420
extraordinary flight characteristics, consisting of materials exhibiting characteristics beyond

342
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:26,660
science. And this section even describes EBEs, creatures, humanoid or otherwise,

343
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,700
whose evolutionary process differs demonstrably from that of Homo sapiens.

344
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,460
And now we get to my favorite part of this entire document, the description of the craft.

345
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,580
Elliptical or disc-shaped craft appear to be metallic and dull in color, whose appearance

346
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:49,060
consists of two pie pans or shallow dishes pressed together. SOM 101 even lists some dimensions of

347
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,740
these craft. They are 50 to 300 feet in diameter, with their thickness near 15% of the total

348
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:01,380
diameter. A dome extends above the disc, about 30% of the disc diameter, and extends 4 to 6 feet

349
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:07,940
above the main body. This dome may or may not include windows or ports. Lights on the craft

350
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:13,940
exist on the top, bottom, and rim that only function during operation. There's no antenna

351
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:20,500
or projections, but there are three extendable sets of landing gear. Cigar shape or tic tacs

352
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:28,100
are considered very rare. They can be 2,000 feet long and 95 feet thick. They do not operate in

353
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:34,580
lower atmosphere and travel at excess of 7,000 miles per hour. They do not engage in the rapid,

354
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:41,220
erratic or instantaneous maneuvers the smaller craft do. The ovoid circular or teardrop shapes

355
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,260
look almost like an ice cream cone, round at the large end and tapering to a near point at the

356
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:52,180
other. They are 30 to 40 feet long and have a diameter 20% of the length. The craft have

357
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,980
a bright light at the end point and the craft travels pointing down. And lastly, we have the

358
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:03,540
airfoil or triangular shape. These were considered new tech due to rarity of recent observations.

359
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,580
The craft appeared to be an isosceles triangle, with their longest side being near 300 feet

360
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,620
length. Little was known about the performance capabilities, but they operated appearingly

361
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:20,340
similar to the disc or ovoid shape. SOM101 then begins to go into description of extraterrestrial

362
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:26,500
biological entities, listing a Type 1 and Type 2, and thank you to Bill McDonald for the art here.

363
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,660
EBE1s look humanoid. They are 5 to 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighing 80 to 100 pounds.

364
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:39,300
They have larger, more rounded craniums with chalky yellow, thick, slightly pebbled pale skin.

365
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:45,300
They have small eyes wide set that are almost almond shape, with brownish black irises and

366
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:52,180
very large pupils and grey whites. Their mouths are wide, nearly lipless. They have fine hair,

367
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:58,020
not confined to underarm and groin. Their body is thin, with no fat and good muscles.

368
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,540
EBE1 has small hands, four long digits, no thumb, but webbing.

369
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,220
The description of the Type 2 EBE will remind you as much more of a classic grey.

370
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,980
They are humanoid, but 3 feet 5 inches to 4 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 25 to 50 pounds.

371
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,900
Their large, elongated head is larger proportionally to that of a human or EBE1.

372
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,940
Their eyes are large, slanted, and nearly wrap around their head, showing only pure black.

373
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:32,260
The nose appears to be two small slits above a slit-like mouth with no external ears.

374
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,780
Their skin is pale blue, greyish, fine-celled, and smooth.

375
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,020
They have no hair, leading MJ-12 to believe these creatures are not mammalian.

376
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,940
Their hands have three long fingers plus a long thumb.

377
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,820
They have four toes, jointed with a membrane.

378
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,540
The document then gives astounding descriptions of extraterrestrial technology recovered from

379
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:58,100
crash sites from 1947 to 1953. This date range includes Roswell to Kingman.

380
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:03,300
Metallurgical analyses show the materials were not known to terrestrial science at the time.

381
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,860
The material showed incredible strength and extreme resistance in proportion to weight

382
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:12,340
and size appearing similar to aluminum foil or aluminum magnesium sheeting.

383
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,740
Identical to the claims of primary Roswell witness Jesse Marcel Senior down to the

384
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,980
inclusion of inscriptions on material. In the press blackout section,

385
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,900
we find information extremely pertinent to today's age.

386
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,820
Media denial, discrediting witnesses, deceptive statements.

387
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,780
There are countless examples I can discuss here, but I recommend watching my UFO Stigma video

388
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,380
and paying key attention to the Robertson Panel and Condon Committee,

389
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,740
and also look at the reprisals against David Grush.

390
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,300
Secure the area, removal and transport, and cleaning the area all detail systems and

391
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,100
protocol for crash retrieval. What is of extreme interest here is the specific mention that any

392
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,740
specific craft or device that appears to be functional is designated to Red Team.

393
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,700
I can't help but think back to R.A. and how one piece of technology he observed at the

394
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,980
off-world technologies division was designated a weapon during recovery due to an energetic

395
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,380
discharge. But I asked Mr. Wood if he had ever come across this Red Team before.

396
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:19,540
I'd have to look, but I mean, I recall Blue Fly and Blue Teams as well. I mean, I think the term

397
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:26,900
Red Team and Blue Team are the same teams, so to speak, in crash retrievals. But, you know,

398
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:35,220
right in the front description of the Special Operations Manual, they have,

399
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:44,100
they mention these MJ-12 recovery teams. And I think in the,

400
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,820
well, you know, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, they call it the Blue Lab.

401
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,980
Now on to Section 16. Special or unusual conditions has a very interesting note here.

402
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,460
Should the need for public disclosure become necessary, the majestic team was to issue

403
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:09,300
Contingency Plan MJ-1949-04P-78. Remember this from the Eisenhower briefing document?

404
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:16,020
We don't have the contingency plan. It's interesting that in the back of the Special

405
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:25,860
Operations Manual, there's a series of references in the back, and they weren't supplied.

406
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,780
That's the missing appendix too, right?

407
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:35,140
Yeah, that's the missing appendix for references. I mean, it's in the back here, but

408
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:44,260
for example, the photographic references were all correct, and you can go find them. So they're

409
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:54,500
correctly referenced in the back. And then there's also another sort of authenticity point is the

410
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:06,260
the UFOB, Unidentified Flying Object Identification Guide, that is listed in the manual,

411
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:15,860
but was not supplied as photocopies, original photocopies. But other FOIA documents provided

412
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:22,740
a typed version of it, not typeset, but just typed. But when my father retyped it all,

413
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:30,660
following the format of the manual, it perfectly matched the page numbers in the table of contents

414
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:37,540
and fit like a glove right in there. Section 17 Extraterrestrial Classification Table is truly

415
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:43,860
consequential for analyzing this document. Intact craft, damaged devices, identified and

416
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:51,380
unidentified fragments, and weapons were all to go to Area 51-S4. If you say Area 51 wasn't built in

417
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:58,180
1954, we'll discuss this shortly. Media, electronic recordings, maps, charts, etc. were to go to

418
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:04,340
Kirtland Air Force Base Building 21. Supplies and provisions, as well as deceased entities,

419
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:10,420
were to be sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Blue Room. If Blue Room rings a bell besides Mr. Wood

420
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,540
just commenting on it, remember in my UFO whistleblowers video, Senator Harry Goldwater

421
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:21,300
was denied access to the contents of the Wright-Patterson Blue Room by General Curtis LeMay.

422
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:32,020
I think the government does know. I can't back that up, but I think that at Wright-Patterson Field,

423
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:37,460
if you could get into certain places, you'd find out what the Air Force and the government

424
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:47,620
knows about UFOs. Reportedly, a spaceship landed. It was all hushed up, quieted, and nobody ever

425
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:54,340
have never heard about much of it. I called Curtis LeMay and I said, General,

426
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:02,260
I know we have a room at Wright-Patterson where you put all this secret stuff.

427
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:11,140
Could I go in there? I've never heard him get mad, but he got madder than hell at me,

428
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,700
cussed me out, said, don't ever ask me that question again.

429
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,780
And speaking of General Curtis LeMay.

430
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:29,940
We have accommodation from Curtis LeMay to Harry B. Cooper, which is the father of Tim Cooper,

431
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:38,500
where many of these majestic documents came, and for his outstanding work at the USAF

432
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:45,860
program. I can supply you that document. You can put it up on the screen.

433
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:57,700
So that's another example of why in the world would Curtis LeMay sign accommodation

434
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:09,620
for somebody for their USAF program. It just makes no sense if it's not totally real. I'm just trying

435
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:20,180
to find a copy of it quickly. Yeah, I mean, it's hard to read here, but this is their seal and

436
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:27,380
accommodation. And it's to Harry B. Cooper, master sergeant, distinguished himself by

437
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,340
meritorious service as a non-commissioned officer in charge of printing management

438
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,380
branch and non-commissioned officer in charge of camera section, publishing division,

439
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,460
command directorate of administration of services headquarters, air defense command,

440
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:53,620
Int Air Force Base Colorado from 30 September 57 to 1 June 63. So he was at Int Air Force Base

441
00:41:53,620 --> 00:42:03,460
between 57 and 63, looking at photographs of UFOs and printing all sorts of classified documents.

442
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:13,700
And, you know, I think it's Harry's relationship to this UFO topic and the friends that he made

443
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:26,340
during that time that allowed those friends to decide that I want to give stuff to Harry's son,

444
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:37,460
Tim Cooper, and several of the mailbox drops that had a lot of these documents from

445
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:46,180
ostensibly the interplanetary phenomenon unit officer or moon dust officer came from.

446
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:52,980
Back to section 17, living entities were to be directed solely to OPNAC BBS 01. Of course,

447
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,260
OPNAV, not OPNAC, stands for the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. There are some who

448
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,460
guess this acronym stands for the Oceanic Platform for the North Atlantic and Caribbean, and that

449
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,980
BBS stands for the Bermuda Biological Station now called BIOS, the Bermuda Institute of Oceanic

450
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:15,380
Sciences, but there's really no proof here. SOM 101 continues with packaging and shipping protocols

451
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:21,540
for EBE life and states, quote, loss of EBE life is acceptable, and also details in figure

452
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:26,820
four, the extraterrestrial craft referenced earlier in the document. Here we observe classic

453
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:32,900
saucer and triangle shapes, but also the conical shape, which closely resembles the 1976 Tehran

454
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,300
Iran UFO case and the Cash Landrum case. You know, in 54, now they have the triangle shape,

455
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,660
they have the ice cream cone shape, they got the cigar shape, the typical saucer shape.

456
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:54,740
But I draw your attention to the triangles and the ice cream cone, which is, you know,

457
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:02,580
famous for the Cash Landrum case, and triangles are, this is some of the earliest mentions of

458
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:07,780
flying triangles. But anyways, let's circle back to the document control page and analyze the

459
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:16,020
initials EWL and JRT. Inside the control page, which is typical of every highly classified

460
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:22,500
document, this was apparently two points above top secret, according to the document,

461
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,060
classifications are different now, and it's pretty much, I believe, an Air Force document.

462
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:37,140
So I went to the Albuquerque phone book, pulled it up for 1954, 55, 56. I mean,

463
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:47,780
the entries in the change control page span from 54 to 57, I believe. And they have the initials.

464
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:56,740
And so I looked in the phone book and found all the initials, and there were two people, Jess R.

465
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:05,620
Totten and Captain Lewis, I think. They both lived on Perimeter Road, like four or five houses

466
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:16,180
from each other, inside Kirkland Air Force Base at the right time. And that's in the authenticity

467
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:26,500
discussions on the specialoperationsmanual.com website. It's in my book. And I'm working on

468
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:34,180
a new updated pamphlet that will have the whole manual and all the authenticity discussion that

469
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:41,860
people can read just easily. So I found them, and then I hired a private investigator

470
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:54,020
to go find them. And well, I actually found one guy, one JRT, but he said he's not the right guy,

471
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:59,940
despite being there at the right time. And he was the one who lived on the street near

472
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,620
kind of what you found from the phone book at the time near Kirkland, correct?

473
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:10,500
Well, I didn't go to... So the process is really to go to the adjutant general's

474
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:21,620
listing in government document libraries to find their name and serial number. And when you get the

475
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:28,100
serial number, you can get their national personnel record center files. And then you can start digging

476
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:37,380
around and try to find these people. And I found one JRT, which I thought was the right person,

477
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:44,820
and went to his house. He took the meeting. I was surprised and pulled out a FedEx envelope with

478
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:51,300
this thing. I'm sure he probably thought I was from the CIA or something. And opened it up,

479
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:59,700
handed it to him and said, is this you? And he looked at it for a while and looked at the

480
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:05,540
initials and said, no. Well, I asked him, well, what did you do at Kirkland Air Force Base

481
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:14,100
on that time? Well, I was sort of a psychological counselor or officer. I mean, he basically sort

482
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:21,060
of hemmed and hawed about what he did. But nevertheless, the other private investigator

483
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:32,260
found the kids of EWL, I have to look at my notes, but wife or daughter. I think it was the wife.

484
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,660
And apparently he had passed away, was buried. I think he was buried in Florida.

485
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:51,860
We have a grave marker. And we got platitudes. But once you hire private investigators there,

486
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,380
they can do things that I just find very uncomfortable. They'll just lie to your

487
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:03,700
face all the time. They'll lead you on. They'll squeeze information on all these methods that

488
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:13,460
you know, I just don't have the skills to do. And so I found that very interesting process.

489
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,740
So we did our best to find that. But I would say the smoking gun there is that,

490
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:26,100
yay, there's two initials are correct. And they were on the base perimeter road addresses.

491
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:33,540
And that was just like, whoo, boy, that's a really good hallmark for authenticity

492
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:43,620
that it was real. And, you know, I know you mentioned John Alexander and his comments.

493
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:48,980
Maybe you want to set that up and I'll respond. Some of you may be familiar with Colonel John

494
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:54,260
B. Alexander, a former US Army colonel whose name has been deeply entwined with ufology and

495
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:59,700
government psionic programs like remote viewing. Not only has Alexander made some outward comments

496
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:06,740
on the MJ-12. Okay, we haven't got time to cover all that. MJ-12 was real, had absolutely nothing

497
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:13,140
to do with UFOs. And if you understand what it was designed for, it was the right kind of people.

498
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:19,220
You don't have to make explanations as how certain people got in. But the people who did know, I mean,

499
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:28,340
I just, in fact, what the thing was, at one time I had got rumors of the program. And it was one

500
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:33,860
time that I went to Subalpine and said, what about this thing? And he says, we're not going to discuss

501
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:40,500
that. And it was super, super secret and parts of it still are and need to stay that way.

502
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:46,340
In his book, UFOs, Myths, Conspiracies, and Reality, Alexander claimed Dr. Bob Wood told

503
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:52,820
Alexander he believed the Psalm 101 manual to have been created in 1954 with the expressed

504
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:58,340
intention to be leaked to Soviet spies as part of a disinformation campaign. The intent would be to

505
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:04,260
get the Soviets to commit resources to UAP crash recoveries. Well, what does Ryan have to say?

506
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:11,860
Yeah, I mean, I wish I knew what he's up to. I guess I've known John for many, many years

507
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:20,340
and so has my father. And he's always wanted to push the envelope and try to squeeze information

508
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:27,940
out of people or trade information. So he has, I mean, he was in Vietnam. He was a

509
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:37,140
special forces colonel operating in Cambodia illegally, you know, maybe on orders, maybe not.

510
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:46,660
So he's had a long history of trying to skirt the edge of legitimacy, in my opinion.

511
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:56,740
And, you know, why did he say this, that it's Russian Soviet, you know, spycraft? I think it

512
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:04,820
was to curry favor with somebody else because it just makes no sense. I mean, there's why would

513
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:10,340
you expose the fact that you've got alien technology that is going to write Patterson

514
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:16,660
Air Force Base and Area 51 S4, and you've got bodies and parts and the whole retrieval program.

515
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:23,620
And why do so much and then leak it? Why wouldn't you just, you know, you could

516
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:32,820
put it with one of your assets in the Soviet Union and leak it in a much more

517
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:43,540
more responsible, less visible way? And so from a psychological warfare point of view, or

518
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:52,900
or PsyOP, it just, it doesn't work. It's like you're exposing too much information. There's

519
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:59,620
no need to create such a fancy document with such high credibility to

520
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:07,380
to try to scare the Soviets. They have their own crashes. No ET's are real. I mean, or China,

521
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:15,300
they penetrated the Manhattan Project, you know, within a year

522
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:24,260
to get the atomic bomb. And I'm sure that they were right on top of the whole, you know, UFO,

523
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:31,860
crash UFO thing. So it doesn't really make much sense in my mind. And the same thing is true

524
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:40,420
with the entire swath of majestic documents, is that why in the world would you try to do

525
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:46,980
something over 19 years with so many documents of so many different different quality aspects?

526
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:53,860
Some are really just photocopies, other original documents. So it just,

527
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:02,260
if you're trying to scare the living daylights out of some, you know, foreign intelligence agency,

528
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:10,660
it's probably better to do something else. With all this talk of the SOM 101, let's spend some

529
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:15,620
time authenticating the document and spend some time analyzing arguments against the document.

530
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:22,420
Now, there is a witness, Navy Yeoman Dale Bailey, who alleges he saw the SOM 101 manual when he was

531
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:28,820
assisting in the destruction of classified UFO material for an admiral in 1976. Mr. Wood is

532
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:33,620
currently in the process of locating files on this witness from his father's archive, so I may have

533
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:38,820
some testimony from this individual soon. Within the words of the document, the Woods have noticed

534
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:44,180
many minute details that speak to the manual's authenticity. These include the mention of craft

535
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:50,420
tape when discussing packaging NHI materials, not duct tape, which is accurate to 1954 shipping

536
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:56,820
methods, as well as some spelling mechanisms, such as screwdriver being two words, which was customary

537
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:03,780
in 1954. The capitalization of first aid, which was changed to lowercase in the late 50s. The

538
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:12,900
abbreviation of New Mexico as N.MEX, not N.M, which was altered for zip codes, as well as the solo

539
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,780
typo in the document in the word desiccant. And there is, of course, the point we touched

540
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:23,460
on earlier, the raising of the letter Z, which indicated the usage of a hot lead press. Many

541
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,100
detractors to the document like to point to the cover page and usage of variable fonts and drop

542
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:33,540
shadow font, but we can find other Army field manuals from this time period using the same

543
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:40,100
styling. Odd fonts had also been used in various documents, like this October 24, 1952 memo

544
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:46,100
initiating the NSA under the Truman administration. Blocked epistemology has theorized the usage of

545
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:51,540
fonts was actually experiments done by Dr. Vannevar Bush, who actually experimented with fonts,

546
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:56,180
such as pictured here in a popular mechanics magazine, where we can see Bush operating a novel

547
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:02,420
phototype setting machine out of EG&G in 1950. Bush even led the design of the cryptographic

548
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:08,980
machinery used by the NSA's predecessor, OP20-G. Skeptics of the memo additionally like to point

549
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:13,620
out a restricted classification on the memo's cover page and how the memo cannot be both top

550
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:19,300
secret and restricted, since restricted classification falls below confidential and top secret.

551
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:25,220
This is a misunderstood point. According to the 1947 Atomic Energy Act, information on atomic

552
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:31,860
energy is born classified even if not created by USG elements. In situations such as these,

553
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:37,780
restricted data is not a level of classification. A document containing restricted data can also be

554
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:44,180
classified as secret or top secret. The SOM-1 was also written during the time that the restricted

555
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:49,700
classification level was phased out of USG to confidential, so we can find articles during this

556
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:55,380
time about an extended changeover period due to some issues. Additionally, skeptics point out the

557
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:01,700
fact that Area 51-S4, as highlighted in the classification table, did not exist in 1954,

558
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:10,980
and this is a very important point to address. Yeah, well, and we found a newspaper article in

559
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:20,100
51, basically contractors are pissed off that there was this huge government contract awarded

560
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:26,660
to a competitor for hundreds of millions of dollars for concrete out in Area 51,

561
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:32,260
and they're fighting back and forth in the newspaper in 51.

562
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:42,260
And the other thing is it was Groom Lake. There was a mine, the Groom Lake mine,

563
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:48,820
which was a borax mine there already that could have been exploited to be enhanced

564
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:57,620
for an underground facility as well. That could still be researched further to find out from

565
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:04,500
the mining department and the historical records of, well, how big was this underground borax mine?

566
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:13,620
How many millions of square feet is it or was it? Where precisely is it? So you could dig further to

567
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:26,020
provide further evidence there, but yeah, clearly it was started in 51, and I'm sure started small.

568
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:32,980
I strongly recommend reading Jan Aldrich's 1996 criticism of the special operations manual.

569
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:37,300
Aldrich's primary criticisms of the manual revolve around what it doesn't include,

570
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,180
such as instructions to tell recovery teams to set up a grid, photograph the scene, and tag each

571
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:47,380
item for future reference. Aldrich also criticizes the use of downed satellites,

572
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:53,060
which in 1954 was before the time of Sputnik. The use of the word satellite has been utilized

573
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:58,180
commonly during this time period in literature to discuss space debris. I find much of his

574
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,220
criticisms to be fluff, such as problems with interchanging the phrases MJ-12, Magic-12,

575
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,540
and Majestic-12 throughout the document, and can't help but to feel that Aldrich cherry-picked

576
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:11,860
his arguments surrounding what is not instructed of the recovery teams. However,

577
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:16,260
I do think his criticisms are important to understand when reading the document.

578
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:21,060
If you want to read more, Ryan and Dr. Bob have a massive section on their website,

579
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:27,140
specialoperationsmanual.com, authenticating the Psalm 101. I highly recommend reading this for

580
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:31,780
more of a deep dive into authenticating the manual. The article explores more into the

581
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:36,660
provenance of the document, including analyzing the anonymous store in Wisconsin where the film

582
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,780
was mailed. With all of this discussion around the Psalm 101, I found it important to touch on

583
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,180
the legitimacy of other majestic documents, especially those that have been found in avenues

584
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:52,340
such as the National Archives. Ryan had many more to reference. There was the Cutler Twining memo.

585
00:58:52,420 --> 00:59:07,380
This is Bob Cutler, Robert Cutler to the National Security Council, and it says NSC MJ-12 Special

586
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:14,900
Studies Group in 1954. It doesn't say Majestic, but it says MJ-12 Special Studies Group. It's

587
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:24,340
original onion skin. It's in the Library of Congress Manuscript Division in downtown Washington.

588
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:34,820
There's other documents too. There's one at College Park in Maryland from the Joint

589
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:44,340
Intelligence Objectives Agency, which is part of paperclip that says CIA MJ-12 on the bottom

590
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:56,580
of a memo for Project Paperclip, Project 63, I think. Anyway, there's a couple of examples,

591
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:03,060
and then there's acknowledgement, as I mentioned earlier, that the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit

592
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:13,700
exists as well. It's not like there's no evidence from the National Archives, let alone

593
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:22,020
all the other stuff, all the other UFOs, Project Sign, Project Grudge, and all that research.

594
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:26,900
Of course, with Ross Coldheart's new reality check program, interest in JFK and the majestic

595
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:31,620
documents is at an all-time high, and I was super keen to explore this avenue.

596
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:38,420
I think it's in the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, one where they say that Kennedy was given

597
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:46,340
some information or believed to have gotten information from somebody in Congress

598
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:56,260
while he was, before he was elected president. So Kennedy was aware of it according to the

599
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:06,260
documents of this topic and its importance. There's also National Security Action Memorandums

600
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:17,620
like a week before he's assassinated, where he says to James Webb, the head of NASA,

601
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:27,380
I want you to share with the Russians the knowns and the unknowns. And by implication,

602
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:36,340
that means open the kimono and tell the Soviets all about UFOs, and lots of reasons why Kennedy

603
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:42,900
would be assassinated. But here's another one reason, is that you might have told the truth or

604
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:51,700
pushed harder on cooperation with the Soviets. I mean, particularly after his Bay of Pigs

605
01:01:54,180 --> 01:02:00,820
showdown, he didn't want that to happen again. The connection with JFK and MJ-12 does not stop

606
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:06,660
here. Within the majestic documents lies a retyped NSA intercept of JFK's hotline,

607
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:11,300
talking to the premier about the UFO situation and national security implications.

608
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:16,340
JFK is also mentioned within another set of documents Wood considers to have the highest

609
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:23,220
authenticity rating, the burned memo. In June of 1999, UFO researcher Tim Cooper received an

610
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:29,220
anonymous letter from a source claiming to be a CIA counterintelligence officer, with documents

611
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:34,740
that would connect MJ-12 to JFK's murder. The source commended Cooper on his decision to have

612
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:40,100
worked with Dr. Bob on the majestic files. The files included by the source claim to have been

613
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:45,940
some of the last surviving paper MJ-12 documents, after a special classified executive order from

614
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:52,180
Nixon ordered all MJ-12 documents to be destroyed and moved onto computers. The burned memo was

615
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:57,140
allegedly snatched from a fire before being destroyed and is unlike most documents' original

616
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:04,180
paper. This memo is from MJ-1, aka the Director of Central Intelligence. The memo is directed to

617
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:10,660
MJ's 2-7, in reference to Project Majestic in Jehovah, Averro, Parasite, and Parheleon.

618
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:17,460
As you must know, Lancer, codeword for JFK, has made some inquiries regarding our activities which

619
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:25,700
we cannot allow. We can also find a 1961 document allegedly sent by JFK to the Director of the CIA

620
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:30,580
requesting an update on the psychological warfare plans related to the Majestic-12.

621
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:36,420
And here is a very interesting additional point. In 2023, President Biden ordered some documents

622
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:42,820
from the JFK investigation be released. One name of note within these documents was CIA agent Ruben

623
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:47,860
Efron, who was intercepting Lee Harvey Oswald's mail in the months before his assassination.

624
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:55,300
I do find it a bit strange. The October 15, 1955 Central Intelligence bulletin listed operative

625
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:02,020
Ruben Efron, as well as three other USG or US military personnel, as witnessing disc-like UFOs

626
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:07,060
when traveling via train in the Caspian Sea. There are hundreds of Majestic documents,

627
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:12,500
and the Woods have implemented a really quality scale to gauge the authenticity of these documents.

628
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:16,740
So of course, with so many documents from so many sources over so many years,

629
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:21,460
I was encouraged to ask Mr. Wood if there were any documents he suspects are forgeries.

630
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:33,140
At this point, I don't have any information that any document that's listed on the website

631
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:42,580
is fake. I have no credible evidence that it's genuinely faked. I mean, so to fake something,

632
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:48,660
you have to have really, what's the specific, why did you fake it? Did you launch it against

633
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:56,020
a specific target in intelligence? Are you trying to mess with the UFO community? Why bother?

634
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:02,500
The general attitude of the intelligence community of the people that control this secret

635
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:12,020
is to ignore everything and provide no additional confirmation or evidence. They just try to manage

636
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:20,420
leaks and discredit people. So that's the methodology for managing leaks. So I would

637
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:28,260
say at this time, I have no evidence that anything has been faked. Now I've got lots of documents

638
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:35,460
where you can't do anything more. Like the Aquarius document that came out in the Carter,

639
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:41,220
was allegedly signed by Carter. Yeah, I wanted to bring that up. That was brought forth by UFO

640
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:46,260
researcher Lee Graham, the Aquarius document package. Can you talk about that and describe

641
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:51,460
it a little bit along with kind of your feelings on it? Yeah, I mean, it's sort of

642
01:05:53,380 --> 01:06:00,340
fluff in my mind. I mean, it's informed fluff, but there's nothing to check. There's not enough

643
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:14,740
specifics to validate or check anything. And it just seems odd that a document like this would be

644
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:20,260
devoid of specifics. Maybe they wanted to ensure that there weren't any specifics that were

645
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:28,980
checkable. But that's the part that's troubling. And you can't check it, so you don't know what to

646
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:33,860
do with it. So that's why it's in, as Stan Friedman calls the gray basket, or I call the

647
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:41,860
neutral basket, where I need more evidence to push it down or up. As we know, the majestic

648
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:48,340
documents were leaked during the 1984 to 1999 era. This time was post Robertson panel and

649
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:53,540
Condon committee where public interest in UFOs were at a relative low. Only behind the scenes

650
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:57,860
in the 70s were researchers like Leonard Stringfield doing serious research on crash

651
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:03,300
retrievals. With the majority of the documents dating back to the 40s and 50s, I asked Mr. Wood

652
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:07,300
why he thought the leaks occurred when they did. But it was really about

653
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:15,220
Vannevar Bush writing to Eisenhower saying, you know, we have all these celestial gifts

654
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:20,260
from crashed UFOs, and, and we really ought to do something about it. And he said,

655
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:26,900
be quiet, go win the war, and come back to me later. And when Roswell happened, they actually

656
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:34,660
pushed at it and started this organization. So who leaked it and why? Well, again, there's

657
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:42,260
multiple sources, and we don't really know, but we know that there was two film drops in

658
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:49,060
84 and 94. Those may have been the same people, but maybe not two different people.

659
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:58,260
The certain method of delivery in an undeveloped film was the same. And then there was several

660
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:09,220
mailings from Sacramento, California. There was several mailbox drops,

661
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:18,980
some physically put in Tim Cooper's mailbox without postage. It's like somebody went into the mail

662
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:25,940
room where I was a member of the post office and put it in his mailbox, or cracked his code at the

663
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:35,460
top and stuck it in. And then there was some mailings, for example, from the post office,

664
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:42,500
some mailings, for example, from the Freedom of Information Act office at Fort Meade, Maryland,

665
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:50,740
that came physically mailed the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers, which is original onion skin.

666
01:08:51,700 --> 01:09:00,420
And then there was a couple of different documents that were, they had this dash one and dash two in

667
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:09,940
the upper corner on every page. And ultimately, Thomas Cantwheel wrote a letter at the time of

668
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:17,460
his death or near the time of his death to Tim Cooper. It basically said,

669
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:27,860
Dear Tim, by the time you get this letter reaches you, I will left this world. So he's dying of

670
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:38,740
cancer. And he goes on to describe his relationship with Stringfield and Friedman

671
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:53,060
and intelligence contacts at Fort Meade, Maryland, Roswell, and then has a sketch of a craft

672
01:09:54,020 --> 01:10:04,420
that, you know, he sort of drew as the Roswell craft. And then we also had another

673
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:12,020
letter from Salina, which is allegedly the daughter of

674
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:19,860
Thomas Cantwell or Cantwheel, which is a pseudonym, you know, it's not his real name.

675
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:29,060
Right. So, but he worked allegedly at the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit and probably

676
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:38,420
was an OSS officer in that timeframe. And, you know, you don't know what he died of other than

677
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:48,820
cancer. But so that's sort of the broad brush of the sources of materials.

678
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:56,580
And there's so many names. I mean, on the majesticdocuments.com website, there's a,

679
01:10:56,580 --> 01:11:00,660
you dig around, there's a personnel- The master list, right?

680
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:06,900
Master personnel data list. And I'd urge everybody to file off your Freedom of

681
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:12,900
Information Act requests to the CIA and the NSA and the Air Force and Air Force Office of Special

682
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:21,620
Investigations and try to dig up more information and more FBI files on those people and individuals

683
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:29,140
or go to the National Archives. So there's loads of research to be done. It's just,

684
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:37,860
you got to pay people to do it. This is the limited bandwidth. Everybody in ufology sort of

685
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:44,020
has this, you know, peak of enthusiasm and then it wanes and then you sort of have the trough

686
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:52,420
disillusionment. And then if you keep going, you keep learning more, it's a complicated world.

687
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:57,460
The mention of Cantwheel, sometimes mistaken as Cantwell here, gives us a great opportunity

688
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:02,420
to analyze what we know about the majestic document leaks and their sources. There are

689
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:08,260
three major sources of document leaks. One, Cantwheel, who supplied much of the material

690
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:15,220
we've covered today to Tim Cooper, such as the IPU Report and Field Order, Hillencoder Magic Memo,

691
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:21,780
First Annual Report, and the JFK to Director of the CIA Documents. Selena, the alleged daughter

692
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:26,740
of Cantwheel, supplied Cooper with 10 short memos alongside documents like the twining

693
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:32,500
White Hot Report, Eisenhower to Oppenheimer Memo, and Directive from Twining to Truman.

694
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:37,780
And lastly, we have Source One, who supplied the burn memo we spoke about earlier. In his letter

695
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:42,980
to Cooper, Thomas Cantwheel took ownership for many of the mailbox majestic document drops

696
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:49,220
starting in 1992. Timothy Cooper investigated Mr. Cantwheel and legally bound his findings in a

697
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:54,020
five-page affidavit distributed to Stanton Friedman and Dr. Bob Wood that can be found

698
01:12:54,020 --> 01:13:00,580
on MajesticDocuments.com. Information obtained by Cooper and shared with Stanton and Bob include

699
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:05,780
claims of Cantwheel's background. Cantwheel himself stated to be part of the, quote,

700
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:11,860
Counter Intelligence Corps, CIC, Scientific and Technical Branch Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit

701
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:20,740
from 1942 to 1958. According to Cantwell, he served in the CIC until 1980 and worked for CIA

702
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:27,620
covert operations in the 60s and had contacts with the FBI, KGB, and GRU. He claimed to have

703
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:32,900
retired as Lieutenant Colonel and been involved with the Majestic Community, MAJCOM, and the

704
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:39,780
super-secret 5412 Group, end quote. Well-respected Reddit user HarryIsWhiteHot has spearheaded an

705
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:44,180
investigation into identifying this mysterious Cantwheel, so credit for his amazing work.

706
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:50,900
Harry has proposed the idea for why CIA operative Boris Dmitry Tarasov is the man behind the

707
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:57,780
enigmatic Thomas Cantwheel. Tarasov's CIA career spanned between 1956 and 1968 after

708
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:02,500
immigrating to the U.S. from Russia, where his Russian language abilities proved invaluable to

709
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:07,620
U.S. intelligence agencies. His U.S. Army records from the Counter Intelligence Corps ranged from

710
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:14,820
1942 to 1945, where Tarasov then left the CIC to work for the Red Cross in Cleveland, Ohio.

711
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:20,500
Harry wisely points out, this Red Cross work likely is a cover story for work on the

712
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:25,460
IPU, stationed out of Wright Field, which is located in northern Ohio near Cleveland.

713
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:30,900
Wright Field also housed the Army Air Materiel Command, where General Nathan Twining,

714
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:36,580
alleged Majestic 12 member, was stationed. It's worth mentioning during his time at the American

715
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:41,700
National Red Cross, Tarasov was employed for building maintenance engineering under a social

716
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:48,180
agency. One must ask why a counterintelligence operator tasked with, quote, detailed composition

717
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:52,820
of the foreign armies and their intelligence services approach and interrogation of the enemy

718
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:58,260
military personnel and civilian detection and prevention of the acts of sabotage, end quote,

719
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:03,540
would leave for a social agency four years into their career before rejoining the CIA.

720
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:08,020
Interesting connection here as well. In Cooper's description of Cantwheel,

721
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:13,860
he states while Cantwheel was part of the CIA and CIC, he interrogated agents in West Germany.

722
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:20,180
We can see on Tarasov's official record in 1945, the agent attended the advanced CIC school

723
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:26,020
in Oberurself, Germany, where he was tasked with, quote, extracting the necessary information from

724
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:31,220
the enemy population, military, and members of the Nazi party, end quote. In his analysis

725
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:35,860
of Cantwheel, Cooper also states Cantwheel served as U.S. Army intelligence in Washington,

726
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:42,260
D.C. from 42 to 45. What we can find, Tarasov attended the Military Intelligence Training Center

727
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:49,700
and performed CIC work at Camp Richey, Maryland, a mere 70 miles from D.C. in the year of 1945.

728
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:54,180
At the time of Cooper sharing his investigation with Friedman and Wood, he believed Cantwheel

729
01:15:54,180 --> 01:16:00,260
to be living in California and to be in his 90s. We can find no obituary for Tarasov,

730
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:05,140
but at the time of this personal history statement titled CIA Historical Review Program

731
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:11,380
Released as Sanitized, released in 1998, just two years removed from Cooper's investigation,

732
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:16,660
Tarasov was indeed living in San Leandro, California. Born in 1908, this would have

733
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:21,220
made Tarasov 88 at the time of Cooper's investigation if he was still alive when

734
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:27,540
Cooper received his letter. This rabbit hole goes much deeper, with Tarasov being stationed in 1963

735
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:32,900
as a translator operations officer in Mexico City, transcribing and translating some agency

736
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:38,260
surveillance traffic from communist-aligned embassies and other specific targets. Tasarov's

737
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,740
work was used as evidence to prove that Lee Harvey Oswald visited Soviet compounds,

738
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:48,820
so of course Tasarov's work dovetails into the JFK assassination. I personally have my own theory

739
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:52,980
on the concentration of these documents, as we see the majority of information collected on the

740
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:59,860
Majestic 12 as a snapshot in time in the 40s and 50s. I draw your attention to the 1954 Atomic

741
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:07,300
Energy Agreement as mentioned in the 2024 and 2025 Schumer legislation, which states NHI craft,

742
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:14,020
materials, and bodies, as well as UAP and legacy program information, were hushed away as trans

743
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:20,340
classified foreign nuclear materials. I find it interesting after the SOM 101, which was released

744
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:27,300
in 1954, most majestic documents dated after 54 contain nowhere near the detail on program operations,

745
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:34,660
scope, and purpose. Perhaps the 54 AEC agreement oversaw a drastic shift in MJ-12 records.

746
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:38,100
I relayed this theory to Mr. Wood, and he shared the same sentiment.

747
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:47,620
That's absolutely true. I think that's when it sort of happened. And that's maybe why we got the

748
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:54,180
special operations manual, is that the Air Force officers that were responsible for this basically

749
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:58,660
got the rug pulled out of them, said, no, no, you guys don't get to do this anymore. It's going

750
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:07,220
someplace else. And people were pissed. And this guy took it and decided at some point he was going

751
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:12,340
to leak it. Mr. Wood and myself circled back to the personnel list I touched on earlier in the video

752
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:17,620
with some of the original members named in the MJ-12. I asked Mr. Wood about names associated

753
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:23,700
with the majestic 12 that have been overlooked or forgotten about. Yeah, I mean, it's in the

754
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:33,700
White Hot Report, it's mentioned that it was really Forrestal and Bush that came together and

755
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:39,220
said we need to form this top secret research and development intelligence gathering organization.

756
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:46,100
And I think it's also mentioned right there on the front couple pages of the special operations

757
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:53,540
manual, the history of the group, where it talks about special classified presidential order,

758
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:03,940
and James V. Forrestal and Vannevar Bush formed the group or recommended to the president to do

759
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:13,060
that. Now, Forrestal, you know, he had a little bit of a drinking problem and he was very much

760
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:21,060
of the attitude that we need to be more open and potentially discuss this with more people.

761
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:29,700
I don't know if he was all the way to go public, but he was thrown out the 75th, well, thrown out

762
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:36,500
the top floor of Bethesda Mays Naval Hospital or fell out the floor or something.

763
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:41,380
Defenestrated, as they say, although I don't think it was windows, it was

764
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:49,060
bars. But anyway, he lost his life over that. And actually, in one of the majestic documents,

765
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:54,980
it says it's even necessary and regrettable that Forrestal had to lose his life.

766
01:19:55,460 --> 01:20:01,940
And in my book, Magic Eyes Only, there's a dedication to those that have lost their lives

767
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:07,140
for the sake of UFO secrecy. And Forrestal is clearly one person that he lost his life for that

768
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:13,300
sake of secrecy. So outside of Bush and Forrestal, are there any kind of names that you think as you

769
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:17,700
were talking about how the majestic documents in the master list needs further investigation?

770
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:22,420
Are there any names that you think are absolutely crucial to study and have kind of been looked

771
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:29,300
over and forgotten about? Yeah, I think so. There's the White Hot Report,

772
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:40,580
which is, you know, it's basically this is the group that went to Roswell and did a bunch of

773
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:48,740
analysis and worked all over the summer to create this report in September. So it happened in July

774
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:57,620
and everybody went crazy and investigated and wrote up this report and presented it to the

775
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:04,020
president and others. And there's the members of the mission. You know, there's people like

776
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:12,980
Captain Charles Buchanan. Who the hell is he? I still haven't found him. And what's his military

777
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:20,900
personnel record file like? Or Robert Ginsburg, Colonel Robert Ginsburg or Captain Richard Glass

778
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:26,580
or, I mean, Carl Hummelsine is a big, well-known person. Major General Stephen Chamberlain,

779
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:31,540
Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence. He was certainly a known, you know, Major George

780
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:38,420
McDonald. That was his Chamberlain's boss. He was, you know, he was like the Chief of Staff of the

781
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:47,300
Air Force. Admiral Paul Lee, he's very well known. Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project. He

782
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:57,860
had all his team members there. James Lay Jr. Thomas Lynch, which is the finance guy in the

783
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:07,620
Treasury Department. So they had, you know, they got Navy and Air Force and finance people and

784
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:14,980
as well as, you know, Von Karman and Oppenheimer and Doolittle, James Doolittle and Professor

785
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:22,660
Einstein. So there's loads and that's just one document where you could dig into the next level.

786
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:28,980
You could write a whole book on just that one document and all the interconnections and the

787
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:34,500
validations of every single sentence and every single linkage between people and their

788
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:40,180
correspondence. It's a huge amount of work. I mean, I'd love to give somebody, here's 50 grand.

789
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:45,060
I want you to go write a whole book on this one topic and go spend a year researching.

790
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:51,220
And as I mentioned before, we really do observe the Majestic 12 as a snapshot in time. Myself

791
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,620
and I'm sure every viewer of this video wonders about the evolution of the alleged group,

792
01:22:55,620 --> 01:23:01,380
how they operate today, and if in 2024 there is still a group known as the Majestic 12.

793
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:09,380
So the documents sort of in the history point of view are stop in the mid 50s or so with the

794
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:20,180
fifth annual report on Majestic. And I suspect that it's probably still has the same name.

795
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:27,860
It's such a rare club, you know, to lose that history and change the name seems silly,

796
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:34,820
but they could do it. And there's probably certainly a lot of subclassifications

797
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:43,220
and different groups that are focused on hardware or bodies. Those are obvious

798
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:49,540
bifurcations of classification. But then probably within each of those, there's probably additional

799
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:58,100
classifications to compartmentalize it and get into buckets where they could potentially work

800
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:06,900
with private corporations or other organizations. But in my mind, it's the Aerospace Corporation

801
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:16,580
and the Carlisle Group and EG&G and some of the historical ones. I mean, Rand, for example,

802
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:24,500
up to their eyeballs in this stuff. And there's probably a lot of them that have done research

803
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:29,540
historically. We have heard so much from Ryan about his involvement with the Majestic 12,

804
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:35,780
but another key player is his father, Dr. Robert Wood. Why did Dr. Bob, a rocket scientist,

805
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:49,940
get involved with UFOs in the Majestic documents? It was maybe 1967 or so, 1967, where he started

806
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:56,820
reading a bunch of UFO books and convinced his management that, are we going to figure out how

807
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:02,900
the UFOs work before or after Lockheed does? And they said, well, how much money you want to try

808
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:09,460
to work on that bomb? And so he spent internal R&D Douglas Aircraft Company money and then

809
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:17,460
the merger happened to McDonnell Douglas. But so for a couple of years, they spent the equivalent

810
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:26,980
of four and a half million dollars working on gravity experiments, theory, being interviewed

811
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:36,820
abductees. I mean, I remember as a little boy, 13, 14, going out to the Mojave Desert.

812
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:46,660
One of his engineers was out there with a magnetometer and strip chart recorders and

813
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:52,900
they had anomalous events and sleeping on this couch in this high heat in the desert. And

814
01:25:53,380 --> 01:26:04,100
it was fun for a kid at the time. So that was his work. They didn't have any access to classified

815
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:13,460
information, but that was the start of his deep interest in UFOs. And actually he hired

816
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:20,820
Stan Friedman to work for him and look at the nuclear physics aspect of UFO propulsion.

817
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:27,300
Viewers of my channel will remember Project Moondust, an official group proposed in 1961

818
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:33,140
by the U.S. Air Force alongside projects Blue Fly and UFO. Moondust was tasked to

819
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:39,460
locate, recover, and deliver descended foreign space vehicles. Moondust's counterpart,

820
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:44,980
Blue Fly, served to facilitate expeditious delivery to foreign technology division of

821
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:49,540
Moondust or other items of great technological intelligence interest."

822
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:54,820
In my video on Moondust, we covered a variety of fascinating cases occurring in Nepal,

823
01:26:54,820 --> 01:27:01,780
Afghanistan, Canada, and a 1965 case in the Congo with an accompanying memo titled Fragment Metal

824
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:06,580
recovered in the Republic of the Congo, origin believed to be an unidentified flying object.

825
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:11,460
Moondust does indeed have connections to the majestic documents in a fascinating

826
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:21,540
original document called the Bowen Manuscript. Moondust is definitely a recovery organization.

827
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:29,860
I mean it's space junk primarily, but occasionally it's down saucers. And so if there's some obvious

828
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:36,100
evidence that it's a saucer, they may have a different team that goes. But the Moondust people

829
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:48,100
were very much involved. And so that's logical that they would do that. I guess I wanted to

830
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:53,300
bring up one final thought for you is that many people say, oh, these are all photocopies.

831
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:59,380
And I guess I just wanted to highlight, you know, one of the leaked ones,

832
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:06,340
well, sent from Ford Meade from Freedom of Information Act office was this one,

833
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:16,180
Top Secret Magic. This is original onion skin paper that we've done forensic analysis on.

834
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:26,500
And for ink and pencil marks, and it has comments by Vannevar Bush, and it has hints of we have

835
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:36,740
anti-gravity craft in the 1960s. The Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers, the Bowen Manuscript,

836
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:42,020
and actually there's a book that it's on Amazon called The Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers by

837
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:54,420
Vernon Bowen who wrote it. And it's very well done history of UFO cases from 1960 and before.

838
01:28:55,300 --> 01:29:01,940
So that's when he typed it, sent it into the Air Force, and never got it back until

839
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:13,860
39 years later. Wow. And the document has comments from Vannevar Bush. Yeah, it's like there's

840
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:20,580
comments in marginalia and in pen and ink marks like, you know, what is Don Menzel doing? Question

841
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:32,660
mark in relation to these comments in the topic. And then another one was in relation to could

842
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:43,780
these craft be our manmade, you know, experimental vehicles? And handwritten on the side in ink is

843
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:54,180
this should not get out, implying in my mind that there are deep concerns that we've got gravity

844
01:29:54,180 --> 01:30:03,460
control craft. And so that's juicy. My research and my father's research on the majestic documents

845
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:11,380
is rich and robust and highly supportive of their authenticity and credibility. And I welcome

846
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:19,140
objections to it. And if you have some it's fake because statement or I don't like it because

847
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:26,820
I'm all ears. But I've not found any credible objections. All right. Thank you so much, Mr.

848
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:33,540
Wood. Thank you. What's up, guys? Thank you so much for joining me into this investigation

849
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:39,220
and documentary on the majestic 12 and majestic documents. Before I get into my usual ramblings

850
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:44,580
at the end of every video, I need to say a couple things. One, thank you, Mr. Ryan S. Wood. Thank

851
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:49,620
you for sitting down with me doing this interview, answering hours of questions and emails in the

852
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:54,740
majestic documents, the majestic 12, me requesting additional files, me requesting images and so

853
01:30:54,740 --> 01:31:01,940
forth. This man is truly of incredible character and I am so thankful one of my biggest inspirations

854
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:07,380
in the field of ufology agreed to sit down with me and cover the majestic documents. For anybody

855
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:12,580
who has watched a single one of my videos, you know I reference this book Magic Eyes Only as the

856
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:17,300
greatest book I have ever read on UFO crash retrievals by Ryan S. Wood. I highly encourage

857
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:21,780
anybody to purchase this book because it also covers much of the majestic 12, including the

858
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:26,100
authenticating of the special operations manual. It also includes a full copy of the special

859
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:31,460
operations manual. Third, Ryan S. Wood has a beautiful tool I don't see referenced much.

860
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:39,700
This is a website called ufodex, u-f-o-d-e-x.com. What this is, Ryan S. Wood trained a chat GPT

861
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:46,580
model and scanned in between 500 and 800 UFO books. You can submit a question on any topic in

862
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:52,260
ufology and receive an answer from Mr. Wood. I myself have used this tool dozens of times

863
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:57,940
and I've used it in a lot of my past research, such as referencing the 1974 Koyamae case,

864
01:31:57,940 --> 01:32:02,340
discussing a certain private corporation I'm going to cover soon, and I even asked it about

865
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:08,340
underwater bases that NHI might inhabit after reading and hearing about some parts of Lou

866
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:14,260
Elizondo's new statements. So, thank you Mr. Wood. Please get a copy of Magic Eyes Only. Please

867
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:21,140
go to majesticdocuments.com where you can read all 33 or 35 of the reports I reference today in depth.

868
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:24,980
Of course, with YouTube video descriptions, it's a little too tough to include all links,

869
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:30,180
especially when I have between 50 and 60 research files. So, you'll look in the video description,

870
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:34,420
you will see every document we covered today, which is over 30, you'll find the exact name.

871
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:39,380
Go to majesticdocuments.com, punch that in, copy and paste it, review the document while watching

872
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:42,820
the video. I think that's really important. When we're discussing a document, you can have it on

873
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:46,100
another monitor on part of your screen, kind of read through what we're going through. You know

874
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:49,780
me, I like to cite my work, so all of these documents will be available for you to read

875
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:55,940
super easily. Okay, on to my ramblings. The Majestic 12 has consumed my life for the past

876
01:32:55,940 --> 01:33:02,100
couple of weeks to the point where I have not even touched this. And this is going to be my next

877
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:09,060
reading. I cannot wait to dive in, but I highly recommend anybody get the Magic Eyes Only book

878
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:14,180
and the book I referenced multiple times in the video, Top Secret Magic by Stanton Friedman.

879
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:18,660
If you want to learn more into the authentication of the Eisenhower briefing document, Cutler Twining

880
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:23,860
Memo, Truman Forrestal Memo, this is the book for you. It was written in the 90s, but this is a

881
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:29,540
beautiful piece that's so useful to investigate more into what we've been talking about today.

882
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:35,780
Stanton Friedman is a legend amongst Ryan Wood, Robert Wood, so please check out this book if you

883
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:41,620
want to learn more. It's fantastic. So now we can get on to some of my thoughts. Anybody who's

884
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:45,220
watched my videos knows more and more over time I've been referencing the Majestic documents.

885
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:50,260
A perfect example is my last video, the 1974 Koyama crash retrieval. I referenced the first

886
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:56,980
annual Majestic report as well as the IPU report. Before that, in my 1955 crash video near Del Rio,

887
01:33:56,980 --> 01:34:01,620
Texas, I referenced the Eisenhower briefing document and the 1950 crash listed there,

888
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:05,060
also touched on by Lou Elizondo to have occurred near El Indio in Guerrero.

889
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:10,660
I made some statements public that I thought that the Majestic 12 was likely a real organization

890
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:14,740
and the Majestic files had probably been a mix of information and disinformation.

891
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:20,100
At that time, I had not spent the amount of time I have now pouring through the documents,

892
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:25,220
looking at connections, looking at research, and just immersing myself in so much time.

893
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:29,300
I think the Majestic 12 encompasses so much more than what I initially suspected.

894
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:36,740
What really took me by surprise was the amount of length behind authenticating the Eisenhower

895
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:40,980
briefing document and special operations manual. Those, of course, are two of the big heavy hitters

896
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:48,340
we talk about in this video. But towards the end of the video, you'll remember the Bowen manuscript

897
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:54,020
and you'll remember how the author, Bowen, I can't remember his first name, sent this in to the

898
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:59,860
Department of Defense in 1960 to get it reviewed. He never got a copy back. It wasn't until 1999

899
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:07,380
Timothy Cooper got this from a FOIA designation, Fort Meade, with comments all over it from Vannevar

900
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:13,860
Bush and Stamp Top Secret Magic. Now, of course, we discussed how this referenced Moon Dust,

901
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:21,540
that Vannevar Bush made comments on anti-gravity vehicles, but this, the discussion of Moon Dust

902
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:28,580
and insect-like beans reminded me so much of Dr. Saurbacher. And of course, I discussed that video,

903
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:32,900
Dr. Saurbacher, multiple times, but we have to remember that within the majestic files,

904
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:39,060
one, if not the key player, is Dr. Vannevar Bush. Of course, the beginning of the majestic leaks

905
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:47,380
occurred in 1980, but the thing is we can trace Dr. Robert Saurbacher discussing Vannevar Bush

906
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:54,660
directing UFO study in the U.S. government as far back as 1950, around the time of the alleged

907
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:59,860
MJ-12 connection. So, I never thought the Saurbacher connections would go so deep here.

908
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:04,420
Remember, Dr. Saurbacher, even when talking to Stanton Freeman, name dropped Dr. Eric Walker.

909
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:10,580
Dr. Eric Walker himself confirmed to know of the MJ-12's existence, to say it's real, along with a

910
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:16,420
really interesting quote that reminded me of Don Quixote, Chasing at Windmills. Perhaps what he

911
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:19,940
meant by this is you might have the majestic documents, because I believe this interview

912
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:25,940
came out in the mid to late 80s. As we didn't have all the majestic documents, I think that

913
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:30,580
he may have meant you might have these majestic documents, you may be able to read them, but you

914
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:35,940
will never get to the bottom of it. It's futile to try and fully grasp the extent of the majestic

915
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:40,180
files. And speaking of Dr. Eric Walker, what really interests me thinking about now is how

916
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:45,940
his claims about an ESP getting into the program and so forth. So, that was just fascinating to me,

917
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:49,940
the connections with Saurbacher, because remember Saurbacher described insect-like

918
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:55,540
beings as well in the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers. Vannevar Bush underlining these subjects

919
01:36:55,540 --> 01:37:00,580
is so fascinating. And let's not forget, at the end of the 14-page sample provided on Majestic

920
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:06,740
Documents.com, there's a section talking about Mussolini and Hitler being exposed to some sort

921
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:12,260
of craft in 1942. Vannevar Bush underlines this as well, almost underlines a whole paragraph.

922
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:18,660
This brings my mind back to the 1933 Magenta Italy case. Anybody else? It's just, it's really

923
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:24,580
fascinating. Some of the other documents that really interest me of course are the IPU report,

924
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:29,940
nine pages talks about the Sandia lab technicians, talks about the crew at Roswell. So much of these

925
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:34,740
documents kind of focus around Roswell, right? I think there's so much more work to be done on

926
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:39,940
the JFK assassination in MJ-12, so much more work to be done on Forrestal's death in the MJ-12,

927
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:44,820
because that's very interesting. I think many people think of a conspiracy around Forrestal's

928
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:50,420
death as well, throwing himself out the 13th story of a naval hospital room. So there's so

929
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:53,380
much more work to be done there, and there's so much more work to be done on the Majestic

930
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:59,620
Documents in general, right? As Mr. Wood has said, much of these documents, as he likes to say,

931
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:04,580
are onion skin where we have original copies. In fact, I'd say that's the minority of the reports.

932
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:09,460
Many of them are facts from Tri-X film, photocopies and so forth. So there's some

933
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:14,580
provenance work that can't be done on these documents, like Mr. Wood has done with the Bowen

934
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:22,100
manuscript, actually dating the ink back to 1962 of when Vannevar Bush wrote Moondust on the paper.

935
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:29,460
So I think if we look at the Majestic-12, we can't argue for the validity of all of these documents,

936
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:37,700
but I think it is a safe line of research to kind of understand the Majestic-12 likely was and

937
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:44,820
possibly is a real group tasked with the study, material exploitation, and reverse engineering

938
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:51,060
and crash retrieval of UFOs. How that looks today, I would reckon it involves much more of a private

939
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:57,300
sector. As beautiful as it is with the Saarbacher video, we get to see a snapshot of the early days

940
01:38:57,380 --> 01:39:02,820
of UFO crash retrieval, and I think the Majestic documents are the perfect example of really

941
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:08,660
investigating the early days, the early players, the early organization, and the early procedures

942
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:13,780
of UFO crash retrieval. But anyway, guys, remember Magic Eyes only and top secret magic. Check them

943
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:19,460
out. MajesticDocuments.com. For the astute of you and my MMA fans, you will see this large signed

944
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:25,220
Alexander Volkanovsky poster from his knockout of Yair Rodriguez in the third round of UFC 290.

945
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:30,180
My wonderful girlfriend got me this piece for an early birthday present. It's not my birthday for

946
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:35,220
months, but I think she knows I'm such a huge Alexander Volkanovsky fan. She had to get this

947
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:39,620
for me, and that is the best gift I've ever had. So, of course, I changed the camera a little bit,

948
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:43,460
as you see, so you can get that in full view. Coming down the line, we got a lot of great

949
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:47,140
projects, guys. I know this one took a little time. I really wanted to get this right. This

950
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:52,500
video was so important. So, guys, please get yourself a copy of Magic Eyes only. Check out
