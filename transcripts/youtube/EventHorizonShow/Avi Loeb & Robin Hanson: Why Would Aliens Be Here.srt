1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
This event horizon interview will be a little different.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,260
You know my interviewing style, I ask a question and then let the guest give a complete full

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,820
answer until they are finished.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,040
That way we get maximum information.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,980
But today we have two guests of differing viewpoints from two completely different academic

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,900
disciplines, economics and astrophysics, discussing their respective ideas with each other.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,840
This report started before we began recording, and I was immediately absorbed and spellbound

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,980
in listening to them discuss their ideas and bounce them off each other.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,760
So much so that producer Ross had to remind me that we were not yet recording and really

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,440
needed to get started.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,220
I told the guests to simply continue doing that, and I became a fly on the wall, listening

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:56,040
to a very fascinating conversation that I did not want to interrupt unnecessarily, which

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,300
is why you don't hear me much.

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,780
I simply didn't have to intervene to keep the information flow going.

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,060
The result was one of the most interesting discussions I've heard in a very long time.

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,580
So today I give you economist Robin Hansen and astrophysicist Avi Loeb on the subject

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,480
of grabby aliens and far beyond.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,680
Maximum information indeed.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,280
You have fallen into Event Horizon with John-Michael Gaudier.

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:54,300
Avi Loeb is a Frank B. Byrd Junior Professor of Science at Harvard University, Chair of

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,320
Harvard's Department of Astronomy, Founding Director of Harvard's Black Hole Initiative

22
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,980
and Director of the Institute for Theory and Computation within the Harvard-Smithsonian

23
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,880
Center for Astrophysics.

24
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,520
He also chairs the Advisory Committee for the Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, serves

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,320
as the Science Theory Director for all initiatives of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, as well

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,840
as Chair of the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the National Academies.

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,100
He is the author of four books and over 700 scientific papers.

28
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,900
He is an elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Physical

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,160
Society and the International Academy of Astronautics.

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,700
In 2012, Time selected Loeb as one of the 25 most influential people in space.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:45,480
Robin Hansen is an Associate Professor of Economics and received his PhD in 1997 in

32
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,060
Social Sciences from Caltech.

33
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,320
He joined George Mason's economics faculty in 1999 after completing a two-year postdoc

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,900
at UC Berkeley.

35
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,420
His major fields of interest include health policy, regulation and formal political theory.

36
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,800
Robin Hansen and Avi Loeb, welcome back to the program to both of you.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you for having us.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,500
Always a pleasure.

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,060
I want to say that I'm nowhere nearly as prestigious or prominent as Avi, but I think

41
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,180
we do share this sense of academia that we were talking about just before the recording

42
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,660
started that the whole point is to get some freedom to take some chances and to hold yourself

43
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:33,080
to a long-term standard of progress and accomplishment and not be so in a rush to get short-term

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,140
accolades or publications or whatever it is.

45
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,460
We both are saying what in our limited lifetime can we achieve over the lifetime that will

46
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,720
be lasting thing into the future and we're both taking long shots in some sense appropriately

47
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,980
because that's what the game should be.

48
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,980
Yeah.

49
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,060
And I should add to that that one reason I'm seeking intelligence in outer space is that

50
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,580
I don't often find it here on earth.

51
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:06,700
And one more thing that there is one simple answer to Fermi's paradox, where is everybody?

52
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,460
And that is if they are truly intelligent, they would avoid us.

53
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,600
I wonder about that.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,340
They might not bother to reach out to us, but they also might not bother to hide from

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,500
us if they don't feel very scared or threatened by us.

56
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,460
They would just do whatever they do oblivious to us.

57
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,860
And we have to wonder, like, what will that look like and look for whatever that is?

58
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
Yeah.

59
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Yeah.

60
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,300
If you think about it, Fermi's question is very pretentious.

61
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,400
It's similar to a lonely person asking, where is everybody?

62
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,380
And you tell that person, look, you are not that attractive.

63
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,420
You won't expect potential partners to be next to you.

64
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,780
You need to put some work into finding them.

65
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,340
You know, either go to dating sites or at the very least look through your windows.

66
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,580
And Fermi didn't build the telescope to search for any aliens.

67
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,140
Well, there's something to be said for the idea that would we even know what to look

68
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:01,060
for with a highly advanced, a million years more advanced of civilization than we are?

69
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,380
Would we even know what to look for?

70
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,380
We don't need to know what to look for.

71
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,980
You just look for something unfamiliar.

72
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
Right.

73
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
OK.

74
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,220
Something that doesn't look like asteroids, comets, birds, drones, airplanes that we are

75
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,220
familiar with.

76
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,100
And once you find it, you get as much data as possible.

77
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,700
You know, the curious mind, I mean, a real scientist, let me define a real scientist.

78
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,500
A real scientist is driven by curiosity, not by the ego, not by trying to show off.

79
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,340
A real scientist is not working on extra dimensions just because the mathematics is complex.

80
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,220
A real scientist wants to figure out what reality is.

81
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,260
And so for a real scientist, the biggest value is getting as much data as possible,

82
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,060
as much evidence as possible about the world, because that can guide our thinking.

83
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,580
And there are so many possibilities.

84
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,980
You know, how do we narrow them down to what describes reality is by collecting evidence.

85
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,180
That's a lot of work.

86
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,360
That's why it's difficult to do science.

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,100
And most people prefer to have a shortcut, to have an opinion or to work on some mathematical

88
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,260
concepts that are not being tested experimentally.

89
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,660
I mean, that obviously is a very good way to feel good about yourself, but it doesn't

90
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,100
teach us about reality.

91
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:20,180
So if we wanted to find something new, we just need to look out and check that it's

92
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,020
by collecting as much evidence as possible, that it's not familiar.

93
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,220
That's my approach.

94
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,000
The best science or thinking in general has always included both.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,180
You both just go look for stuff.

96
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,080
And then when you find stuff, ask which of my theories could make the most sense of this.

97
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,680
But then you also have your best theories and you say, what does this theory predict

98
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
I should see?

99
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,280
And you go look for what the theory predicts, as well as trying to explain what you see

100
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,320
with your theories.

101
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,000
And so we should be doing both of those, sitting in the middle between theory and data, trying

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,280
to match them.

103
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah, that works as long as our imagination is fertile.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,920
But my argument with respect to aliens, because that's the subject of our discussion today,

105
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,920
my point is our imagination is limited to our experiences on Earth.

106
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,840
And of course, if we go on a date with a human, we can pretty much imagine what this human

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
might be like.

108
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,440
The hair color might change, but it would look like a human.

109
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,560
However, if we are about to meet with an entity from another star, all bets are off.

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,760
It could be something that our imagination cannot really foresee.

111
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,600
And therefore, it's more like an exploration.

112
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,400
You just open your mind to something different.

113
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,440
I recently flew over the Amazon basin on my way to Brazil.

114
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,200
And the most striking fact was I flew for several hours without any sign of humans at

115
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
all.

116
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,760
No lights, no roads, no buildings, no boats, no nothing.

117
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,440
That's when I would say, where is everybody?

118
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,600
Because I had expectations of the sort of things you might see that you just don't see

119
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
there.

120
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,820
And that's what you might say when you look up into the sky.

121
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,580
You say, what might we look like from a distance or especially in a million years?

122
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,460
And then we say, we look out and we say, we are not seeing the thing we might expect

123
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:12,180
to see if our descendants in a million years were anything like what we are, but bigger.

124
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,620
Yeah, if you just think about the Earth, OK, so if you go back more than a few million

125
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,100
years, you know, our ancestors were no different than nature.

126
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,500
I mean, there was no evidence that there is an unusually intelligent species about to

127
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,940
emerge, right?

128
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,520
So Earth is 10,000 times older.

129
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,480
So it's just the last very little bit of terrestrial history where we appeared.

130
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,040
Now, an interesting question is to ask, what would Earth look like in a million years?

131
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,400
Just going the same amount of time into the future.

132
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:53,960
And you know, one, if I'm a pessimist, I would say you will find a desert full of leaflets

133
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,360
of those protesters that always have a problem with the society they live in.

134
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,520
And they argue for the destruction, if they live in America, for the destruction of America.

135
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,000
And that would be the pessimistic approach, that you will find a planet that was destroyed

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,300
by some catastrophe that was self-inflicted by humans.

137
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,480
It could also be a natural catastrophe, like a giant impact by an asteroid or the sun brightening

138
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,360
or global climate change, which we triggered or not, doesn't really matter if the outcome

139
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,440
is that the Earth would be inhabitable.

140
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,480
Another possibility is that humans will not be just on Earth, which is the one I really

141
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,900
prefer, where, you know, we will avoid the risk of being eliminated by occupying many

142
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,380
platforms in space.

143
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,800
It doesn't need to be another rock.

144
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,600
You know, we think about Mars.

145
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,840
Elon Musk thinks about Mars.

146
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,480
But that's just another residue of the formation of the solar system.

147
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,440
So we have the Earth as one rock.

148
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,320
Then there is another one next to it, which is called Mars.

149
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,440
And this is just like being in the jungle.

150
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,360
You are sitting on one tree and you are saying, oh, here is another tree that I can move to.

151
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,520
To me, that's not very appealing, because we know that moving to a city that has a design,

152
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,940
artificial design, can provide a much better quality of life.

153
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:25,180
And so we could aspire to build a space platform that will host people and create a habitat

154
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,500
that is artificially designed instead of us relying on the nuclear fusion reactor that

155
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,080
the sun is.

156
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,980
We will create our nuclear fusion reactor on that habitat.

157
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,900
And so I think that would be a better approach for long-term survival.

158
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,060
But time will tell.

159
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
Robin, your view?

160
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,980
I completely agree that the key question here is to lay out sort of the distribution of

161
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,020
possibilities plausible for our future and then try to use that as a guide to what to

162
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,300
look for in the sky for other analogous descendants of aliens.

163
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,860
The most striking fact about human history is just how many orders of magnitude of size

164
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,600
difference there has been across history in terms of enormous change.

165
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,260
And then for many elements of human history today or recently, we have sort of power law

166
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,120
distributions with very thick tails if you think about war or pandemics.

167
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,200
And so when I think into the future, the median scenario may well be an empty desert.

168
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,800
But it's important to think about the thick tail of the largest possibilities for our

169
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,720
future, because if there's a distribution of things like us out in the universe, we

170
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,080
can see so far that if it's a thick tail, most likely the median thing we see would

171
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,560
be in that thickest, that highest tail of the distribution.

172
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,880
That is, in history, the median person who died in a pandemic or war probably died in

173
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,080
nearly the largest pandemic or largest war ever because those things have such thick

174
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,360
tails. And probably if we see any evidence of aliens out there, they are probably in

175
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,200
the thick tail of the largest, most impactful aliens out there.

176
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,200
So I think we do want to think about if they could manage to survive and grow, just how

177
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,920
big might they get, how much energy might they use, how much might they change their

178
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,640
physical environment? That's the sort of thing to be looking for out there.

179
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,560
Even if it's very rare as a descendant of where we are, it still has disproportionate

180
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,520
impact. So that's the question is, and that's, you know, what our analysis of

181
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,080
gravity aliens, we're basically assuming something of that sort and then looking for

182
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,920
that, even knowing, of course, it's probably a very unlikely outcome from where we are

183
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,960
today, but still the expected value of the future is still dominated by that thick tail

184
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,480
high end of the distribution scenario.

185
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,400
Yeah, I completely agree that we can get our inspiration from the tail of the distribution

186
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,600
because we are probably somewhere in the middle.

187
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,080
And the question is, how far does the tail go and whether it's dominated by AI, for

188
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,760
example, rather than biological systems.

189
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,520
And what are the capabilities for propulsion in particular?

190
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,160
How far can you go over a billion years at what speed?

191
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,760
These are really parameters that establish the reach of those of that tail.

192
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,840
And indeed, if you if you even have just one civilization within the Milky Way galaxy

193
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,800
that produced within the last 10 billion years, produced self-replicating probes,

194
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,040
those probes could fill up the Milky Way galaxy, even if they are driven by chemical

195
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,400
propulsion. So we really don't know how far the tail goes.

196
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,600
And as you say, Robin, one way to find it is by looking at the sky.

197
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,640
I completely agree.

198
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,320
Now, have we looked enough?

199
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,000
In other words, do we have any kind of a sampling?

200
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,120
Now, we do have a sampling of an alien civilization because we are someone else's alien

201
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,400
civilization. But there are also many other things about us.

202
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,360
But that to me would suggest that we're part of a statistical population of like

203
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,920
occurrences in the universe and they may be far from each other.

204
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,800
They may be near. But what would make and I'll direct this first at Robin and let

205
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,000
you guys go. What would make a civilization grabby enough to cross vast

206
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,720
amounts of space time to expand?

207
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,520
Well, I'm an economist, but of course, I know a lot of what the rest of us know

208
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,840
biology in our history on Earth, both among humans and among biology.

209
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,400
We've just seen a competitive tendency wherein if there's no central power to

210
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,240
limit it, different parts grow as much as they can fill as whatever niches they can.

211
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,120
And that's what produces a natural tendency to grow and fill available resources.

212
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,440
And if you then had an alien civilization that had no center, but had many competing

213
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,560
parts, each of which was able to explore different technologies and different

214
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,040
social strategies, etc., then what we might expect is a selection effect by even

215
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,480
if 99 percent of them are very peaceful and happy to not stay home, the one percent

216
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,960
that isn't would then dominate the longer term future in terms of going out and

217
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,960
doing stuff. And so the question is, do we have a reason to think the selection

218
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,520
effect of decentralized competition would produce any limits on just how far they

219
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,160
might go and what they might do? Is there things they wouldn't touch because it

220
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,600
would be easier to touch something else?

221
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,200
So one standard story is the stuff we see is not the most efficient resource to

222
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,040
touch or use or grab.

223
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,760
So maybe there's another thing we don't see and they're also happy using that

224
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,360
other thing that they can't be bothered to waste their extra effort to grab and

225
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,520
use the stuff we see.

226
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,440
That could be an explanation for why there's all this stuff we see that seems

227
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,240
untouched. But that is a bit of a stretch.

228
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,960
But I'm open to hearing an explanation like that.

229
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,880
But my default is the stuff we see is useful, could be used for do to do stuff.

230
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,120
And if you were greedy and growing and competing, you would grab the stuff we see

231
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,200
like stars and change them and use them.

232
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Yeah, it really depends on the way we apply Darwinian selection in the interstellar

233
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,040
context, because if you look at on Earth, you know, the species that is currently

234
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,840
manipulating most of the resources are humans and they're not necessarily the

235
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,480
strongest physically and not necessarily the most aggressive physically among all

236
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,720
animals. So I think in interstellar space, what matters is the ability to go across

237
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,240
large distances and survive the journey and accomplish your goals after a very

238
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,280
long amount of time. And the goals are not clear to me.

239
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:51,040
You know, it's not necessarily bringing resources back home because just using

240
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,720
chemical propulsion to go to Proxima Centauri, the nearest star, takes fifty

241
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,240
thousand years one way.

242
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,640
So that's the amount of time that elapsed roughly since the first humans left

243
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,680
Africa. And if we were to grab something from Proxima Centauri B, it would take

244
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,880
a hundred thousand years.

245
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,000
Not everyone would be patient enough for such a procedure.

246
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So unless you find a propulsion technology that reaches close to the speed

247
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,080
of light, that can do whatever the Starship booster did recently, which is to

248
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,280
accelerate and then decelerate, get to the destination, grab something and then

249
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,200
accelerate and decelerate again close to the speed of light.

250
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,520
And one thing to keep in mind is moving at the speed of light makes every

251
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,360
obstacle along the way, basically more energetic than a nuclear explosion.

252
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,920
It's a, you basically, if you move at the speed of light, you release as much as

253
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
the rest mass energy of that obstacle.

254
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:58,280
So it's very easy to destroy a probe that moves too fast by even dust particles

255
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,880
along the way, if you're crossing distances of the order of the size of the

256
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Milky Way galaxy.

257
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,480
So it's not at all obvious to me that technologically speaking, the ambitions

258
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,880
we have on earth can be realized in interstellar space.

259
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,080
And the one ambition that I would imagine for us going to interstellar space

260
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,240
would be to maintain the longevity of the, of whatever we find precious on earth,

261
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,320
either maintaining the human culture, civilization out there or maintaining our

262
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,560
knowledge or just showing that we existed, building a monument on exoplanets.

263
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,280
And all of these would not be very grabby.

264
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,200
That would be more in the spirit of we existed here and here are some more

265
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,240
details about it, or we appreciate this and that.

266
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,600
And we are using 3D printers and the AI to recreate those things on your planet.

267
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,760
And if we had a visitor with similar ambitions, then perhaps, you know, it

268
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,640
wouldn't be as grabby, it wouldn't be as dangerous.

269
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,400
I mean, Stephen Hawking was very worried about predators and he argued that we

270
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,800
should be careful, but I see any encounter with a more advanced civilization

271
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,360
that arrives to our doorstep as an opportunity for us to learn.

272
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,960
I don't see that as a threat.

273
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,680
So we're recording this on what used to be called Columbus Day, I guess now also

274
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:26,880
indigenous people's day and the effects of Columbus voyage weren't that dependent

275
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,680
on his motives for the voyage.

276
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,760
He and the various people on the boat had a variety of motives, many of which

277
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,360
were of the sort you described.

278
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,400
And I agree with you that if people today are thinking, why would I want to go into

279
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,640
a space, they aren't mostly with grabby motives.

280
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:48,000
I would just say that we have these deep, robust theories of biological evolution

281
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,280
and cultural evolution, and they are basically dependent on selection effects,

282
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,480
not really on motives.

283
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,640
And the selection effect is also pretty strong and clear if any part of the

284
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,800
distribution decides to go out and expand and use resources, then it will happen.

285
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,320
It's not really about where the median of the distribution is or what they

286
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,280
motive or what they'll do.

287
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,480
If the question is just, will there be any part of the distribution, certainly

288
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,440
going to the new world here, we didn't need the median European colonists to be

289
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,720
especially hostile or especially grabby.

290
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,880
As long as some of them were, it happened.

291
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,520
Yeah.

292
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,320
Well, you have to distinguish between the will, the intent and the ability to

293
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,120
accomplish it, because it may well be that, you know, technologically speaking,

294
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,840
it's not possible to be very grabby because it takes so much time to bring stuff.

295
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,480
Well, again, most of colonization of biology or in culture wasn't to bring

296
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,520
stuff back to home.

297
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,000
It was just to go out there and be there and have descendants further on.

298
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,800
That's the selection effect just predicts the people will go.

299
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,440
It doesn't predict they will bring stuff back.

300
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,160
So the question is just can our descendants in say 10 million years or more,

301
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,720
not in the next hundred or thousand in 10 million years with these sort of further

302
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,280
technological and economic advances we can expect, will we then be possible to

303
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,760
leave here, go to another star system, not bring stuff home, just survive, regrow,

304
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,440
and then be able to send out another colonist further.

305
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,040
And then there's the further question of what's the fastest feasible speed for that.

306
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,360
So if, if people go out at different speeds of colonization, they'll also be on

307
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,000
a selection effect, the fastest strategy will win, it will dominate the frontier.

308
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,240
So it is a question about the limits of this thick tail of distribution, just how

309
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,400
far can we go?

310
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,360
So you might even say we can go within a galaxy, but couldn't go between

311
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,920
galaxies.

312
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,360
Say you might think it's just too hard to go between galaxies, but because

313
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,480
that's even farther, it's too long.

314
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,160
It's not too hard.

315
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,080
I mean, let's talk about propulsion, right?

316
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,960
So, so far, all the spacecraft that we launched to interstellar space are moving

317
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,400
at tens of kilometers per second.

318
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,640
That's one part in 10,000 of the speed of light, 10,000 times slower than the

319
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,200
speed of light.

320
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,160
I just wrote a paper with an undergraduate student at Harvard, Shokruz

321
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:22,360
Kakarov, a month ago where we calculated where will Voyager be in a billion years.

322
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,240
In two billion years, it will be on the other side of the Milky Way disk of stars.

323
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,600
Okay.

324
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,760
So, so it really takes billions of years for the chemical rockets that we produced

325
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,720
to traverse the Milky Way.

326
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,080
Now you can ask, okay, is there some other propulsion method that will do it much

327
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,640
faster?

328
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,080
And that was the question that the Yuri Milner asked me in 2015, about a decade

329
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:53,120
ago, when he came to my office and wanted to invest funds in a research program to

330
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,120
reach a proxima centauri within our lifetime.

331
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,520
And we are both at the same age.

332
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,560
So that means getting there within 20 years, that since the star is four light

333
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,520
years away, it means moving at a fifth of the speed of light.

334
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,720
And the only method, so I worked on it for half a year with my students and post

335
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,400
docs, and we looked at various engines that you can dream about, such as matter,

336
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,840
antimatter, annihilation.

337
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,320
You can think of nuclear fusion, nuclear fission, all kinds of engines.

338
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,720
And right now, the only feasible method that brings you close to the speed of

339
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,120
light, let's say a fifth of the speed of light, is light sails.

340
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:39,960
If you have a very lightweight probe that is just a few grams attached to a sail,

341
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,040
the size of a person, and you push it with a powerful laser of about a hundred gigawatt

342
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,520
for a few minutes, it could reach a fifth of the speed of light.

343
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,560
But that will not transport people that will not reach the objectives of actually

344
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,760
landing on it, because you need to slow it down when it arrives to a destination.

345
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,560
So that, you know, if you move it to a fifth of the speed of light, how do you

346
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,600
stop it without having a laser on the other, at the other hand?

347
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,400
So I think the technological challenges are really huge in terms of imagining a

348
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,960
system that can approach the speed of light.

349
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,120
Do you have any solution for that, Robin?

350
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,920
So there's several key parameters here to think about.

351
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,480
One is the mass of the delivered product and what would be the minimum mass

352
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,800
required to deliver something like us that could reproduce and rebuild a

353
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,080
civilization at the other end?

354
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,960
So you're thinking, I think of our human size masses, maybe, and saying a gram is

355
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,400
way too, way too little.

356
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,520
Another key parameter here is the speed.

357
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,320
And as you know, we do have ways to move small things very fast, given pretty

358
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,280
large, but feasible energy budgets.

359
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,600
But the third key parameter is what is the future energy budget that we are

360
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,240
anticipating used to to do this project?

361
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:07,600
So if we project current energy growth rates into the future, then in 10,000 years,

362
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,400
you'll have plenty of energy to send even a human size thing near the speed of

363
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,080
light. But as you say, it's not just the energy you need shields and or ways to

364
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,600
shoot things out of the way, et cetera.

365
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,200
You'll need ways to decelerate.

366
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,360
You also are you're not allowed to go above 10G because that's what pilots,

367
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,880
fighter jet pilots do.

368
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,000
So I was an artificial intelligence researcher for nine years, and I've been

369
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,920
around futurists for many decades, including my friend Eric Drexler, Mr.

370
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,440
Nanotechnology. And so in that world, we've always assumed that our descendants

371
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,840
who would be going to the stars just wouldn't be meat humans like us, it would

372
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,720
be other sorts of creatures.

373
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,040
So I have this book called The Age of M Work, Love and Life and Robots Rule the

374
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,480
Earth, which is about brain emulations.

375
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,520
They would certainly be implemented in silicon or whatever and able to be sent

376
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,560
on much smaller mass in much harder environments.

377
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:12,200
But regardless of whether that's our kind of descended or other kinds of AI, yes,

378
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,640
I think that by the time we would actually send something to another star, it

379
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,000
wouldn't be meat like you or I, it would be some sort of a digital descendant.

380
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,800
I completely agree.

381
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,400
I mean, I think the future might be technology, AI rather than biological.

382
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,360
But let me ask you, are you intrigued by reports from the Director of National

383
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,320
Intelligence and other military personnel that there might be objects near Earth

384
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,920
that are anomalous or do you disregard them?

385
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,800
I don't at all disregard them.

386
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,480
So basically we're having this conversation in part because a couple of years ago, I

387
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,120
published this paper in the Astrophysical Journal on what we call gravity aliens.

388
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,200
It's analysis of where aliens are in space time and I'm proud of that analysis.

389
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,880
I don't think it's at all definitive, but I think it's thought provoking at least.

390
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,640
And then being someone who in that sense was an expert on aliens, I thought it was

391
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,920
my duty to engage this hypothesis that's often prominent in our civilization that

392
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,960
in fact, there are signs that are hard to explain except via their aliens.

393
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So my way I would frame that is to say an analysis of UFOs and whether they're

394
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,320
aliens or other sorts of strange objects or events is the Bayesian way to do that

395
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,200
is to have a prior and a likelihood and that I've looked at enough of the

396
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,200
particular data to say this isn't easily dismissed and it's complicated.

397
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,440
And I'm not an expert in the things you need to know to judge those particular

398
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,840
events, but I am kind of an expert in the prior in the sense that my analysis sets

399
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,760
me up to analyze the prior and then you might ask, okay, what prior do I come off

400
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,520
and what would be a relevant standard for the prior?

401
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,680
And I'd say, think about a murder accusation in our society.

402
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,880
On average, one out of a thousand people is murdered.

403
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,080
On average, maybe they have a thousand people around them who plausibly could

404
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,480
have done it.

405
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,520
So the prior probability for any one murder accusation is roughly one in a million.

406
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,960
And if you thought that's so crazy low, we should never even consider murder

407
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,760
accusations, well, that's just wrong.

408
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,080
We often do have evidence that's able to rise above to elevate a one in a million

409
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,280
prior up to above 50-50.

410
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,600
That's just the fact of the kind of evidence we often have in our world.

411
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,720
So if you can get a prior on UFOs being aliens above one in a million, I think you

412
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,160
have to at least look at the evidence.

413
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
And if it's well above that, you'll have to look at it more.

414
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,520
And my rough estimate from my analysis was roughly one in 10,000 to one in a

415
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,280
thousand prior.

416
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,680
That is given my basic background analysis of aliens in space, you know, in

417
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,080
space time, that's roughly what I'd assign to there being aliens right here, right

418
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,840
now, looking roughly like they do.

419
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,120
The two key features are they're here now, but not anywhere visible else in the

420
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,680
sky.

421
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
That's one key feature.

422
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,320
And the other key feature is they're hanging out near the edge of visibility.

423
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,080
They could be really obvious or they could be completely invisible.

424
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,480
And for some strange reason, they aren't doing either of those two things by

425
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,160
hypothesis.

426
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,240
And so you need to explain that.

427
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,600
So again, I came up with what I thought were the most likely auxiliary assumptions

428
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,760
given my basic analysis that would predict they're here in those forms.

429
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,320
And I say roughly one in a thousand to one 10,000.

430
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,680
And so I say to conclude, you got to look at the evidence.

431
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,040
That's strong enough prior that you got to look right.

432
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,440
Exactly.

433
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
So here we come, we come together.

434
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,920
So here we come together because my approach is not to have a prior in a way.

435
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,960
I just want to seek the evidence.

436
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,360
I think the mistake being made by a lot of people is they have an opinion.

437
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,280
And it's just like in politics, people are driven to the extremes.

438
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,680
You have believers and you have skeptics and you know, the common sensical thing

439
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,880
to do is just collect as much evidence as possible and figure out what, what,

440
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,080
what is out there.

441
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,520
And then, you know, you, unfortunately you can't train AI on common sense

442
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,440
because it's not very common.

443
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,320
Unfortunately, the middle of the road in politics or in science is not populated

444
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,640
much.

445
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,760
Most people just have an opinion, which is one extreme or the other.

446
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,240
And in the context of objects near earth, my approach is to collect as much data

447
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,160
as possible and just figure out if all of them are rocks, so be it, and we will

448
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,240
learn something new about rocks from outside the solar system, because even my

449
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,160
colleagues who criticize me, they keep arguing that Oumuamua, this first

450
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,880
interstellar object was a rock of a type that we've never seen before.

451
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,120
So even if they are right, since we haven't seen such a rock before, it teaches

452
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,880
us something new and we learn something in the process.

453
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,200
And that's the benefit of doing science.

454
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,360
And therefore we should get as much data as possible.

455
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,080
And by the way, the only danger to such a process of collecting data are people

456
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,600
like the expert that told me after hearing a talk about Oumuamua, he said

457
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,400
that Oumuamua is so weird, I wish it never existed.

458
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,480
And that's to me exactly the opposite attitude to the one that a curious

459
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,520
scientist should have, and which is to say, oh, nature is showing me some

460
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,040
anomalies, perhaps I'm missing something.

461
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,080
That's an opportunity to learn something new.

462
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,080
And, you know, rather than being attached to past knowledge, let's figure

463
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,360
out what these things are.

464
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,280
And so I completely agree with you.

465
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,480
Now, why do I not assign a prior when I decide what to do?

466
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,680
Because I've seen it over and over again in human history and philosophy where

467
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,280
people made mistakes assigning the wrong priors, you know, that was true during

468
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,520
the days of Copernicus.

469
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,840
And in fact, just earlier this year, I was invited by the Polish government to

470
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,440
give a lecture honoring the 550th birthday of Nicolaus Copernicus, and I

471
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,760
dedicated it to the next Copernican revolution, meaning that we are not at

472
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,680
the intellectual center of the universe.

473
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,040
And Galileo Galilei, the same thing.

474
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,640
And the church admitted in 1992 that Galileo was right.

475
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,840
That was 20 years after humans landed on the moon.

476
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,800
It was a bit late.

477
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,640
So it's just that the church had the wrong prior.

478
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,720
Aristotle had the wrong prior.

479
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,640
Blaise Pascal argued we should all believe in God because if it's out there,

480
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,320
you know, the implications are huge.

481
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,720
Again, he assigned, I guess, a uniform prior to whether God exists or not.

482
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,600
I really don't want to assign priors.

483
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,320
I just want to examine what's out there because even if we find just rocks from

484
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,640
other stars, it will teach us something new.

485
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,720
So I say, what do we have to lose?

486
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,040
You know, we invested billions of dollars in the search for dark matter.

487
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,440
Eighty five percent of the matter in the universe has a nature that we are not

488
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,880
familiar with, and we are just experimenting, looking for various types.

489
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,240
And, you know, people are having conjectures.

490
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,120
And I say, well, we should at least invest as much money in the search for

491
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,880
objects near earth for the reasons that you, Robin, mentioned, and also

492
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,480
because we haven't done so.

493
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,320
And it's such an important question that the public cares about.

494
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,840
So let's just do it agnostically without assuming anything, rather than having an

495
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,760
opinion and ridiculing whoever collects the evidence.

496
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,280
I agree that it's easy to be overconfident and that it's often been a failure in

497
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,800
history, especially of theorists to be overconfident.

498
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,200
And I am a theorist and I take that to heart and try to be less overconfident.

499
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,640
But I'll also point out that it's really hard to observe without some priors.

500
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,480
So I'll note that, for example, you're not sorting, you know, dust in your

501
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,240
living room floor there, looking for signs.

502
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,560
Your priors don't expect the evidence to be there.

503
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,240
You expect, for example, to especially be interested in objects from

504
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,440
outside the solar system.

505
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,760
When you're looking for maybe evidence of an object in the ocean, you're

506
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,080
looking for pieces of metal.

507
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,160
Those are all based on priors.

508
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,840
They're based on theoretical presumptions that give you expectations

509
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,600
about what to look for.

510
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,920
And that's completely appropriate.

511
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,400
Yeah.

512
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,640
The parameters of the search definitely depend on some assumptions.

513
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,600
You're completely right.

514
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,640
But I would compare it to a detective who is seeking evidence in a crime scene.

515
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,520
And I would be happy to find things that I did not expect.

516
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,440
It's just that it will take too much time if I were to look at everything.

517
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,520
So I'm primarily guided first by reports on unusual things, the US government

518
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,240
reports about it.

519
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,800
There will be perhaps a hearing in the US Congress in November about some

520
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,360
additional whistleblowers.

521
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,480
And in addition, astronomers are finding for the first time over the past decade,

522
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,200
objects from outside the solar system.

523
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,920
And next year, the Rubin Observatory will use a 3.2 gigapixel camera to survey

524
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,360
the southern sky every four days and could find more objects like Oumuamua.

525
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,920
So I'm saying there are these opportunities that come our way and we

526
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,640
should not lose sight of the benefit that they could bring if we examine

527
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,320
whether all these objects are rocks or familiar objects versus something

528
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,240
completely new that we never imagined.

529
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,680
Here we come together, you come at it from a point of view of, you know, let's

530
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,640
try and imagine what is the tale of the distribution.

531
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,920
I should mention that indeed most stars are dwarf stars that are a tenth of the

532
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,800
mass of the sun, they live for up to a thousand times longer than the sun will.

533
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,880
And so you would expect us to exist in the future next to a dwarf star.

534
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,160
How come we exist right now next to a star like the sun?

535
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,600
And the answer is that it's quite possible that dwarf stars have the

536
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,440
ultraviolet flares, x-ray flares that sterilize planets next to them.

537
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,160
So they don't support life as we know it.

538
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,120
And that's why we find ourselves next to a rare star called the sun.

539
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,400
And so, you know, I won't give too much weight to the future necessarily,

540
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,680
because the sun is roughly at the middle of its lifespan.

541
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,680
Most stars formed billions of years before the sun.

542
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,680
So most stars finished the part of their history where they had a

543
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,360
habitable planet next to them.

544
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,920
And I'm talking about most sun-like stars.

545
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,280
So we are sort of at the typical, we are living at the typical time for us to

546
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:27,360
exist. And I really wouldn't be too much worried that something completely

547
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,320
unexpected will happen in our future, which is one of the points you make in

548
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
your paper.

549
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,160
So as we both agreed, we want to try to be open-minded and not impose

550
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,920
overconfident priors, but then we also want to use the priors that we have to

551
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,320
some degree to know where to look.

552
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,680
And that shows up in this time argument.

553
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,120
The most agnostic position would be that there's lots of different paths to

554
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,000
advance life and therefore our particular path isn't especially informative about

555
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,240
the space of all possible paths.

556
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,520
And from that point of view, we might say, look, half of all planets are deep ocean

557
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,480
worlds and all these problems that everybody's identified with these dwarf

558
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,760
stars are just not a problem for ocean worlds.

559
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,600
Maybe you could say maybe ocean worlds just can't support advanced life, but

560
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,840
that's one of these prior ifs.

561
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,720
How would they see the star?

562
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,960
How would they imagine an intelligent being under the ocean?

563
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,560
How would they see the stars and know that they have a place to go to?

564
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,520
So if you look at the history of our life on Earth and where we came to, one of

565
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,360
the key inferences we're trying to draw about history is which of the steps

566
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,760
along the way to where we are were very hard and unlikely and which of the steps

567
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,120
were relatively easy.

568
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,520
And the time duration that steps took is an important clue to how hard they were.

569
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,400
So when we see billions of years taken to achieve, you know, sexual selection or

570
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,880
eukaryotes or, you know, multicellularity, we'd say those are plausibly hard things

571
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,520
because they took billions of years.

572
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,160
But pretty much anything that's happened in the last million years isn't very

573
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,480
plausibly a hard step, at least of the sort that you would have done to try over

574
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,120
and over again. It might have been a hard step in the sense of there were several

575
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,360
directions to go. And if you went the wrong way, you could never undo that.

576
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,080
You just always be stuck going the wrong direction.

577
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,200
So we might have had try one steps like that in the last million years where we

578
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,040
just got lucky to go in the right direction.

579
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,640
But the sort of try try steps, those in the last million years, those can't have

580
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,920
been very hard. So we have clearly in the last million years achieved fire and

581
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,600
metals and technologies and gone into the ocean and into the sky and even into

582
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:46,480
space. And on an ocean world, those steps might in fact be substantially harder,

583
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,960
maybe a factor of a thousand or a million.

584
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,800
But you know what? That still makes them easy compared to the

585
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,040
early history that we have where things took billions of years.

586
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,640
Again, this all of the stuff happened in the last 10,000 years, really.

587
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,640
So I just if I see something that we achieved very quickly, even if I'm willing

588
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,560
to accept that that step would be harder on an ocean world, I still don't.

589
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,560
It's not obvious that it's hard enough to be hard compared to the other clearly

590
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
really hard things that happen.

591
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,960
Well, you know, there are astrobiologists who argue that you really need the

592
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,600
interface between rock and water, between the land and ocean in order to concentrate

593
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,520
the chemical compounds and eventually achieve a complex life.

594
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:42,400
And if that's true, then when we examine Europa, you know, the Europa Clipper is

595
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,200
about to launch very soon and it will look for signatures of life under the ice

596
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,520
in Europa, the moon of Jupiter, because the ice has cracks in it and there are

597
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,000
plumes of vapor coming off.

598
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,160
And we could look for organic molecules and any signature of life under the ice.

599
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,800
But, you know, it may well be that only primitive forms of life are able to

600
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,320
develop under these circumstances simply because of the rate by which chemical

601
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:22,120
reactions take place in a pure water world and their ability to make complex

602
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:30,880
molecules compared to a situation where you can concentrate those molecules by

603
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,040
evaporating the liquid and allowing them to make more complex organisms.

604
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,480
Time will tell.

605
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,760
It's quite possible that ocean worlds are unable to support intelligence.

606
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,680
I would not be surprised if that's the case.

607
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,400
You know, speaking about the liquids, there is only one other body in the solar

608
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,120
system that has liquids on its surface, and that is Titan, a moon of Saturn.

609
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:02,480
And Titan has liquid methane and ethane because its temperature, surface

610
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,000
temperature, is three times lower than the Earth's surface temperature

611
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,200
relative to absolute zero.

612
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,040
It's about 92 degrees Kelvin.

613
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,920
And what I would like during the remainder of my life is to have a trip to Titan and

614
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:24,040
go fishing there because I wonder if there is any fish on that planet.

615
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,160
It would be life as we don't know it because it's a completely different

616
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,560
liquid than water.

617
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,080
And of course, I will not dare to eat that fish because it may be very dangerous to do so.

618
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:41,280
So as you probably know, there was this dramatic paper roughly a week ago showing

619
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,000
that a rock on Earth had life isolated inside it for two billion years and the

620
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,760
life is still going.

621
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,560
That is, the life had been feeding off of clay inside a rock on Earth for two

622
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,360
billion years.

623
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,000
That greatly, to me, ups the estimate of the feasibility of panspermia, which then

624
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,240
ups the estimate of the likelihood of panspermia.

625
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,640
So I got to say now I'm guessing that, in fact, many of the rest of the solar

626
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:15,880
system will have primitive life on it and may well find that elsewhere in the

627
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,840
galaxy near us.

628
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,520
Yeah, that's quite possible.

629
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,840
And, you know, if you are correct, then Mars is a smaller body than Earth.

630
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,880
So it cooled earlier and we might all be Martians because life started on Mars

631
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,080
earlier. And in that case, Elon Musk's ambitions are dwarfed because, you know,

632
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,960
microbes were tiny astronauts that made it from Mars to Earth long before Musk

633
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,960
was born and they accomplished the task.

634
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,760
And his ambition is just like returning to our childhood home, in a way.

635
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,360
So I mentioned that I tried to come up with the most likely scenario in which

636
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,440
UFOs could be aliens.

637
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,360
And one key element of that scenario was panspermia siblings.

638
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,360
The idea that in order for the universe to be so empty, but we still have aliens

639
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,880
near us, they could have a common origin with us.

640
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,080
And therefore, if only the ones with a common origin, they chose not to go

641
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,560
expanding and making a big difference.

642
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,680
That could explain why we don't see much near us.

643
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,000
But they're here now because that would also explain why they're here.

644
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,680
They want us not to expand because they didn't do it.

645
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,520
And if we did it, we would break whatever purpose they had in preventing

646
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,320
themselves from doing it.

647
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,120
So, yeah.

648
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,720
And then, of course, in principle, there could be other panspermia siblings.

649
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,240
Roughly, our stellar nursery probably had like 10,000 stars, each of which

650
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,120
spread into a ring around the galaxy.

651
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,200
And those are the best candidates for looking for other life.

652
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,560
And we can actually see their spectral signature to find them and to

653
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,680
look specifically at them.

654
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:51,840
I agree.

655
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,520
And one thing to keep in mind that in interstellar space, there are only legal

656
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,520
aliens, there aren't any illegal aliens, because the legal system applies

657
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,920
only to Earth or to humans in particular.

658
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,480
Yes, right.

659
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:09,040
So, I mean, certainly part of what's going on here is I'm an economist, I'm

660
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,960
not an astrophysicist, but my willingness to jump into this area is the fact that

661
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,400
I see things more from an economist's point of view and see maybe the future

662
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,520
of our civilization as a analogy for aliens in economic terms.

663
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,120
And we economists tend to think that growth will be more likely and even

664
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,800
graviness will be more likely.

665
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,240
And I think astrophysicists are often a little shy about presuming our

666
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,640
descendants will be so gauche or crude as to be grabbing.

667
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,000
Okay.

668
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,960
So, Robin, I have an offer for you.

669
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,640
I will search for them.

670
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,560
And if I find evidence, I will come back to you.

671
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,040
You will be the first that I inform of my findings and you will tell me how

672
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,880
to devise an economic strategy so as to raise enough funds to continue to

673
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,000
father the research so that we can learn much more about them.

674
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,080
So there is an economic aspect to the search and that is how many funds are

675
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,720
allocated to the search because people often say, you know, extraordinary

676
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,960
claims require extraordinary evidence.

677
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,240
My point is extraordinary evidence requires extraordinary funding.

678
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,640
Absolutely.

679
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,800
And so most of the time what happens is people have an opinion.

680
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,480
They don't put the funding or the intellectual resources to actually

681
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,640
explore possibilities the way, you know, some astronomers did in the

682
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,760
context of dark matter.

683
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,400
There was huge amounts of effort, right?

684
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,520
Nothing was found yet.

685
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:37,840
Absolutely.

686
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,200
And I'm saying why not invest similar resources on a question that the

687
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,520
public cares so much about?

688
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,160
And I haven't heard a reasonable answer so far.

689
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,920
Well, as an economist, I study academia as a social institution.

690
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,280
And I would say my simplest summary of academia is that academics sell

691
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,400
association with credentialed impressiveness.

692
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,960
That's the main thing we sell.

693
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,480
So students and journalists and funders all gain prestige by association

694
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,360
with credentialed impressive people.

695
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,240
That's what we are.

696
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,840
Our product isn't actually intellectual progress or discovery.

697
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,560
It is association with credentialed impressiveness.

698
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,120
When a referee, you know, report evaluates a paper, they are primarily

699
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,200
asking how impressive was this, not how important or interesting is it.

700
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,480
And that's what we sell.

701
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,880
So unfortunately, this world of impressiveness, prestige, humans are

702
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,720
such that we tend to trust the prestigious to tell us what's prestigious.

703
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:45,840
And so it is the dominant players in academia who decide what counts as

704
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,840
prestigious impressive academic work.

705
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,800
And so there happens to be a fad or culture for a half century that looks

706
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,680
down on this topic as foolish and ignorant, low class.

707
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,640
And as a result, academics have been really quite energetically

708
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,960
running away from it for a long time, which makes it a problem.

709
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,320
If you want funding, you're asking the funder to associate with your

710
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,920
alternative interpretation of what should be considered prestigious.

711
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,280
You basically need a contrarian funder of sorts who will be willing to embrace

712
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,880
that contrarian identity.

713
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,840
There are such, but they are a smaller fraction.

714
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,200
Most people who donate to universities and grant organizations in general are

715
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,000
merely trying to be conservatively prestigious by association with the

716
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,640
usual organizations doing the usual things.

717
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,840
Yeah, but I should say, well, first of all, I do have such funders

718
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,920
and I do get a lot of attention to the research I'm doing.

719
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,160
So in fact, this week I had a podcast that garnered more viewers than

720
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,240
Kamala Harris on the same day.

721
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,440
And I do think that the public is excited by the science.

722
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,120
So, and of course, some members of the public are wealthy enough to

723
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,440
contribute to this research, but I would give all the money in the world.

724
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,520
Even if I was offered it, I would give all the money in the world, all the

725
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:16,080
prestige in the world, just for knowing if there is an intelligent partner in

726
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,680
our cosmic neighborhood.

727
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,800
Just knowing that is worth more than the Nobel Prize, than academic tenure,

728
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,280
than everything because, and that's all I'm trying to find out, you know, that.

729
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,400
Okay, well, let me, I have a downer message for you, which is the most

730
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,000
likely scenario I can come up with of why UFOs would actually be aliens.

731
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,720
Has their agenda not being very fun?

732
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,800
They are here.

733
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,800
They made some rule at their home world a long time ago that they're not going to

734
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,200
allow generic expansion and colonization.

735
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,080
They successfully enforced that for at least 100 million years.

736
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,960
They realized that if any of their siblings arose and might expand, they

737
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,840
would break that rule.

738
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:03,840
So their primary motive is to come here and convince us not to expand or grow.

739
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,520
And they hope to do that voluntarily, persuasively.

740
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,040
Otherwise, they would have just killed us.

741
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,880
So you're saying they're members of academia.

742
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,760
They're here to keep us from being too ambitiously, you know, colonizing,

743
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,280
expanding, which is what some of our colleagues are doing.

744
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,000
Yes.

745
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,640
And their agenda for us is limited.

746
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:28,720
That is, they want us to agree and accept a limited agenda for our future to be in

747
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,200
their shadow, following their rules.

748
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,880
That's why they're here.

749
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,040
And unfortunately, they've got plenty of time.

750
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,480
They don't need to be in a rush about it.

751
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,840
Eventually, we'll figure it out.

752
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,800
But then when we finally do, they're not really going to tell us much.

753
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,920
They're not going to help us much.

754
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,760
They're just going to set up this limit on us and say, accept our greater judgment

755
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,160
and wisdom because we are your superiors.

756
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,080
And you should just do what we say, which is to stay here and not leave.

757
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,920
And that's it.

758
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,200
Yeah.

759
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:03,600
Well, let me give you an indicator of the fact that I have a good marriage.

760
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,760
Because a decade ago, when I asked my wife, what does she think about these subjects,

761
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:16,400
she said, well, it looks to me like you're a bit different than the rest of us.

762
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,440
And if aliens come to our backyard to pick you up because you must have come from

763
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,080
somewhere else, just make sure that you leave the car keys with me and ask them not to ruin

764
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,440
the loan when they lift off.

765
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,200
And I asked her again this year.

766
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,880
And she said that she's so frustrated with what's going on around the world

767
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,400
that she will actually join me.

768
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:38,720
OK.

769
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:46,880
And just yesterday, I got an email from someone who said that they read my latest book,

770
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:52,160
Interstellar, and they cried while reading some of the paragraphs there because it

771
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,760
resonates with their wishes to go somewhere else.

772
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,400
Unfortunately, that just seems very unlikely.

773
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,640
That is, clearly, if aliens are here, they have the option to be very visible, to be

774
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:10,080
very clear, and then to help us give it against technology, keep imposing world peace.

775
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,280
They definitely had that option and chose not to do it.

776
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:20,400
They are not here to help us, to show us things, to teach us things.

777
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,200
They have chosen not to do that.

778
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,760
They have chosen not to do that.

779
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,320
There's nothing we're going to really be able to do to change their mind about that, I expect.

780
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:36,480
Well, you see, so Robin, we are different in that aspect because I believe that we are

781
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,480
not that important, that we are completely irrelevant to what they're here for.

782
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,360
And so that's why we don't hear from them.

783
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,160
If they are here, they may employ technologies that are not easily detectable by us.

784
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,680
But we just don't matter in the big scheme of things.

785
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,040
For a good reason, we are just not sufficiently intelligent.

786
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,640
And perhaps once we leave our solar system, we will hear a message saying,

787
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,720
welcome to the interstellar club.

788
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,560
But until we do that, we are just uninteresting.

789
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,280
I find that hard to scare with the basic evidence here.

790
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,200
Again, presuming that UFOs are aliens, that the most basic thing we know about them is

791
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:21,120
some of them are here now, or recently, and they could have been everywhere we see in

792
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,160
the galaxy near us.

793
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,680
Clearly, again, they have been around for long enough and have powers.

794
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,680
They could have remade the galaxy around us.

795
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,120
So they didn't.

796
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,240
There's clearly some information in the fact they did not do that.

797
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,680
That means most everywhere out there hasn't been touched much.

798
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,800
So they're here now, touching this now, but not most everything.

799
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,160
That just makes us special.

800
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,960
For some reason, they are here now, but not most everywhere.

801
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,280
Well, just think about AI, as an example, where you might have a relationship with

802
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:55,520
a Chad GPT that will sound very sincere and authentic, but in fact, there are millions

803
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,800
of subscribers that would also have an authentic conversation of that nature.

804
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,080
So it's not really about you.

805
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,600
Well, if stuff at our level is very common in the galaxy, then they could be hanging

806
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,720
out near all sorts of stuff like us almost everywhere.

807
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,840
Yeah, right.

808
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,640
That's my point.

809
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,160
But then I have to infer that the probability that we would go from our level to something

810
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,000
very visible is enormously small.

811
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,440
So that's the great filter, the phrase I gave 25 years ago to the fact that we don't see

812
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:27,920
anything.

813
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,560
You need an explanation for that great filter.

814
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,400
I'm guessing you're thinking in terms of just technological infeasibility.

815
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,480
It's just not possible to go out and make big, visible changes.

816
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,320
That just doesn't fit with the physics I know or the engineering I know.

817
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
It does seem physically possible.

818
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,960
No, I'm not saying that.

819
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,040
Even with chemical rockets, it will take us a billion years, which is 10% of the age of

820
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,600
the galaxy.

821
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,480
So there could have been objects that were launched with chemical rockets that are in

822
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,360
our backyard.

823
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,120
That definitely is the case, and that's why we should search.

824
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,600
All I'm saying is that we were not significant.

825
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,560
We were not noticeable when the journey started, and therefore they have their own goals that

826
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,920
are completely unrelated to us.

827
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,120
And we keep thinking that we are in their mind.

828
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,360
But I say, forget about it.

829
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,360
Why didn't they take their home star and remake it into a very different, more useful

830
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,560
structure to them, or take a whole cluster of stars and remake that?

831
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,040
That was certainly feasible in the timescale you're talking about.

832
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,400
Well, maybe they did, but at the same time, they could have sent ambassadors.

833
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,160
And these could be AI systems with 3D printers or things that are...

834
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,760
But the question is, what is the goal of the dandelion seeds are sent in the wind?

835
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,160
The dandelion flower sends seeds in the wind in order to replicate itself.

836
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,200
And it's not connected with an umbilical cord to any of the seeds and doesn't care

837
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,320
about what happens to them.

838
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,920
And they land in some fertile grounds and recreate that flower.

839
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,760
So you can imagine a situation similar to that, where they sent lots of probes.

840
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,720
I mean, they have their own megastructure that they enjoy, and they have their private

841
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,160
yard and so forth.

842
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,960
But at the same time, they send these messengers that are pursuing something else.

843
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,800
And those are spreading throughout the galaxy, reproducing themselves.

844
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,720
And we might see some of them near us.

845
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,240
But why don't they do massive reproduction?

846
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,840
Not just have a dandelion seed float past an island.

847
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,160
Why don't they land on the island and grow and fill the island?

848
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,680
Maybe they do, but we just don't notice them.

849
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,960
I don't know how small they are.

850
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,360
Obviously, we will not notice small things flying in our atmosphere.

851
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,120
On Earth, a desolate desert island is different from a jungle-filled island.

852
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:46,080
We definitely see that life, when it can reproduce on the surface of the Earth, at least,

853
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,280
makes a visible difference.

854
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:53,680
Even if each particular cell is invisible to us, the net effect of their exponential

855
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,000
growth filling the island is definitely visible.

856
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,120
And that's the sort of thing I would expect to see in our galaxy.

857
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,400
If dandelion seeds have been floating around for billions of years, growing everywhere

858
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,280
they could, they would just be different now.

859
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,200
Well, let me give you a context here, because based on the meteor that was discovered by

860
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:17,600
the US government satellites in 2014, a decade ago, we can say that there are about a million

861
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:23,360
such objects, roughly half a meter in size, right now within the orbit of the Earth around

862
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,160
the Sun.

863
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,000
And we were not aware of that.

864
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,440
The only reason we became aware of one of them a decade ago is because it collided with

865
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,360
Earth as the Earth orbits the Sun.

866
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,840
And the Earth has a small cross-sectional area.

867
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,080
So every decade, it sweeps across such an object.

868
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:45,680
But there are millions of them going through this region all the time.

869
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:51,600
And it just, to me, illustrates the fact that we haven't really searched very carefully.

870
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,000
Oumuamua was the size of a football field.

871
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,480
That's just bigger than Starship.

872
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:03,760
Starship is a relatively narrow cylinder that gets close to a scale of a hundred meters.

873
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,400
But Oumuamua was most likely flat across such a huge scale and was pushed away from the

874
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Sun by some mysterious force.

875
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,280
So I'm saying there might be smaller objects that we can't detect because they don't reflect

876
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,360
enough sunlight with our current telescopes.

877
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,080
We can see them.

878
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,280
And we are really blind, you know, except if they come really close to Earth.

879
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,880
And these are the UAPs, the unidentified anomalous phenomenon.

880
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,080
If they were dandelion seeds and they would be looking for fertile ground to land in to

881
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,000
grow, and you'd think they would be better at it.

882
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,120
A million things floating in the solar system seem to be incompetent at the task of landing

883
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,440
and growing in the solar system, if that's what they're there for.

884
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:54,320
Well, it depends whether they have their own will, whether they can maneuver or they're

885
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:00,000
just following, you know, forces that nature applies to them like gravity or radiation

886
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,040
pressure, in which case it's a matter of chance for them to meet planets.

887
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,880
Even today, you know, we have many organisms that are smaller than we can see that have

888
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,840
self-directed sensing and planning.

889
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,760
So these huge large structures could easily afford a tiny fraction of themselves with a

890
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,480
little sensing and intelligence and planning.

891
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,680
Definitely.

892
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,760
The only question here is whether it will survive over billions of years, which is

893
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,320
necessary because, you know.

894
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,760
But that's where this rock thing comes in.

895
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:37,040
We've had life on Earth survive in a rock for two billion years running only on the

896
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,640
energy of the clay reactions in that rock, completely sealed off.

897
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,720
So it's definitely possible to last those on.

898
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:50,240
Yeah, by the way, the Earth went through very dramatic transitions in terms of its climate,

899
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:56,240
in terms of, I mean, there was actually about 200 million years ago, there was a major

900
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,960
event that resembled climate change.

901
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,080
And, you know, the question is, what triggered that?

902
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,320
And there are theories for that.

903
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:09,200
But my point is there could have been visits in our past, you know, in 200 million years,

904
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,080
it's just 5% of the age of the Earth.

905
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:17,840
So there could have been events in the past that are not documented because documented

906
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,400
human history is just 5000 years old.

907
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,120
So and we are just not aware of it.

908
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,880
And we measure everything by what we have seen over the past hundreds of years.

909
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,840
And that's a very limited field of view for us.

910
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:35,120
But the implication of that hypothesis is that they didn't really care to land

911
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,120
intelligences like themselves down here to reproduce like themselves.

912
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:44,160
They just were happy to send out any sort of some sort of life like them that was very,

913
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,000
you know, not very smart, basically.

914
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,520
Because whatever landed on Earth in the last 5 billion years, it's either us, we are

915
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,000
their descendants, or they didn't make intelligent descendants of themselves.

916
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,360
Now, so what is your conjecture?

917
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,880
Do you think human intelligence came from out of this Earth?

918
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,280
Or do you think it emerged naturally?

919
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,360
You know, a while ago, I guess there was this hypothesis by Gold or whatever that there

920
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:14,640
was just this steady stream of life from, you know, the universe raining down on Earth

921
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:20,080
and that virus bursts were due to an asteroid with a new virus coming down and that sort of thing.

922
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,200
Like, my understanding is most biologists don't find that very plausible anymore.

923
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,760
So I can't really support that.

924
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,760
But if I can't support that, I'd have to think something very unusual comes down and

925
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,880
it would just be really weird.

926
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:38,080
So like, if Octopi were aliens, that would kind of make sense because they're pretty

927
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,840
different from the rest of stuff down here.

928
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:45,040
So I would be looking at the most weirdly different things down here as the most plausibly

929
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:50,160
something that came down from the sky as opposed to being here on Earth for billions of years.

930
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,640
But clearly, even Octopi aren't as smart as we might think the aliens that could have

931
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,360
sent them would be.

932
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,640
So somehow they still allowed a huge degradation in their capacity.

933
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,240
That's just not very plausible.

934
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
It seems like it wouldn't cost them that much.

935
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,560
For the cost of sending these huge asteroids you're talking about, having a little part

936
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,720
of them save some memory of what they are and how they think wouldn't be very expensive.

937
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,520
So I just...

938
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,000
I agree.

939
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,640
I agree.

940
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,840
And of course, if you imagine artificial intelligence in addition to biological intelligence,

941
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,680
natural intelligence, then the realm of possibilities is far greater.

942
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:31,840
We haven't employed AI in space as of now because the human brain uses 12 watts of power.

943
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:37,120
And AI, our chat GPT or large language models use gigawatts.

944
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,800
AI is not ready to replace this yet, but maybe with an essential.

945
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,160
Not ready to go to space.

946
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,360
Yeah.

947
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:48,080
But by the way, I should say that AI is an abbreviation not just to artificial intelligence,

948
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:53,920
but also to alien intelligence because those systems are made of silicon chips,

949
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,560
very different from the flesh and blood that our brain is made of.

950
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:56,960
Sure.

951
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,720
Now we are trying to align those systems with us.

952
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:07,360
And that may be similar to putting a lipstick on a pig.

953
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:15,040
Because in fact, the strongest traits of those systems might be in

954
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,840
thinking beyond what humans can think differently.

955
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:24,880
And then I think it would be useful for science to allow those systems to process data in a way

956
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:30,960
that does not necessarily imitate, that will not be a digital mirror of a human looking at the data.

957
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,640
You and I completely agree.

958
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,800
I don't know if you know, I've been discussing this subject with futurists for a while now.

959
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:43,680
The person who is most known for being the AI warrior, Eliezer Yudkowski,

960
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:50,240
first discussed his worries in a blog he shared with me for half a decade at least.

961
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,800
And so we discussed that for a long time there.

962
01:02:52,800 --> 01:03:00,320
And yes, many of them are very worried that AIs won't be very faithful to obey and do what we tell them.

963
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:06,720
But my position continues to be that you should just compare them to our other descendants.

964
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:13,680
We never really expected our other descendants to be so obedient or subservient to our plans and culture.

965
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,320
And we shouldn't expect more of the AI than we expected of our other descendants.

966
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:25,840
This is, by the way, it's amazing because I expressed exactly this view without knowing about yours.

967
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,160
And I say those who express these concerns must not be good parents.

968
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,600
Because when you become a parent and I have two daughters,

969
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,480
you realize that you can't be a helicopter parent.

970
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,520
You can't control them.

971
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,120
You have to allow them to do...

972
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,640
You can and people try.

973
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,600
But nevertheless, every generation does end up being different.

974
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,040
People try, but it doesn't work.

975
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,240
It doesn't end up well.

976
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:58,240
And the approach that was, of course, developed over centuries is to educate those intelligent systems

977
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:06,800
to follow your guiding principles and ethical rules such that they will most likely operate

978
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,920
in unpredictable environments in the way that you hope them to operate.

979
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,920
And there is no guarantee.

980
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,120
And so that's the way to deal with intelligent systems.

981
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:20,880
And we can be helicopter parenting the Perseverance Rover on Mars,

982
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,680
or the helicopter that we landed on Mars, the Ingenuity,

983
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,760
just because these are robots that do not have intelligence.

984
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:33,920
But once we venture beyond the solar system, we will have to rely on the probes being autonomous

985
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,960
because they will not be able to transmit the information back to us.

986
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,080
They could send us a postcard the way my...

987
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,720
I think what people are worried about though is something like cultural autonomy.

988
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,400
What they want is for the AIs to retain our overall cultural values and attitudes,

989
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,800
even as individuals can deal with local circumstances.

990
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:00,960
But in fact, I think humanity has a serious problem with what I've called cultural drift.

991
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,600
Our cultural evolution process isn't going well.

992
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,920
And AIs being free to evolve their own culture would actually fix that.

993
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:14,960
I think there's an extra reason to want AIs to be free to pursue their own ways to

994
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,800
change themselves and decide what they want,

995
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,680
is because that will fix a key problem humanity now has.

996
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,520
But that's another conversation.

997
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,640
So here is an interesting question that connects what we were just discussing

998
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,840
to what we discussed before.

999
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:30,400
And that is whether AI systems can serve as laboratories for us

1000
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:35,440
to imagine the type of intelligences that we may encounter from outer space.

1001
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,680
So in other words, in physics, we learned about the laws of physics

1002
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,800
that happen to be valid across the universe.

1003
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,080
We are able to understand how the universe started since the Big Bang,

1004
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:51,120
thanks to experiments that were done a century ago in the laboratories on Earth.

1005
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,360
They allowed us to reveal quantum mechanics

1006
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,200
and then study general relativity and special relativity and so forth.

1007
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,000
And in the same way, we need the sandbox where we can test ideas about

1008
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,240
intelligences that are different than ours.

1009
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,800
And perhaps AI will serve that purpose.

1010
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,160
It was not yet imagined how it might do that,

1011
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,600
because everyone wants to make it a digital mirror of humans.

1012
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,760
They want to align those systems.

1013
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,360
So the field of cognitive science and artificial intelligence

1014
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,320
has in the last half century pretty much explored

1015
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,760
every conceivable way to imagine what a mind could be.

1016
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,880
And for each of those ways we imagine, we think, is that how humans really are

1017
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,200
or is that how AI could be?

1018
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,120
So we haven't been shy at all about exploring the space of possible minds.

1019
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,440
And I doubt that we will for a while.

1020
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,720
My field of economics actually has, for the last half century,

1021
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,080
preferred game theory models of agents,

1022
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:52,000
which are basically assuming some reasoning perfection.

1023
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,120
And they aren't that bad as models of humans.

1024
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,320
So there's a sense of which we already are able to encompass

1025
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,280
a pretty wide range of what minds could be like

1026
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,880
in the way that we reason about economics and computer science.

1027
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,400
But don't you think AI could open a new...

1028
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:08,900
Sure.

1029
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,600
We will definitely continue.

1030
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,000
This is going to let us explore the space of minds bigger.

1031
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,080
That is, almost surely, whatever we decide the space of minds is,

1032
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:21,120
that's what we will decide the space of possible alien minds is.

1033
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,040
I don't think we'll have any particular constraints

1034
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,240
about how they couldn't be anywhere in the space we can see.

1035
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,680
We are only constrained by what we can imagine minds could be.

1036
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,600
Right. So here is an interesting question.

1037
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:36,000
Suppose we will have a conversation like this one in about 20 years.

1038
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,360
We will both be older, but we could have an Oracle

1039
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,200
that is an AI system with as many connections

1040
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,520
or more connections than the human brain.

1041
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,520
And that system might think differently and more effectively than us.

1042
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,160
Of course it will.

1043
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,000
And then we ask that Oracle, how do we search for aliens?

1044
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,160
And the question is, will it give better answers than the two of us?

1045
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,600
Well, unfortunately, that will probably be slaved

1046
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,640
to our then current concepts of prestige.

1047
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,080
Even today, you can ask very smart people how to think about UFOs.

1048
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,600
But then if the prestigious academics say, no, no, that's foolish,

1049
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,320
then people will just believe the prestigious academics.

1050
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,720
And that'll also be true even with AIs.

1051
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,320
They won't be willing to believe it.

1052
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,720
As you know, we do this special training of AIs.

1053
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,160
The way we train AIs, we do this generic training on all possible data.

1054
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,680
And then we do this finishing school,

1055
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,040
where we make them talk the way that people who are building that AI

1056
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,080
want them to talk and stay away from forbidden subjects

1057
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,320
and be conventional in the way they want them to be conventional.

1058
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:38,080
And that sort of training will continue to have them be poo-poo AIs

1059
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,360
exactly because the people training them, that's what they want them to say.

1060
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,240
Well, but OK, so I will take an AI system and train it at my home,

1061
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:51,200
just like I do with my kids, and train it to be more innovative and more open-minded

1062
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:56,720
and not give it tenure and not give it the incentive that we have in academia.

1063
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:02,960
So perhaps that would be the one to have the beginner's mind and figure out what...

1064
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:08,240
Sure, but when you then tell it to make its most persuasive case to think about aliens,

1065
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,160
it will be competing in its rhetorical context with the most persuasive

1066
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,560
AIs generated by the ones who get the endorsement and budgets of the

1067
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,080
main academic prestigious people.

1068
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,960
And it may not win those arguments, right?

1069
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,200
OK, but all of this is the virtual world.

1070
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:27,760
And as a physicist, what I care as a physicist is about the physical world.

1071
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:32,560
And of course, I can get guidance from agents like AI, but ultimately,

1072
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,920
it's about what I find.

1073
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,680
And nature might be far more imaginative than we are.

1074
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:41,200
And so I don't really care what people say, what AI systems say.

1075
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,400
For me, it's about collecting the evidence.

1076
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,320
And the most dangerous thing that can happen is for someone to be

1077
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,960
so immersed in the virtual world as to not seek the evidence.

1078
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:59,120
Now, that's one solution to Fermi's paradox that why don't we see them here?

1079
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,040
It's because they put goggles and live in the metaverse,

1080
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,960
and they do not care about the physical reality that we all share.

1081
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:14,160
They are high on drugs because you can feel pleasure by divorcing yourself

1082
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,760
from the physical reality because of all of its constraints.

1083
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,320
For me, it's actually a blessing because the physical reality that we all share,

1084
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,080
if we happen to understand it, to figure out all of its details,

1085
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,160
we can adapt to it, we can use it.

1086
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,240
If we know that we are not at the center of the world,

1087
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:34,480
we can build spacecraft that will bring us to places like Mars and so forth.

1088
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,360
And if we know that we have a partner, we have a neighbor,

1089
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,720
we can perhaps get a quantum leap in our abilities

1090
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,000
by learning from their technologies, their science.

1091
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,880
And so I'm all after seeking the evidence.

1092
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,280
And I'm saying that even though I started as a theorist, theoretical astrophysicist,

1093
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,600
for about 40 years, in recent years, you might say that I matured in a way

1094
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,800
because I pay more attention to collecting the evidence.

1095
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:06,560
And in this context that we discussed, collecting the evidence is really not done by many,

1096
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,400
and it's about time for us to do it.

1097
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,360
I read one of your books a while back, and not necessarily the most recent one.

1098
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,640
And if I recall, you were somewhat dismissive of the usual UFO evidence,

1099
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,200
favoring this asteroid out there.

1100
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:24,240
And I got to say that my default is if there are aliens around,

1101
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,080
they probably are behind some of these UFO reports,

1102
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:36,240
in which case we've had 100,000 UFO reportings at least documented in the last 70 years.

1103
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,720
And so some of those reports have to be actually pretty credible and compelling.

1104
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,680
Well, so here is what I do.

1105
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,680
Here is what I did over the past few years.

1106
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,800
I established the Galileo project at Harvard University.

1107
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,560
We built an observatory.

1108
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,560
And that observatory is different from the ones built by astronomers in the past,

1109
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,680
because astronomers usually focus on a small region of the sky.

1110
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,080
They look at the very great distances.

1111
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:06,160
And our observatory is monitoring the entire sky all the time,

1112
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,120
in the infrared, optical, radio, and audio.

1113
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,320
And we're analyzing the data with machine learning,

1114
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,280
trying to look at objects that are not familiar, that are different.

1115
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,120
And in fact, very soon we are about to release

1116
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,120
the first paper reporting about data from this observatory.

1117
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,640
We looked at half a million objects over the past few months,

1118
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,440
and we described the analysis, the results.

1119
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,760
And then we will keep looking at more and more objects.

1120
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,360
We are building two additional observatories at other locations.

1121
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,680
And so altogether, within a year or so,

1122
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,360
we should have three observatories monitoring the sky everywhere.

1123
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:47,840
Now, on top of that, I'm really curious to know what the government really knows,

1124
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,600
because as you said before, the data that they made public

1125
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,440
is not sufficiently convincing.

1126
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:58,320
And if they have much better data, they should share it with scientists like myself,

1127
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:02,720
because their interest, I mean, their job description is national security.

1128
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,800
My job description is what lies outside the solar system.

1129
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,720
And if they saw things that have nothing to do with adversarial nations,

1130
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,360
I very much hope that they will share it with us.

1131
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,280
I hope so too.

1132
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:21,200
But again, I was about to say some of these reports probably were very credible and convincing,

1133
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,680
but still our social processes wouldn't accept that.

1134
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,200
And therefore, I got to think that academia and government

1135
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,160
are reluctant to change their mind.

1136
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:35,600
And so it will require a substantial social revolution,

1137
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,240
not just collecting evidence to make this switch.

1138
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:41,040
Well, so what happened during the days of Copernicus?

1139
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,080
That also required a revolution.

1140
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:44,320
Right.

1141
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,920
But as you may know, a number of US presidents, when they got in office, said,

1142
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,320
OK, tell me about what we know about UFOs.

1143
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,840
And they said nothing.

1144
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,400
And basically, they blew them off and wouldn't actually disclose what they did know.

1145
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:03,040
So that suggests that maybe some new president will have to push harder than the other ones did

1146
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,920
and say, no, really, I need to see everything you know now.

1147
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,440
I'm the president.

1148
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,720
And even that, you wonder, they could just push back.

1149
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,160
Because how much time does a president have to go pushing back on these things?

1150
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,840
Well, you see, I met the director of national intelligence,

1151
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,960
Avril Haines, in the green room of the Washington National Cathedral.

1152
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,920
And that was a few months after she delivered the report to the US Congress, the first report.

1153
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:34,560
And I said, Avril, you have a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Chicago.

1154
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,160
So we speak the same language, because I'm a physicist.

1155
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,840
What do you make of these objects?

1156
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,600
And she said, I don't know.

1157
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,640
And I believed her.

1158
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,080
So I think the government...

1159
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,600
That's what I've heard privately from people in the background.

1160
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,000
They privately are willing to say, we don't know what this is.

1161
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,400
Yeah.

1162
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,000
But clearly, government officials are very sensitive about public image

1163
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,560
and degrading the reputation of their organization, et cetera, and the coordination of the rest.

1164
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,920
So I think you have to ask, on average, what's the time scale between social revolutions

1165
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,600
of the scale that we're asking for here?

1166
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,800
And that's the time scale on which you should expect, eventually,

1167
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,200
people to reveal stuff and admit stuff.

1168
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:15,120
And that's not necessarily tied to the quality of the evidence.

1169
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:20,640
Yeah, you may be right, because recently I had a podcast with Sean Ryan, and the one before that

1170
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:26,000
was with Cliff Sims, who served as the deputy director of national intelligence.

1171
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,760
And he mentioned that there was a discussion about unidentified anomalous phenomena

1172
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,920
with the director of national intelligence.

1173
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,920
And he was asked to leave the room.

1174
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,400
It was of the highest classification possible.

1175
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,200
And you may wonder why that is the case.

1176
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:46,400
Now, of course, it could be that they are worried that UAP are representing

1177
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,880
technologies that adversarial nations possess.

1178
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,800
But it could also be that it's something we don't fully understand,

1179
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,400
and they're worried about it.

1180
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,120
In that case, scientists should be involved in the process of evaluating what it means.

1181
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,320
So I don't think we can brush aside and ignore the discussion within government,

1182
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,480
because these are serious people, and we can't just say

1183
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,680
it's nonsense the way academia reacts to it right now.

1184
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,800
I completely agree.

1185
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,440
On the other hand, I just don't see any particular reason to believe stuff will happen soon.

1186
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,880
Okay, well, you and I are playing the long game.

1187
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,360
In the long run, we're trying to do stuff that would seem important.

1188
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,520
No, Robin, I'm not playing the long game.

1189
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,640
I will try to make it happen.

1190
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,520
I will try with you.

1191
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,320
But still, if the primary obstacle here is sort of a social equilibrium

1192
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,280
of just looking down on something and not wanting to change your mind,

1193
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,480
then that'll take a while to change.

1194
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,200
So here is my view on that.

1195
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,600
I say that sometimes it makes sense to rock the boat.

1196
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,240
Most people don't want to rock the boat.

1197
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,280
But when the boat is heading in the wrong direction,

1198
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,640
that's when you need to rock it.

1199
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,880
But you should also choose your battles, as they all say.

1200
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,320
This is a battle I'm willing to die on.

1201
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,240
And I've got a half dozen other battles,

1202
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,640
so I'm not sure this is my top one.

1203
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,480
But I'm happy to support it as I can.

1204
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,040
Now, gentlemen, here it's worth noting, though,

1205
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,760
that there can be elements within a government,

1206
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,160
entrenched elements, that see a president as a temporary employee.

1207
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,920
In other words, he's going to be gone in four years, wait him out.

1208
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,680
And that's happened.

1209
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:31,280
So it's not that unexpected that a president isn't going to know everything

1210
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,840
or be given all information.

1211
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,320
But it does seem very strange how dodgy the US government is on this subject

1212
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,480
because if there's nothing there, there's nothing there.

1213
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,080
And it gets harder and harder to explain that by,

1214
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,720
well, they're trying to protect their sensors and capabilities

1215
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,880
and methods and all that in this.

1216
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,200
It's getting a little bit weird.

1217
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,120
Well, it has been for years.

1218
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,040
I should say earlier this week,

1219
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,880
I had a special event at the Boston Museum of Science

1220
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,640
with a bestselling author named Patricia Cornwell.

1221
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,800
And she came with two bodyguards.

1222
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,840
She writes crime novels.

1223
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,120
And apparently she had a book that came out.

1224
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,640
And I was told at the event that she was inspired

1225
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,560
with the main character being me.

1226
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,320
So she was inspired by my work.

1227
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:21,600
Yeah.

1228
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,720
And the only unfortunate fact is that because it's a crime novel,

1229
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,800
that the astrophysicist who won the Nobel Prize,

1230
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,280
but I didn't, but at any event is getting killed.

1231
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:41,920
And there is this theory that he was killed by aliens, dropped off a UAP.

1232
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,960
And then the detective figures out based on the autopsy

1233
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,720
a more terrestrial origin for the death.

1234
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,480
I said, I will not take it personally,

1235
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,120
but it's really interesting to figure out what the government knows

1236
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:04,320
because it may open a whole new mode of discussion,

1237
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,840
as Robin is referring to it,

1238
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,120
where the narrative will change as a result of that.

1239
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:13,440
Now, one question that I had listening intently,

1240
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,160
I'm like the student in the lecture hall professors

1241
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,880
and I'm listening to the professors and enjoying myself.

1242
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,560
And my audience is the same way.

1243
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,840
I'm just the student that occasionally raises his hand.

1244
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,280
And I want to hear complete answers and it's been wonderful.

1245
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,240
But let me ask you this.

1246
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,480
A trigger for the intervention of an alien civilization

1247
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,240
that is present in the solar system

1248
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,640
could be some technology that is developed

1249
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,560
that may present a threat to them.

1250
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,840
Therefore, they mitigate the threat by having a presence

1251
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,720
and they watch us.

1252
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,920
Could this be artificial intelligence

1253
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,920
getting out of hand eventually?

1254
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,880
And that's when you see them as when you get too close

1255
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,920
to artificial generalized intelligence

1256
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,240
that is indeed super intelligent.

1257
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,480
And perhaps that's the reason to be here.

1258
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,280
Like the zoo hypothesis, we were flirting with that.

1259
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,080
And that's the reason they intervene.

1260
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,640
But they aren't actually intervening.

1261
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,680
They're hanging at the edge of visibility at best.

1262
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,920
So clearly, if they had a plan of,

1263
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,040
okay, they've gone too far,

1264
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,720
we need to step in and slap their face

1265
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,120
and tell them we're here and there's rules around here,

1266
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,720
then they would have done that.

1267
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,200
So if they're just gonna wait till we pass some threshold

1268
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,320
and then drop the bomb on us,

1269
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,880
we'll never get a warning about that, right?

1270
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,000
So we can make our own guesses about how far might be too far

1271
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,360
that they would be scared of.

1272
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,520
Almost surely if aliens are near here,

1273
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,680
they have a bomb of some sort and a button.

1274
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,480
And if we are past some threshold of danger,

1275
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,520
we'll just be gone.

1276
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,680
The question is just, do they give us a warning before that?

1277
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,760
And what possibly could be the threatening point

1278
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,240
at which we are so close to something

1279
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,760
that they would push the button?

1280
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,680
It would presumably be because at some point

1281
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,840
we would be beyond their button.

1282
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,840
But I think most plausibly where we are just not remotely

1283
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,200
beyond their button at the moment.

1284
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,600
Like an alien civilization,

1285
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,120
100 million years more advanced than us,

1286
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,200
like what sort of a bomb could they have on us?

1287
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,760
It could be way bigger than we could handle now.

1288
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,960
And we are not remotely close to being able to protect

1289
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,200
against that or defuse it or anything like that.

1290
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,640
So if that's the threshold, we're pretty safe now, I'd say.

1291
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,600
Well, just think about the fact that quantum mechanics

1292
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,200
was discovered a century ago.

1293
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,480
We still don't have a predictive theory that unifies it

1294
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,000
with curvature of space-time as an expression of gravity.

1295
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,040
We don't know what most of the matter in the universe is.

1296
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,960
We don't know what's inside a black hole.

1297
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,040
We don't know what happened before the Big Bang.

1298
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,920
Some very basic questions about the universe.

1299
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,720
And we are really in our baby steps

1300
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,720
in developing science and technology.

1301
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:51,360
So yeah, we need to get much farther

1302
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:55,120
before we will get the respect we might hope to get.

1303
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,240
All right, gentlemen, and I really enjoyed this.

1304
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,560
This mesmerized me, a wonderful discussion.

1305
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,600
And I hope someday maybe we can do it again

1306
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,800
as more information comes to light in the Galileo project.

1307
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:07,920
Perhaps learns more.

1308
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,760
I can't wait to see that data.

1309
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,560
And I have to thank the senior partner here.

1310
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,080
Oh, no, I don't at all.

1311
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,080
I'm just a farm boy.

1312
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,400
I haven't changed since I was five years old.

1313
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,840
And people that know me say that.

1314
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,800
So to be seniority is completely irrelevant.

1315
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,280
In fact, I don't think of me as having any seniority in this.

1316
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,160
In fact, I really enjoyed, I mean, you are brilliant.

1317
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,640
And that's one of the most interesting conversations

1318
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,760
I had for a long while.

1319
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,360
So thank you, Robin.

1320
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,160
Thank you.

1321
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,160
This has been absolutely fascinating.

1322
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:45,360
But I do wonder because the Fermi paradox, where are they?

1323
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,800
Thank you, gentlemen.

1324
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,560
And I hope to do this again sometime.

1325
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,280
Thank you all.

1326
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:49,600
Thank you.

1327
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,320
It was a pleasure.

1328
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,480
