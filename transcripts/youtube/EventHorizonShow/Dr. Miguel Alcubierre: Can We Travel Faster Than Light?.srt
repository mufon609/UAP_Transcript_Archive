1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Can we achieve faster than light travel? That's the big question, isn't it? It is important,

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,080
though. Throughout the history of sci-fi, it's been explored many times, but usually never backed

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,360
up as to how it could happen. That was usually glanced over. And faster than light travel is

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,480
something we want. Warping at many times the speed of light to explore our entire universe

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,240
is an alluring idea, especially if we want to someday meet intelligent alien life. It's

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,280
infectious, even. So how do we do that, speaking in terms of the real universe?

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,920
Unfortunately, there have never been very many ways to do it according to known physics.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,480
In fact, it's almost hostile to the idea. Breaking the speed of light within Einstein's

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,440
relativity, the best description of the universe at large that we have, would require infinite

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,200
energy. Infinite energy isn't possible. Or is there another way? Is there a way to essentially

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,840
hack the universe and move at speeds so fast that science fiction generally didn't imagine

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,960
until science itself actually did? My guest today explored just such a concept after watching an

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,440
episode of Star Trek and thinking about how a warp field could be established that would allow

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,240
faster than light travel. It's just an idea consistent with relativity, there's no guarantee

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,680
it would actually work. But it's one that so far has stood the test of time. People still wonder

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,440
about this idea over 20 years after its formulation. As I said, it's consistent with relativity,

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,480
but with caveats. Pretty big ones. But it's important to explore the idea nonetheless.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,000
After all, if we respond to all ideas as inherently impossible,

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,960
we'd have never gotten very far as a civilization. So can we actually travel faster than light?

20
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,240
This episode is theoretical physicist Dr. Miguel Alcubierre. Dr. Alcubierre received his PhD in

21
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,000
1994 through the study of numerical general relativity and has since worked at the Max

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany and the National Autonomous

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
University of Mexico. Dr. Alcubierre is best known for his 1994 paper, The Warp Drive,

24
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,240
Hyperfast Travel Within General Relativity, where he describes his theory for traveling

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,440
faster than light with what's become known as the Alcubierre Warp Drive.

29
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,280
Doctor, everybody knows you for your warp bubble concept, but you've done a lot of science. That

30
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,720
was 1994. You've done a lot of science since then. What is your work focus on these days?

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,160
Well, on these days I've been working on black hole formation and also on something a little

32
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,080
bit esoteric that we call boson stars, which is a model for a star made of a special kind of field

33
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,040
that could mimic a black hole in many circumstances. So I've been specializing

34
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,160
in that area and my work is mostly numerical simulations. So for a long time I've been doing

35
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,520
numerical simulations of black hole space stamps, formation of black holes, collapse of stars,

36
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,640
and also gravitational waves, production of gravitational waves. So that's my main work

37
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,200
and I've been working on that for the last 20 odd years.

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,960
We recently detected with the LIGO experiment the formation of or the coalescing of two neutron

39
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,120
stars and I suppose that would be even more applicable to black holes if you have a binary

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,560
black hole that's merging. Now, do you study that? I've studied binary black hole formation,

41
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,360
collision of binary black holes, not so much neutron stars. Neutron stars are difficult

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
for different reasons because they have a lot of matter and you have to do fluid dynamics and

43
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,160
maybe magnetic fields and things like that. Black holes are cleaner and I've been studying black

44
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,360
holes for a long time. So during the 90s and even early part of the 2000s my main work was black hole

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,760
simulations, simulations of black holes that collide in an inspiral, they're orbiting and

46
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,320
they do an inspiral collision. And that was actually the first thing detected by LIGO.

47
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,800
Three years ago they detected the first gravitational wave detection ever was a collision

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,600
of two black holes which is exactly the problem I have been working for a long time. Now when

49
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,560
black holes merge collide like that, how long does that process take before they become entangled

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,040
and gravitationally and they actually collide? Depends very much on how they formed but it could

51
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,080
take tens of millions of years. It's a very very long process. It's very slow. They approach each

52
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,720
other very slowly because they're emitting very low gravitational waves energy. They're losing

53
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,040
energy in gravitational waves but it's very very slow and those gravitational waves in principle

54
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,440
cannot be detected because they're extremely weak but this process takes millions and millions

55
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,200
of years but eventually they get to the point in which they're very very close and they're

56
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,040
separated just by a few times their own radius and at that point the whole process can take just

57
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,080
fractions of a second and that's what we detect. So the final, the detection of gravitational waves

58
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,280
from a black hole collision typically only detects the less than a second, the last fraction of a

59
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,720
second of a collision. That's what we can detect and the first detection actually the whole thing

60
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:04,400
lasted for about 20, 20 parts of a second so 120 of a second or something like that. It was really

61
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,440
very very close. Neutron stars actually take longer so when two neutron stars collide we can

62
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,560
detect the last minute or so of the collision and that's because they're usually closer by

63
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,640
so the signal is stronger and it's also more in the range of the detector so we can detect for

64
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,080
longer but black holes is a very very fast process what we can detect. So when you have two incredibly

65
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,360
dense objects like two black holes or two neutron stars for that matter, this has to be a ridiculously

66
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,640
abnormal environment. Do you see things like, so you create gravitational waves but what other

67
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,640
radiation comes out of that? Do you see like this perhaps a solution to something like fast radio

68
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,760
bursts where you you just see this mysterious burst of radiation that comes out of nowhere?

69
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,560
Could that be from these kinds of mergers? That's exactly what we think. Not from black holes. When

70
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,800
two black holes merge then nothing else happens. It's only gravitational waves because black holes

71
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,680
are vacuum. They have no matter. The matter has all been concentrated in the center and the center

72
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,800
is beyond the horizon so it cannot nothing that happens inside the black hole can affect us and

73
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,280
no radiation comes out from there. So when two black holes collide all you get is gravitational

74
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,160
waves but when two neutron stars collide that's very different because neutrons are made of matter

75
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
they're made of fluids and they have magnetic fields and etc so when two neutron stars collide

76
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,480
essentially you get fireworks you get a huge explosion and and this explosion produces

77
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,360
radiation in all wavelengths and in principle yes we believe that part of the gamma ray bursts

78
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,920
that have been detected for the last 20 or 30 years by satellites come from collisions of

79
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,720
neutron stars. There are actually two different types of gamma ray bursts what we call the long

80
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,440
lived and the short lived and we believe that the short lived are mainly caused by collisions of

81
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,560
neutron stars. The long lived we still not sure but the short lived are probably almost always

82
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,120
the collision of two neutron stars and this is extremely interesting because if we can get

83
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,040
the information from the collision of the neutron stars with gravitational waves and also we can

84
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,200
detect them also with gamma rays and other things then we can learn a lot about the system.

85
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,400
We can even do cosmology. So these types of systems are far more interesting. At the moment

86
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,640
there's only one confirmed detection of a collision of two neutron stars from LIGO

87
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,840
from gravitational waves that was just over a year ago a year and a half ago and there hasn't been

88
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,760
another announced but maybe they they've seen something in the last few weeks and they're a

89
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,640
bit cautious about announcing it there might be some hints about it but that those are the

90
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,920
extremely interesting systems collisions of stars give us a lot more information about the universe.

91
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,560
Now is that due to the fact that nothing can escape a black hole's event horizon so if you

92
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,800
have two black holes coalescing and and falling into each other and becoming a single black hole

93
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,520
you can't get anything except gravitational waves because nothing can escape the the black holes

94
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,120
so you can't get any kind of of radiation other than I guess some maybe some kind of

95
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,240
Hawking radiation off it so is that the case that that they're just simply that's exactly

96
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,840
the case when two black holes collide there's nothing else there's just two black holes

97
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,960
there's nothing can escape from inside the black hole so there's no light there's no radiation of

98
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,160
any kind the only thing you get are gravitational waves so in that sense it's a very clean system

99
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,080
but it's also you can only detect it on gravitational waves and and nothing else

100
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,080
even even the Hawking radiation Hawking radiation is a concept that it's theoretically very well

101
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,120
understood but we've never seen evidence of that because for a black hole the size of a star or

102
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,200
bigger which is the ones we've seen the Hawking radiation is is completely negligible it's just

103
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,960
being ignored completely there's no hope of detecting it so what you detect is just the

104
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,200
gravitational waves coming from the collision still that's very interesting that was the first

105
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,200
system we've seen we saw and we've seen about 10 maybe a lot more now because LIGO's already taken

106
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,840
data again but until the beginning of this year we've seen about 10 collisions of black holes with

107
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,440
LIGO when i when i say seen i actually mean observed with gravitational waves not with light

108
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,080
but so that happens sufficiently often that we see them a lot collisions of neutral stars are not that

109
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,160
easy to see because if they happen very far away you can't see them because the signal is very weak

110
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,320
they have to happen very close by so you might be able to detect them but black holes you can

111
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,640
detect very far away because they're usually bigger and that means that the that the signal

112
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,960
in gravitational waves is much stronger but that's all you get so you get the gravitational wave you

113
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,880
know it was two black holes you can you can measure the distance because of the gravitational

114
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,200
waves and you can get the mass of the black holes and maybe if we're lucky even how fast they were

115
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,640
rotating but it's very difficult to know exactly where they were so we cannot pinpoint the galaxy

116
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,120
in which the black holes collided because there's no light coming out of the system

117
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
and the gravitational wave doesn't allow you to locate this in the in space very well so

118
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,520
you can sort of say it came from that region in space but we don't know exactly where

119
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,800
whereas with neutron star is much more different because if you see the light

120
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,320
then you can pinpoint the galaxy exactly what would the hawking radiation of a black hole

121
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,880
look like would it be uh gamma rays well yeah hawking radiation is as i mentioned is a

122
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,400
theoretical idea that came from hawking in the 70s it still has not been confirmed observationally

123
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:24,000
or experimentally but basically hawking radiation is just what we call black body radiation now a

124
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,360
black body is not the same as a black hole a black body is just physicists terms of saying

125
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,000
something hot so we call it a black body because it absorbs everything that falls into it but and

126
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,840
then emits the light back as just heat so the sun even though it's not black it's yellow but it's

127
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,080
a very good approximation to a black body in in physics terms it's just something that emits

128
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,280
light because of it's hot it is hot and depending on how hot it is it emits light in different

129
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,840
wavelengths so if it's not very hot you can't see it if it's a little bit hotter you see it

130
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,120
red and hotter still than yellow and if it's very hot you see it blue now black holes emit

131
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,960
radiation just like this a black body radiation but the temperature of a black hole is inverse

132
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,560
to its mass that means that very large black holes are essentially very cold and emit very

133
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,520
little radiation and radiation you cannot see with normal light it would come in radio waves

134
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,800
so for a for a black hole the mass of a star the hawking radiation would come in the very very

135
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,760
far radio waves and would be so weak that we wouldn't be able to detect it at all if the

136
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,880
black hole was very small and when i mean very small about the size of a of an atom or something

137
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,200
like that i mean really small with the mass of a few atoms then it would emit radiation very very

138
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,560
hot and it would come out in gamma rays probably but we haven't seen that it's it's very difficult

139
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,400
to detect so so there's no proof yet observation or proof that hawking radiation exists it's just

140
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,960
a theoretical idea now to get into the concept of a star drive that you could use a black hole to

141
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:03,680
drive the smaller the black hole the more radiation it emits right yes that's correct so if you if you

142
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,560
saw i mean could there be like a technosignature there as they say within astrobiology a technosignature

143
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,800
would an artificial very small black hole low mass yeah would that be visible as something that

144
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,560
you could say that is an alien star drive driven by a micro black hole not really because the

145
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,760
process it would be very very it's very fast a very small black hole with the mid hawking radiation

146
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,560
so fast that it would evaporate very quickly and what you would see essentially is probably

147
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,560
something more like an explosion a burst of gamma rays so some people have actually speculated

148
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,040
the gamma ray bursts are actually black holes evaporating but the idea doesn't fit very well

149
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,400
but you would see some sort of burst of radiation and that's it it would die very quickly

150
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,200
because the black hole as it evaporates as it emits radiation it loses mass and the smaller

151
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,240
it is the faster this goes so very small black hole would evaporate very quickly in a matter

152
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,440
of seconds so you wouldn't see something that just emitting hawking radiation for a long time

153
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,160
you would see a burst of radiation and then it's dead right it would be something very quick

154
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,120
and and also depends on the size if you have a small black hole that's still a few grams in

155
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,080
weight that would still not emit enough hawking radiation for us to detect it it would have to be

156
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,680
something that weighs not much more than a few atoms and then you would see a lot of

157
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:28,560
radiation and it would happen very quickly so you would see it as a burst but so say you had a

158
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,760
kugelblitz essentially a tiny little black hole that you've artificially created with lasers

159
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,800
it would radiate in a certain way but very rapidly if i'm understanding it correctly so you would

160
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:47,360
see it evaporate almost instantly exactly yeah now you're also known for the alcubierre warp

161
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,560
field and i call it the warp field because you know a lot of people say star drive but it's really

162
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:01,040
the idea of warping space time at its most at its most basic what is the alcubierre warp field

163
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,800
well the idea is just the way in which you can deform space that would allow you to travel in

164
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,920
principle as fast as you want in space without actually moving so it's it's as you mentioned

165
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,640
it correctly it's not a star drive it's not a machine it has nothing to do with a spaceship

166
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,880
it's just a model of what you would need to do to space to be able to move very fast and the idea

167
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,920
is to use the fact that space can be deformed and according to the theory of relativity einstein's

168
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,600
general relativity gravity is just a deformation of space it's a deformation of the of the geometry

169
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,000
of space so space can be curved usually people here talk about the curvature of space or space

170
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,960
time but a curvature is a very generic name so you can do many things to space you can expand

171
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,400
it and you can contract it for example and we've all heard about the expansion of the universe

172
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,280
and that happens because space is expanding so people usually don't understand that correctly

173
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,440
because they think that if space the expansion of the universe they think is because galaxies

174
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,600
are flying apart because there was some huge explosion somewhere but it's not like that at

175
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,400
all and galaxies are not flying apart galaxies are just sitting there quietly in their own corner

176
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,800
of the universe but space between them is expanding it's been stretched so you can do that to space you

177
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,600
can stretch space and you can also contract space and then the idea i had back in 94 was that you

178
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,280
can do this in a very small scale so if you imagine that you do a very violent but very

179
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,560
localized expansion of space behind you that would push you away from things that are behind you

180
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,360
and if at the same time you do an opposite contraction of space in front of you that would

181
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,480
pull you towards things in front of you and the net effect of those two things combined is that

182
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,880
you would move you would move through space you would get away from the things behind you and

183
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,600
closer to the things in front of you but you will not be moving yourself you would be sitting in a

184
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,280
bubble of quiet space if you want with a violent expansion behind you and a violent contraction in

185
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,160
front of you and that would apparently you would move through space without moving at all so it

186
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,200
would space doing the moving and this is the idea i had as i called it the warp drive because it

187
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,320
gave me the a similar idea to what happens in science fiction but it's this idea of warping

188
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,920
space to be able to to move fast very fast and there's no limit to how fast space can expand

189
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,120
or contract so in principle you could use this sort of warp bubble to move faster than light

190
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,440
so that was the idea i had in 94 now there's a price to pay and there's nothing is free so the

191
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,800
the theory of relativity tells you that curvature or this geometry of space time can be the firm

192
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,880
deformed but it's deformed through them through the effect of gravity so you need large concentrations

193
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,360
of mass and energy to produce a deformation of space and there's some equations we call them

194
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,480
the Einstein field equations that tell you if you have this concentration of matter you will produce

195
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,240
this deformation of space and that's the normal way in which we go about it we we think okay we

196
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,600
have a star and the star has this concentration of mass and we go through the equations and figure

197
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,400
out what the deformation of space related to the star is and then that gives us the gravitational

198
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,280
field of the star but in this case i did it the other way around i said i want this very specific

199
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,200
deformation of space this warp bubble and you go through the equations backwards and it tells you

200
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,880
what sort of energy density at what sort of mass distribution you need it to be able to

201
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,320
produce this strange deformation of space and when you do that you find that it's something very

202
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,240
nasty because you need something with physicists called negative energy which maybe doesn't say

203
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,840
much to ordinary people but if people remember this famous equation e equals mc squared that

204
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,640
tells you energy and mass are the same thing then when we talk about negative energy we're really

205
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,440
talking about negative mass and negative mass as far as we understand does not exist in the

206
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,760
universe so that's a big problem with the warp drive you need negative energy and even if you

207
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,960
have negative energy you need huge amounts of negative energy because to deform the space is

208
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,600
very difficult to deform space it doesn't like to be deformed so in order to deform space a lot you

209
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,080
need huge concentrations of mass you need planets entire planets of energy to be able to deform space

210
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,920
even a little bit so you would need for the warp drive the equivalent of a jupiter sized object

211
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,720
but on pure energy and also the energy would have to be negative not positive so that's that's a big

212
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,840
problem with the warp drive but the idea was just just this basic idea that you can actually

213
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,080
deform space and it would allow you to travel faster than light if you deform it in the right

214
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:37,920
way the idea of the of the warp bubble and warp drive what inspired you to think about this was

215
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,880
science fiction as in star trek yeah i was actually watching an episode of star trek the

216
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,960
next generation i don't remember which episode it was but it was some episode of star trek the

217
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,520
next generation sometime in 92 i was doing my phd at the time in britain and watching this episode

218
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,240
they they keep always talking about the warp drive and the warp drive and and i was doing a

219
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,120
phd in the black holes at the time in black hole collisions precisely and i was using ancient

220
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,960
theory of relativity all the time so i started thinking how maybe if they talk about the warp

221
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,440
drive they mean that they're deforming space so how could you really deform space to to be able

222
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,240
to do something similar to what they do in science fiction and i started thinking about that and then

223
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,640
i had this idea of the expansion and contraction of space the expansion behind you the construction

224
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,520
in from in front this sort of bubble and then i went back to the office and i did some quick

225
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,960
calculations to see if the idea could be expressed mathematically in a simple way and i found that it

226
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,840
yes you could express it mathematically in a relatively simple way so i did it and then

227
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,120
eventually i published a paper about that i actually i was doing my my my phd at the time

228
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,160
so i was still a student i went to my supervisor to tell him about the idea and i had already

229
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:57,120
written something up and i was afraid he would tell me to just stop thinking idiotic ideas and

230
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,720
go back to work but he was actually very supportive he told me that it was a very nice idea and i and

231
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,000
he helped me publish it so it was actually my first scientific paper and on that note we have

of a warp bubble if you'd like to support event horizon you'll be pleased to know we've recently

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:48,080
share the video and now back to john and we're back with dr mcgill alcubierre doctor you were

238
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,080
inspired by star trek too which is something that that i think is important because science

239
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,520
fiction tends to inspire the imagination for anybody from scientists down to the common person

240
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:08,080
you were inspired into thinking about could you create a warp field now yeah tell us more about

241
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:17,200
this warp field where you could create a geometry i suppose of spacetime where you have one area of

242
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,240
spacetime in front of the ship and the ship is stationary within a piece of spacetime essentially

243
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:30,320
broken off from the rest of of spacetime so how does it work is it less dense in front of the ship

244
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,080
and more dense behind the ship how does this work well it's it's not so much density is is

245
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,000
it's a dynamic thing is space can contract and it can expand so in front of the ship you would

246
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,520
have a region in which space is contracting very violently and very quickly and behind it you would

247
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,000
have a region an opposite region in which is expanding very violently and very quickly

248
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,880
and it would do this in in a thin shell so the idea is that you would have a sort of relatively

249
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,080
large region of space in which space is quiet and nothing is happening to it and and you're sitting

250
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,520
inside this this region and then on the boundary of this region you have a very thin shell in which

251
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,120
there's either expansion behind you or contraction in front of you and this is a very violent effect

252
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,480
so you would it can move you very fast so that's the basic idea and this is when we think about a

253
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,200
field here we're talking about really what's really the gravitational field it's a gravitational

254
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,720
field is the geometry of spacetime that's how we understand it so it's the gravitational field the

255
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,240
one that's producing this now you can think about another kind of field or energy field or something

256
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,720
that's the one that producing this right so because if you want to deform space you need

257
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,480
some concentration of energy or mass so the easiest thing is to think that it's not so much

258
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,960
mass that you're carrying around with you or negative mass is some sort of energy field that

259
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,600
you're projecting and this energy field has a very large negative energy and this produces this

260
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,960
strange curvature a strange expansion and contraction of space in front and behind you

261
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,200
so that's the basic idea i never went very much or very far into the details i just wanted to

262
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,280
show that this was in principle possible that the equations of general relativity allowed for the

263
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,480
formation of space that looked like this and i also showed very quickly that you would need this

264
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,800
negative energy which is a big drawback because as far as we understand we don't have it in the

265
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:29,760
universe so that's that's basically how i how i left it and and then i never worked back on the

266
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,800
on that again so a lot of people have worked on that in the past 25 years but i never went back

267
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,280
i i only wrote the first paper and then i've been just looking about what people say about it

268
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:47,440
you introduced an idea and saw what happened exactly so because of mass energy equivalence

269
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,680
if if you see and you have evidence of negative energy which maybe there is a little bit of

270
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,120
evidence for that there's certainly nothing for negative mass but is there any evidence

271
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,480
that we could create such a material negative energy might be possible in small regions of space

272
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,960
and in very small quantities i'm not sure if that would be useful for the warp drive because

273
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,720
one thing is maybe it's possible but maybe you can't control it very well and maybe it's very

274
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,840
a very small quantity and you need huge amounts of it but still it's it's possible that negative

275
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,560
energy exists we have hints about it quantum theory tells us that in some circumstances

276
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,000
something that like negative energy happens for example a very classic example that comes from

277
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,120
about 50 years ago is something that comes from quantum mechanics quantum field theory

278
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,160
and it's actually called the casimir effect and the casimir effect the idea is you put two

279
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:48,160
parallel metallic plates very close to each other and the metallic plates conduct electricity and

280
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,880
that means that even if they're not charged they they produce some sort of boundary conditions for

281
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,640
the electric field and it's because they're conductive so inside between the plates then

282
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,840
you can only have a very definite number of of modes of the electric field those that fit in

283
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,840
there it's like a string if you have a string in a guitar can only oscillate in a given certain

284
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,000
ways because of the length of the string so this is the same idea that the separation of the plates

285
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,760
makes the the electric field in the middle allows it only to oscillate in very specific ways

286
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,400
and outside of those plates the electric field can oscillate any way it wants because there's no

287
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,320
nose restriction and we know that according to quantum theory the vacuum is not empty so that

288
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,640
means that the vacuum is actually full of fields popping in and out of existence all the time we

289
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,360
call that the vacuum energy or the vacuum the quantum vacuum or the vacuum energy and it since

290
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,760
outside you have have more freedom than inside the plates that mean that inside the plates you

291
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,760
have less vacuum energy than outside and if you define the vacuum energy outside as zero

292
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,120
then it means that inside the plates you have negative energy because it's less than zero

293
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,600
so that's an effect that we've been we've known for about 50 years it's a completely theoretical

294
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,680
idea it hasn't been measured not the energy there's a secondary effect that all these things would

295
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,560
imply that the plates feel a small amount of force and there will be a force that will try to put

296
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,040
them together to bring them together this is called the casimir force and i understand that

297
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,760
the casimir force has been measured it's very difficult experiment but apparently the casimir

298
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,040
force has been measured but the this negative energy inside has not been measured now if it

299
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,680
does exist and it probably does it would be a very small amount of negative energy so it's not

300
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,200
enough for a warp drive by far and and even then it's not clear how you can manipulate that so

301
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,640
it's very little and not very easy to manipulate so i'm not sure that would help but there's this

302
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,400
hints that maybe in some cases negative energy exists then we also know in a separate case in

303
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,600
which is not so much negative energy but there's something like anti-gravity going on around in

304
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,200
the universe and maybe anti-gravity could also be used for the warp drive it's not clear at the

305
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,320
at the moment but maybe we could and when i talk about anti-gravity we normally think of gravity

306
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,680
as a force that brings things together that planets attract each other and objects attract

307
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,160
each other because of gravity and that gravity would be a repulsive form of gravity that would

308
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:20,800
make things repel each other and this might exist because we've seen in the universe at large for

309
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:28,400
the last 20 just over 20 years we've realized that the the expansion of the universe is accelerating

310
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,520
instead of decelerating it's going faster and faster all the time and the only way in which

311
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,560
we can understand this is by postulating some sort of anti-gravity in the universe at large

312
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,720
we normally call it dark energy so if you hear about dark energy when people talk about the

313
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,560
universe is this mysterious form of energy an energy field that produces a little bit of

314
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,640
anti-gravity that causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate and this anti-gravity

315
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,520
might be useful for the warp drive i'm not sure i've tried to do some calculations in the past but

316
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:08,400
i've never been able to go very far but my hope is that yes maybe dark energy could be used to

317
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,840
do something similar to a warp drive at some point in the future but but still not clear at this point

318
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,000
so because of mass energy equivalence einstein's famous equation e equals mc squared if you can

319
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:30,000
find some sort of negative energy whether it's dark energy or or casimir effect or what have you

320
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,600
does that suggest that you could create and actually perhaps manufacture negative mass

321
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,880
at you know an object that has negative mass yeah it's a good point and one might think that

322
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,000
it's possible i don't think it's very likely because when we think about mass as such we're

323
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,480
actually thinking of on particles elementary particles we have no hints that there's any

324
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,280
elementary particle with negative mass in this case would when we think about negative energy

325
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,040
would be more like a an energy field and it's the energy would not so much be negative per se but

326
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,400
just less than the vacuum and the vacuum it would define the vacuum as zero then it would be negative

327
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:14,720
would be more like that like less than the vacuum and and it's difficult to see how you can translate

328
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,760
that into a particle and make a particle with negative mass so even though it might be suggested

329
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,040
by the formula equals mc squared i think in practice there's there's probably not not that

330
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,000
easy or not true at all that you could create a particle of negative mass but it's true that

331
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,800
nothing forbids it in the in the physical loss we know there's no nothing that forbids

332
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,040
to have a negative mass particle it's just it would do very strange things and we have never

333
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:47,920
seen something like that in other words the the universe does not ban the existence of something

334
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,560
with negative mass say you have a an apple made of negative mass that would be anti-gravity the

335
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,560
universe doesn't forbid it but that doesn't mean it can exist right yeah it's not so much the

336
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,920
universe doesn't forbid it is the loss of physics as we understand them today don't forbid it it

337
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,200
might be very well that the universe does forbid them but we just don't know how right so is the

338
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,320
loss we understand does not forbid it but there's no indication that that's something that can happen

339
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,400
right it's yeah it's not same so there's things that are not forbidden by the loss of nature but

340
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,840
don't happen for example the loss of nature are the loss of mechanics Newtonian mechanics

341
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:30,720
are reversible so in principle if it can break a glass in the floor the loss of mechanics would

342
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,400
allow the process to be reversed to all the pieces of glass to jump together and and coalesce into

343
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,440
a full-form glass and jump into my hand that's allowed by the loss of physics but it doesn't

344
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,640
happen right because it violates all the things like thermodynamics and things like that so it's

345
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,640
just statistically not not not likely to happen so it might be something like that that the loss

346
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,800
of physics do not forbid negative mass but maybe it's again statistically unlikely in the same

347
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:03,040
way as a glass reconstruction itself would be unlikely right so very very unlikely say let's

348
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,360
conjecture for a moment say that it could exist is there a way for the big bang to have produced

349
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,960
matter with negative mass if they do exist then they should have been produced in the big bang

350
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,480
the big bang there was so much energy around that essentially any particle that could exist was

351
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,480
created most of those particles don't live very long so that would be another question right you

352
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,360
have a negative mass particle how long does it live so most most elementary particles we know

353
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,200
about are actually unstable and they decay very quickly into other other types of particles and

354
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,080
in the end we're only left with a few stable particles which the ones we were taught about in

355
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,240
high school right the positive right the the proton the neutron and the electron and everything

356
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,600
is made of those three because those are the only three that are actually survived because they're

357
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,800
stable all the other zoo of particles that we know from particle physics are unstable but they're all

358
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,120
produced at the big bang because at the big bang there were so much energy available available that

359
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,640
everything was everything that could be produced was produced so yes if negative energy particles

360
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,800
can exist and in principle they could be have been produced in the big bang but the next question

361
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,560
would be how long do they live if they don't live very long we wouldn't see them around

362
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,640
and it would be interesting if there was some sort of stable negative energy particle but then

363
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,040
we would have seen it that that's what we would expect right if there's some sort of stable

364
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,840
particle then we should see it today because since it's stable it should be around it we should be

365
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,240
able to detect it right and we haven't been able to detect anything like that so if they do exist

366
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,760
they're probably not stable now that's somewhat of a mystery in and of itself within within physics

367
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:45,680
is if the big bang created antimatter then shouldn't we see what happened to all the

368
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,360
antimatter it should have been an almost equivalent amount to normal matter but yet we don't see it

369
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,560
leading to questions about is the is did did most of the universe annihilate you know as far as

370
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:04,880
matter goes early on in the universe exactly that's an excellent question it's one of the biggest

371
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,480
puzzles and mysteries of modern physics that we don't know the answer to and we're certainly

372
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,160
worried about that so yes in the big bang as far as we understand physics today an equal amount of

373
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,360
particles and antiparticles should have been produced and then then those particles should

374
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,000
have annihilated each other when they found each other when a particle and antiparticle meet they

375
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,200
annihilate each other and they produce pure energy so we should live in a universe of pure energy

376
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,280
because all the particles and antiparticles should have annihilated each other and should have been

377
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,760
exactly equal amounts of them because of the symmetry and of course that's not the case

378
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,120
fortunately we're around and there's matter around so for some reason there must have been at the

379
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,840
beginning a slightly larger amount of matter than antimatter maybe a very small fraction but a

380
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,400
little bit more matter than antimatter and when the annihilation occurred some matter was left

381
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,720
behind we don't really know why that's a big question people have been thinking about that

382
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,480
for 50 years at least if famous physicists and even soviet physicists like gamma one thinks that

383
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,000
we're thinking about why matter prevails over antimatter and people are still thinking about

384
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,720
that today but we don't have a clear answer yet but it is one of the big mysteries of modern

385
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,360
to ethical physics why there is there's matter and no antimatter around back to matter with

386
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,200
negative mass how would this stuff behave it would be by its nature anti-gravity so

387
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,360
if you were looking for it in nature would it immediately eject itself out of a galaxy or would

388
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:41,040
it concentrate at certain points in a galaxy where you have this this gravitational equilibrium

389
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,280
going or would it be out in the intergalactic space just it would produce a different type

390
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,200
of gravity so a large object made of negative mass would produce a gravitational field that

391
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,200
would be repulsive so if you were so instead of falling into a lot so imagine you have a star

392
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,680
like the sun but it's made of negative mass so instead of falling into it you would be repelled

393
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,200
by it you would fly away from it because it the field it produces is opposite so it would produce

394
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,400
produce a repulsive field now as far as small particles that that's not true because a small

395
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,200
particle it doesn't matter that's one of the things we know about gravity that the trajectory

396
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,760
of a small particle when it's moving in a gravitational field of a much larger object

397
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,800
the trajectory follows independent of its mass so it doesn't matter the mass is positive or

398
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,240
negative it would do the same thing so if we have the sun and the sun is normal a normal star of

399
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,520
positive matter and we had an earth made of negative mass it would still go around the sun

400
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,400
exactly the same way the earth goes around the sun because the mass is much smaller and doesn't

401
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,920
matter if it's negative or positive it would follow the gravitational field of the sun and

402
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,680
that's attractive so it's more like that it large amounts of negative mass would produce a repulsive

403
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,280
gravitational field but a negative mass particle would not be repelled by the sun it would still

404
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,520
be attracted by the sun because it doesn't matter which side the mass is so yes particles of negative

405
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,400
mass would not be expelled from the galaxy but if they clump together into a larger object that

406
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:17,120
object would be repulsive things would fly away from that object now with this concept of negative

407
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,920
matter i suppose you could call it this is also important with things like creating stable worm

408
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,960
holes and and yeah essentially any speculative way we could conquer the speed of light so to speak

409
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:36,480
now the universe doesn't ban it but we have no indication of it how could we detect such matter

410
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,040
which i guess would be the first step in trying to harness its power how could we detect this negative

411
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,400
mass material if it existed at a distance it would be difficult you would have to find some

412
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,240
sort of objects large very large object in space that instead of attracting nearby objects repels

413
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,240
them so but if there was a galaxy with negative mass then we would have seen it because we would

414
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,200
see that the trajectories of other galaxies close to it are repulsive instead of attractive so

415
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,600
maybe we should be able to see it in large clusters of galaxies and if there was a galaxy

416
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,200
there with negative mass if if the object is much smaller then it's very difficult to detect

417
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,760
if you have individual particles with negative mass then we should see those in particle

418
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,280
accelerators and then we should be able to measure it because essentially energy is conserved so in

419
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,000
an interaction with mass with particles with negative mass you would see that you gain more

420
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,240
energy than you put in because some of the energy became negative and you ended up with negative

421
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,800
energy particles so that you you should be able to measure that in the energy balance and in

422
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,360
particle collisions in an accelerator so that which we would have seen an accelerator and we

423
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,640
haven't seen it but as as far as much larger objects in the universe that those are difficult

424
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,960
to detect unless they're extremely large and have a big effect on the surroundings based on

425
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,840
but but i think it would be difficult to see but again there's no indication that they

426
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,080
they exist because if there was negative energy particles we would see those on a laboratory in

427
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,760
the on the accelerators and we haven't so no evidence whatsoever no unfortunately

428
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,160
now back to the warp field if you were in a spacecraft sitting static within within the

429
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,640
warp field and you were traveling across the universe at superluminal speeds what would that

430
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,400
be like what what i mean would you experience radiation i mean what would being inside the

431
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,280
warp bubble be like yeah there's some people that have thought about that and they've even done

432
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,440
some simulations as to how the stars would look like if you're sitting inside a warp bubble so

433
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,960
and essentially if you're going very fast even faster than the speed of light the first thing

434
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,080
you would notice that the the stars in front of you first you would see them in a very small cone

435
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,800
in front of you so you would see stars only in a very small circular region directly in front of

436
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,040
you everything outside that small cone you wouldn't see because the light wouldn't be able to reach you

437
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,040
because you're going faster than the light so you wouldn't be able to see anything behind you

438
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,960
because nothing would be able to catch up with you not even light so behind you it would be

439
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,520
totally black but also in front of you in a large region only on you would see only a small circle

440
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,560
of stars but again if you're going faster than light then any light that hits you from from in

441
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,760
front is going to be blue shifted so it's going it's going to increase in energy we call that

442
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,440
a blue shift it's similar to what happens with with an ambulance when it's coming towards you

443
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,920
you hear a very high pitch and it's moving away from you you hear in a very low pitch

444
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,440
so it's the same thing with light Doppler effect it's Doppler effect so you would see

445
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,280
the light coming towards you blue shifted so again it would be far more dangerous because

446
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,280
something that's normally just ordinary light will probably be hitting you like gamma rays and those

447
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,240
are very dangerous and so you would receive a lot of radiation from the front of the ship

448
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,880
and also anything else that is in in your path if there's a rock in your path or something like

449
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,200
that you would hit it at a huge speed and it would probably be deadly even a small grain of sand

450
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,680
right so yeah it would be extremely dangerous unless you had a very high efficiency shield

451
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,800
to shield you from the radiation coming from in front and also from any small speck of dust that

452
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,840
could hit you and destroy the ship so anything everything that hits you comes with higher energy

453
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,640
because it's shifted right so yeah that's essentially what you would see so whatever

454
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,960
light comes in front of you would be shifted even probably towards gamma rays depending how

455
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,240
fast you're moving it would be deadly and and you would need a big shield but and you would see

456
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,160
also this this deformation only a small region in front of you would be able to reach you

457
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,560
everything else won't be able to catch you and as I said I haven't done these calculations myself

458
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,400
but people have done them and they've done simulations over the years about how it would

459
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,880
look like from inside the the warp bubble and this is sort of the the things you find

460
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:52,160
so if you were traveling through space at rel you know at faster than light speeds we're not even

461
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,840
talking about relativistic speeds we're we're faster than that and you you caught up material

462
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,840
in front of your ship if you came out a warp in front of a planet you could do some serious

463
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,320
damage to that planet by that material right that's a very good observation and it's also

464
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,440
something people have actually done calculations on everything that's anything that's in your

465
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,480
path and doesn't directly hit you if it was moving forward say but not as fast as you you would you

466
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,600
would catch it but then it would be sort of stuck in the front of the bubble it wouldn't come inside

467
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,800
the bubble because it was moving towards the forward so you it wouldn't actually hit you

468
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,600
but it would be stuck in the front of the bubble so the front of the bubble forms like a barrier

469
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:40,160
that is sweeping particles and energy in front of you and and you would be accumulating a lot

470
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,160
of energy so any light for example that you catch because you're moving faster than light so if you

471
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,160
catch light that was moving forward but not as fast as you because you're moving faster than light

472
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,440
it would get stuck in the front of the bubble and then you you will catch a lot of light in that way

473
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,600
and when you stop all that light that you caught would suddenly just go forward to whatever's in

474
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,840
front of you so yes it would be extremely dangerous when anyone in front of you when you

475
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,120
well it would be extremely dangerous even if you don't stop it because that way you would hit them

476
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,040
right but but even if you stop then all the radiation would be released and it would burn

477
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:18,080
anything in front of you so yeah it's it's it's dangerous so and there comes the question of

478
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,720
how do you slow down once you accelerate and we'll get to that in a minute we have to go to break

479
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,720
but never point your warp drive directly towards your planet destination exactly

480
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,760
we'll be back in a moment with dr alcubierre the following program contains imagery from mark

481
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:43,040
raider maker designer of futuristic hardware and founder of holland space yards what tell him

482
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,600
thanks yes john i'm doing it now thanks mark thanks tell him thanks

483
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,400
and we are back with dr maguella cubierre now doctor it's a big problem with traveling

484
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:05,600
at these speeds is that you can also bring in time as a problem because such whatever you go faster

485
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,720
than light you always have to ask the question what does time travel have to do with this tell

486
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,920
us about that what what effect here do we have on time yeah well there's separate issues here so

487
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,440
separate issues here so one thing that people might might have heard is about the time dilation

488
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,920
when you're traveling very fast but still lower than light but close to the speed of light then

489
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,360
time it moves forward very slowly for you as compared to to things that are not moving right

490
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,440
so if you go far away from the earth very close to the speed of light and then come back

491
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:43,200
stay to a distant star a few years away and then come back then you might find that for you it was

492
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,520
only a few years and maybe on earth it was a hundred or a thousand years or even more

493
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,000
depends how fast you were going and how far you were going this is time dilation and it happens

494
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
also if you travel slower than light now in the model i did for the warp drive i on purpose put

495
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,880
out this effect so the warp bubble that i designed doesn't have any time dilation but that's by

496
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,360
construction and and since the construction is a little bit just like i wanted to make it and i

497
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,480
did it simple it doesn't mean that if you could do it in real life it would be like that but in

498
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,800
in the model i have there's no time dilation so you wouldn't have this effect but the other

499
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,720
effect that you also have when when when you travel faster than light it is worse you can show and

500
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,480
this is something that einstein showed very early from his special theory and relativity that if

501
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,520
you can travel faster than light in principle you can build a time machine because if you travel

502
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,680
faster than light then from the point of view of some observers you're actually traveling back in

503
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:44,240
time so if you do it there and backwards you could end up coming back before you actually left it's

504
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,800
not easy it's a special construction but you can do it in principle so and there's a proof

505
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,360
general proof that any method you come up with that can allows you to travel faster than light

506
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,560
can in principle be turned into a time machine that's true of the warp drive i didn't prove it

507
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,560
myself but i hinted at it in my paper and somebody proved it a few like about a year later somebody

508
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,680
actually proved it in detail so you could use a warp drive to build a time machine but you can do

509
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,280
the same with wormholes so people talk about wormholes to travel faster than light if you

510
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,320
can build a wormhole then in principle you can also turn it into a time machine so in a way you

511
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,760
could step into the wormhole today and come out of the wormhole yesterday which again is weird so

512
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,480
but it is true as far as we understand any any way you come up with to travel faster than light

513
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:36,320
allows you to in principle build a time machine now physicists as myself we don't like time machines

514
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,440
because time machines mean you cannot predict the future because anything you were going to predict

515
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,640
can be destroyed by somebody coming from the future and changing it right so

516
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,480
so in principle it means that physics would not be predictable we wouldn't be able to predict

517
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,120
what happens in the future if time travel is allowed and it brings with it a lot of a host

518
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:00,400
of paradoxes like the famous brand grandfather paradox and all those crazy logical paradoxes

519
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,440
so we don't like it we don't like time travel to the past and so stephen hawking in the in the

520
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:13,520
early 90s and late late 80s i think he came up with an idea that he calls in in very technical

521
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,920
terms the chronology protection conjecture but in layman terms it actually means the the no time

522
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,560
travel idea if you want so he argued that the laws of physics do not allow time travel to the

523
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:32,160
past and if you would were able to try to produce a time machine something would happen that would

524
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,640
prevent you from doing it maybe the time machine would blow up in your face or maybe a black hole

525
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,760
would form and and we came up with this idea it's not just a general argument in words he actually

526
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,280
came up with some mathematical calculations based on quantum theory and he showed essentially that

527
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,600
if you were able to produce a time machine travel to the past and a feedback a feedback loop would

528
00:47:53,600 --> 00:48:00,400
occur it's similar to what happens when they have a microphone and and a speaker close by right

529
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,080
so you hear the feedback because sound is going around and around and it's getting stronger and

530
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,000
stronger because of the amplifier and everybody has heard that when you when you're talking in

531
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,480
microphone you get too close to the speaker so it's the same idea but hawking argues that it

532
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,960
would happen in a time in a time machine energy would be trapped in a loop in time

533
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,040
and going round and round and round it would be amplified it would be focused and amplified with

534
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,240
each loop and eventually these would create such a huge concentration of energy that either the

535
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,560
machine would blow up or a black hole would be produced and that would happen essentially

536
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,800
instantaneously because it's a time machine so from your point of view would be instantaneous

537
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,040
you would switch on the the time machine and it would blow up or produce a black hole and you

538
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:45,200
would not be able to use it so that's essentially hawking's argument and it's been around for 25

539
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,840
years it's still just that conjecture because there's no formal proof that this happens it's

540
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,120
just an idea but it's a good idea based on very solid mathematical foundations but it's not a

541
00:48:55,120 --> 00:49:01,200
formal proof so that that for me is good right because it that means that it doesn't mean that

542
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,640
you cannot travel faster than light it means that if you want to turn your faster than light

543
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,040
spaceship into a time machine machine you wouldn't be able to do so and i think that's

544
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,920
good that means you would in principle might still be able to produce a warp drive and still

545
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,360
don't have a time machine and at the moment you would try to use it to build a time machine you

546
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,960
would die in an explosion or something so for physicists i think it's a good idea and and even

547
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,080
for the warp drive is probably good news it means that that one of the arguments against it that is

548
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:34,320
that is you could turn it into a time machine wouldn't be true right you wouldn't be able to

549
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,800
turn it into a time machine so that's that's essentially the situation there in short it

550
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,880
would be isolated in that since you've isolated a piece of space time and you're not moving within

551
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:51,600
it then you are not actually manipulating time well yeah exactly if you if you just go on a

552
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:57,760
one-way trip then that's true the thing comes around if you try to do a return trip and if

553
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,320
you do it in a very special way in print way in principle you should be able to do a time machine

554
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:07,360
but this honking's argument tells you that you wouldn't be able to so the laws of physics protect

555
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:13,200
us from time paradoxes in this case that's that's that's essentially hawking's conjecture the laws

556
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,920
of physics protects us from from time travel time travel to the past time travel to the future is

557
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,040
always possible sure just can't come back right we're always we're always constantly traveling

558
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:30,160
into the future we just can't go to the past exactly now how does this relate to einstein

559
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,880
and things like closed timelike curves because some people say that maybe backwards time travel

560
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,080
might be possible through that mechanism what it's exactly that it's exactly that that's that that's

561
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:48,000
so when when physicists talk about time travel we always mean in technical terms closed timelike

562
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,960
curves so time travel from the point of view of physics is the fact that you have have a trajectory

563
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,400
that you can follow that brings you back around in a circle and and a trajectory that you can

564
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,200
follow it's always a timelike trajectory because you can follow it in your own time so

565
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,920
it's a trajectory that a particle like us can follow it's called a timelike trajectory and

566
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,120
if you can bend on itself and go around back then it's called a closed timelike trajectory so any

567
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:20,320
time any type of time travel in physics today is always understood as a closed timelike loop

568
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,360
and what hawking is telling you that closed timelike loops cannot exist in nature because

569
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,880
something catastrophic would happen as soon as you can want to produce one but every every sort

570
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:36,480
of idea for time travel even geddle who had an idea of a strange universe in which time travel

571
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,240
could exist is called geddle's universe and it's from the 20s of the 20th century that also has

572
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,920
closed timelike loops so in principle you construct the geometries you can construct geometries with

573
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,440
these loops that allow time travel and and you can construct them easily mathematically it's not that

574
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,080
difficult to come up with examples but what hawking's tells us is that in practice you

575
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:02,560
wouldn't be able to do this because this sort of space dance would be unstable against quantum

576
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:09,120
perturbations that's that's essentially hawking's argument if you forget about quantum mechanics

577
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,680
and you just do a purely classical general relativity calculation in principle you can

578
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,960
always make them it's not even difficult to to come up with little models but in practice

579
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,560
is if you try quantum mechanics would intervene and it would be unstable

580
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,680
which is a big problem with everything you know when you start talking about stuff like this is

581
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,560
instability like a wormhole would you know yes there maybe there's a wormhole at the the

582
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,640
singularity of the black hole but it's going to open and close rapidly and you're not going to

583
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:43,120
be able to traverse it so and this and this is where the negative mass matter comes into play

584
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:47,680
because you would need that in order to stabilize the whole thing you know keep it stable yeah a

585
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,560
wormhole on its own it's unstable and that's that even has nothing to do with quantum mechanics

586
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:58,080
that just pure relativity and pure relativity a wormhole in empty in empty space or with positive

587
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,560
mass it's unstable and you want to stabilize it you need negative energy because the wormhole

588
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,680
wants to close it's it's the equation tells you that whenever you open a wormhole it wants to

589
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,880
close very quickly and you want to keep it open you need that repulsion repulsive field and that's

590
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,000
negative energy that keeps it open so that's the reason why you need negative energy in wormholes

591
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,760
but it turns out anytime you want to do something crazy with Einstein

592
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,040
equations of relativity if you anytime you want to produce some crazy geometry like a wormhole

593
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,720
or a warp drive or something like that apparently always you need negative energy it's some sort of

594
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,960
comes out always right anytime you want to circumvent the laws of the universe it says

595
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:46,000
you're going to need something special in order to do this and back to the warp drive if you

596
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:54,240
were able just to speculate to create the warp field and travel at many times the speed you know

597
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:01,120
relativistic speeds is there a speed limit could is there some barrier that says you can't go

598
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:06,160
faster than this with the warp field there's no there's no speed limit in principle it's just

599
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,000
to go faster you would need more and more negative energy and the more negative energy you have the

600
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,400
faster you in principle could go you could also use a warp drive to move slower than light it

601
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,800
would be a very inefficient way to do it but you could use a warp drive to move slower than light

602
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,880
but and faster than light is as far as you as fast as you want to go depending on how much

603
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,360
negative energy you have available so there's no limit but there is a problem that I haven't

604
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,760
actually mentioned yet this is the second problem with the warp drive we call it the horizon problem

605
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,840
and it has to do with when you when you use the warp drive to move faster than light

606
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:43,360
then in front of the this this bubble of deformed space at the at the front region there's a limit

607
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,640
further to which you cannot you cannot actually access anything in front of that directly from

608
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,000
from inside the bubble so if you're inside the bubble you can only reach so far in front of the

609
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,480
bubble but not all the way in front of the bubble so there's a horizon that forms there so there's

610
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,520
a region you cannot reach and this is a problem because if you're supposed to be putting the

611
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,160
negative energy in place from inside the bubble so you're in a spaceship and you have some sort of

612
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,880
energy field generator or something like star trek and you use this generator to put negative

613
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,440
energy at the front of the bubble to be able to move then there's a region you can't reach

614
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,760
and that means you cannot put enough negative energy there and you wouldn't be able to

615
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,320
produce a bubble in the first place so this is the horizon problem it doesn't if you want to

616
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,080
use the warp bubble to travel slower than light then there's no problem but you want to travel

617
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:39,280
faster than light then it's a big problem and that means that the spaceship itself would not

618
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,440
be able to produce the required field it would have to be produced from the outside and that

619
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,600
again it's it's a big problem right because somebody would have to be there producing the

620
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,800
negative energy as you as you go along as you pass it you could imagine maybe a sort of big

621
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,640
tube like a like a like a subway tube right a big tube through space with field generators

622
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:05,120
are switching on in time as the spaceship is going through but that's that seems like completely

623
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:09,600
crazy right to build a tube from here to office and torii so essentially you need to build a

624
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:16,400
highway before you could use the drive so you would have to build a highway before you send

625
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,080
anything through it yeah so how would you do that if you you would have to do it at sublight speeds

626
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,960
you'd have to have a spacecraft you know and you would have to leave some sort of negative mass

627
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:33,280
generators of some sort in front so to build a highway to to have it it's sort of like gas

628
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:40,960
stations actually where exactly yeah to send us a spaceship before slower than light that would

629
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,000
be leaving behind it negative energy generators along the way and they would this would give you

630
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,040
this sort of highway and once it's built something can go through it faster than light but it would

631
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,600
have to be built before and they would have that would have to be done slower than light yeah now

632
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:02,960
once you had this highway built and you could traverse well at sublight speeds obviously it's

633
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:10,160
very difficult to traverse the universe but the galaxy say you were able to build a highway over

634
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:18,400
millions of years and create this this sort of transit system what um with a warp bubble

635
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,720
could you detect that if say say an alien civilization millions of years ago created such

636
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,920
a thing and you were looking for alien technosignatures what what would that look like

637
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:36,560
this alcubierre warp drive highway system i mean could you detect it or would it just be

638
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:42,000
not visible i think you would i have never thought about this in in detail but i think

639
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,400
if it was moving directly towards you you should be able to see a burst of radiation when they're

640
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,200
using it but if it's not moving directly towards you then i don't think it would be detectable

641
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,320
i don't think you would be able to see anything but if it's if it's pointing directly at you then

642
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:01,840
yes you would see a burst of radiation especially when they slow down as we mentioned but yeah that

643
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,680
you should see but but i think it would be difficult because something very localized

644
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,080
and it's not really pointing at you then i don't think i don't see what you would see

645
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:16,560
so it's probably undetectable you mentioned slowing down once you get going how do you slow

646
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:22,400
back down with this concept that's exactly what i what i'm saying this is the same problem with

647
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,200
the horizon so you wouldn't be able to slow down on your own somebody would have to do it from the

648
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,400
outside so somebody would have to switch off the highway as you arrive at your destination you

649
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,200
shouldn't you wouldn't be able to switch it off from inside it's the same it's for the same reason

650
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,520
because you cannot reach the front of the bubble so you cannot tell it to switch off at the front

651
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:48,560
at least and and it's exactly the same problem so initially when i when when i did this paper i

652
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,240
mentioned this also in passing i mentioned that you shouldn't be able they wouldn't be able to

653
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,160
slow down once you turn it on but then i realized the problem was actually much worse you wouldn't

654
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:01,360
be able to turn it on in the first place right so that's because of this horizon problem but it's

655
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,560
basically the same problem if you're traveling faster than light you cannot reach the front of

656
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,400
the bubble which means you can't manipulate it and you can i you cannot not turn it on you cannot

657
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,800
turn it off you can't manipulate it at all somebody has to do it from the outside that was already

658
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,880
there waiting right so essentially you cannot ever reach the brake pedal basically yes

659
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,440
it's a good analogy but yeah it's essentially this is a brake pedal was so far away you wouldn't

660
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:31,040
be able to reach it yes you can't ever reach it physically now inside the warp bubble you would

661
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:37,520
also probably have problems uh people have said that you would you would be cooked by radiation

662
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,320
can you can you get into that yeah well that's what i was mentioning anything coming for towards

663
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:47,520
you from the front as as as you reach it with the warp double any radiation that was pointing

664
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:53,040
towards you would actually be blue shifted very and if you're moving much faster than light than

665
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:59,280
light it would be blue shifted a lot so even something that was ordinary uh radio waves that

666
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,120
was completely harmless if you're traveling sufficiently fast faster than light with the

667
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:07,840
warp bubble it could be blue shifted towards gamma rays and kill you right because the radiation

668
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:12,480
would be so intense so you would need a very good shield if you're planning to use this with

669
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,200
traveling faster than light but this is a problem maybe if you move slower than light if you build

670
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:23,280
a spaceship that could go say 99 of the speed of light then again that's a danger which is

671
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,480
radiation that's coming towards you ordinary light it's blue shifted and it's this blue shifted

672
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:34,240
towards gamma rays it would be deadly and and if you find a small rock and it's hitting you at 99

673
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,880
the speed of light then it could destroy the ship so this is a problem even at slower than light

674
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,680
speeds if they're sufficiently high right and 99 the speed of light is already a big problem

675
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,640
so it's not a problem that's just related to the warp drive it's a problem of moving at very high

676
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:56,480
speeds on a scale of one to ten with ten being the most unlikely where would you rate the

677
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,600
possibility of the warp bubble that we could actually at some point in the far future create

678
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:08,320
this how likely is it oh yeah so ten is the most unlikely yes so i would probably put it at a nine

679
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:15,680
at a nine yeah i think it's very unlikely if you ask me even though it's my own idea and i like it

680
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:21,680
for personal reasons i think at this moment it might seem even more likely to have wormholes

681
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:27,120
and those would have fewer problems still wormholes are not likely at all because we have no idea how

682
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,360
to build one but they have they have fewer problems if you could build a wormhole then you

683
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:36,000
wouldn't have this horizon problem you wouldn't have this radiation problem a lot of the problems

684
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,680
with the warp drive are simply not there in the case of wormhole but again nobody knows how to

685
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,640
make a hole in space so we have no idea at all how to create a wormhole but it seems less problematic

686
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,920
if you could actually have one but yeah i i think it's unfortunately for myself because it's my own

687
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:57,360
idea but i think it's highly unlikely at this point still an interesting idea and it's always

688
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:02,240
fruitful to entertain useful ideas because that's where maybe other useful ideas come

689
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:10,400
yeah i agree completely yeah and on that we are out of time dr akubir thank you for joining us

690
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,440
it's been a pleasure thank you thinking about far future technologies is a very uncertain thing

691
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:21,040
vexing at times given what i do imagining something is one thing and actually engineering it and

692
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:26,720
building it is entirely another but imagination is important that's what starts the ball rolling

693
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,360
and gets people thinking about the nuts and bolts of an idea and while the materials and technology

694
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:36,240
needed to create an akubir warp field lie in the future perhaps even the distant future for all we

695
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,760
know it is at least a seed for thought on the subject right now that's important and who knows

696
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,320
there may be other ways to defeat the speed of light there are always the possibilities of

697
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,760
wormholes or even ways we may not have thought of yet we do not yet have a complete understanding

698
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,480
of our universe only a partial one so the concepts that spawn out of science and sci-fi

699
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,440
in the coming years centuries or millennia may serve as seeds to push us further who

700
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:10,560
knows where we might end up john yes i think it's time to talk about getting rid of the car

701
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:17,920
but wait well i have an idea oh dear this isn't a good sign if

702
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:24,800
and i stress if if we can get akubir to drive the lebaron we can increase its value tenfold

703
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:32,720
oh no i can see where this is going wait stop where did you how did you how did you even use

704
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:38,560
a spray bottle we'll figure that out later and joining me next week will be dr duncan forgen

705
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:48,800
for a discussion of the fermi paradox and the solutions to it
