1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
On the night of July 19, 1952, something rather strange happened on two fronts in North America.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,480
At Mount Palomar Observatory in Southern California, a pair of photographic plates were taken about

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:20,840
one hour apart, one just before 9pm and the other just before 10pm local time.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,740
In these plates, one showed a cluster of three star-like points, essentially indistinguishable

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,480
from stars.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,680
But in the second plate, the points had abruptly and inexplicably disappeared.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,640
Known as transients, these short-lived events hold much promise in the study of astronomy,

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,480
in that they show events in much shorter timescales than astronomy normally looks at, a known

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,960
deficiency for many years.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,760
What these three star-like points represent is an open question, with potential answers

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,200
ranging from gravitational lensing to short-lived astronomical phenomenon we currently haven't

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,400
thought of.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,440
They do not appear to be plate flaws or contamination however, those leave telltale signs not present

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,440
in this transient, rather they do appear to have been there one hour and gone the next.

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,720
Interestingly, it was possible to constrain their distance, which turned out to be less

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,360
than two light-years away at maximum and within the orbit of the earth at minimum.

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,520
Curiously, on the other side of the country, the time the plates were taken would have

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,560
been between 1 and 2 am on the east coast.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,000
At the time, one of the most puzzling UFO flaps in history was happening in the Washington

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,360
D.C. area, including multiple radar returns and visual sightings from people in several

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,600
locations.

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,960
Coincidence perhaps, but all options must be on the table when trying to figure out

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,080
what that telescope at Mount Palomar imaged that July night in 1952.

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:02:05,320
You have fallen into Event Horizon with John Michael Gaudier.

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,400
In today's episode, John is joined by Dr. Beatrice Villereal.

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,800
Dr. Villereal studies astrophysics and astroparticle physics as a Nordic Fellow at Nordica, the

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,680
Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics.

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,240
She has served as the lead on multiple papers, using existing survey data to find examples

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,360
of exceptional astrophysical transients, including looking for physically impossible effects

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,600
caused by highly advanced technology.

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,480
Beatrice Villereal, welcome back to the program.

32
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Thank you.

33
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
It's a pleasure to be back.

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,040
Now, in our long-running series on transients, you now have a new paper on a newfound transient

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,840
in a photographic plate taken in 1952 at Palomar with, I assume, the Hill Telescope,

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,840
which at the time that was the most largest and advanced telescope we'd ever built.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,240
It was state-of-the-art.

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,480
And yet there's this transient there where in one plate you see essentially three objects

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,320
that look like stars, and then a plate an hour later, nothing, they're gone.

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,840
Tell us about this new paper regarding this particular transient.

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,920
This is a new paper that is actually led by my colleague Enrique Solano at the Center

42
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,880
of Astrobiology in Madrid.

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,880
And he has discovered this image where you see three very bright and beautiful stars,

44
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,900
and they are there in that unique plate, but you cannot see them ever again, not even one

45
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,760
hour later.

46
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,560
And these three stars we wanted to find with the largest optical telescope because we thought

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,020
maybe they just like got much fainter.

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,360
So we used the Gran Telescopo Canarias, which is a 10.4 meter optical telescope.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,320
And we looked there, we went very deep and we found nothing.

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,440
So they really vanished and they look real.

51
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,320
And it seems to be like another case of the so-called multiple transients that we've been

52
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
seeing before.

53
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,900
Now you've written previous papers on this where there are other transients.

54
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,900
What makes this one, and I actually know the answer to this question, but what makes this

55
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,880
one especially compelling?

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,240
It's so bright, so beautiful, so star-like.

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,000
Because with the previous ones, like when the first case we found, they were very faint.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,660
We were wondering, okay, maybe it's some kind of plate flaws, some kind of plate flaws that

59
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,120
have some very unusual coincidentally star-like shapes.

60
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,200
But again, they were quite faint and close to the detection limit.

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,560
And now you see three super beautiful stars that are there and later vanish.

62
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,520
And that is the kind of thing that we reacted on.

63
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,960
So what magnitude are we talking about as far as brightness goes?

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,280
I think like 15 mag, more or less.

65
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,800
Which for that telescope, that's solid.

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,480
I think that, I mean, what could a telescope like that...

67
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,520
15-16 mag to be more exact.

68
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah.

69
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,640
But it's solid.

70
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,760
And they all appear to be the same brightness?

71
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
More or less, yes.

72
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,280
It's a little bit difficult to get the exact magnitudes of the two ones that are in the

73
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,720
crowded region because they are like overlapping.

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,080
But they seem to have more or less the same brightness, all three of them.

75
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Maybe the one in the back is slightly fainter also, but yes.

76
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,840
What strikes me about this is that that does not look like a plate flaw.

77
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,920
That looks like stellar objects.

78
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:26,240
And that should be there set in stone, so to speak, but that's not what this is, right?

79
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Exactly.

80
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,040
Because when you have something very faint, you can always try to say that it's a plate

81
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
flaw.

82
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,640
And then suddenly you have these three like super clear stars and they don't look like

83
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
plate flaws.

84
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,560
But of course, we will always find someone who is going to say, but it probably is a

85
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
plate flaw.

86
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,080
And I think that is why we need to confirm this phenomenon with entirely different methods

87
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,720
that have nothing to do with photographic plates.

88
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
But yeah, they look very authentic.

89
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,400
Now in your work, you look at photographic plates and I'm sure you see plate flaws and

90
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,800
the characteristics of them.

91
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,040
So what does a plate flaw actually look like usually?

92
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,720
No, but plate flaws usually looks like random shapes.

93
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,960
So in order to get to look like stars, you would need to have a very specific, it would

94
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,360
have to, a lot of different factors would have to align up if we say like that to make

95
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,520
it look like a real star.

96
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,760
So I think it's a very, very improbable event.

97
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,640
And now to find several of them that look like stars is even more improbable.

98
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,120
So that's the thing.

99
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,840
And I would also expect that if you have, let's say 10 very bright plate flaws in one

100
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,480
plate, you would see some things that are a mix of different forms, but not that it

101
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,040
would only look exactly like the stars in the field.

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,040
So I don't know if this rant made it clear.

103
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
It did.

104
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,440
Now what about exposure time?

105
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,280
In other words, how long was the shutter open on the plate that shows the transient?

106
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,840
How long was the shutter open to, you know, sort of eliminate any movement that might

107
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
be there?

108
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Because they appear to be point-like.

109
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
50 minutes.

110
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Yeah.

111
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,680
50 minutes exposure time.

112
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,280
So if something would be moving in and out of the image, it should be, I mean, it should

113
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,400
be leaving an elongated streak.

114
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,420
It's not going to be, I mean, let's say it moves fast.

115
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,400
If it moves fast during this 15 minutes, so fast that it can go out of the plate and move

116
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,200
somewhere else, you are going to have a streak, not a point source.

117
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,960
Now if it moves very, very slowly, then so slowly that it leaves a point source in the

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,560
red image, you would also see a point source in the blue image that is taken one hour

119
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
later.

120
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
But you don't see that.

121
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,440
What you see is really a point source, only one image and nothing in the other.

122
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,480
So how does that happen?

123
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
That is the question.

124
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Yeah.

125
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
You have to wonder that.

126
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
I mean, stars don't just disappear.

127
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
You know, they don't blink out.

128
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,760
Well, at least we, as far as we know, hopefully, hopefully, well, you know, what about things

129
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,280
like a really, really weird event, like a gravitational lensing effect?

130
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,840
In other words, a naked black hole passes by lenses, some normally very dim stars that

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,120
are out at the reach of the telescope and you see them very briefly.

132
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,840
What about natural, weird things like that with especially gravitational lensing?

133
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,560
So we've been thinking about it for this particular case because imagine if you have this gravitational

134
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,960
lens that is very, very massive and suddenly behind this lens, you would have a short transient,

135
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,720
something that flared up just for a few minutes.

136
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,920
Maybe what you would see as an observer would actually be that you would see this transient

137
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,760
through the gravitational lens and it would give multiple images.

138
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,120
This is one of the thoughts we were having.

139
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,760
My colleagues estimated like a possible, what would be the possible mass of the lens?

140
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,960
And they concluded something like 10 times the Milky Way mass, sorry, 10 times the mass

141
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,040
of the Milky Way black hole.

142
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,360
And I'm not sure, we are not gravitational lensing experts and I don't know if this is

143
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
a reasonable or not reasonable scenario.

144
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,320
It has to be said though, looking at the image, it does look like an Einstein cross, you would

145
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,160
expect, but at the same time, when you see those, it's usually the entire mass of a galaxy

146
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,800
bending that light and making that effect when you see it with like a quasar or something

147
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,080
like that.

148
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,160
And it would seem to me that, you know, that's an implausibly huge black hole to be not at

149
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,560
the center of a galaxy.

150
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,560
But it's, you know, you have to look at all angles and, you know, see what might be there.

151
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,240
Now, what about other options with this?

152
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,600
What other ideas have you guys come up with that might explain this?

153
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,400
Well, I still think that there is an option of that we are seeing something either some

154
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,720
reflecting the sunlight or that you see something with its own intrinsic light that is fairly

155
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,360
close to Earth, why you see it like happening at the same time, because, you know, the speed

156
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,080
of light is limited, so it's not going to come from a galaxy far away, but it's likely

157
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,800
to come from inside the solar system.

158
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,480
Though you got to wonder, though, if it were like an asteroid or something like that that

159
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,720
had varying albedo and you just happened to catch it, but how did it happen that it had

160
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
three lobes?

161
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
It just seems...

162
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
No asteroids.

163
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,600
Well, I'm thinking more about maybe something artificial, possibly, as a possible hypothesis.

164
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,680
Something with either, again, its own intrinsic lights or lamps or something, or maybe something

165
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,560
reflecting the sunlight and let's say something very flat, very like glass or metal or so.

166
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,040
There is an elephant in the room.

167
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,520
This plate is from July 19th, 1952, which is the evening that a massive, massive UFO

168
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,920
flap happened over Washington, D.C. that was caught by multiple radars.

169
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,400
It's quite a fun coincidence, right?

170
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,200
It's quite the coincidence, and it has to be said that that did happen.

171
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,960
And maybe I would dare say, though, if that's what this is, a photographic plate from the

172
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory would constitute probably the best UFO photograph

173
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,400
ever taken, right?

174
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,400
There's something even more fun about this.

175
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,800
When I discovered, or actually I didn't discover it, when my friend Dave Altman pointed out

176
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,200
this date, because it was he who recognized the date when I mentioned 19th of July, 1952.

177
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,600
After he had pointed it out, I was wondering, hey, what about the dates of my other candidates?

178
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,360
And I went to this paper where we had been looking for alignments.

179
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,560
It's a paper called, like, Is There a Background Population of High Albedo Objects?

180
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,320
I don't remember the exact title, but last year we put it on archive and it's a paper

181
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,080
that has issues getting published, because it's a little bit too transparent, I would

182
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,200
say, about the alien angle.

183
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,040
We had five candidates where there were two that were statistically significant and one

184
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,960
that was the best of all.

185
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,240
And in the one that was best of all, you could see five objects in a line.

186
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,520
And it was called Candidate 5.

187
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:16,320
And if you look at that one, that is from the 28th of July, 1952, which is also inside

188
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,400
this time region of the Washington flap.

189
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
It's one day after the second weekend, I think.

190
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,520
I think the second weekend was 26th to 27th of July, and this one happened on the 28th,

191
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,160
and I found it super funny.

192
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,840
I like that kind of funny coincidences.

193
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,920
We have to remember, too, that this is before satellites.

194
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,060
So this is before Sputnik.

195
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,400
So we had nothing up there.

196
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,680
And I mean, at that time, 1952, we were still experimenting with captured V2 rockets and

197
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,640
things like that and developing for the rockets.

198
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,480
And we just didn't have the technology to put something out there that would explain

199
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,920
this as human interference, so to speak, right?

200
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,160
But what if there were some secret military experiments that resulted in the Washington

201
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,040
flyover, but also resulted in that they created some kind of very radioactive particles that

202
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,400
were just captured on the plates that those nights?

203
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,320
Oh, that's interesting.

204
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,640
So there might have been a secret nuclear test that might have done it that we could

205
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,200
do, because remember, obviously, World War II and Trinity testing, and that maybe there

206
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,640
was something thrown into the atmosphere that was...

207
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,200
But couldn't you look at other photographic surveys and look for the same thing, you know,

208
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
reoccurring?

209
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,000
Maybe we could actually look for those for the photographic surveys that are from July

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:44,080
1952 and see if we can find more signs of, let's call them UFOs, or any kind of UAPs

211
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,520
or it's a possibility.

212
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,280
Unidentified astronomical object, I'm coining a phrase, and yeah.

213
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,960
It's an interesting coincidence, and of course, it has made me wonder even more.

214
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,760
Now, what other photographic surveys from this time period are there?

215
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,200
I'm sure the Vatican was doing it with the astrograph that they had.

216
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,800
So what other sources of data can you look at?

217
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,880
Maybe the Lick Observatory could be a good, well, it could work.

218
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,360
Unfortunately, the Harvard place don't seem too accessible.

219
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,920
They are photographic plate surveys, I think, from Ukraine, but I don't know if they have

220
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,960
the 1952 year.

221
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,520
Now, what's the future?

222
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,280
In other words, we've got really ideal-seeming survey telescopes coming online soon, probably

223
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,560
the biggest being the Vera Rubin Observatory.

224
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,960
Are you thinking in terms of searching modern data sets like that when we get it?

225
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,480
Actually, we are going to try to go a little bit ahead and create our own project called

226
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,440
Exoprobe, where we are going to place multiple telescopes.

227
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,680
They are all going to be filtering away human space debris and human satellites, and we

228
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,280
are going to search for these kind of multiple transients, but also search deliberately for

229
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,560
signatures of ET probes or unidentified objects that are leaving short transients.

230
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,480
We are going to really focus on transients in these searches, and the goal will be like

231
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,600
if you use multiple telescopes, then if you see some very short flash in several of them,

232
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:28,560
you directly know that it is a real observation and not something just in one image.

233
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,840
Independent telescope corroboration of a transient would be amazing.

234
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,440
That's exactly what we want to achieve, and then at the same time, if you use at least

235
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:44,640
two telescopes, you can triangulate and you will directly say it's at this and that distance,

236
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,120
and now if you use ten telescopes, you will get a very accurate distance because you can

237
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:58,680
get the 3D location much more accurately if you have many more combinations of triangulating.

238
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,600
Within the question of technosignatures, there is a known bias, and Dr. Sankirk Patrick recently

239
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,200
stated it as the orbit of Mars. A technosignature outside of that can be talked about like a von

240
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,760
Neumann probe or something like that at Jupiter, but when you start talking about anything getting

241
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,800
close to Earth, the biases come in even though it's virtually identical. There's no difference

242
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,240
between a von Neumann probe in orbit of Saturn or one in Earth's atmosphere. What's your view

243
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,080
on the stigma and how can we sort of try to get past it? Well, actually, I find it pretty fascinating

244
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:38,960
that there is such a stigma to search near the Earth because technically, why wouldn't a probe

245
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,680
that can make it into the solar system make it also inside the atmosphere? There's no difference.

246
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,520
There's no difference. So this is just like some kind of social barrier or so, and I think the

247
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,520
only way how we can get past that is by doing these searches and show that, okay, we know there's a

248
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,080
social barrier and we know that it's going to be difficult to publish the papers, but we'll still

249
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,760
look and even if we don't publish them right now, we will probably get them published in a few years

250
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:10,640
when the stigma is off and people will be kind of much more open-minded. Simply go on and do

251
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,040
your best. That's all one can do. The other thing is that you have to ask another question

252
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,320
when analyzing this sort of thing is that, again, we've talked about von Neumann probes and we've

253
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,520
talked about Benford probes and Bracewell probes and all this sort of stuff that could be in the

254
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,960
solar system, you know, artifacts on the moon or whatever, but we ignore the fact that we might

255
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,000
be living on the most interesting planet in the star system. Yeah, why wouldn't they send it right

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,200
to the earth? And I think this is the best place to send any probe to. So if I would be aliens and

257
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,440
they would know that there's an advanced civilization here, I would send all the probes here and I

258
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,800
wouldn't send it somewhere else. The universe is full of gas giants and Venuses and Marses

259
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,760
and things like that, but not so much with civilizations as far as we can tell and study

260
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,520
and that it seems to me that bias, the Mars orbit bias, is just really unhelpful because

261
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,920
the Earth's atmosphere is where you would expect to find a technosignature if there is indeed an

262
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,040
alien civilization here studying us. Exactly, and this is where you could imagine that you would

263
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:29,840
see things like artifacts and remains on the planet, maybe in geological records even or so.

264
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,120
So I think it's a completely valid way of starting SETI searches here and simply assume that if we

265
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,400
can send something to a different stellar system also can another civilization send something to

266
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,280
us and to the Earth. So I'm totally in favor of this this type of SETI. I also am attracted

267
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,960
to the idea of searching the surface of the moon for any evidence of a past visitation just because

268
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,280
the moon, unlike the Earth, the moon does not recycle its surface constantly and I think that

269
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,320
that's kind of a wide open area for technosignature searches is to start looking at lunar maps and

270
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,840
things like that that might reveal something that was once there. I think that's a really

271
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:20,320
beautiful idea and I think there are even some searches like AI-driven searches for artifacts

272
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,400
on the moon led by ETH researchers in Switzerland. By the way, I apologize in case you hear weird

273
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,360
sounds from my end, it's my cats coming here and licking my plates that had some ham on. So

274
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,680
sorry for the weird sounds from my end. Oh it's quite okay, we like the cats. I like cats and

275
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,400
one of the reasons why I have a separate Event Horizon studio from my house is that

276
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,840
my cats will try to talk into the microphone. This one might try to, it's a non-human intelligence

277
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:58,400
that is trying to find her way of maximizing her resources. So yes, a von Neumann cat. Exactly.

278
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,560
So yeah well I completely agree with you on your entire assessment both about the moon and about

279
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,400
the earth and I hope there will be more setting in that direction because we have been doing

280
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,560
60 years of radio searches over and over again always pushing the limit but if you do something

281
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,160
over and over and over again and you don't get any results it's maybe time to open new doors

282
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,880
because new doors will always lead to something unexpected even if it's not what you were looking

283
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,440
for. Well if you're going to look in radio then it only makes sense and this has been

284
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,000
something that's been changing recently is if you're going to look in radio look everywhere

285
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,040
look at every possible technosignature you can think of and see if it might be there or it might

286
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,040
not be and that's one thing that that I think there's not enough work done on is is sort of

287
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:58,400
the candidates like Jabelsky star or HD 139 139 where we don't exactly know what it is but as

288
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,000
soon as it looks weird and potentially alien all work on it stops and I think that now is the time

289
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,800
to change that and take a fresh look at these weird potential technosignatures. I agree I think

290
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,680
there's an experience that a lot of astronomers have at some point which is like the driving force

291
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:24,080
let's say you're young and you work on you discover some anomaly and you get super excited like this

292
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,000
coolest thing ever this anomaly and you invest months into exploring it and then in the end you

293
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,280
discover that this was something super mundane and then maybe again some time passes and the

294
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,240
same thing happens and I think what happens is that lots of astronomers develop some kind of

295
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,160
over time some type of experience of that when it's an anomaly 95 percent of the time it's something

296
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,600
mundane and since they want to publish and make good careers and do zero science in quotation

297
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,720
mark it means that anomalies very often get overlooked because people assume that yeah it's

298
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,400
going to be 90% probability of that this is something boring and uninteresting or instrumental

299
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,080
and 10% probability that this is something real I better take a more safe road and I go for more

300
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,400
safe science and in that way a lot of anomalies like remain unsolved while I think the most fun

301
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,200
thing is actually to explore anomalies if we don't do that and stay on the safe side sure we can

302
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:30,000
learn a lot but it's not going to be as intriguing and as adventurous as the more risky road

303
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,040
it's a high payoff though because if you discover an alien civilization you've just made

304
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:41,040
probably the biggest scientific discovery in the history of humanity that we are not alone

305
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,320
but what if there is something even crazier than an alien civilization something even crazier to

306
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,000
be discovered that you cannot really imagine right now but you you would discover it and

307
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,920
it would make the alien civilization look like a mundane explanation none of the above

308
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,640
in other words yeah that it's it's something but it's not an alien but it isn't it isn't it isn't

309
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,640
from here well that requires paradigm changes but paradigm changes are common in human history

310
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,920
and for example someone in the medieval world had no idea quantum mechanics existed and maybe

311
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:26,320
this works like that that we just have no conception of of what might be there and it might be weirder

312
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,640
than aliens in the end yeah and I think like there is some kind of idea that I see in a lot of my

313
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,640
fellow colleagues and that is something like that we have already discovered all the important

314
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,760
physics there is nothing big and new to be discovered which I find super weird the first

315
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,960
question that hits my mind is okay so if you don't think that's anything new can be discovered

316
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,640
and what's the point of doing all this research well of course they will reply that they want

317
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,040
to understand the natural processes and into a finer detail and so on but I find it so hard to

318
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,480
for me it's a point of view that is very different from my own because if you look at

319
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,720
like physics most has been done in the last 200 years and what is 200 years in the history of

320
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,800
humanity it's a short time period and now imagine you have some civilization that has been there

321
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,840
for one million years I think they will they will know so much more about physics than we ever

322
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,240
or that we will do at this point that there is I think there's an immense world of discoveries

323
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:36,480
ahead of us ahead of the humans and it would be so cool to be part of that and see some of it

324
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:43,680
the thing is though is that the universe throws curveballs and we see hints right now of a fifth

325
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,720
force you know and things like that and maybe you know another planet in the solar system

326
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,080
planet nine we see all these indicators and things that change our paradigm and we need to be prepared

327
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,760
for that but in defense of science most scientists I've known actually really get intrigued when

328
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,200
there are discrepancies hints of new physics and things like that so at least there still is an

329
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,960
open debate it's not a dogma it's not it hasn't descended completely into a dogma yet I think so

330
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,080
too you're right maybe I was thinking a little bit too dark and I just remember a couple of

331
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,080
conversations sometimes that's stuck in my mind you're right many scientists are very excited

332
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,120
when there's some new anomaly but I remember people were super excited when there was this

333
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,960
neutrino neutrino's traveling faster than the speed of light at cern I remember that yeah

334
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,640
I remember that and well it turned out to be a bad cable or something but

335
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,440
let's see another example of when anomalies turn out to be have some very abundant explanation

336
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,360
it's true that you can have well misinterpretation and knowing that your data may be flawed and you

337
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,120
know there's all kinds of things you got to go through the whole list to make sure you know

338
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,600
confirmation bias all of these things to make sure that what you're seeing is real but that's

339
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,400
what's peer reviews for exactly so what's the future look like on looking at photographic

340
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,240
plates from the past versus looking at new data you know new data sets from telescopes like the

341
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,840
lsst vera rubin observatory that's going to come online can you use computers and things like that

342
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,040
to automatically look for these kinds of transients and see if they're still occurring actually that's

343
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,640
exactly what we want to do but we want to build our own system to look for these kind of transients

344
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,880
because we think that they are quite short from what we've seen with this place that you can only

345
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,720
see them in one plate so what we want to do is to create a system where you have multiple telescopes

346
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,760
where you search for short flashes and you only retain the flashes that are seen in at least two

347
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,120
telescopes to make sure that they are authentic and when you have multiple telescopes you can also

348
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,880
let's say you have two telescopes you can measure the parallax to an object inside the solar system

349
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,200
let's say that this flash comes from something that is blinking or blinking or having some laser

350
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,280
by having by seeing the flash in two telescopes you will once you have the parallax you can get

351
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,840
the distance and now let's say you have 10 of these telescopes and you see the same flash in

352
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,200
all 10 of them then you're going to have a very good accuracy on the distance to that object

353
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,840
at the same time as you are like validating the flash and you know that it's real at the same

354
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,880
time as you get the 3d location you can actually also use a so-called wedge prism in order to

355
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,160
measure like get the spectrum in low resolution of all the objects in that field that is what

356
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,560
we're going to do try to get the real-time spectrum when you get a spectra on a transient like this

357
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,120
say you catch one and you catch multiple telescopes so you know it's really there it's not a plate

358
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,640
floor or anything like that it's really there and you get a spectra on it what happens if that

359
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,920
spectra is not that of a star well it depends on what we actually see because maybe what we are

360
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,920
seeing is some kind of communication laser that looks the same as what humans use in their

361
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,560
communication satellites maybe also the object that we are seeing is in let's say in geosynchronous

362
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,360
orbit and moves just like a human satellite and shoots a laser just like a human satellite

363
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,440
and there is nothing that indicates any kind of anomaly then it's maybe it's not super exciting

364
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,440
but what if that spectrum what if you know that that object is something

365
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,720
that is very close to the earth it moves let's say again at the geosynchronous orbit but

366
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,040
what you see is not any laser and it's some very peculiar type of emission that you've never seen

367
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,160
that would be super cool. Now how would you go about the process of illumination to begin to

368
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,160
ask in other words if it's a technosignature then it could have a signature that is there's no way

369
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:56,480
that can be natural right and so you say like with a star when you see a star spectrum you see all

370
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,440
the absorption lines and all this stuff and if you don't see that I mean it it would seem to me to be

371
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,560
a very fruitful method of study to start looking at these transients and try to catch spectra.

372
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:14,080
Well we have our methods that they cannot reveal yet in the exapro program where we will be removing

373
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,080
all the human objects like space debris and satellites and we also have are working on

374
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:29,040
establishing a protocol where we remove the remaining unknown objects so of course there's

375
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,800
always a chance that you find some very anomalous thing that is some secret some very secret

376
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,800
experiment that some country on earth has sent there but I think we know the boundaries of what

377
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,720
humans can create and produce and we will have to check whether the anomalies are within them

378
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,160
or outside them. Yeah that's going to be a problem because that's a that's a thing in satellite

379
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,280
technology is blinding other satellites meaning you're emitting some kind of light to throw off

380
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,360
the the rival satellites and things like that. Now what about will this research result in other

381
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,840
discoveries in other words might you find when you're looking for your transients and taking

382
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,320
plates with as many telescopes might you find something like I don't know Kuiper belt objects

383
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:21,680
or planet nine something like that could you catch that with this survey? I think it's there's a very

384
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,720
good possibility that you can find some very unusual astronomical phenomena that are just

385
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,160
happening on these short time scales because in the time scales we are focusing on very few

386
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,320
astronomers have examined it and that's what's what makes it so exciting and that's why it's so

387
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,800
fun for us to explore it and by the way like just a small thing I was thinking about in connection

388
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,760
to the previous question. One more thing by the way in the way how we can separate between human

389
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:57,040
objects even the secret ones and the non-human objects that we are interested in the artificial

390
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,880
let's call ET probes is that we are going to actually search quite far away from the earth

391
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,960
for starters because in that way we get rid of all these satellites at low earth orbit

392
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,440
and we get rid of the whole belt of human space debris so it's a very good thing to try to start

393
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,280
and the searches further out because there everything that has been or most of the stuff

394
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,000
that humans have sent are very like well known. So in other words we we know what the signatures

395
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,840
of human technology are and we should be able to tell that from alien technology for example if

396
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,000
you were seeing say the light from some kind of a photon drive or something like that it would be

397
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,040
so characteristically weird that it's it can't be something that humans produce right?

398
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:54,480
Exactly exactly so that's how I'm imagining that you can identify some of the unidentified objects

399
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,160
or if you find let's say something that maybe looks more like a conventional ET probe but in

400
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:06,160
completely wrong place no country says that they have sent their space rockets and it's too far out

401
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,720
to just be a random object that is there that nobody knows what it is that's also a possibility.

402
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,360
Now you can use parallax to determine that distance right? Of course. When you're using

403
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:24,000
multiple telescopes and you can determine that this is either close or far away. Exactly.

404
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,960
That's what we want to do. So what is the what where are the telescopes going to be located?

405
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,600
I mean is it globally or what telescope locations are we looking at? So actually we hope to get it

406
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,320
globally but in the first phase it's going to be in California so we're looking to put up a telescope

407
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,840
there in Sierra remote and also two more locations so that's where we are now we are trying to

408
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:55,600
solve the administrative things with the telescopes. What kind of telescope apertures

409
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,600
are we looking at? What are the size of these telescopes? It seems to me you can do this very

410
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,920
with very small instruments right? Exactly we are going to go for like very professional state of

411
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,600
the art half meter telescopes that have super good tracking and very good mounts that are reliable

412
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,160
and to do this type of work and yes they are pretty expensive so of course we have to

413
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:24,800
work on that end to make it happen but this yeah we're imagining at least three telescopes

414
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:32,640
in California and hopefully like within the near future so one is being ordered and there are two

415
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,160
more not equally good as the one that we are ordering and one that also one of them actually

416
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,520
recently had an accident so we need to solve that too. Yeah there was a little accident that

417
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,760
happened with one of them and we will probably we will need to replace it. Now this also seems

418
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,720
like something that citizen scientists might be able to do look for transients because there are

419
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,400
a lot of people doing astrophotography out there and there have been for decades and that maybe

420
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,520
people that have archives should look and see if anything's missing in their photographic plates

421
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,880
that they have and let you guys know about it. I would love if they did that and we also have

422
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:16,240
a citizen science project that we've been running with the Vasco team where people can go and actually

423
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,480
search for these type of objects that are vanishing. We're now actually wrapping up the

424
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,280
results from there and like we found some thousands of transients we didn't find any example of a star

425
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,000
that is there in five plates and later vanished but we found many of these short-lived transient

426
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,160
things so everyone are welcome to help us with it also or they can also do it with their own

427
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,560
telescopes on their own archives. I think there's a lot of potential when it comes to

428
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,080
transient searches especially in the short time region. Now you recently spoke at the

429
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:55,200
SOL conference which was put on by Gary Nolan and regarding to UAP tell us about that. Oh my god that

430
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,240
was the most interesting conference I've been to probably in my life. So fun, so nice people,

431
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:09,040
so brilliant thinkers and minds and like such a diversity in the type of work people are doing

432
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,800
and still there's such a unity because everyone wants to understand the phenomenon or the UAPs

433
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:24,320
or if there are ET probes and this curiosity people had like there was such a passion for the topic.

434
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:36,240
Apologies for the sound. Just for the listeners that is the sound of a very active cat. Yes.

435
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,200
All right doctor thank you for visiting with us yet again and I look forward to the next paper

436
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,920
because I'm just fascinated by these transients and legitimately this is one of the things that

437
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,800
really puzzles me these days in science is that is these transients especially this one with the

438
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,280
palomar plate because it just does not look like it looks like stars. Yeah that's the thing it's

439
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,640
like we have several of these cases with the multiple transients all look like stars and some

440
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,400
are even aligned like lying beautifully in a line like if it was satellites moving and tumbling

441
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:16,000
and of course they are from the early 50s when there was nothing human at those high altitudes

442
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,480
or in space so I find it super puzzling and maybe there's some new physics that I don't know about

443
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,480
maybe there's some completely different type of explanation I'm of course also limited

444
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,200
with my bias but I find it fascinating and I want to understand more what it is with new projects and

445
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,200
everything I can do to solve the riddle. Natural or artificial it's going to be interesting.

446
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,400
I think so too. I'm very curious about where it will lead.
