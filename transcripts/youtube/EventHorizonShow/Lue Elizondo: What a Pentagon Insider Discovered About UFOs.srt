1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
For many decades, beginning with the purported crash of a vehicle of unknown origin at Roswell,

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:12,040
New Mexico in 1947, there have been many rumors regarding the involvement of the US government

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,440
in the field of UAP from crash retrievals to interactions and allegations of a broad

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,880
cover-up of their activities in this arena, even making its way to congressional hearings,

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,440
of which another one is scheduled.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,480
Amid this, there have been whistleblowers coming forward claiming that yes, indeed,

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,640
there have been retrievals, and that the US knows far more than what it admits about UFOs.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I have stated before that I am a skeptic of an alien origin for the UFO UAP phenomenon,

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,120
but my mind is open and can be changed.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,280
I am not however skeptical that people see things in the sky that they cannot explain.

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,600
That is why we refer to the phenomenon or phenomena as unidentified, but in having an

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,760
open mind, I am willing to consider both sides of the question of government involvement

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,360
in UFOs.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,360
So this and next week's episodes will be from two differing viewpoints from within

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,120
the US government.

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,220
This week is whistleblower and former Pentagon official Luis Elizondo on the pro side, ultimately

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,620
saying the US government knows far more than it lets on, and does indeed have recovered

18
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,900
materials from Roswell.

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,420
And next week, as a counterpoint interview will be Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick.

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,260
I leave it up to you, the listener, to decide.

21
00:01:47,220 --> 00:02:04,820
Luis Elizondo is a former senior leader of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification

22
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,660
Program, ATIP.

23
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,420
Previously, Lou oversaw counter-espionage and counter-terrorism investigations worldwide

24
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,620
for the US Department of Defense, and also worked for the Office of the National Counterintelligence

25
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,800
Executive and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Elizondo is a proud US Army veteran and later served his country throughout the world, including

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,400
South Korea, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Afghanistan.

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:41,220
Elizondo is a graduate of the University of Miami where he studied microbiology and immunology.

29
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,660
Lou Elizondo, welcome to the program.

30
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,320
It is my sincere privilege to be with you and your audience here today.

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,940
Thank you so much for having me.

32
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,940
Thank you, Lou.

33
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,620
I know your schedule is very, very busy with the book tour and everything, and we'll get

34
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,740
to that book shortly.

35
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,040
But I wanted to ask you to start the conversation going.

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,620
What is your view on just the question of alien life and the universe in general, and

37
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,020
the science behind that?

38
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,860
Well, I mean, we're living proof that life does exist in the universe, aren't we?

39
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,860
We're living proof.

40
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,140
And not only is life prevalent, it's abundant.

41
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:24,580
One only has to look at this little rock and realize just how pervasive life really is.

42
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,020
You know, John, I know you're a man of science, and I like to consider myself a disciple of

43
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,020
science as well.

44
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,900
And I'm probably a little older than you, I tell people, this is gray, not blonde on

45
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900
my face.

46
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,280
I remember a time when at the universities, certainly when I went, there was very narrow

47
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,500
definition of what life is.

48
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,260
And basically, all life had to derive and have to have DNA of some sort.

49
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,780
And we now realize that's not true, because some life forms only have RNA, microbial life.

50
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,260
And then we were told things like, well, you know, life has to survive in a certain Goldilocks

51
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,900
area where there's water and there's oxygen.

52
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,060
And it turns out all that's wrong.

53
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:14,740
There are these organisms called anaerobic bacteria like Clostridium botulinum botulism

54
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,180
that's actually anaerobic, that actually will die in the presence of oxygen.

55
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,220
It actually thrives in a low oxygen environment.

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,820
And then, of course, there's microorganisms that live on the skin of the ISS space station

57
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,340
in a near complete vacuum, right, where the solar radiation is much more intense than

58
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,220
the UV radiation.

59
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,020
You have microbial life living miles beneath the Arctic ice and even even underground in

60
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,700
the highest points of our of our of our natural Earth and in the deepest parts of our oceans.

61
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:50,300
And so we're constantly having to reevaluate even ourselves what what does life even really

62
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,220
mean? What does it mean to be alive?

63
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,020
And, you know, it's a great observation, because I think one only has to look at this

64
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,380
planet and realize that life thrives virtually everywhere.

65
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,660
It is. And it has things that are related to it, but not quite life.

66
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,980
And I know your background is microbiology.

67
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,220
Look at the viruses. You know, what is that?

68
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,380
And how prevalent is such a thing in the universe?

69
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,180
Well, and a virus can self-replicate, a virus can protect itself, a virus can do everything

70
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,020
that a living thing does, it just doesn't have DNA, it has RNA, right?

71
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,460
And so and there have been actually some, even when I was in college along, again, back

72
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,740
when Moses was around, they were they were teaching us that there were some scientists

73
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:40,820
who believe that if there was ever a case for some sort of alien life beyond our planet,

74
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,180
a virus would be a perfect candidate for that, that a virus could have hitched a ride on

75
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,420
a meteor, come to Earth and spread that way.

76
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:54,220
And yes, that there was some serious conversation by some very serious virologists back in the

77
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,460
90s, early 90s, about that very about that very topic and possibility.

78
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:08,300
So I think NASA realizes that the narrow definition of what life is supposed to be probably isn't

79
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,860
entirely all encompassing, isn't completely accurate at this point.

80
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,260
And it has to be said, the first life on Earth were the anaerobes, as you mentioned, they

81
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,780
know it starts with that.

82
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,780
And maybe there's other ways it can start and maybe it doesn't need water.

83
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,780
Maybe it can use ammonia or any other sort of solvent, anything where the chemistry can

84
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
happen.

85
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
Sure.

86
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,780
You've got it.

87
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,180
That to me, yeah.

88
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,020
No, you're you're absolutely right.

89
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,500
In fact, you know, people don't realize this.

90
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,380
Water is something that we need to survive.

91
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,420
But it's actually to a lot of minerals, it's extremely destructive.

92
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,860
It's caustic.

93
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,660
In fact, if you put one of the strongest elements that we have in the natural world, which is

94
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,900
iron and stick it in water and see what happens to it.

95
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Right.

96
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:04,980
So it only works for us because we have evolved where water is is useful to us, both from

97
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,060
a metabolic and catabolic perspective.

98
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:14,620
But in reality, you know, there are other things that that, you know, water, water is

99
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,740
rather destructive towards.

100
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,020
And so is it possible that life has evolved somewhere in the cosmos off of something else?

101
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,140
Is it possible that you don't have to be carbon based?

102
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
Right.

103
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
Maybe silicon based.

104
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,260
Look at artificial intelligence.

105
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:34,780
We are getting close to the precipice where AI could become self-aware, meaning a conscious

106
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:42,940
sentient life form, but not based in carbon and not based in neurons, but based in capacitors

107
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:51,580
and circuitry and silicon rather than neurons and rather than carbon.

108
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,940
There's also the, to get even deeper into it, oxygen itself may not be the be all end

109
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:03,780
all for intelligent life because you've got very highly reactive gases like fluorine that

110
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,100
while they're rare, they would work.

111
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,260
And so you have just many possibilities of alternative biochemistry.

112
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,260
That's right.

113
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,260
Look at methane.

114
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,100
You know, there's how many there's a reason why NASA is interested sending more probes

115
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,580
to certain moons orbiting Jupiter.

116
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,580
That's because of methane.

117
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,300
Now, methane is a it's an organic compound.

118
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:33,260
And it is we know from life here on earth that methane is produced by the decay of carbon

119
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:41,060
based life forms, also by the respiration and respiratory processes of life.

120
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,260
Is it possible that we don't have to go searching throughout the Milky Way that maybe life is

121
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,380
just right around the corner here and we're just getting to the point now where technologically

122
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,980
we can we can discover it and begin to understand it.

123
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,940
And you know, Europa, in fact, the Europa Clipper mission just launched.

124
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,140
That's one of its missions is to see maybe, you know, in the plumes coming out of that

125
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:10,900
moon, maybe, you know, I tend to be a proponent that microbial life is probably ubiquitous

126
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,620
across the universe and that it's nothing special.

127
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,500
And maybe the filters are when, you know, other things happen, you know, to lead to

128
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,260
us.

129
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,220
But at the same time, as you say, we are proof of concept of intelligent life in the

130
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,220
universe.

131
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,500
And that brings us to the topic at hand, the UAP phenomenon, which is, you know, is

132
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,580
everywhere in the news and has been for a very long time.

133
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,100
Going back to rumors from 1947, you know, very early stuff.

134
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,420
What brought you into that world inside the Pentagon?

135
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,460
Well, I was kind of involved, to be honest with you.

136
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,580
I didn't realize what I was getting into till after it was too late.

137
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,980
Some people had met me at my office a few times asking me some general questions.

138
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,780
I had vetted them. They were government officials and they had the blue badge, IC intelligence

139
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,500
community blue badge, which means they had the same, almost the same level of clearance

140
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
that I had.

141
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,700
So we could we could have a normal conversation.

142
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,940
And they told me they needed help with a particular program, very sensitive program, and

143
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,780
they needed some expertise in counterintelligence and security, which is what my background

144
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,780
was.

145
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,860
And so after several meetings, still not knowing what the heck I needed to do or what this

146
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,540
office was, I finally met with their director, Dr.

147
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,460
James Lukatsky, who, if anybody knows that name, this is one of the world's premier rocket

148
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,540
scientists. And I don't say that lightly because there's a lot of really good rocket

149
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,180
scientists. But this is a guy who could have very easily found himself several decades

150
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,900
earlier on the Manhattan Project.

151
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,540
That that qualified, that that that intelligent, that elite when it comes to

152
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,940
just intellectual horsepower.

153
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,980
And at the end of our conversation, still not knowing what we were talking about, he

154
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,220
asked me a very straight question.

155
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,620
And he said, Lou, what do you think about you?

156
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,340
Remember him looking over his glasses and asking me the question, he says, what do you

157
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,380
think about UFOs?

158
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,380
And so I thought for a second and I responded truthfully and said, Jim, I don't.

159
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,900
And he kind of rocked back in his chair and he said, what do you mean, you don't believe

160
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,180
in UFOs? And I said, I didn't say that.

161
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,140
Jim, you asked me, what do I think about them?

162
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,700
And I answered truthfully, I don't think about them because frankly, I don't have the

163
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,060
luxury to think about them.

164
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,020
I'm too busy chasing bad guys and worrying about other national security issues.

165
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,300
I've never been a big fan necessarily as a kid of science fiction.

166
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,700
I wasn't a big Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

167
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,100
I was more of a G.I. Joe kid.

168
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,500
And so for me, I never had that luxury really to be involved in science fiction.

169
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,020
So it never really affected me.

170
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,340
I never really gave it any type of serious thought because I just didn't have the

171
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,260
bandwidth to do so.

172
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,420
It was very quickly thereafter that I realized that, yeah, we're dealing with

173
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,300
something very real.

174
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,380
And it's and there's a national security aspect to to to this conversation.

175
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:06,140
Now, now, in your time and doing that at the Pentagon and I and I will come clean

176
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,940
and open, I am an open minded skeptic.

177
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,420
I don't know what this is.

178
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,220
I am not skeptical that people see UFOs.

179
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,860
Of course they do.

180
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,340
You know, you see things unidentified.

181
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,100
But some of the stuff from the Pentagon, like the Tic Tac incident, are pretty

182
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,940
obviously something a little bit, probably not a balloon, you could say.

183
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,180
And I'm sure you've seen even better stuff in your time.

184
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,580
Would you say that whatever this is, in some cases, it appears to be technological?

185
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,900
It is technological.

186
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,580
There's a piece to this that is very technological, very much nuts and bolts.

187
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,500
And then there's let me correct myself.

188
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,820
People are going to say, well, you said before, there's no nuts and bolts and

189
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,740
rivets. I mean, that figured that there's a tangible physical aspect to this topic.

190
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
There's a technological piece to this.

191
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:01,500
But with every piece of technology, there is a huge history and a tale that goes

192
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,860
with it. You can't just simply look at a car and say that's a piece of technology

193
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,780
because you have to then ask the next question.

194
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,500
Where was it built?

195
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,420
When was it built?

196
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,500
Who built it?

197
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
What is it used for?

198
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,620
You know, and all the other questions that come along that aren't necessarily

199
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,460
always going to have a technical response, you know, eventually you ask enough

200
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,020
questions and you start getting into a little bit more, maybe the spirit,

201
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,580
spirituality aspect of this.

202
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,180
When I say spirituality, I don't mean in a in a woo sort of way.

203
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,900
I mean, really in a in a more esoteric sort of way, in a in a manner that that

204
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:44,500
involves human psychology, human sociology, our ability to perceive and to

205
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:53,340
to translate information and rationalize information into into into a into a

206
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,580
thought that has a natural conclusion to it.

207
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,300
I know I'm being a little evasive here.

208
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,460
Just I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you want to understand a piece of

209
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,780
technology, you first have to have the capability inside as a person and the

210
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,580
intellectual capability to understand that.

211
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:11,860
Right.

212
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,340
So it's often like, you know, there's a there's a good analogy.

213
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,820
My my good friend, Steve Justice, used to say, he said, imagine or it might

214
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,700
have been even helped put off.

215
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,780
He said, imagine being Da Vinci back in this in the Renaissance and coming

216
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,020
across for the very first time a garage door opener.

217
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,100
Now, electromagnetic has not been discovered yet.

218
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,220
So we don't understand frequencies.

219
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,660
We don't understand the waveforms.

220
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,900
We don't even understand plastic because it's never been made before.

221
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,140
We don't understand rubber.

222
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,020
And let alone we don't understand why a house would happen to have a garage door

223
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,780
for a vehicle that hasn't been invented yet.

224
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,380
So, you know, it's it's there's a lot to, you know, you learn a lot from nuts and

225
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,620
bolts, which was my focus, but there's a lot more to the conversation, to be

226
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,140
honest with you, like any conversation.

227
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,660
Really? Yeah.

228
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:09,060
Another analogy would be if you find a piece of a cell phone, a component, a

229
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,940
chunk, a screen, it isn't going to tell you anything about the cell phone network.

230
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,060
You're just you're missing too many puzzle pieces to be able to.

231
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,620
How would you understand what 5G is if the electromagnetic spectrum hasn't

232
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,740
even been discovered yet?

233
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,140
You wouldn't even know it was there.

234
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,620
You wouldn't even know now.

235
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,780
And which is an interesting point, because when we're glimpsing things like this,

236
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,500
now, as far as and of course, everybody's going to ask about Roswell and those

237
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,900
sorts of things of purported materials being recovered, is that the problem in

238
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,220
looking at that kind of stuff if we have it trying to figure it out is you're

239
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,420
like you're you're going blind.

240
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,860
You know, you're you're you're proceeding from a blind position to try to figure

241
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,460
out something presumably far more advanced than anything you've ever seen.

242
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,940
Right. And look, one thing is if you recover a Russian aircraft that crashed,

243
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,860
chances are they might have some advanced technology, but it still works the same

244
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,980
way as the technology we're familiar with.

245
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,620
It's not necessarily new technology.

246
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,620
It's just advanced technology.

247
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,780
But when you come across something that is fundamentally new and requires a new

248
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:23,700
understanding of science and a new understanding of the physical world, where

249
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,740
do you start with that?

250
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,740
Right. It's a pretty it's a pretty big leap of faith to just jump off in any

251
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,020
direction and say, OK, this is what this piece is used for.

252
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,140
Most components, like you say, in a cell phone, right, have all sorts of other

253
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,420
components that they rely on a screen by itself that can't do anything without a

254
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,460
battery and a battery can't do anything without a charger.

255
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,820
And the charger can't do anything without being connected to the electrical grid.

256
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,300
And the electrical grid can't do anything without, you know, electricity being

257
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,940
supplied by a dam or perhaps a wind turbine somewhere, you know, in the state

258
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,980
or a nuclear reactor.

259
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,020
So it's it's it's not just that simple as picking up a piece of material and

260
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,420
saying, aha, you know, it's far more complex than that.

261
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,300
I always wondered if there was a warehouse somewhere where the U.S.

262
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,220
government keeps things like Russian aircraft and that submarine that they

263
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,300
recovered from the ocean floor decades ago, if they if they still have that

264
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,660
stuff. Right.

265
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,380
We would not, unfortunately, be able to to elaborate on that.

266
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,660
But it's a very good, very good, insightful question, for sure.

267
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,900
Call it the Indiana Jones warehouse.

268
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,220
But anyway, back to the topic at hand now, internally speaking, what did you guys

269
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,140
discuss as far as possible solutions as to the origin of this?

270
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,900
Did you get into scientific ideas like the zoo hypothesis, for example, that this

271
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,540
could be, you know, an alien machine or something like that that's, you know, here

272
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,380
to keep us bottled in and keep an eye on us?

273
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,060
Or some other sort of, you know, what were those discussions like?

274
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,940
And this is just all open science speculative stuff that, you know, is out

275
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,380
there. Well, there was a lot of speculation.

276
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
I never had one particular narrative.

277
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,980
Some people suggested that we were merely a gas station, that water was being used

278
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,540
as a form to power their propulsion units.

279
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,460
Others said that they suspected there was some sort of monitoring of our nuclear

280
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,580
capabilities and to see our development and evolution as a species.

281
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,980
Others suggested that they're here for a far more malevolent reason, some sort

282
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,740
of ISR, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and preparation of the

283
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:35,140
battle space. Others had speculated that they may be here just out of curiosity.

284
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,140
Why do we go to the Serengeti and and watch the wilder beasts migrate?

285
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,820
Because we do, because it's part of nature.

286
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,820
There's a lot of different theories.

287
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,420
I was never necessarily wedded to one or the other.

288
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,380
I think we need more information.

289
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,900
I think we need more data.

290
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,340
And I've always been, although I've been tempted a few times, I've always tried to

291
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:07,060
resist the urge of trying to trying to figure out what their intent is.

292
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,980
You know, intent is something, John, intent is something that tends to be very

293
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,940
uniquely human. There are motivations.

294
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,500
All animals have some sort of motivation.

295
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,940
When a shark bites the surfer, his motivation that he's hungry, but his intent

296
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,460
isn't to hurt the surfer.

297
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,220
He's not even kidding.

298
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,140
Shark isn't even calculating that it's a human being, right?

299
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,020
Living, breathing human beings says, oh, something on the water looks yummy.

300
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,140
I'm hungry. I'm going to eat it.

301
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,620
But intent is something a little different.

302
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:40,420
Some of the more advanced primates and humans have intent, meaning we do things

303
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:47,740
deceitfully. We do things to manipulate in order to get some sort of self gain

304
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,820
out of it. Most of the animals in the wild don't do that.

305
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,620
They have motivations, but not real intent.

306
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,580
Humans are one of the only real species that have that higher order of thinking.

307
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:05,700
And therefore, that complexity of thinking and intent is a uniquely human

308
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:12,740
and advanced ape aspect of our being.

309
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,420
Artificial intelligence doesn't have intent.

310
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,700
Artificial intelligence has input in and data out.

311
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,460
Very simple. Is it possible what we're dealing with is also like artificial

312
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,580
intelligence, meaning it just does what it does?

313
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,580
Or maybe it's binary.

314
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,380
Maybe it's just things on ones and zeros, right?

315
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,380
Yes or no. Very simple, on and off.

316
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,420
We simply don't know.

317
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:47,140
And from a national security perspective, to determine if something is a threat,

318
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,700
it's a very simple calculus.

319
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,020
It's capabilities versus intent.

320
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,060
We've seen some of the capabilities, but we have no idea the intent now, do we?

321
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,420
Or even if there is an intent.

322
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:01,580
So it's very hard to even, from a national security perspective, even determine

323
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,460
whether these things even are a threat.

324
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,260
I think one of the more spooky scenarios is that it may not know why it's here.

325
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,220
It may have forgotten.

326
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,260
It may have never been told.

327
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,620
You know, it may, it's just like sending out Voyager 2.

328
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,380
We never told it what it was going to go do.

329
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,020
We just programmed it to...

330
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,620
Well, how about the trip to, you know, at some point when mankind or humankind

331
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,300
decides to go to Alpha Proxima, with current technology, it would take us

332
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,060
about 10,000 years to do it.

333
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,500
You know, that's only three and a half light years away.

334
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:38,100
Do we, are we sure that the occupants of that, let's say that starship we were

335
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,500
to send out, that notional starship that doesn't exist, but let's say it does, by

336
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,260
the time they get to Alpha Proxima, would they even understand what their mission

337
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,300
was all along, or would they have forgotten it?

338
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,860
Well, you can also apply that to machine civilization.

339
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,980
If you have a von Neumann probe that has been sitting out there for millions of

340
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,820
years, taking cosmic ray hits, it may be so corrupt in its programming that it has

341
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,980
no idea what it's doing.

342
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:07,020
It's just 3D printing out probes that are appearing irrational, you know, in

343
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,500
the atmosphere of an exoplanet.

344
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,220
Glitches in the system, so to speak.

345
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,820
Yeah, glitches in the system.

346
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,660
Now, did you ever see any indication that it might actually be multiple

347
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,300
different phenomena that are being mistaken as one and that we're just

348
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,540
lumping it all together, perhaps unwisely?

349
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,500
Yeah, yeah, that's always a possibility too.

350
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,820
You know, we do understand the morphology of certain crafts.

351
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,380
You have lenticular or disc-shaped craft.

352
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,060
You have cigar or rod-shaped craft.

353
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,740
You have triangular-shaped craft.

354
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:42,060
And you even have large boomerang craft that are often reported.

355
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,380
And then you've got some of these outliers like the jellyfish, right?

356
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:51,180
And these orbs, if you will, or whatever you want to call them, right?

357
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:58,020
These luminous balls of light as well that are often lumped into the UAP

358
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,340
phenomenon, interestingly enough, when I went to South America, the Mapuche

359
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:08,580
people, the indigenous people, Aboriginal people of Patagonia in Argentina, in a

360
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,780
little area outside of Bariloche called Las Lajas, they see these orbs, these

361
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,580
luminous balls of light all the time, but they actually have a different conclusion.

362
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:25,100
They believe that they are the spirits of their ancestors coming in to take a

363
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,540
peek at them and make sure that they're okay and everything, everybody as well.

364
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:36,380
So, yeah, I mean, there's always speculation that this could be multiple

365
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,140
different types of variants, probably using a similar type of technology, kind

366
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,700
of like an internal combustion engine, whether it's a Ferrari or a, you know,

367
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,700
Chevy Impala, the physics is still the same.

368
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,100
There's, you know, one may look a little different, one may behave a little

369
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,500
different, but at the end of the day, it's still a piston's internal combustion

370
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,220
engine, transmission, power to the wheels, and away you go.

371
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,500
So, you know, that's a great question.

372
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,700
And I think a lot of people have speculated that we're looking at different

373
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:17,300
types of morphology of vehicles, probably even different occupants, perhaps,

374
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,740
with probably, probably similar technology.

375
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,660
Was there any indication of how the propulsion systems on these worked?

376
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,140
And was it common?

377
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:33,740
Did you see the same characteristics from different types of UAP morphology?

378
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,100
Yeah, great question.

379
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,620
So that's correct.

380
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,100
We did.

381
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,820
And in fact, talk a little bit about it in my book, I actually give a

382
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,180
presentation on it that's a little bit more comprehensive, but yeah, there

383
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,700
was in 2015, this proverbial aha moment within ATIP where the senior

384
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,300
scientists came in kind of barging through the skiff's door and said,

385
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:55,980
we need to talk.

386
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,020
And after about a three hour conversation, it was kind of this Eureka moment

387
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:05,860
where a lot of the observables that we were seeing, both from a performance

388
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:12,460
and even a human biologics perspective, could all be explained through very

389
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,260
simple physics.

390
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,580
Now, when I say simple physics, I don't mean easy physics, but I mean simple

391
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,180
physics.

392
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:25,300
Now with simple physics comes very complicated technology sometimes to

393
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,500
master physics, the simple physics, right?

394
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,540
Look at gravity.

395
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,460
If you want to break gravity, we have to come up with either a helicopter or

396
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,100
plane to do it.

397
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,100
And we've only been able to do it maybe the last century or so out of the time

398
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,660
that homo sapiens, sapiens been scratching on the floor.

399
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:48,420
So by no means am I saying it's an easy thing to do, but the physics seems to be

400
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,900
fairly straightforward and that what is happening is that whatever these are

401
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,980
have created some sort of ability to create a bubble around themselves that

402
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:04,300
insulates themselves from the external effects of the warping of space time.

403
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,100
As we know, massive objects, there's two ways to warp space time.

404
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,540
Thanks to, thanks to Einstein and his famous equation, E equals MC squared.

405
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,460
Now, most people don't realize this, but that is a very interesting equation

406
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:27,140
because energy and, and mass matter are really coefficients of each other in that

407
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,900
equation, meaning you can think of energy and matter as fundamentally the same

408
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,340
thing in two different States.

409
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,420
So what do I mean by that?

410
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:43,620
Think of imagine ice being matter, solid mass, and now imagine steam being energy.

411
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,100
Both are made of water, right?

412
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,860
Both are almost identical.

413
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:53,420
It's just the fundamental state in which they, they, they, they, they reside.

414
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,820
One is extremely energetic while the other is condensed and consolidated.

415
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,460
Cause it's cooler.

416
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,140
Very much the same thing.

417
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,260
If I take matter and I annihilate matter, what do I get?

418
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,020
I get pure energy.

419
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,140
And if I take energy and I go to the CERN and I start cooling it down and slowing

420
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,180
it down, I start getting at the subatomic particles.

421
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:20,620
So the two ways to warp space time or to, to battle space time.

422
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,740
Cause we do know space time is flexible.

423
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,340
That's a fact.

424
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,260
We've already proven that one only has to look at their cell phone and look at a

425
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:34,700
GPS signal and realize something through the phenomenon called atomic drift, where

426
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,980
the atomic cesium clocks on board the GPS spacecraft, even though the, the exact

427
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,500
same clocks here at the ground station and have the exact same half-life, atomic

428
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,980
half-life, they still run at different rates.

429
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,180
Now, why is that?

430
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,060
Because the clocks that are on the ground here on earth, the warping of space time

431
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,020
is more extreme.

432
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:02,940
And so time literally goes by at a slightly different rate than the atomic cesium

433
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,300
clocks are experiencing on board the spacecraft.

434
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,140
So we know space time is flexible.

435
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,100
And in some extreme cases, you know, with mass earth warps space time.

436
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,580
The sun warps space time because of its mass.

437
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,340
And if you're a super massive enough, you make a black hole and you warp space time

438
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,260
to the point where, where it almost becomes nonsensical.

439
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:31,660
Now, are they using mass, whatever they are to, to propel themselves across the

440
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,740
vastness of the cosmos, if that is where they're coming from, chances are not,

441
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,060
because that mass would perturb the very massive here on earth and it would be

442
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,860
very destructive and we'd all, we would all see that and feel it.

443
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,780
So the other way to warp space time is with a tremendous amount of energy.

444
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,700
And it turns out that if you have enough energy and potentially the right material,

445
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,980
you can create at a localized area, a bubble that insulates yourself from

446
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,660
the external warping of space time, meaning inside this bubble, the way you

447
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,540
experience space time would be fundamentally different than the

448
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,500
observer standing outside the bubble.

449
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,340
And what would appear like magic to me, standing outside the bubble to you

450
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,140
is just a walk in the park.

451
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:24,260
What I consider extreme acceleration and hypersonic velocities for you, you're

452
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,140
not performing anything unique or extreme.

453
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,740
In fact, to you, you're just operating like normal and to, and, and your

454
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,060
observation of us outside the bubble is that we're actually all going in slow

455
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,980
motion and it's, it's, it's a little interesting.

456
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,700
It's kind of a trick off of Einstein's relativity, but we believe that

457
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:51,900
potentially that these UAP, their, their, their propulsion units are a little

458
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,300
bit different than what we are used to.

459
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,620
You know, we have a car or an airplane and you've got an engine inside the

460
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,980
car that propels a car.

461
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,580
This is a little different.

462
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,700
In this case, the car itself may be part of the engine, meaning you have an

463
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,340
energy source in the middle of the craft and you then have a reaction with the

464
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,980
skin of the vehicle, which happens to be a certain material type of material.

465
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,100
And when you have that interaction, all of a sudden, interesting things start to

466
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,140
happen, things that shouldn't be able to happen, but, but do happen.

467
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:31,260
And it might even explain the, when people see the strobing lights, different

468
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,060
multicolored lights, they say, it looks like a police car sometimes.

469
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,140
And that could just simply be a Doppler redshift blue shift.

470
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:42,180
You could be seeing something that is going in, in, in one frequency that gets

471
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,300
shifted up into the visible light spectrum.

472
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,500
And now you're, you're actually seeing, uh, it's propulsion units, the triangles,

473
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,260
for example, that have the lights on the apex of the triangle, um, chances are

474
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,780
those are not actually lights.

475
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,580
Um, it's, it's quite possible those are part of potentially the propulsion

476
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,020
system on board the craft.

477
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Well, the descriptions of the lights, at least in the really good accounts,

478
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,380
you're right, they're not lights.

479
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,220
They're, they're something to do with inherent with the UFO because otherwise,

480
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,700
you know, an alien doesn't, they're not interested in, in following FAA

481
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,420
conventions or things like that.

482
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,420
Yeah, they, they, they don't necessarily have the handbook on board with them.

483
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,860
So it's probably not used for the same things we, we, we would use it for.

484
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,140
Right.

485
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,700
It's kind of like, I always tell people, imagine if a, if a 747 crashed in the

486
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,460
middle of the Amazon jungle and, and, you know, an Amazonian lost tribe of the

487
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,740
Amazon find some of the wreckage and, you know, they pick up a piece of glass from

488
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,620
the cockpit and now they can use it as a tool to, to skin their meat a little

489
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,060
easier, but are they really reverse engineering the technology?

490
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,820
No, they're not.

491
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,660
They're just exploiting it for whatever current paradigm that they live in and,

492
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,220
and exploiting it for those purposes.

493
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,100
Now that gets into a rather puzzling question that's vexed me for a long time.

494
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:05,100
So there are reports that these things crash, but they can't have been doing

495
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,940
that for very long because whenever a human throughout history finds a piece of

496
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,540
metal, say a meteorite, they use it.

497
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,340
Even if you don't even know how to smelt metal, you still use the meteorite metal

498
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,820
because as you know, you haven't seen anything like that before.

499
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,300
And there are, you know, archeological examples of, of, you know, nickel iron

500
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,740
meteorites hammered into points.

501
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,940
And this was even done into, into historic times.

502
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:35,460
Massai warriors in Namibia had access to the Gibeon meteorite and were hammering

503
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:42,300
it into spear points into recent memory until they realized that the meteorites

504
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,420
were worth something on eBay.

505
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,020
Same thing with in, in Greenland.

506
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,380
There was the Cape York meteorite that was used by local peoples for harpoons.

507
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,940
I mean, John, let's not forget, you know, King Tut's tomb and the famous dagger.

508
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,180
Yep, the meteorite dagger, but what we don't have is an aluminum one, you

509
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,980
know, or, or a piece of titanium done like that in an archeological context.

510
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:10,660
Well, we believe that the crashes are more recent and, and may be due to a

511
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,780
vulnerability and particularly in the way the propulsion systems work.

512
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,140
And that is to say that electro certain electromagnetic pulses, think of an EMP,

513
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,620
just like they can disable my cell phone or this computer can also interfere with

514
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,620
the propulsion units of, of these vehicles, because of the way they operate.

515
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,180
So radar or some sort of EMP or something like that.

516
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,740
They're susceptible or the, or, you know, the detonation of an atomic weapon or

517
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:47,700
the testing of an atomic weapon, there is a very strong EMP that is released.

518
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,820
Electromagnetic pulse that interferes with all sorts of conventional

519
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,820
technology and it's quite possible.

520
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:00,620
And there's also a huge burst of neutrinos as well, and, and, and neutrons as well.

521
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,580
So, you know, I'm not going to bore you and your audience with, with the science

522
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:09,660
lesson on atomic and nuclear technology, but it does seem to be a correlation

523
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,580
there that the U S government has recognized.

524
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:18,860
Lou, that means that we've recently become some kind of a threat to this phenomenon,

525
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,140
right?

526
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,460
In other words, we are dangerous now.

527
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:29,300
Well, certainly we are not as susceptible, you know, willing subjects.

528
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:35,540
It means that we have an ability to, to potentially interfere with, with

529
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,660
whatever they are.

530
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,660
And they seem to recognize that.

531
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,900
And, you know, we can, we can ascribe all sorts of intent behind it.

532
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:53,140
Um, but, uh, it does appear that at least superficially that they have a vulnerability.

533
00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:00,140
Now, certainly someone within the government noticed that because I can't, I

534
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,980
do not buy it when, um, you know, a government official comes out in a

535
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,420
hearing or whatever and says that whatever it is, it does not appear to be

536
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,660
a national security threat.

537
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,860
Of course it's a national security threat.

538
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,340
When you don't know what it is.

539
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,780
And given that we can't, apparently sometimes can't even see gigantic

540
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,580
Chinese spy balloons, uh, we may have a problem here.

541
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,740
What's your take on that?

542
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,740
Yeah.

543
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:32,140
Um, look, uh, we're getting into a part of a conversation here that I find, um,

544
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,780
interesting, some people may find disturbing, but look, governments are no

545
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,540
different than religions or any other type of institution where the citizens

546
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:47,660
have given, have placed their faith and confidence into a particular organization.

547
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,620
Um, again, whether it's a government or religion or anything like that.

548
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,140
And governments in particular have one job and that is to protect

549
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,740
their citizens from threats, whether it's environmental threats or military

550
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:07,020
threats or ecological threats or financial threats, um, it is not a good

551
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:12,220
spot to be in as a government to identify a problem for which you don't have a

552
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,940
solution for it.

553
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:13,580
Okay.

554
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,580
And the people say, oh, well, that's nonsensical.

555
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,580
Look, we do it all the time.

556
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,940
Let me give you a case in point.

557
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:25,380
Uh, when we first developed the U2 spy plane, when, when, when the CIA had the

558
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:31,420
plane commission with locking skunkworks, um, we did it in direct contravention to

559
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,260
the peace treaty we had with Russia at the time, which was we would not fly manned

560
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,500
reconnaissance missions over mainland Russia, but we did because we were afraid

561
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,740
they were building nukes and we wanted to keep an eye on them.

562
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,180
So what was, what was our choice?

563
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,500
Well, we would build a plane that would fly higher and faster than anything else.

564
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,380
And the Russians would never be able to detect us.

565
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,740
And you know what?

566
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,100
It seemed like that was a case because for the first few missions we flew over

567
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,300
Russia, the Russians didn't react.

568
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,620
And so we thought, holy crap, we did it.

569
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,700
That was to say until the Russians developed the SA-2 surface to air

570
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:10,620
missile and successfully shot a U-2 down and then went on to parade, uh, Captain

571
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,620
Powers and the aircraft bits and pieces of it in front of the United

572
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,220
Nations and the world, right?

573
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:22,020
They did not even admit to their own Russian people that we had this capability

574
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:30,100
until when, until we, they had a solution to, to, to negate that threat, right?

575
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,660
It wasn't until they could shoot down the U-2, did they ever admit that

576
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,620
they even knew about it.

577
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,460
And this is very common for, for all governments, uh, because governments are

578
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,100
supposed to be solution focused.

579
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,620
And when you don't have a solution to a problem, it creates great anxiety and it

580
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,580
also creates distrust, animosity, fear.

581
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:55,060
And, and that's not what, that's not what we want our citizens to feel.

582
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:02,140
So, um, therein lies part of the problem that we, we don't like to admit problems

583
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,020
that there are no solutions for until there's a solution.

584
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:11,540
Now question, we briefly mentioned this, but I want to get deeper into their

585
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:17,180
interest in our nuclear, uh, capabilities, aircraft carrier groups and things like

586
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,820
that, and you know, they seem to be, especially if, if such a thing can

587
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,780
actually produce an effect on them, well, of course they're going to be interested

588
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,580
in it, but were you able to figure out, and this is part one of this question,

589
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:33,900
where you were able to figure out why they were so interested in, in, uh, you

590
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,740
know, nuclear reactors and things like that.

591
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,180
And then I got a part two after this.

592
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,140
Sure.

593
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,060
Um, what you're saying is correct.

594
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,180
There is definitely interest in our nuclear equities, not just ours.

595
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,220
Um, other, other world governments, nuclear equities as well.

596
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,180
Now, when I say nuclear equities, I don't just mean nuclear weapons.

597
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,340
I mean, nuclear weapons, I mean, uh, nuclear energy, nuclear technology,

598
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:04,180
nuclear triggering devices, anything and everything nuclear, uh, there seems

599
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,340
to be a very keen interest by UAP.

600
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:10,540
And furthermore, they have the ability to interfere with that technology.

601
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,620
Now, some can speculate, well, it's like, you know, parents taking

602
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,100
matches out of the hands of kids.

603
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,060
Well, that's fine if you think that, but let's, let's look at the actual

604
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:27,540
evidence and see if it's, see if it exists, um, where we have issues here,

605
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,940
where we had anecdotes of these UAP taking our nuclear weapons offline

606
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,180
here in the United States in Russia, the opposite occurred.

607
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,700
They actually turned them on.

608
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,140
Um, so think about that for a minute.

609
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:47,940
Secondly, um, in the 1940s, mid 1940s, there's only one, it'd been one country

610
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,500
that's ever used an atomic weapon and it was us.

611
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:56,260
And we vaporized nearly 800,000 human beings off the face of the planet with

612
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,540
dropping of two bombs, uh, Hiroshima and Nagasaki with a, a, a yield of roughly

613
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,940
13 kilotons and then only I think was about 21, 22 kilotons, um, nowhere did

614
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,860
UAP come and stop that from happening.

615
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,340
In fact, when we were the only country with an atomic weapon, nowhere did

616
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,700
UAP stop the proliferation of a type of technology getting into the hands of

617
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,500
the Russians and then ultimately North Korea and Pakistan and potentially Iran

618
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,740
and India and everywhere else.

619
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,820
In fact, UAP didn't stop, uh, anything from happening when we were testing in

620
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,660
Nevada, all our nukes or Zarbamba from being detonated by the Russians.

621
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,420
It didn't interfere with Three Mile Island or Chernobyl or Fukushima.

622
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,260
So to suggest that they're trying to prevent us from hurting ourselves, I

623
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,580
mean, that sounds nice, but there is no empirical evidence to suggest that.

624
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,460
What we do know is that they're interested in our nuclear carrier strike groups.

625
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,540
Now, what is that?

626
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:56,180
Well, you're talking about a nuclear footprint that when, when all is said

627
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,500
and done in the middle of the Atlantic ocean can be bigger than the entire

628
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,420
nuclear footprint of the entire state of New York, right?

629
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,660
Um, you have nuclear powered vessels, nuclear capable vessels, nuclear armed

630
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,340
vessels.

631
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:15,020
Um, and that's a pretty big, uh, that's a pretty, pretty big target, if you

632
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:20,060
will, for, for UAP, and we believe that may be why they have a keen interest in

633
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,500
our nuclear carrier strike groups, simply because of the nuclear footprint.

634
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:30,780
Part two, there is an elephant in the world that also operates a nuclear

635
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,100
powered aircraft carrier group, and it is France.

636
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,220
Did you ever have any contact with the French and do the French see the same

637
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,780
things from their aircraft carrier bases?

638
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,180
No, I can't speak on behalf of a foreign nation.

639
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,700
Um, I, it would be very inappropriate for me to do that, whether we have, or

640
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,140
we have not, um, that's, that's a question you'd have to, I would need permission

641
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,420
from another government to answer that.

642
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,620
Um, and I don't have that.

643
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,420
So unfortunately I'm going to have to do a polite pass on that, but, but look,

644
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,100
France has their own organization called Japan and they have been very interested

645
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,060
in the UAP topic for some time as well.

646
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,580
Um, talk to Jacques Lallet, he can give you more details about that.

647
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,660
But as far as what the capabilities are or what the interactions are with

648
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,700
another foreign country, unfortunately, I can't, I can't elaborate on that.

649
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:25,460
Now, the other question regarding, um, nuclear, you know, interest, does it

650
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,420
appear that they're trying to harvest energy?

651
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,140
In other words, I mean, could there be a neutron flux or something like

652
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,420
that, that they find useful?

653
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,380
Could be, but there's easier ways to get it.

654
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:40,180
Um, we don't see any, what appears to be any type of bleed off effect where

655
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,460
they're reaching any type of anything from it.

656
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,180
Um, it appears to be more, they're just interested in our development.

657
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,860
Um, and, and there may be a reason for that.

658
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,940
Uh, look, if you look at it at a scale.

659
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,780
And you, I don't know if your viewers are going to be able to see me on screen

660
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,700
here, so I'll be, I'll be trying to say articulate as I can, um, cause I don't

661
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,780
know if I'm actually going to be on screen for you guys.

662
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,460
We can make it happen.

663
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,860
So if you were to take a line on a piece of paper and you start with, with two,

664
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,300
start with two, two lines here.

665
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:31,140
So if you look at a chart like this, energy versus mass, and you start

666
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:36,900
way back here and you look at a glass of water, glass of water sits over here.

667
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,460
Um, that is a, when you convert that into steam, that's a, uh, you are

668
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,780
separating the molecules from each other.

669
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,260
It's still, you're not breaking the molecules up.

670
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,260
You just separate the molecules and that's a one times 10 to the third

671
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,660
yield of energy and you can go there and go now to an exothermic reaction

672
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,140
like gunpowder and you get now one times 10 to the fourth, uh, yield of

673
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,740
energy, an exothermic reaction.

674
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,980
Then you get down to splitting an atom.

675
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,740
The smaller you go in mass and you break apart those bonds, the

676
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,420
greater your energy yield goes up.

677
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:13,940
And, and it turns out that long story short, um, any species, any

678
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:20,700
civilization that finally cracks the code of how the atom works and that

679
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,900
there's a whole nother universe, subatomic universe, smaller than that

680
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,300
with infinite amount of potential for energy.

681
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:33,500
Um, it's probably a matter of time, maybe feta can play that, uh, within

682
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,900
a couple hundred years, they will understand the technologies themselves

683
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,140
to bend space time, to warp space time and basically perform the same type

684
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:46,900
of maneuvers that we are seeing with each UAP is it possible that things

685
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,660
are just interested in us and our development that the, that the funny

686
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,820
little monkeys are getting to a point where in the next couple of centuries,

687
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:03,020
they may be able to travel the cosmos like they can, and now no longer

688
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,260
distance is no longer really a problem anymore.

689
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,140
Um, and if that's the case, what would the impact be?

690
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,980
You know, if you've got some, some noisy neighbors that are pretty, you

691
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,180
know, they keep a sloppy yard and there's dog poop all over the place,

692
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,540
but they keep it to their yard, you know, and there's a big fence around

693
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,180
it and you rarely see them, you're probably not going to be as bothered.

694
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,060
But what happens when your noisy neighbors start doing the same thing

695
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,540
around the entire neighborhood, right?

696
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,140
And they start knocking on people's doors.

697
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,140
Well, that's a different problem.

698
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:38,380
And so it could very well be that they are just watching us very carefully

699
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,140
because the funny little monkey is about to get out of his cage.

700
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:48,620
It could be, and that again, that's the zoo hypothesis or subset of it, which

701
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,940
is the alien police action scenario where they, they're, they're watching

702
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,100
you until you do something like develop artificial generalized intelligence

703
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,020
that can be a threat to the rest of the galaxy.

704
00:45:59,420 --> 00:45:59,700
Right.

705
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,180
I mean, look, we're, we're doing it now with the tribes in, in, in Brazil

706
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,540
and in the Amazon, right?

707
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,740
We, we, we, we fly into the helicopter.

708
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,740
We take pictures and we monitor them.

709
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,340
What are they doing?

710
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,180
You know, and there's going to come a point where we're going to have to say,

711
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,300
okay, well, now's the time for contact.

712
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,500
You know, now, now it's either they're getting violence or they're starting

713
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,420
to raid a local village and they're starting to steal things.

714
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,460
Um, you know, who knows?

715
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,660
So it could just be a monitoring mission.

716
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,900
It could be, or it could be like, you know, we were talking with a shark,

717
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,780
but in this case, like a grizzly bear, it's just staring at you with a

718
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,300
half hearted interest until it gets hungry.

719
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,860
And then it just does something that, you know, it's what a bear does.

720
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,580
Yeah, that's what a bear does.

721
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,900
And, you know, or, and polar bears are worse in a lot of ways

722
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,220
because they don't have as much food.

723
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:52,500
Um, so it may be that way for an alien civilization is they're like, well,

724
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,500
that planet may be useful someday.

725
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,540
We don't need it right now.

726
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,180
And the monkeys can have their planet, but when we need that, you know, and

727
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,620
it could be something very predatory like that.

728
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:02,460
That's right.

729
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,540
Oh, by the way, can the monkeys defend themselves?

730
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,700
So what are we going to have to do to take, you know, take a little blue planet

731
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,860
if we need it, you know, these monkeys can be pretty violent sometimes.

732
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:11,980
Absolutely.

733
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:12,740
Absolutely.

734
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:17,020
Well, the good news is if they, you know, people have pointed out, if

735
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,220
they were going to do anything, they'd have probably already done it.

736
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,700
So we must not have that important, but I don't know if I believe that.

737
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,700
I don't, I don't know if I believe that, you know, we're, we're, we're

738
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:32,460
talking off human timescales here, but that's relative, you know, um, a

739
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,900
tortoise lives 200 years plus maybe even older, right?

740
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,740
The oldest tree right now is what?

741
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,420
Several thousands of years old.

742
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,740
Time is relative.

743
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,780
You know, they don't, they don't, we don't, they're not on our timescale,

744
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,140
whatever they are, a timetable.

745
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,220
They've got time on their side.

746
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,060
They can do whatever they want, whenever they want.

747
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,500
And so, you know, say that way, we've already done it.

748
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,980
I'm not convinced.

749
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,220
Maybe there, you know, some folks in the Pentagon have speculated they're

750
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:02,060
doing a preparation of the battle space, maybe a 100 year, 200 year mission

751
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,140
to do reconnaissance, figure out what resources are on this planet and what

752
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,780
type of fight that they're going to have, and then be prepared for that.

753
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,500
Um, do I believe that?

754
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,220
Not necessarily, but some people in the Pentagon do.

755
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,660
It's interesting to think about the idea that, you know, time to them,

756
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:24,060
because we perceive time with our clocks and our calendars and our lifespan.

757
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:29,740
Ultimately, you know, we think a hundred years is a long time, but it, it really

758
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,940
isn't, it's not geologic time here.

759
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,180
But if you have something that lives, you know, on the scale of geologic time

760
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,500
or as part of a hive mind or something like that, that just is effectively

761
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,740
immortal, 10,000 years to it is nothing.

762
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,340
Absolutely nothing.

763
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,900
You know, we get out.

764
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,260
Sure.

765
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,260
I mean, it's, it's, it's not that big of a deal.

766
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,660
It is to us because, you know, our lifetime book, you said, are very

767
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,300
compressed, you know, if you live to 85 years old, you're doing pretty well.

768
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,100
Um, but that's, that's nothing.

769
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,260
That's a blink of an eye, right?

770
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,580
In, in, in real terms of, of, of time.

771
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,940
For now, in the future, 300 years from now, people may live a

772
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,620
considerably longer and they won't be.

773
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,340
We already are, aren't we?

774
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,820
I mean, look at the way we were back in the middle ages,

775
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,820
lifespan was what, 38, 39, 40 years old.

776
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,620
Unless you were royalty.

777
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:22,140
Um, now most people are living into their seventies, eighties, and even nineties.

778
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:27,580
Um, and now with the, you know, this, this new development of gene therapy and

779
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:33,420
some other stuff where you can, you know, biohack the system, it is very possible

780
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,420
that the next generation or two may be living to 150 years old.

781
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,780
Um, and, and, and that's still nothing.

782
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:44,380
Once you understand why, why people age, why animals age, right?

783
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,580
There's a genetic code that switches and all of a sudden, you know, the

784
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,260
system starts to eat itself.

785
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:54,180
But if you can turn that off and suppress that from occurring, then, you

786
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,660
know, who knows how long we could actually live.

787
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:57,900
True.

788
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,380
And I mean, that is the future.

789
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:04,660
But next question is a little bit more, um, in depth about the Pentagon.

790
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,180
Were you able to uncover the basic reason for the secrecy?

791
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,380
Now we all know that, that the Pentagon wants to protect the capabilities of

792
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,900
its sensors and all that stuff.

793
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,300
And they don't want to, you know, tell the Russians what, what the Raytheon radar

794
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,580
can do, you know, and things like that, which that's obviously national security

795
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,940
stuff, but they always say, you know, it's, it's not, it's not, it's the

796
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,220
instrument that's classified.

797
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,860
It's not the bird we photographed, you know, but in this case, that does

798
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,940
not seem to be the case.

799
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,740
The UAP seems to have some kind of classification of its own.

800
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,620
Am I, am I getting that right?

801
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,460
In other words?

802
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:45,140
So there is a UAP security classification guide.

803
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,980
Um, I'm not at liberty to discuss much of it.

804
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,700
Um, I was aware and, and familiar when it was being developed.

805
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:59,420
Um, there are very specific aspects of the UAP discussion that are indeed

806
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,900
classified, some of it is very classified.

807
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:07,660
Um, why they chose to classify certain aspects and not other aspects.

808
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,220
I couldn't answer that for you.

809
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:13,220
Um, I think some of it has to deal with sensitivities of the topic.

810
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,700
Look, the Dead Sea Scrolls, when they were first found, you know, how many years it

811
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:22,380
took before the translations were released to the public and do you know why that

812
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,860
they were kept secret for so long?

813
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,460
These are the Dead Sea Scrolls that they found in the, in the forties.

814
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,500
Yeah, absolutely.

815
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,540
Um, well, they were obviously worried that there were religious concerns.

816
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,340
Let's say that even though there really wasn't that much there, but

817
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,340
they were afraid that it would contradict the, at the time, the present understanding

818
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,420
of the Judeo-Christian belief system.

819
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,180
Um, that's not that uncommon.

820
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,860
We do things like that all the time to, to protect the American mindset

821
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,340
and other countries do it as well.

822
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,100
Now, is it right?

823
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:57,420
I don't think so, but that's not my decision.

824
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,380
Um, you know, there are, there, you don't want to, there were several studies that

825
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:06,020
were done in the past that the Pentagon and the intelligence community commissioned,

826
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:11,820
uh, through formal channels, think tanks, and they all came back unanimously saying

827
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,940
that if you, if you were honest to the American, with the American people about

828
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,340
this topic, it will cause great panic and pandemonium, you'll have runs on Wall

829
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,980
Street, people won't want to pay their bills anymore, and you're going to have

830
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,940
complete mass panic on your hands.

831
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,140
So the government decided not to have a conversation.

832
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,420
Um, you know, I tend to look at it the other way.

833
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,260
We're having the conversation now and guess what?

834
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,580
Everybody's still paying their mortgage.

835
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,100
Everybody's still paying their phone bill.

836
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,260
Everybody's still going to soccer practice and going to PTA.

837
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,860
So, um, I don't think those studies were accurate.

838
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:46,500
Now at the time, at the height of the Cold War, maybe, but we're not in the same

839
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,260
timetable anymore, or we're not in the same circumstance or in the same

840
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,460
situation that we were in.

841
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,260
And so I think we can have the conversation.

842
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:58,260
And I think America particularly can handle the truth and deserves

843
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,460
the truth about this topic.

844
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,820
Well, I think we're sufficiently conditioned by the pop culture and the

845
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,300
presence of UFOs on, you know, things like the History Channel and everything,

846
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,740
all that constantly, people know what it is.

847
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,940
You know, they know that it's a possibility.

848
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,100
Um, my last question for you is this.

849
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:18,900
Now, could there be an even more insidious reason for the secrecy?

850
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:24,020
In other words, if they have recovered technology from these, I can't imagine

851
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,580
they would hand that over to NASA.

852
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,260
They would want to know how it works so that we can use it, you know, and have a

853
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,660
leg up on, on, uh, you know, adversaries.

854
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:38,900
But even if we can't figure out how it works, keep it around and keep it secret

855
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,740
because maybe someday we will, although these things we tend to understand.

856
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:47,140
I understand, you know, you know what it is after you develop it yourself.

857
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:51,860
So not a lot of hope for, you know, back engineering, very advanced technology.

858
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,020
But is that the reason it's being kept secret?

859
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,060
And is it under like nuclear secrecy or something like that?

860
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:00,900
Well, um, you're not far off on the nuclear secrecy side.

861
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:06,820
Um, there are some, during the atomic, uh, regulatory committee time, they, they

862
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:12,660
had some very interesting policies, uh, that anything that gives off a certain

863
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,980
amount of radiation falls under those guidelines, period, full stop.

864
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,180
And then you have the U.S.

865
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,980
Espionage Act of, I think it's 1903 and some other, other laws on the books that

866
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,380
really were used to enforce secrecy about this topic.

867
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:30,980
Um, there are potentially more insidious reasons to keep this secret.

868
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:36,500
And it could be because of what we've done.

869
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:41,140
Uh, and I'll give you a case in point, you know, there were experiments with the

870
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,380
United States have done in the past.

871
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,620
And by the way, let me just make this clear.

872
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,460
I love my country.

873
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,180
I love my citizens.

874
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:51,420
I love my government, but we haven't always been honest brokers in the past.

875
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,700
People say, oh, our government doesn't lie to you, but lie to us.

876
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,660
Well, okay.

877
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:59,020
Unless you talk about, but they, I don't know, the Afghanistan withdrawal

878
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:02,340
and, uh, Iran contra and all the Pentagon papers, right?

879
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,660
Um, MKUltra, MKUltra syphilis experiments, right?

880
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,340
Where we allow human beings to die, die.

881
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,860
Think about that and allow syphilis to go through its natural progression

882
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,940
just so we could study it, right?

883
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,580
Even though we haven't cured at the time, um, we have done

884
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,300
a volatile things to each other.

885
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,940
Just, just look at the indigenous people here in this country and the way they've

886
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:31,100
been treated and the way the army started to, to basically conduct mass genocide

887
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,620
and get rid of all the buffaloes so they couldn't hunt and they were forced to,

888
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:41,300
to ultimately, um, force to their knees and then subjugate themselves to this

889
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,180
new government called the United States.

890
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,100
Um, you know, we can all look back in hindsight and say, well, you know,

891
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,260
we're all better off for it, but are we really?

892
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:54,420
And is it an excuse to treat people the way we have and keep things secret

893
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,940
only later on to find out what we did and go, yeah, sorry guys.

894
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,620
Well about that.

895
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,820
Maybe we shouldn't have done that.

896
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,180
Yeah, you're damn right.

897
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:02,980
We should have done that.

898
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:03,980
That was long.

899
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,980
And are we still doing things like that today?

900
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,220
Sad to say that we are.

901
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,820
And that's why this is why I do what I do.

902
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,340
Look, I'm a disclosure advocate, but not just for UAP.

903
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,660
People think, oh, you're the UFO guy.

904
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,100
Actually, I'm not the UFO guy.

905
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,100
Uh, I'm a disclosure guy.

906
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:25,580
Um, I've been part of some very interesting things that this country has

907
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,220
done in the past, some of it, not very good, some of it, very good,

908
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,580
some of it, not so good.

909
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:35,500
And the only way we, we stopped from ever making those mistakes again, is being

910
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,380
open and honest and, and being held accountable for those things.

911
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:45,260
And that is why I think this topic is just one example of many, why the

912
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:50,940
government needs to come open, come on about what, what, what we have known

913
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,380
all this time about UAP.

914
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,260
Now I'm not saying necessarily give up, you know, the crown jewels and say what

915
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:00,660
we've been able to exploit from this and reverse engineer from it, if anything

916
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,660
at all, but what I am saying is the mere fact that we're not alone in the

917
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,500
universe, you know, let's learn from the, the, the, the mistakes of the Catholic

918
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,540
church back in the days of Galileo.

919
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:14,820
You know, when he first proposed the idea of the heliocentric solar system and not

920
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,340
an earth centric solar system, it almost burned him at the stake.

921
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,820
They made him recant.

922
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:23,180
They even refused to look through the very telescope he had to prove his observations.

923
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:30,060
Now at the end of the day, did the, the truth about earth really hurt religion?

924
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,020
No, of course not.

925
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,740
What it did was just challenge our ideas at the time about religion, but it

926
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,340
never actually challenged religion.

927
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,020
And I think we're kind of in the same boat here.

928
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:46,660
I don't think this topic is going to hurt or threaten anything with our government.

929
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:52,820
Um, it may force us to recalibrate our thinking on some things, but I think,

930
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,860
I think we can handle that.

931
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,900
I think we're grown up enough.

932
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,500
And I think the new generation of people, the younger folks that are my

933
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,860
kids age, who are very responsible, very intelligent, they have what took me

934
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,260
having to go to a library, reading an encyclopedia, an encyclopedia that was

935
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,700
written 10 years before me even getting there is now all available on this

936
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,300
phone worldwide in any language in the world, instantly touch of a button.

937
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,380
Think about that for a minute.

938
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:23,180
We are, we are, we are smarter now than we have ever been before.

939
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:31,860
We have evolved more in the last 120 years than we have in the last 120,000 years.

940
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,460
So that's my, that's my take.

941
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,740
That's my perspective anyways.

942
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,180
I think, I think we can handle the truth.

943
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,780
And I think, I think we deserve the truth.

944
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,540
And we must always remain vigilant in this democracy.

945
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,820
You know, keep the country honest, keep the government honest, because

946
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,300
the government isn't the problem.

947
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,820
It's the people in the government.

948
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,860
That's right.

949
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,500
That's right.

950
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,700
Look, sometimes to be a patriot, you have to do things that don't always

951
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,660
necessarily seem patriotic at the time.

952
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,100
Absolutely.

953
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,460
But, um, I could not agree more.

954
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:04,580
Now everybody should check out Lou's book, uh, Eminence, which is absolutely

955
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:08,980
fascinating, but I got a special plug because I got the audio book version and

956
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:15,100
Lou actually read it and did a fine job, even better than, you know, a voiceover

957
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,500
artist could normally do.

958
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,580
So that was just very nicely done, Lou.

959
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,500
John, thank you.

960
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,220
I don't have the, uh, sexy, smooth voice, uh, like you do.

961
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,820
You have a natural voice for radio.

962
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:30,020
I have a voice that's more akin to a, a cement truck, uh, hurling down

963
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,740
a country road in high gear.

964
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:35,620
Uh, um, so unfortunately you had to endure that.

965
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,140
I apologize, but thank you for the compliment.

966
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,980
It suits, um, it's very heartfelt.

967
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:40,860
Oh, I enjoyed it.

968
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:45,300
It was very personable and really added a, uh, you know, a personal touch to

969
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,340
the story and it was very good book.

970
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,740
So everybody should check that out.

971
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,180
Luel Elizondo, thank you for joining us today.

972
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:56,300
It was a pleasure and I hope whatever happens, we, we eventually get an answer.
