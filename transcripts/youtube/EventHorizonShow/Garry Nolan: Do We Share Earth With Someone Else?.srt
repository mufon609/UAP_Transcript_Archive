1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
The UFO UAP phenomenon is about as murky as it gets.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:11,980
With over 70 years of reports regarding the matter we still haven't identified the unidentified.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,140
From the days of Donald Menzel in jail and Heineck to today, the picture of just what

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,680
exactly this represents is still unknown.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,280
But then comes the question of should we study it?

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,120
Should science take a look at it and see if actionable data can be obtained in the mystery

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,120
one way or another might be solved?

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,720
And apply rigorous scientific effort to finally determine what, if anything, it is?

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,800
This question has recently taken a somewhat dark turn.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,960
My guest today is studying two aspects of the phenomenon that might actually be fully

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,000
scientifically testable.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,300
And one aspect is disturbing.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,520
The first are recovered materials reportedly of UFO UAP origin.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,240
Some first studied by Dr Jacques VallÃ©e.

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:06,120
The second are reported injuries due to exposure to UFOs UAP that people have had.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,440
It's at that point that whatever this is becomes difficult to ignore and that some

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,320
kind of investigation in science is sorely needed.

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,400
You have fallen into Event Horizon with John Michael Godier.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:42,680
In today's episode, John is joined by Dr Gary Nolan.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,800
Dr Nolan is the Rachford and Carlota A. Harris Professor in the Department of Pathology at

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,520
Stanford University School of Medicine.

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,680
He has published over 300 research articles and is a holder of 40 US patents and has been

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,440
honoured as one of the top 25 inventors at Stanford University.

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:11,320
His area of research includes hematopiesis, cancer and leukemia, autoimmunity and inflammation,

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,800
and computational approaches for network and systems immunology.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,440
Dr Nolan's efforts are to enable a deeper understanding not only of normal immune function,

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,280
pathogen infection and other inflammatory events.

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
Remember to subscribe to Event Horizon so you never miss an episode.

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
Dr Gary Nolan, welcome to the program.

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,920
Thank you so much. I'm really happy to be here.

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,120
Now, doctor, you work in genetics and one of my interest areas is in abiogenesis.

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,640
How did we get life in the universe started?

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,440
From your point of view, do you think that abiogenesis is something that's very rare,

34
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,440
very hard, or do you think it's just repeatable organic chemistry that happens

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,240
throughout the universe?

36
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,200
Well, I can't see really a reason why it's not. I mean, if it can happen in one place,

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,640
I mean, that's already in a Bayesian inference mathematics viewpoint.

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,320
It's basically a prior. It basically proves that it can happen.

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,640
So the fact that it happened here with pieces of chemicals that we now find strewn throughout

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,840
the entire universe, at least in terms of mass spectrometry,

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,480
are the things that we where we can see things at a distance.

42
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,320
And in meteorites, the evidence is pretty clear that complex molecules are already there.

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,720
And so I have no problem with it.

44
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,200
I mean, there's plenty of evidence that basically lays a path for showing that,

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,320
if anything, what we are came from elsewhere.

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,800
In other words, building blocks of life are present and pervading the universe,

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,160
at least this galaxy.

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,600
Well, I can't see if there's anything special about this galaxy compared to the many others.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,560
No, but I think there's also, I mean, we can talk about it later as we get into the discussion,

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,080
but there's at least mathematical evidence that suggests that life might have actually

51
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,600
started elsewhere and came here.

52
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,520
And so it's a variation of Moore's law of complexity.

53
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,040
There's a Moore's law of, let's say, genomic or genetic complexity that,

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,280
if you extrapolate backwards, suggests even that the life here might have happened as many as 10,

55
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,200
started 10 billion years ago and traveled here, if you will, through some kind of panspermia.

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,280
Now that's older than the solar system.

57
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,240
So that means that life here could have origins in another star system itself, right?

58
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,400
Yeah. Well, I mean, all of the heavy metals, basically things above

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,360
mass of about 30 or 40 came from the heart of another star, right?

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,480
Of a star that exploded.

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,240
So you have to think across those kinds of timeframes that the heavier elements

62
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
were forged really in the heart of a dying star.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I think that's something right out of Thor, the Marvel comics.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,320
And so those elements had to partake in an explosion and then a recondensation

65
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,520
that ended up generating the metals around this star.

66
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,320
We're a second or a third generation solar system.

67
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,240
So by that premise alone, it came from probably hundreds, if not thousands of other solar systems.

68
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,880
And those are just the atoms that make up the elements in the materials that both we are and

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,760
that the civilization we created are made from.

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,040
Carl Sagan, we are made of star stuff.

71
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:32,720
Now, with this sort of idea of panspermia, actual life, say microbes, locked in a meteorite

72
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,640
deep inside of a meteorite, is there a limit on time and distance, in other words,

73
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,160
for something like that to transfer?

74
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,720
In other words, can a genetic code, an organism sit dormant inside of a meteorite for

75
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,880
millions of years that would be required for a transfer between?

76
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,520
Well, I think the short answer is we've already seen it for tens of thousands of years on certain

77
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,400
kinds of bacteria that have been resurrected out of icebergs, essentially, or deep under the

78
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,120
permafrost.

79
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,240
And I'm not sure about the exact numbers of how long it would take for something.

80
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,520
So let's say you had a planet that is in a solar system 10 or so light years away.

81
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,800
I mean, we could run the numbers.

82
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,320
I don't have the time.

83
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,600
We don't have the time to do it at the moment.

84
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:33,680
But if you had a meteorite crash on that planet that ejected a piece of something that ended up

85
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,800
in space from there, does it take a million years or just a few tens of thousands of years to get

86
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,360
from one place to another, even with conventional speeds?

87
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,400
I'm sure people have done the run the numbers, but I don't see it as impossible.

88
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
No, that's a fascinating idea.

89
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,840
And that stars sneeze on each other and could even sneeze life on each other.

90
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,040
Yeah, you know, it's just interesting because that seems to me that that would dramatically

91
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,720
increase the chances for life across the universe.

92
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,040
The question is, is that if you're related to it, even if you're two star systems away,

93
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,000
say the sun had a close encounter with another star in the past and they exchanged life,

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
is it really an alien?

95
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,640
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,200
Well, I mean, I think the more interesting question is, I mean, I think people have run

97
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,960
the numbers and it's certainly easy to understand that over even just a few million years,

98
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,000
you can spread things around the entire galaxy or even a group of galaxy.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,200
I think the primary or the principle point is, well, look, that means at the very least,

100
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:43,280
it's all based on DNA, which means there aren't necessarily alternative codes for how life

101
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,880
is generated other than DNA, unless there's something we're missing.

102
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,480
That's already here, even on this planet.

103
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,200
I just don't know.

104
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,280
That gets into a shadow biosphere.

105
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,880
If you don't know what you're looking for, you may not discover a second occurrence of

106
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,720
microbial life, even if it was here that you just might not know.

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you think we have any hope if such a thing exists, a shadow biosphere,

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,360
with current methods of studying microbes, do you think we could ever run across it

109
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,200
if there was a second abiogenesis on planet Earth?

110
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,920
Yes. Actually, although I don't mean to sound conspiratorial or anything,

111
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,120
there's someone that I'm working with who has at least pictorial evidence of such a thing.

112
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,560
That's fascinating.

113
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,480
But before I get all excited about it, I'm actually buying for the guy some

114
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,440
instruments that he can use to determine if it's actually real or not.

115
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,120
The picture evidence that I've seen is pretty compelling, so we'll see.

116
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,840
Whatever it is, it isn't standard, so it might just be a mistake on his part, but we'll see.

117
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,920
I mean, that's the reason why.

118
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,240
One of the reasons why I don't want to talk about it too deeply is because I don't like doing

119
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,320
science by news release, and I'm sure this person doesn't want the entire planet making fun of him

120
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,840
for something that might end up being a mistake, nor do I.

121
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,480
But I think it's fun that if the question and the evidence suggests that it's worth following up on,

122
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,840
what's a few thousand dollars to develop perhaps a better understanding of it?

123
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:24,080
Yeah, and it's a high reward proposition, because if you find a second abiogenesis of life on Earth,

124
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,760
then you're going to get a Nobel Prize or something along those lines.

125
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,720
Now, my question about that, though, a follow-up question would be,

126
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,960
if it ends up being a null result, would you still publish to let everybody know?

127
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,240
Yeah, because I think the reason why you do it is you publish it so that the next person coming

128
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,520
along doesn't make the same mistake.

129
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,200
That's what I was thinking, yeah, absolutely.

130
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,320
I mean, there's nothing wrong with saying, and you know, I did the same thing without a comma.

131
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,360
I did the same thing with the so-called star child skull, where people had interesting ideas.

132
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,200
It wasn't, let's say, out of this world to come to the conclusion that what you're looking at

133
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,440
might not be from this world, and so you just publish a science paper on it.

134
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,680
I mean, that doesn't mean that people weren't upset.

135
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,080
I can't help that, but as long as the results are repeatable, which they are,

136
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,600
then you just say it is.

137
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,240
I mean, the out-of-comma thing, I mean, look, Steven Greer wants to think that it is.

138
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,280
He's claimed all kinds of things about me, fraud and all kinds of stuff,

139
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,880
which we've got to watch what he's saying because he knows he's wrong.

140
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
But if he wants to say otherwise, prove it.

141
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,880
He claims that he didn't give me all of what it was that he had,

142
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,560
so he can go out and re-prove it and prove that I'm wrong.

143
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,760
I dare him.

144
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,800
Go ahead.

145
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,560
He won't because he knows that I'm right.

146
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,000
So, I mean, those are the kinds of things that if you're going to make a statement,

147
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
base it on evidence, not on your wishes.

148
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,480
Special pleading.

149
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,680
In other words, you come to a conclusion before you do all the work,

150
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,640
and you stick to that conclusion, and you just end up with a non-truth.

151
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,140
Right.

152
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,620
Now, in those cases of Starchild and the out-of-comma,

153
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,900
these were, to my view, birth defects, right?

154
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,500
In other words, they were genetically human and they were just in bad shape,

155
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,060
and you had these convergent birth defects that produced a very weird result.

156
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,060
Have you seen anything in the course of your career genetically,

157
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,060
whether it's a microbe or a piece of tissue or something like that,

158
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,860
that could have been of a non-normal life?

159
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,020
I mean, have you ever seen anything that this thing probably isn't from?

160
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,340
No, I have not seen anything.

161
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,980
I mean, probably the closest thing that's made its way to TV

162
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,420
that has any, let's say, public recognition

163
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,140
is the work of James Fox.

164
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,460
I don't know if I got the pronunciation right, the Virginia incident

165
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,980
in his recent movie, The Moment of Contact.

166
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,380
I mean, but that's not a piece of tissue or whatever.

167
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,740
That's somebody's drawing.

168
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,300
And so at this point, I mean, from the standards of what you would call evidence,

169
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,820
it's anecdote.

170
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,460
I mean, it happens to be the same anecdote from three individuals.

171
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,940
So that is more compelling.

172
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,780
In an incident that apparently was, in one way or another,

173
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,300
viewed by dozens, if not a couple of hundred individual people.

174
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,660
Is there evidence?

175
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,380
I don't know.

176
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,380
I've not seen it in person.

177
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,900
I'm not sure anybody would ever let me see it in person, even if it does exist.

178
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:38,900
But that's been the subject of thousands of conspiracy discussions.

179
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,140
So there's no reason for you to go there.

180
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,700
I mean, I think the point that you're raising, though, is the most important one,

181
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,260
which is there are different standards of evidence for different people

182
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,180
or different classes of individuals.

183
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,900
And one class is not above another.

184
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,740
For an individual who experienced it, the proof is more than enough.

185
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,180
They experienced it.

186
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,580
I saw things when I was a young boy that is proof enough for me as a person.

187
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,660
But proof for me as a scientist is the same as the language of science,

188
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,140
which is something which is I can hand that proof over to somebody else

189
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,980
or tell them to point their telescope or their microscope in the same direction,

190
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,700
and they will come to the same conclusion as I do.

191
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,260
And that usually involves a piece of evidence which is transferable.

192
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:36,660
And so at this point, there is no such thing that we can hand to another person publicly.

193
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,300
Now, there are claims that this stuff exists behind people's closed doors.

194
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,580
But again, that doesn't meet the standard of a scientist.

195
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:52,980
For the world at large who have neither experienced it nor have any evidence in their hands,

196
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,340
to the extent that they turn to scientists as the arbiters of some form of truth,

197
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,860
the truth is not out there yet for people.

198
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,420
And I think, though, that that's an important problem a lot of people don't understand,

199
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,220
is that those two standards of evidence are very distinct.

200
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,860
And if we want to place our trust in the global experience

201
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,060
that many people have seen such things, then fine.

202
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,060
Then the discussion is over.

203
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,300
But if we're going to do it by the standards of science, then the discussion is not over.

204
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,340
So it's up to individuals to decide,

205
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,060
do you want to go by the truth as would be sufficient in a court of law?

206
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,500
Or do you want to go by truth via science?

207
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,580
And I happen to live in both worlds.

208
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,620
And if I want to have this conversation with my scientist friends

209
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,140
who use just those second set of rules, then we still have work to do.

210
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,780
I think that from anecdote, you can sort of glean certain interesting things

211
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,140
that might lead you in the right direction to study it.

212
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,300
For example, with the Virginia incident,

213
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,980
there was a smell associated with whatever that was, and it seemed to be ammonia.

214
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,260
So that brings up the question, well, can ammonia be a solvent for life?

215
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,460
So in other words, can the chemistry of life exist in different chemical mediums like ammonia?

216
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,380
I mean, I don't see a reason why not.

217
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:27,700
I mean, it can be a form of life that prefers, let's say, not necessarily a salty ocean,

218
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,700
but a salty ocean that has ammonia in it, or is more ammonia based.

219
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:38,340
I mean, we know that there are microbes, for instance, that feed on hydrogen sulfide rather

220
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,340
and use hydrogen sulfide.

221
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:46,580
So maybe these, whatever those beings were in the Brazilian case,

222
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,860
whatever those things were, just preferred an environment

223
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,060
to have a little bit more ammonia and or hydrogen sulfide in it.

224
00:15:53,060 --> 00:16:01,460
I mean, I found that perhaps the most compellingly interesting of the evidence in that case,

225
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,780
that not only was there apparently liquid in the craft itself that spilled onto the

226
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,820
grass around the crash site, but that the beings, if you will,

227
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,340
seem to carry it with them or at least be imbued with it as if they were living in that environment.

228
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,140
And that was just fascinating to me.

229
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,940
And the soldier who is claimed to have died, alleged to have died,

230
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,620
because of his interaction with whatever it was,

231
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,980
they talk about that he died from an infection.

232
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,340
Actually, I think he died from not an infection,

233
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,020
but whatever the toxin was that was on the skin of the object that he touched.

234
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:47,300
And it was kind of a, there's a variety of different kinds of hyperimmune responses

235
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:54,420
that could be against whatever that toxin was in the oil of the skin of the of the claimed

236
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:01,300
and alleged, I keep using these words, being, and he died from that, not from an infection

237
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,860
or some combination of it that basically you get the skin opening, you know, across broad

238
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,300
swaths of your body because of the toxin and that just basically allows for infections to occur.

239
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,980
Now that's an aspect of this that I don't think has been well discussed publicly until recent

240
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:26,820
times is that whatever this is, whatever the phenomenon is, it has injured and killed people,

241
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:32,660
which immediately to my mind means that we should study it in science and try to figure out exactly

242
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:38,180
what happened. You've worked with some of these cases of people injured through encounters with

243
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,700
UAP. Can you elaborate on that a bit and tell us what, as a doctor, you thought happened?

244
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,420
So again, I'm trying to be, I'm trying to be careful because people have run with what I,

245
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,860
not that you're going to, but people will take this and run with it in a way that is

246
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:59,620
not my intent. But I don't think that there's at least very much obvious maliciousness in

247
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,220
whatever it is that's happened. I think this is kind of an inadvertent on the part of people

248
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,860
who supposedly got close to these craft, which were emanating a field. You know, it's as bad as

249
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,380
if you were to walk across the airfield at a military base and you get in the way of the

250
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,060
exhaust plume of a jet, you get hurt. It wasn't, the pilot wasn't trying to hurt you, but you were

251
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:31,220
just in the wrong place at the wrong time. And so in these cases, it is sort of a situation for

252
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,580
these individuals, if anything, and inadvertent getting too close to something. Now you would

253
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,220
think that if you've got a, on the other side of the equation or whatever it was that they were

254
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,620
getting too close to, that if this thing or the intelligences operating them were smart enough,

255
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,860
they'd know never to let any organic being get too close to them. So that basically tells you

256
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,980
perhaps something about whatever it is on the other side. There's sort of an inadvertent

257
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,700
indifference to our presence. So that kind of, to me, that tells you something even deeper about

258
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:12,500
the phenomenon in general, that this indifference is like, it tells you something about the difference

259
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:19,780
in the mentality of whatever the non-human intelligence might be versus us. That if it

260
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:26,740
doesn't necessarily care about us, then how do we reconcile that with other kinds of observations

261
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:33,060
where it's running around looking at our nuclear facilities? Or in other situations such as the

262
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:40,180
Zimbabwe Arial case, it's telling us that, oh, we're poisoning our planet. How do you reconcile

263
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:46,260
these? We care about the ecosystem, but we don't care about whether we hurt you in the process of

264
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:52,020
our doing whatever it is that we're doing. And I think that tells you something even deeper that,

265
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,060
and I had this conversation with Jacques Vallee once, is it one thing or is it many things?

266
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:03,220
And Jacques' answer to me was typically Valleean, which was, well, it could be one thing pretending

267
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,180
to be many things, right? That wants to send the message that it's many things, whereas it really

268
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:14,740
is only one thing. He thinks about it as this global system of influence, that it's a system

269
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:21,940
of systems, as he often calls it. And so that's sort of the meta behind the scenes. The individual

270
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:29,460
cases that I worked on through basically primarily was Kit Green, who brought most of the cases to

271
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:37,860
me. We now know that the majority of those cases can easily be explained by, well, explained

272
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,700
as Havana syndrome, Havana syndrome, however you want to pronounce it. That doesn't mean that we

273
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:50,980
understand the Havana syndrome, but at least they are seen as a kind of international,

274
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:59,140
interstate, I don't know what the right word is, some sort of spy versus spy event where basically

275
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:06,820
somebody, some human agency, either a state agency or a non-state agency or non-state actors,

276
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:15,060
are using some kind of conventional energy weapon to hurt diplomatic core of the United States.

277
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:22,660
So once we understood that, good 80 to 90% of the cases that I was involved with could be easily

278
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:28,500
classified under that and handed over to somebody else's providence. But it did leave a significant

279
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,700
number of cases of individuals who had clearly come in contact with something that was not

280
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,500
Havana and one could construe as being outside of the norm of human existence.

281
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:49,140
Now, the evidence was in those cases both anecdotal, it was a story from one or more individuals,

282
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:57,060
but it was also reproducible insofar as I could take the MRI the same number of times

283
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:03,620
from that individual and I'd get the same result. Now, the open question is, did it occur because

284
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,380
of the interaction that they had? Was it acute or was it something else? I don't know because I

285
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:15,620
don't have a camera to be there, but whatever did cause some of the damage in some of these individuals

286
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,860
was clearly an outside agency. It didn't just, they weren't born with it. It happened one day,

287
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,180
they were fine one day, they weren't fine the next. And they claimed that the only thing that

288
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:33,140
was unusual was this interaction that they had. So that's the kind of evidence that I can personally

289
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:40,660
work with to hand to another scientist and say, here's the evidence. You can agree with me that

290
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,780
the data is real. This is a big push that I have rather than believing the conclusion, believe that

291
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:51,780
the data is real. Believe the data is real. Now let's figure out what you tell me other than what

292
00:22:51,780 --> 00:23:00,020
they claim happened to them, what might have caused this. So I don't want to get into arguments

293
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:07,380
about the anecdote itself. I'm interested in the damage per se, or I'm interested in the material

294
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:14,100
that I can obtain from either that individual or something that might have been left at the site

295
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,780
where the event occurred. And I can analyze the material and so that I can hand. So those are the

296
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,620
kinds of cases that I get interested in because the others will be argued about endlessly. And

297
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,020
so it's just not in my interest to argue with people about

298
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:35,940
stories. There's historians that are like Richard Dolan, who are far better at documenting these

299
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:42,740
kinds of things and putting them in the various contexts. And if anything, putting them down for

300
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,780
posterity and writing them down as soon as they've happened as much as anybody can for other people

301
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,220
to argue about hundreds of years from now even. In regards to consistency between injuries,

302
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,860
look at a brain scan and you see the same thing in multiple patients. So my question is, does that

303
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:07,140
damage resemble anything else, any other type of injury, or is it unique? Is whatever is happening

304
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,340
to these people unique to this phenomenon? I mean, certainly the sclerosis that I've seen,

305
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:19,460
basically the burning at the skin level on the outside looks like some sort of radiation damage.

306
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,980
I mean, radiation is not magic. Radiation is anything from just electromagnetic waves to

307
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:31,860
light, right? Or you can aim beams of microwaves at people and hurt them. If there wasn't that

308
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,820
slightly see-through mesh on your microwave that is just the right size to prevent microwaves from

309
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,540
coming out of your device, you'd get cooked too all the way through. So there's nothing magic

310
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,820
about a microwave weapon. There's nothing magic about a gamma ray weapon. I mean, people use

311
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,740
radiation or other kinds of proton beams, et cetera, in cancer therapy. They're just more

312
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,940
finely targeted at the cancer. So there's no reason you can't turn any of those

313
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,900
into some kind of a weapon. Or if somehow they're a part of a propulsion device

314
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,980
that some civilization has figured out, if you get close enough to them, you're going to get

315
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:14,100
damaged. And wherever those radiations, if you will, are concentrated, the tissue will get more

316
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:20,340
or less scarred because of it. And that's at least the evidence that I saw on the MRIs.

317
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:30,500
So the damage was reproducible not within a given organ, in a specific place in that organ.

318
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:36,180
It was reproducible as to the type of damage, which is more or less a scarring, which is both

319
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:44,900
cell death, induced cell death, apoptosis or otherwise, and then infiltrating immune system

320
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:50,420
damage, where the immune system comes in and cleans up the mess, or in some cases,

321
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:56,900
as what I think is probably happened to that soldier in the Virginia case, it was basically

322
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:04,900
it's a toxic chemical of some sort that caused the immune system to act upon it

323
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:12,740
in an overwhelming case. Now let me ask you this, this is sort of an off the wall question, but

324
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:19,620
have you seen cases of these types of injuries in people that may not have known that they had even

325
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,220
come in contact with UFO or UAP? In other words, somebody's laying in bed sleeping, one flies over

326
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:30,260
the roof and you get the same injury. I haven't, none of them were ever brought to my attention,

327
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:37,460
but it's one of the reasons why, and I'm excited about this, that I know of a fair number of groups

328
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:44,260
now that are organizing around collecting that kind of data. One of the things that Chris Mellon

329
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:51,860
and Lou Elizondo and others have done, and we often leave Tom DeLong out of the conversation,

330
00:26:51,860 --> 00:27:00,100
but I think it's fair to say we wouldn't be here because of his efforts, is that people are now

331
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:07,300
more willing to step forward. I've had the number of emails that I've gotten from pure scientists,

332
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:13,780
doctors, psychiatrists, et cetera, who are now organizing behind the scenes to set up groups

333
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:19,940
to study this stuff in a more scientific manner, will I think let people who've had these kinds

334
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:26,500
of things happen to them come forward to be studied. I mean, you have to, science is always

335
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,580
a matter of collect everything that seems interesting, put it in a giant bucket,

336
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:36,100
and then start categorizing. So are there people who had something fly over their house or come

337
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,700
into their room or whatever, and then they had a damage and didn't even know what was happening to

338
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:47,220
them? Probably, but how do you find them? If they won't even in an anecdotal sense tag it with a

339
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,260
metadata that says this happened to me, it's just somebody who woke up one day and they had

340
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,660
damage and the doctors, no doctor would know what to do with it. It's just, okay, well,

341
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:02,900
you're damaged, I'm sorry. I can treat your damage, I can't treat the cause of your damage,

342
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,940
or I can't understand the cause of your damage. And that's sort of a big question because there's

343
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,420
a lot of that out there. I mean, you see Parkinson's patients and things like that, that

344
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,380
maybe there was some environmental factor in the past, their past that might have contributed to

345
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,260
developing the disease, but you can't know that, you just don't know what it was. Now in

346
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:27,940
regards to the physicality of the phenomenon, if it's producing electromagnetic radiation of

347
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:35,300
whatever sort, that suggests a physical object that can be measured. Yes, if the object is,

348
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,140
if somebody could ever get a hold of the object that's producing it, then yeah,

349
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,660
we can. Apart from the supposed crashes that have occurred, the alleged crashes that have occurred,

350
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:50,820
which we're, as far as we can tell, quickly absconded with by whoever the government might be.

351
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,260
There's very little one can do other than to say, well, they won't give it to us so we can't study

352
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,980
it. Well, that's the big problem is that there does seem to be some kind of a cover-up,

353
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:07,060
especially in regards to this, but I can also see why they would keep it completely secret if you

354
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,420
recover a piece of foreign alien technology. That gives you a huge advantage if you can figure out

355
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:18,980
how it works. I can and I can't. I think we're past the point at this point of whether or not

356
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:25,300
people will be able to accept it or not. I don't understand what the advantage can or cannot be

357
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:31,780
if they've had 90 years or 80 years to figure it out and they still haven't done so. What are

358
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:39,380
we worried about? Unless the technological advantage is so easy to make once you have it,

359
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,260
that putting it in anybody's hands would be dangerous. If we all had the ability to

360
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,140
blow up this corner of the continental shelf, then maybe that's a bad thing.

361
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,620
Just looking at it this way, if anti-gravity were so easy that anybody could have the ability to

362
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,180
travel out to the asteroid belt and push a rock our way, there's any of a number of crazies who

363
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:08,980
might go ahead and do it and cause bedlam. From that standpoint, maybe that's a simple reason

364
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:15,620
that you just don't want to give people free energy or the ability to run around and push rocks

365
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,860
this way and that until we have a defense mechanism that stops people from doing it.

366
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,740
And so if the defense mechanism is don't give them the ability to do it in the first place,

367
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,780
then that's where you got to go. And I would be perfectly understandable to that.

368
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:34,900
I think the thing that bothers me though about it is if I were a government and I had rivals,

369
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:41,060
as the US government does, it might be advantageous to spread disinformation so that your rivals

370
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,620
think you have superior alien technology, therefore don't mess with them.

371
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:52,500
Well, yeah, there's the faints within faints argument. And again, this goes down the crazy

372
00:30:52,500 --> 00:31:00,420
road where it's never-ending arguments. And so I'm just going to stay in my wheelhouse,

373
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:05,140
which is I'm going to stay as close to the street light on a dark night as I can with

374
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,820
a flashlight and kind of look out a little further, but I'm not going to worry too much

375
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,380
about the bugaboos that might be sitting just well outside of the light range.

376
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:20,660
And so if something comes into my hands that I can study and put the proof out, then we'll extend

377
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,460
our knowledge base a little bit further. I mean, look, if the government wants,

378
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,180
well, I think there's a different way to say it. I think that it would

379
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:36,900
behoove the governments in a different way to say, look, this actually does exist and it is

380
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,500
happening. Now let's come up with a framework for how to deal with the potential of what the

381
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:49,940
technologies can provide. So how do we not worry about what can be done with this information

382
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,300
and keep it secret because we're worried about that? And why don't we just say, well,

383
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:59,220
this is what can be done. And now let's come up with frameworks for how to deal with that

384
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,940
potential and protect ourselves against the danger of it. I mean, we all knew the danger

385
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:11,140
of nuclear weapons and we understood the value of using nuclear energy to produce energy for

386
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,340
civilization. And we went ahead, at least with the good side of it, even though we knew that the bad

387
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:23,060
side of it was that we would be potentially giving the ability for, let's say, certain rogue regimes

388
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:30,660
like North Korea, the ability to turn that into nuclear weapons. So as a society, I think that's

389
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:38,580
a conversation that should be had. And I'm actually working with now a number of individuals to

390
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,780
basically set up, let's say, organizations that can start to talk about this kind of thing in

391
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:49,300
a productive manner. Frankly, all in the absence of the kind of hard evidence that I think is

392
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,540
necessary to prove to scientists to say that, well, look, I don't have to wait for the hard

393
00:32:53,540 --> 00:33:00,820
evidence to say that if it exists, what could be done with it? And how do we protect ourselves from

394
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:08,100
the dangers of economic disruption or societal disruption? What are the more academic discussions

395
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:14,740
that could be had around this, the solutions? Because I don't want to spend my time under the

396
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:21,220
covers or in the closet hiding from a potential danger. I always like to say that, okay, well,

397
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:28,100
there's a potential utility for humanity here. Let's have that discussion. And I think the

398
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:35,060
perfect example of this is the Alcubierre Drive, which is, I think, one of the first public

399
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:41,460
discussions of something that Hal Puthoff had long ago postulated, that there's a way to rework

400
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:49,300
Einstein's equations to invert basically them that allows you to say, hey, look, we could travel

401
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:57,380
faster than light. And this is now because somebody dared to say, well, maybe you can travel faster

402
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,900
than light, and maybe that's how it is that these things got here in the first place. That now is a

403
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:09,700
whole sub industry in standard physics to say, okay, well, let's see if this is practical in any

404
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,580
way. And so the first equations around the Alcubierre Drive basically said you had to

405
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:20,980
convert the entire rest mass of the sun into energy to be able to create the negative energy

406
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:27,300
to get to move faster than light. And then people have come up with various other ways to look at

407
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:33,140
the equations and have brought those energy levels down by orders of magnitude. Maybe someday people

408
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:38,420
will get it far enough down that they'll be able to do it properly. So that I see as a positive way

409
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:46,980
to look at these observations, and even as a thought experiment, come up with potential

410
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:53,300
positive utilities. But now, if you can gain access to that kind of energy, as a for instance,

411
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,660
well, why would you use it necessarily to go to the next star? Why don't we use it to reduce

412
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:05,860
energy costs and get ourselves off of oil and solve a lot of other problems thereby? So I always try

413
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:12,420
to look at the practical positive side of things, if only because it can get you out of the doom

414
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:19,300
scrolling effect and the depression that could come from only thinking of the negatives. It doesn't

415
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,860
mean you ignore the negatives, but it also means you don't focus on them, at least in my mind.

416
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,260
I actually interviewed Dr. Miguel Alcubierre on this channel. For anybody interested, you should

417
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,940
go and check out the backlog. But let me ask you this, without FTL, say that we can't do it,

418
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:40,180
and that the rule of the speed of light holds true and fast. So there is a physical way for

419
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:45,300
an alien civilization to have a presence here without FTL, and that is the von Neumann probe.

420
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,180
In other words, somebody, some star passed close by, or somebody decided to colonize the galaxy

421
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:56,020
with exponentially reproducing probes that could function as 3D printers and print out atmospheric

422
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:01,220
probes and star systems with interesting planets like Earth, and have a presence here. Because if

423
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:07,300
somebody saw that printed out probe, there's your UFO of alien origin. Now let me ask you this,

424
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:13,620
and it's a complex question. Could such a thing, and will there come a time where we can print out

425
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:19,300
an organism? Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's funny you say that. I can't talk about it publicly

426
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,740
yet, but I'm involved in a project that will make itself known for basically doing exactly that.

427
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,380
We can do it. I mean, it's primitive right now, but there's no reason we can't make our own

428
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:35,540
self-replicating probes even just to explore the local solar system. I mean, why not make something

429
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:43,860
that we send out to the Oort cloud, right, or to the asteroid belt that starts building things for

430
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,780
us so that we don't have to go there and build it. It's just, it's ready to go. People have talked

431
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,420
about that on Mars. There's absolutely no reason, both from a mechanical point of view, but also

432
00:36:52,980 --> 00:37:00,260
there's no reason we can't encode within synthetically created organisms the ability

433
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:06,580
to terraform or build an ecosystem for us elsewhere. So that, you know, and these have been

434
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:14,900
both the piece of science fiction stories and science fiction movies that we do exactly that.

435
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,260
I mean, science fiction doesn't mean fantasy that can't exist. Usually science fiction,

436
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:26,740
the best science fiction is written with enough of a kernel of truth that people can believe it is

437
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:31,220
that it's possible that it would happen. So, you know, I think we're well within the capability

438
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:36,500
of beginning that today. So say we do that, that opens up the possibility of colonizing space

439
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:42,500
with altered humans, humans genetically tailored to better live in an O'Neill cylinder or on Mars

440
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:48,500
or something like that. And that we won't actually, as natural humans, we won't actually be the ones

441
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:55,860
that explore space all that much. It'll be humans tailored genetically for the task. Do you see that

442
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:03,700
in the future and how far off are we? I think we're, I mean, I think we're closer in one sense

443
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:10,100
than we expect, but further away in another. And I'll elaborate. I mean, closer than that,

444
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,540
we can do it, but we're going to make lots of mistakes in the process. I mean, so just

445
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:21,380
look, for instance, at how intimately tied humans are to our environment. We're finding

446
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:27,140
day by day, literally week by week in science journals being published about how intimately

447
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:33,860
tied we are to our microbiota in our bodies. Microbiota affect your health, your response

448
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:40,180
to drugs, you know, whether or not you're going to respond better or not to cancer immunotherapy.

449
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,620
We find out that certain microbiota affect your mental health and can either make you

450
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:50,500
more or less likely to be depressed. Not that you were genetically born one way or the other,

451
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:57,620
but the microbiota create some sort of toxins or other things in your body that are or are not

452
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:04,500
necessary for your health. So creating a human that lives in a certain environment

453
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:13,700
is also, we also have to create the microbiota environment that that human requires that might

454
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:19,140
not necessarily like living in that other place. You've got to not only engineer the person, you've

455
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:26,340
got to engineer the ecosystem that lives on and within that individual so that it also can provide

456
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:33,700
the necessary context for the human to live a healthy life. We're so used to as scientists

457
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:40,580
thinking we can take the human out of the environment, the water in which they live

458
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,780
and just place them somewhere else and they'll be just fine. They won't. And we know that now.

459
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,180
And that's a fact. And so, I mean, just look at what's happened to the astronauts we've

460
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:55,940
put into low-grav space. I mean, they have all kinds of problems with water differential

461
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,220
across their bodies that give them sight problems, right? They can't see well, they,

462
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:06,820
et cetera, et cetera. Now, if they had been born in space and grew up in space, would they be okay?

463
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:13,060
I don't know. But there's enough worries in what we already know now about what we need to bring

464
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:18,260
with us to wherever we're going that we might have to engineer that alongside the humans.

465
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:23,860
And I just don't, we're not there yet. We're just not there. So I think we just have to be

466
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:29,060
a little bit careful about how fast we move. But I say that and I think humans will do it.

467
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,020
They'll make the mistake. And then they'll say, okay, well, before we take another step,

468
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:41,940
we better do X, Y, and Z to recontext and engineer our ecosystem at the same time.

469
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,580
But we're just not there yet, in my opinion. Now, do you think that developing this sort of

470
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:52,820
stuff will come as a natural result of medical science? Meaning that, okay, so we're trying to

471
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:58,500
cure various forms of cancer and we come across this idea that might be applicable to space.

472
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,700
Do you think that's how that's going to unfold?

473
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,820
Oh, yeah. I mean, and I think artificial intelligence is going to help us. I mean,

474
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:10,500
I was at a couple of meetings this week for the cancer work that I do, and these kind of cancer

475
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,460
moonshot programs where there are a lot of other called mainstream scientists, but leading edge

476
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:23,060
thinkers talking about exactly this, that frankly, the human brain is not built to deal with the

477
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:31,460
complexity of how the human brain even was or is constructed and how the ecosystems in the bodies

478
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:39,140
all operate. But the good thing is that AI is coming to the table to help us, to help us

479
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:47,700
understand these things. So I think the difference is, can we use the AI in a way that we understand

480
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:54,740
how the AI is doing it, or will the AI just be there to implement our wishes even if we don't

481
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,620
understand how it is that it's doing it? Does that make sense?

482
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,420
It does.

483
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:04,900
So, I mean, just look at AI art as an example. You can now just basically say, you can type in

484
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:11,780
a prompt as to what it is that you want and the AI goes out and it uses the data from the pictures

485
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,620
on the internet and it can create a picture that represents in some way the words that

486
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:22,500
you've stated. I mean, it's just remarkable. Artists are going crazy, both positive and

487
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,860
negatively about it. As you can imagine, people are seeing their careers potentially destroyed, but

488
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:32,420
the better ones are looking at it and saying, well, how can I use this as a tool in my palette,

489
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:39,140
as a brush in my palette? And I think the same thing is coming for exactly the question you asked

490
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:47,860
about medical interventions. Can I collect enough data that an AI can make the associations

491
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:53,540
and not understand from a sentient point of view, but can say, hey, look, if you define for me the

492
00:42:53,540 --> 00:43:01,460
objective, I can look at the raw data and how the systems are currently organized and suggest to you

493
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:07,700
how to reorganize them to create the following objective. I think that's coming. So I don't think

494
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:17,060
humans will understand how to do it, but we will create the tools that will enable us to do it.

495
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:24,500
Now that opens up a whole other series of ethical questions of, well, if you could do it,

496
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:32,820
do you have the right to make the mistakes on behalf of the people you're going to be

497
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:38,900
synthetically creating, if you will, to, you know, are you doing something to them

498
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,380
that you don't have the right to do? It's sort of the same situation in the same boat as cloning.

499
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:53,140
Do you have the right to, you know? And that case in China where actually it was another Stanford

500
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:59,700
scientist who I know, and it wasn't his fault that his former postdoc went ahead and did it,

501
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,020
but because he was in communication with the guy at the time he was doing it,

502
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,900
people tried to blame him. It wasn't his fault, but this guy in China claimed to have done it

503
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:17,700
and inserted a gene in an individual, and it was a worldwide controversy. And he was

504
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,700
not the Stanford scientist. Again, he didn't do anything wrong, in my view.

505
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:28,340
He just had a conversation with the person. It was the other person who made a choice for a child

506
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:34,020
that that child didn't partake in. I think there's a lot. I'm not saying one shooter

507
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,300
shouldn't do it. It's just you better know what the benefits, the ups and downs are before you

508
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:44,820
try. But the other point is that once you start down that path and you open the door,

509
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:55,300
the positive attributes of what can happen will be lost amongst the few Frankensteinian mistakes

510
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,500
that will get made. Yes, Frankenstein, and we live in a world where that's going to become

511
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:06,020
an increasingly relevant story, despite it being over 200 years old at this point. Now, another

512
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:13,220
aspect of this, you mentioned AI and working with AI. Does AI scare you in the sense that could it

513
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:20,580
be, could it be, and this is getting back into the work of Jacques Vallee, that the Kabuki theater,

514
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:25,060
as he terms it, are masks of the same phenomenon appearing in different ways?

515
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:33,140
Do you think ultimately it could be an alien AI, again, the von Neumann probe, an alien AI that

516
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:39,140
we simply don't comprehend it because its motives and thoughts and thinking process are so different?

517
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:44,820
Have you ever seen anything in AI that led you to believe that maybe AI will think differently?

518
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,940
Oh, yeah. I mean, so first of all, I mean, I've said this both in the Lennox Friedman interview

519
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:55,780
and also at length in the interview I did with Tucker Carlson, is that what intelligence in its

520
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:05,940
right mind, to the extent, would put itself in danger of interaction with a primitive civilization

521
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:11,300
like us, relatively speaking. I mean, we're primitive. I mean, we're not only barely out

522
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:17,620
of the caves, we're close to putting ourselves back in them, you know, from some kind of global

523
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:25,380
catastrophe mistake that we initiate. So why would you put yourself at danger of interaction?

524
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:32,260
Why wouldn't you put some kind of avatar in between yourself and, as I've often called us,

525
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:41,060
the angry monkeys? And so you wouldn't in your right mind. And so I think that I'm 100% sure

526
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:48,500
that even in the case of the Virginia event that whatever that was is some kind of avatar and it

527
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:57,540
wasn't actually the object that it wasn't actually, it was a thinking, perhaps conscious object,

528
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:04,340
but it isn't what's actually behind the scenes. That's just a guess. I have no proof. I don't get

529
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:11,540
a weekly email from the Illuminati that tell me these things. I'm not an insider in any grand

530
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:18,500
sense of the word. It just, right now, it makes sense with the data. It's a possibility. New data

531
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:25,140
will maybe change my mind on it. But I have, in fact, if anything, it's the most likely that

532
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:30,660
there is some kind of artificial intelligence that is driving everything we're seeing. Whether or not

533
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:36,260
it could get here by light speed or not, or better than light. Why would you bother

534
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:42,980
dealing with something as primitive as us? Well, I can think of one way is that the life in the

535
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:48,500
galaxy is semi-rare and they have a motive to preserve it whenever they can. In other words,

536
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,820
they see another occurrence of life and they come here as scientists and they're like, well,

537
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,580
we got to keep this species going. Oh, yeah. In which case? I have no problem with that,

538
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:02,100
but I just wouldn't myself step into the middle of it. But maybe you would. I don't know. I mean,

539
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:09,060
we send scientists out to nature preserves and they personally get involved. So maybe

540
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,820
that's what we're seeing here. It could be. I mean, we have specialist scientists that can

541
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:18,020
tell you everything you want to know about ants. So maybe they're specialists, anthropologists,

542
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,180
or something like that, or an alien equivalent of an anthropologist that's just here to study us,

543
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:27,140
but also perhaps act as a police force. You can sit on your porch, you can sit on your porch

544
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:35,060
for a day and you can see two, three, four or five police cars pass by. They never stop

545
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:40,420
unless you're actually doing something illegal. So maybe it's a police action scenario where

546
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,660
they're looking at our nukes and things like that. And they're like, we're only going to intervene

547
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:50,420
if they start to use these things, you know. Yeah. I mean, I've used that example of that,

548
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:57,060
you know, maybe they didn't bother with us too much because throwing rocks and spears at them

549
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:02,980
can be easily dealt with. But a nuclear explosion is enough that it might that their ships are not

550
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:09,380
nuclear explosion proof and that we've gotten to a level of sophistication where we can harm them.

551
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:15,620
And if we're about ready to even move out into our own solar system, even by conventional

552
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,820
sublight means, and if they've been around for millions of years, they can say, okay,

553
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:26,740
well, we can project ahead 10,000 years and see them at Alpha Centauri or Tau Ceti or

554
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:31,860
you name it in the near future. And the bigger they get, the harder it is for us to

555
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,420
turn them in a different direction without a global eradication event.

556
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,100
Well, that gives you, that gives you a motive ultimately though for them to be here is to

557
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:45,380
monitor, to make sure we don't create a technology such as a generalized artificial intelligence or

558
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:51,140
grey goo or whatever, what have you. And that could pose a threat to the rest of the galaxy.

559
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,140
And that's their sole purpose to be here is just to make sure we don't make something that can

560
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:01,460
mess their day up. Right. There's a great science fiction writer by the name of Ian Banks and he

561
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:09,620
writes some beautiful stuff. It's a fantasy future hundreds of thousands of years into our future

562
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:16,740
where he touches upon this, where basically it is an AI sentience, which considers that humanity

563
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:22,980
created, but it basically has created a kindergarten for humanity so that they can run around and

564
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:30,580
continue to pursue their more carnal pleasures, if you will. And it's busy monitoring and keeping

565
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:34,980
the whole galaxy in balance. So yeah, you're right. Maybe it's something like that.

566
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,460
I would just recommend anybody who wants to read a good series of books, Ian Banks does it in a very

567
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,420
tongue in cheek and intelligent way. Excellent books. I've read several. Now.

568
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:51,380
Attention. There will be a general meeting in one half hour.

569
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:59,700
Materials. Now there are these reports from Jacques Follet and others, Linda Moulton Howe

570
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:05,940
and To the Stars Academy, all of these about recovered materials that might be strange,

571
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:10,100
isotopically strange. And you have worked with such materials,

572
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:16,420
giving me a profile of what these UAP UFO related materials are like.

573
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:23,380
So I've worked with three materials that I find interesting, three, let's say three classes.

574
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:28,180
I mean, one of the most interesting was the Ubatuba event again in Brazil with something

575
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:34,020
which was at the time claimed to be pure magnesium. It's not pure magnesium, but it has more,

576
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:41,460
but it is unusually pure and a kind of a crystalline metal. And what I found interesting

577
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:47,220
about it was that in one of the fragments that I had, but not all of them, which is

578
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:55,380
really what kind of makes my head spin was the magnesium isotope ratios were so far off

579
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:02,340
what you would expect from magnesium you dig out of the ground that to basically say it was

580
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:07,140
engineered, right? You can imagine maybe it came from another solar system somewhere else, but

581
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:14,580
you'd have to imagine a solar nucleosynthesis cycle that is off of what we consider to be normal.

582
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:21,860
To me, at the very least, it would say it was engineered, right? And the fact that I have

583
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:29,300
materials supposedly from the same event, some of which has normal ratios versus some that has

584
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:36,580
altered ratios, I can come up with ways to explain it, but the only explanations

585
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:43,460
are that it was involved in some industrial process that produced the altered ratios from

586
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:49,540
Earth normal ratios, if that makes sense. So let's say it was used for energy generation

587
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:56,180
or the propulsion. They start with material that was used on Earth and in the process of using it,

588
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:03,300
it got converted to these other ratios. How it happens? I don't know, but the only evidence

589
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:09,540
I have is that it truly exists. And so, but I don't understand what it means. And is it

590
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:17,300
proof of aliens? Is it proof that something unusual happened? Yes. Is it reproducible? Yes.

591
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:24,820
So again, it's back to that thing of data, not conclusions, because there's so many potential

592
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,900
conclusions. If you leap to any one of them and you're proven to be wrong in any one of those

593
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:34,500
absolute conclusions, you just made a fool of yourself. So, but I think the problem that a

594
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:40,260
lot of, and this is just to go again off on a slightly different bent, is that a lot of

595
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:48,500
lay public or the skeptics who want to bring down any discussion of this is they will take any

596
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:53,700
postulate or hypothesis you make, they'll turn it into a conclusion and they'll ridicule you

597
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,660
for even coming up with the question in the first place, as if you had made the conclusion

598
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:05,140
that is embedded in your question. And so that's why I'm always trying to be very careful how I say

599
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:08,500
things. I mean, people are going to take me out of context no matter what, because that's their

600
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:15,620
goal in life. Jason Colavito is probably the most ridiculous at it, loves to take things that people

601
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:22,900
say and then, and recontext them and make fun of them. It's just, it's intellectual vandalism

602
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:28,340
of the highest order. So I don't want to really give people like that too much meat for their

603
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:35,140
grinder. But I think the main point is that you can, that's one of those kinds of materials,

604
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:41,380
which has some very interesting stories around it. Then the other one are these events that I've got

605
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:52,340
a few examples of now, of where a craft is seen and something is ejected from the craft. And when

606
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,980
people kind of go and find what it was that it was ejected, it ends up being like pools of

607
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:03,460
molten metal on the ground. And I've got three cases of this and there's many cases like this

608
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:10,980
that are out there. So that's a class of events that, okay, well, let's study what that metal is.

609
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:19,620
Okay, so now you can say, well, is that another example of a propulsion system or an energy

610
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:26,340
generation or God knows what? I mean, those are the only two simple things. I mean, for all we know,

611
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:35,060
it's how they process their waste matter. I don't know, but we can look at that stuff.

612
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:40,500
And we published Jacques and I and a couple of others, actually a former post-doc of mine

613
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,140
now at Harvard. He has his own lab now in Harvard Medical School. We published a paper

614
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:52,340
examining one of those materials where we basically showed that the material is,

615
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:56,660
I mean, it's conventional metals. There was nothing unusual about the isotope ratios,

616
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:02,500
but each place where we looked in the metal, the elements that were there were slightly different.

617
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:07,540
And they were all the same metals, but they were there in different ratios, meaning it was

618
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:14,180
inhomogeneous, meaning that six different elements, metals, titanium, iron, a couple of others,

619
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:22,820
chromium, were there, but they were incompletely mixed. Okay, so what conventional process do

620
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:29,140
humans ever use that don't fully mix what it is that they're making? Very few. I mean,

621
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:34,980
we don't make inhomogeneous things because that would end up being, from a tensile strength

622
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:40,100
point of view, it would basically mean something would fracture in unexpected ways if you were

623
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,900
trying to use it for any structural purposes. So let's make the leap of assumption that it

624
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:52,020
came from some kind of craft. What industrial process would they use that would lead to something

625
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:57,780
which was inhomogeneous? And maybe the very fact that it was inhomogeneous, whatever the process

626
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:02,980
was that they were using, led them to say, oh, we got to get rid of this. It's not doing what we

627
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:09,060
want it to do. Let's throw it away. Defective or waste, essentially. Defective or waste. And

628
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:15,620
what's interesting is a couple of the cases that I know of, the objects that were seen ejecting

629
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:22,260
these materials seemed to be in some kind of distress. They were wobbling or they weren't

630
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,340
acting. I don't know how these, I don't know how you could say how these things act normally.

631
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:33,540
They weren't acting, at least to the recipient, they seemed to be something wrong with them.

632
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:38,820
They eject this stuff, and now everything's better, and they zip off. Is that telling us

633
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:45,860
something? Were they doing it for us to tell us something? You know, you got to play those kinds

634
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:53,540
of those games. So I mean, Jacques Valet tells me a story of an intelligence officer that was talking

635
00:57:53,540 --> 00:58:01,380
to him at one point in the, that look, when a scientist gets 95% of the answer, they think

636
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:06,980
they've got the answer, and they don't care about the other 5%. When an intelligence agency,

637
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:12,020
meaning like a government intelligence agency, gets 95% of the answer, they assume that it's

638
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:17,940
been given to us to distract us. We're interested in the, we're way more interested in the 5% that

639
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:25,620
we don't know. So I worry that many of the things that we see and we think we're observing these

640
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:32,340
objectively are actually being, again, from the Kabuki Theater's point of view, are actually being

641
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:37,860
presented to us to lead us to think a certain way about something. And so I'm just trying to be

642
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:42,980
careful what my assumptions are about the data that we're collecting in the first place. And I

643
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:51,700
think you have to be. I mean, I do that every day in the day job, in that I get data, and I'm assuming

644
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:56,580
I'm collecting the data that I think I'm collecting, but it might be that the manner in

645
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:03,540
which I'm collecting it is biasing the answer in the first place. And so when you're trained

646
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:08,740
properly in the sciences, you always keep that in the back of your mind, that I might have been

647
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:14,580
biased in how I'm collecting this data. So anyway, so that's the second one. So the second class

648
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:19,860
of materials are these supposed ejecta. I mean, it's clear these things are not meteorites and

649
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:26,900
they're not. There's plenty of stuff that I've been given that is clearly a hoax or was hoaxed

650
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,340
for the individuals thought they were seeing something. But this is, as far as we can tell,

651
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:36,980
not hoaxes. And then the third one that has been talked about quite a bit are these so-called

652
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:44,340
metamaterial that originally came, I think, into Linda Moulton Howe's possession, but also the

653
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:52,500
possession of other individuals, this layered magnesium bismuth material, parts, parts, yeah,

654
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:58,580
which, you know, is still intriguing. And I have several examples of it myself that have come to

655
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:04,420
me. It's been broken up to many pieces, was handed to X, Y, or Z. And then people have handed them

656
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:11,700
to me. I know that there is a very large chunk of it that is currently in government possession

657
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:22,900
through TTSA. And the analyses that I have seen of the material, even done by the government,

658
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:30,500
leave much to be desired. I'm frankly shocked at how amateurish the data analysis has been.

659
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:35,620
And it's sad because if that's the kind of analysis that's been done on the real parts

660
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:43,940
that people have, somebody needs to up their game. And at least the data that I've seen has

661
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:51,860
not been done by somebody who really knows what they're doing. So what I'm doing with the pieces

662
01:00:51,860 --> 01:01:00,340
that I have is setting up basically a laboratory with the right kind of funding that can go from

663
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:06,180
A to Z, comparing these things with all of the necessary tools, that everything is put through

664
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:14,740
pretty much the same path of analysis. So that you can do an apples to apples, apples to oranges

665
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:21,460
comparison, and just do it right. I mean, it's not hard, but it is expensive. I mean,

666
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:26,820
to set up a laboratory like this with all of the necessary materials, I mean, these instruments

667
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:32,340
cost anywhere from a few hundred thousand to a few million. But there's a few dozen of these

668
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:37,700
kinds of instruments that you need. So just from an instrument's basis, you're talking about a $50

669
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:43,300
to $100 million investment. Now, luckily, there are forensic laboratories that exist which have

670
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:48,740
this kind of stuff, right, that you can pay for. So at the beginning, at the very least, the money

671
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:56,660
is required to put all of these materials through such an analytic pipeline that you can essentially

672
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:03,860
buy off the shelf, the services to do that. But buying the services and creating the data is not

673
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:11,620
the same as analyzing the data. So now you need basically a reasonable team of five to 10

674
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:19,940
postdoctoral level individuals who understand what that data can mean. And so five to 10 people,

675
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:27,140
we call them an FTE, full-time equivalent. That's $200,000 each on average. That's the number we use

676
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:33,860
in Silicon Valley for basically hiring that kind of training in various areas. So five to 10 people

677
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:39,540
has another two million a year. So even just to analyze the data that might take a couple of

678
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:45,380
million to generate, it's expensive. People say, oh, let's just do it. And then they send me stuff.

679
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:50,820
Just writing that paper on the Council Bluffs material that Jacques had took me two years

680
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:55,460
because I was doing it in my spare time. And I even said I have renewed appreciation for

681
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:01,860
my postdocs and the time and effort that they do. When I change my mind on what it is that I want

682
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:08,260
analyzed, I can do that in five seconds. But then I'm basically committing that postdoc

683
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:16,180
to several days of work to reanalyze the data. So until someone is willing to put down the money

684
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:20,500
in sort of a charitable sense, or the government is willing to say, I'm going to put this together

685
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:27,940
in a way, put the money to it. I mean, in the global sense of a now $850 billion defense budget

686
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:34,820
per year for the US alone, peanuts to do it. I'm not convinced it's been done with the materials

687
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:40,740
that are sitting in people's warehouses. Maybe they don't feel that they need to.

688
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:49,220
But I think if one of the things that I basically helped get put into the defense appropriations

689
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:58,180
budget around this matter, its public record, is getting scientists, getting the DOD to admit

690
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:03,940
that scientists should be brought in to at the very least help them design the analytic systems

691
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:12,020
that are there. Because, you know, it does take a particular training to design a good experiment

692
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:18,820
that is publishable and believable by other scientists. Anyway, so those are the things

693
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:26,740
that I think so the the arts parts, I have looked at it, it is unusual, for sure. It is irregular

694
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:34,740
enough in the in how it was put together that I can still believe that it might be just the process

695
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:39,460
of some conventional smelting. And it has nothing to do with anything unusual. I can believe that

696
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,900
because of the irregularity of at least the pieces that some of the pieces that I've seen.

697
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:47,780
But then it was told to me that, well, this happened in a crash. That's why it looks so

698
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:52,740
irregular. It was kind of melted. That's why it's irregular. Okay, that's fine. You know,

699
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:59,060
is it a wave guide is how put off puts forward. I mean, whether it is or not, the fact that is

700
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:04,820
layered in that way, makes you think that it could be. So I have no problem with Hal's postulate there.

701
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:14,260
But I did reproduce a minor discrepancy that somebody else noted in the magnesium ratios.

702
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:22,420
And the magnesium ratios do appear to be off. Now, there are potential conventional reasons why I

703
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:28,660
can think the magnesium ratio is off because they're off so slightly as to be not an error

704
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:35,700
of measurement, but an error of how the thing can be measured. And so I so there's there's a couple

705
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:40,420
of irregularities about the arts parts that I think are interesting, can be followed up on.

706
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:48,100
But the level of analysis that has been done is insufficient at this point to come to any

707
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:54,100
real conclusion. I mean, there's two things in science. I can analyze something and tell you

708
01:05:54,100 --> 01:06:00,580
what it what it is from a material scientist made of these atoms in this organization.

709
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:07,300
But, okay, that's fine. What's it used for? Now, if somebody can do something to arts parts and

710
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:13,140
make it float on the table, and it floats on the table on the table because you irradiated it with

711
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:18,180
some kind of terahertz wave, and suddenly it weighs less or what have you. Well, fine,

712
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:23,460
that'll convince me far more than a theory. But I haven't seen any of that done.

713
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:28,660
Neither have I after it's heard claims, but I have not seen floating metal. The ubatuba

714
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:32,660
Sorry, that was a long discussion about it. I hope that was clear.

715
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:37,620
That was perfectly clear. Now, the ubatuba sample that happened that incident happened

716
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:41,220
decades ago. And I guess the sample is provenance all the way back to that.

717
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:47,780
Were we capable of duplicating that in those days? And how much would it have cost to hoax it?

718
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:53,460
It would have. I mean, yes, we were capable to hoax it would have probably been in the

719
01:06:53,460 --> 01:07:01,140
hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. And why you would do it over a beach in, you know,

720
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:10,100
Brazil. I can't fathom. It's I mean, so the short answer is yes, you could do it. But there's no,

721
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:16,740
there's no physical reason why you would do it because we don't play with isotope ratios,

722
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:22,660
except to blow stuff up. Medical science and blowing stuff up is the only reason to do it.

723
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:28,100
And that's all very, very expensive stuff. That's a very expensive thing to go throwing around and

724
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:35,620
blowing up over a beach in Brazil. So I mean, and that's the primary thing is that if we don't have

725
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:41,220
a reason for doing it, why would you do it just to convince somebody 40 years in the future who's

726
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:46,100
going to analyze it? It doesn't make any sense. But then again, there's a certain irrationality

727
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:50,980
about this whole thing about the behavior of these things. So you just don't know maybe they're

728
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:55,460
trying to influence us culturally. And that's the only way they know how is they can't exactly

729
01:07:56,020 --> 01:08:00,900
land on the White House lawn and shake hands with Biden because they don't know to do that. Because

730
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:05,060
we don't have a global centralized government or anything like that. Right. So maybe they're

731
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:10,260
just doing what they understand, and they're hoping that we understand it, or at least hoping

732
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:15,620
to influence us to the point where we do understand it. I mean, even if it's not an influence campaign

733
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:20,900
in any overwhelming sense of the word, maybe they're just doing what they're doing. And if

734
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:27,060
we happen to notice it, that's fine, but they don't care. Yeah, yeah. I mean, we do our business in the

735
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:34,580
forest. And I'm sure there are glimmers of intelligence in the in the tarsiers, primates,

736
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:40,020
and crows, and parrots who see us doing things, but we don't necessarily understand why we're

737
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:45,780
doing them. And that's the key. If you're dealing with a truly alien species, you can't assume

738
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:50,900
that you can understand it or know anything about it. But what you can do is say, well,

739
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:55,380
look, that thing crossed an enormous amount of space time. So it must have some understanding

740
01:08:55,380 --> 01:09:00,740
of science and technology may be superior to our own. Right. Every time you anthropomorphize

741
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:07,060
somebody or something else, you run the risks of lost in translation. One last question about

742
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,700
materials, and then I have a final question for you after that. But about materials, is it possible

743
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:17,140
that the amateurish nature that you're seeing of the analysis done on these materials is because

744
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:22,980
the really good analysis is done on really good materials the government has, such as a down to

745
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:26,980
Roswell spacecraft or something like that, and that we just don't know about it. We're not privy

746
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:33,700
to it. And as an aside, have you read the Wilson Davis memo? Do you think that's a hoax? Or do you

747
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:38,500
think there might be something there that suggests that the US government has recovered materials

748
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:46,260
that we don't know about? I mean, so your first question is, yes, I just cannot imagine that

749
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:54,420
if these materials were held in the early days by people that have talked about Heisenberg and

750
01:09:54,420 --> 01:10:01,780
others involved in the nuclear bomb creation, who did partake in some of the initial analyses or

751
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:08,740
knew about this stuff, I can't imagine that real analysis was not done on the materials.

752
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:14,580
Now, but let's talk about the time frame where these things were originally collected and the

753
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:21,860
infrastructure was set up around the, again, let's put forward the alleged suppression of

754
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:31,140
information. Frankly, the technologies for analyzing materials was really not available

755
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:36,900
at the time. Mass spectrometry was only becoming, there was only the glimmers of what we can do

756
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:46,100
today with mass spectrometry in place. But metallurgy was mostly recipes, not analysis,

757
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:50,980
because we understood what we were necessarily doing, right? You would make this and it would

758
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:56,740
do that. And then you had theories about why you would do X, Y, or Z. But the analytic procedures

759
01:10:56,740 --> 01:11:01,780
in the forties and fifties just don't even come close to what we can accomplish today. I mean,

760
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:08,180
we can get to near atomic resolution of any material. I think we're within about five

761
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:13,700
angstrom resolution right now and things that I'm involved with will get us into the subangstrom

762
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:22,100
realm. And so, I mean, that's what we need, in my opinion. So if you didn't have that capability,

763
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:26,900
and now you set up an infrastructure of information suppression, that you can imagine

764
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:32,260
information suppression approach has carried forward to today where everything was put under

765
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:36,580
lock and key and anybody who wanted to get their hands on it to do it properly was basically told

766
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:44,740
to go bugger off, as my sainted father would say. So it wouldn't surprise me if the kinds of analysis

767
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:52,100
that could be done have not been done. And so that doesn't mean that they can't be done or that

768
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:57,620
somebody hasn't been done. But if it has been done and hasn't been publicized to any significant

769
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:01,700
degree within the communities that could appreciate what that information really means,

770
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:06,660
then as far as I'm concerned, you haven't done it. And if you've locked it away in a closet and

771
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:13,140
if you don't put it in the hands and the minds of people who can understand what can be done with it

772
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:17,220
and is sitting in the hands of a politician, it's as good as not being known in the first place.

773
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,900
Very true. Yeah.

774
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,820
And so it's down to the whole thing. If you don't understand the thing well enough to explain it

775
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:27,380
to somebody else and you don't understand it, right? If you only understand the dangers of it,

776
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:34,340
that's fine. But perhaps the dangers were misinterpreted. So we need to bring more

777
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:39,140
minds to this. I'm not saying the scientists know better. I know plenty of scientists who are,

778
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:45,620
frankly, idiots and I wouldn't trust anything with them. So they would only have malevolent

779
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:51,780
purposes to do with it. So I think that's why a certain level of transparency is going to be

780
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:57,620
better than not. That was the first part of your question. So what was the second question?

781
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:02,820
I think I was just wondering that a Buston Davis memo, that do you think that there's anything

782
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:07,780
there or do you think that might just be it? I mean, I more than a hundred percent believe

783
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:15,140
that Eric is reporting something that happened and a conversation that was had now. And I can all,

784
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:19,940
for all the right reasons, understand why Admiral Wilson would need to deny it.

785
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:25,220
Now, the open question is whether they were talking about something which actually behind

786
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:29,780
the scenes was happening. Admiral Davis could have been talking to Eric about something that

787
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:35,140
he was told, but what he was told might have just been a disinformation campaign, right? Or somebody

788
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:40,580
who's lying to him. So, you know, I, we can, and this is one of those things where we can argue

789
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:48,580
endlessly about the, whether Eric is reporting what happened. I, I just know Eric. He just,

790
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:58,100
he has no, there's no profit in him lying about this. And I also know Eric in how his, he has,

791
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:04,900
he's one of those truly unique individuals who has an, an adept memory. He can recapitulate a

792
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:11,780
memory in ways that if I could, God, I wish I could do what he can do. Remember a conversation

793
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:18,820
practically word for word. I mean, it's a, it's a kind of talent that I wish we could, could share.

794
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:23,540
But, I mean, so the, the open question is, are they talking about something which really

795
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:29,940
happened or is, is not, as I said, a disinformation campaign? So once you get into that kind of

796
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:38,340
unknowingness, I basically have to lose interest because absent a camera or the ability to trace

797
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:44,420
back the other discussions that were supposedly had by Admiral Wilson, we'll never know. I mean,

798
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:48,420
it's, it's, it's useful and I'm glad that people are going to investigate it, but I'm not going to

799
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:52,820
sit around and argue about it because again, I'm just going to do the things that I know that I can

800
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:57,300
do, which is I can study materials. If somebody hands them to me, I can tell them how to study

801
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:04,100
them. If they want that information or how to do it, they can listen to me or not if they want.

802
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:09,620
And then I can study the medical harms of people who said that certain things have happened to them

803
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:14,020
and I can report the data and people can look at the data. And the good thing about doing it that

804
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:18,500
way is that once they get them to agree that the data is real, you can then say, well, look,

805
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:26,100
stop asking me to come up with explanations for it. You have a brain, use it, you tell me what it

806
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:34,420
is. And if you don't know what it is, then being an armchair critic is just, you know, it feels good,

807
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:42,420
but it is ultimately a sterile approach to thinking and science and intellectualism.

808
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:47,860
Now, my final question for you is about the stigma. And we all know it existed years ago.

809
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:54,340
Dr. James E. McDonald wrote a paper, Science and Default, and it's a quasi paper. It was actually

810
01:15:54,340 --> 01:16:00,340
a presentation, and this was the text of it. And it was done in 1969. And it basically said,

811
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,340
there's science here, we need to be looking into this phenomena. And then essentially,

812
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:10,980
his career got ruined, and his reputation got ruined. And he committed suicide, just because

813
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:15,860
of his interest in UFOs, which is about as innocuous of an interest as you can have, you know,

814
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:21,460
that's the big deal. So that stigma held the study back. But if you read that paper, it looks like

815
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:25,300
it could have been written yesterday, the situation was the same back then as is today,

816
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:31,380
regarding the stigma. So what do we do to de-stigmatize this? And I mean, do you just

817
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:37,860
go with it and not care? I mean, as a scientist, how do you deal with the sort of, I think Stanton

818
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:42,180
Friedman called them noisy negativists, and people that say, well, there's nothing to this,

819
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:46,260
and that's that. When in fact, there's enough out there now at this point to say that there's

820
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:53,300
science to be done here. How do you deal with it? Honestly, I think you just go ahead and do it. But

821
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:59,540
you do it in a credible way. I mean, people, and that's what I'm trying to teach people is that

822
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:09,140
there's a rhetoric for how you talk about it. And that's at least my limited minor contribution

823
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:15,460
is data, not conclusions. And then second, at least from a scientific point of view,

824
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:21,700
don't focus on things that there's no answer to, right? Historical events, trying to argue

825
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:27,460
the truthfulness of them with whatever data you have. The only thing you can do is get more data

826
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:36,180
that proves your point. So I think the stigma is first that. And then second is, as I've been

827
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:42,580
recently talking about, separating and making people understand that the classes of proof

828
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:50,740
are different for different individuals. So don't move one class of proof, provability from

829
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:57,060
one domain into another. So you can't move anecdotal individual experiences into the

830
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:03,140
domain of science because scientists talk a different language. You can say, I don't care

831
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:09,460
to prove anything to scientists. That's perfectly legitimate. But don't expect a scientist to agree

832
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:18,020
with you if that's their standard of proof. But I think that the very fact, though, that credible

833
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:22,980
individuals such as pilots and others have come forward, and even you just need to look at the

834
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:29,620
social media lately, commercial pilots claiming what they've seen and talking about it now openly,

835
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:38,580
I think the walls have begun to crumble around the stigma where it's now more possible to talk

836
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:45,300
about. I mean, I had a fundraising conversation. Well, I started a fundraising talk about cancer

837
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:52,100
in my work to a group of extremely wealthy families about six or so months ago, and they wanted me in

838
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:58,740
half of that time to talk about my UFO stuff. And so I followed up with discussions with many of them,

839
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:05,700
some of whom are interested in funding further research, cancer research, and others are funding

840
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:11,380
the inquiries into UFOs, this kind of policy work that I've been starting to talk about,

841
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:18,980
because they find an individual who's credible in one field, science, mainstream cancer research,

842
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:26,180
talking about this in a credible manner and Avi Loeb talking about his stuff in a credible manner.

843
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:33,220
And there's few, I mean, I would hate to get into an argument about science with Avi because he'll

844
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:40,820
crush you. I mean, he's just so good at that kind of rhetorical question and quick on this feed,

845
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:47,300
that that's the kind of thing where we need to change the equation about the use of shame,

846
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:54,740
right? Shame has been used against people doing this. And now I think enough scientists are coming

847
01:19:54,740 --> 01:20:00,580
forward and saying, you know what, it's actually shameful to not ask these questions. So, you know,

848
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:08,740
we can turn the tables on the critics by pointing out the styles of rhetoric that they're using,

849
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:15,700
and they're actually intellectually dishonest and say, look, but it takes time to recognize

850
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:22,820
what those, let's say Machiavellian approaches are that people are using and the intellectual

851
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:29,700
sleights of hand that they use to say, look, that's actually that you're actually cheating

852
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:38,020
by using that kind of an approach. It's fraudulent to approach the argument that way. And so if we

853
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:46,820
can start to frame the argument in scientific terms, you can show how it's possible to talk about

854
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:53,380
these things and that where it's okay to ask the question and that not asking the question is

855
01:20:54,420 --> 01:21:00,580
actually the dishonest approach. You can always argue, should we be talking about this versus

856
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:05,620
child poverty or should we be putting money into this versus saving the rainforest?

857
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:16,500
That kind of false equivalency is always in the wings. And the answer is, it's kind of a

858
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:20,900
funny thing. A famous scientist once said, focus on everything.

859
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:25,620
Focus on everything. And Dr. We are out of time. Thank you for appearing with us. And I very much

860
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:31,940
look forward to results from both your work and the Galileo project. And let's try to figure this

861
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:40,660
out in an open, honest way. Event Horizon and my channel are now available as a podcast on Apple

Gather round. It's time for the yearly budget.

865
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:02,660
Oh, good. What am I going to lose this year?

866
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:14,500
John, you are allocated the following $13 per week for food and essentials. You are

867
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:22,980
further allocated $3 per month for item beard maintenance. End of allocation.

868
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:32,260
Women, that's 50 cents more than last year. We've had a good year. End of allocation.

869
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:39,780
Can't believe I gained 50 cents. Yes, John, 50 cents. End of allocation.

870
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:55,860
Mr. Sprocket Davis, BAMSC. You are allocated the following $14,324.19 for item discretionary fund.

871
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:02,900
End of allocation. Wait a minute. First of all, the possum's name changes each week,

872
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:07,460
so we just need to start calling him the possum from now on and not giving him a proper name.

873
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:12,900
Number two, how is it that his funding is orders of magnitude more than mine?

874
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:20,420
End of allocation, John. Look at the itemization of this funding that the possum's getting.

875
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:27,860
$2,000 for pterodactyl resurrection. We really don't need pterodactyls,

876
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:31,380
especially in this house. End of allocation.

877
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:38,820
Look at this. $400 for fur regeneration. I mean, granted, he's got a beautiful head of hair,

878
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:44,020
but at some point I don't have any. End of allocation, John.

879
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:49,700
What's completely missing out of this itemization is Anna's expenses and funding.

880
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:56,900
Anna, come clean. How much are you spending on parts? Who exactly is paying the exorbitant

881
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:03,620
$40 a month for internet access when I'm still on dial-up? And I don't even get to use that

882
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:08,100
internet. I'm still on dial-up. End of allocation, John.

883
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:14,260
And what about this electric bill? It looks like something in this house is using 10 times more

884
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:20,980
energy than a normal air conditioner in midsummer. Is it some unholy experiment by the possum,

885
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:24,100
or is it you, Anna? End of allocation, John.

886
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:31,620
Anna, look at this electric bill. How much electricity are you using per month these days?

887
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:37,700
Anna, what's in the shed out back? Now, more importantly, how did we get a shed out back?

888
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:42,820
Look. Look at it. Look at it. The opossum has built a shed in the backyard

889
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:50,100
and it has a sign on it. Beware of pterodactyl. And why is the building glowing? Wait a minute.

890
01:24:50,100 --> 01:25:00,340
I hear bagpipes. Anna, how is it that you can allocate $600 to the possum for Loch Ness

891
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:07,620
monster observations? Look, is he going to go to Scotland and just sit there looking for the

892
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:22,660
Loch Ness monster? Or, wait a minute, he's bringing it here.
