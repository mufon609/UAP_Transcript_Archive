1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Signals among the noise.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,020
For over 70 years, rumors have abounded regarding the discovery of materials of potentially

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,860
alien origin, chiefly by the US government.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,860
This came mostly in the form of hearsay, stories from people often now long dead of the Roswell

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,980
incident and others, that verification of was woefully absent.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,540
Recent events have moved it closer to at least the possibility that within all of this, there

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,680
is a kernel of truth, a something rather than a nothing being here.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,180
Just what that entails has been the subject of both much debate, but also much taboo.

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,140
Dr. Jalen Heineck once summed up the hard skeptic position as it can't be, therefore

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,140
it isn't.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,140
But on the opposite end would be the true believer, and the positions that go along

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,140
with that.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,940
But the fact remains there are plausible ways, or at least marginally so, for an alien presence

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,740
in the solar system.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,040
And there was also a bias present within science against close aliens.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,260
We could talk of von Neumann probes in the solar system, propagating and self-replicating

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,660
across the galaxy in only a few million years.

18
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,880
But as aero director Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick pointed out recently, the plausibility seems

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,760
to stop at the orbit of Mars.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,300
Anything inside that radius, or in the earth's atmosphere, became implausible wrongly because

21
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,420
of the taboo which led to a bias.

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,600
But when you look at John von Neumann's concept, it has no such limitation.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,380
If you have a probe in the solar system, it's really no different from having it in the

24
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,660
atmosphere of the most interesting planet in the solar system.

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,620
With recent events, and the ongoing fight over legislation, sponsored by Senate Majority

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,940
Leader Chuck Schumer to get to the bottom of these rumors, the subject is starting to

27
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,460
get the attention of the scientific community at large.

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,820
So long as evidence is presented that we can actually reliably study, keeping a skeptical

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,780
eye in mind.

30
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,260
With that legislation, that may actually be on the table, if there is indeed a signal

31
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,380
among the noise.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:20,060
You have fallen into Event Horizon with John Michael Godier.

33
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,380
In today's episode, John is joined by Dr. Kolm Kelleher.

34
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:30,740
Kolm A. Kelleher, PhD, is a biochemist with a 15-year research career in cell and molecular

35
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,340
biology.

36
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,660
Following his PhD in biochemistry from the University of Dublin Trinity College in 1983,

37
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,580
Kelleher worked at the Ontario Cancer Institute, the Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory,

38
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,180
and the National Jewish Centre for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine.

39
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,940
For the past eight years, he has worked as project manager and team leader at a private

40
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,860
research institute, using forensic science methodology to unravel scientific anomalies.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,260
Kolm Kelleher, welcome to the program.

42
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,260
Great to be here.

43
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,140
Now, Doctor, we have grappled with the UFO phenomenon for over 70 years, and, you know,

44
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,220
before Roswell, really.

45
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,380
And there's always been rumors and questions and everything else, but it took a very different

46
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:24,060
the last few years, where there seems to be something there in the U.S. government that

47
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,300
at least knows more about this than what they're telling everybody else.

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,300
Now, I wouldn't want to come to any sort of conclusions about it, other than there just

49
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,540
does seem to be a signal among the noise.

50
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,340
Now, in your experience with the UFO phenomenon, looking at many, many different accounts and

51
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,260
looking for patterns among these accounts and trying to glean what you can from the

52
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,380
aggregate as opposed to the individual accounts, which can be problematic.

53
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,260
But if you're looking at a lot of them, you can look for patterns.

54
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,700
What were your conclusions on that?

55
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,540
What did you see?

56
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,860
Well, I guess this goes back from I joined National Institute for Discovery Science,

57
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,980
which was an organization funded by Robert Bigelow back in 1996.

58
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:13,100
We spent eight years focusing on the UFO phenomenon and investigating sort of boots on

59
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,740
the ground, dozens and dozens of cases.

60
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:23,100
And then we sort of moved into the OSAP program in 2008, which started through the

61
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Defense Intelligence Agency, twenty two million dollar program.

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,100
We hired about 50 people in order to do that program.

63
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:38,700
And the exclusive intent of that program was to investigate UFOs and also to determine

64
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,900
whether or not UFOs constituted a threat to the United States.

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:53,820
So I guess the short answer to your question is obviously we do have gobs and gobs of data

66
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,180
regarding UFO performance.

67
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:04,460
We have gobs of data regarding UFO technology and how and or or regarding technological

68
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,780
performance.

69
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,580
What we don't have a lot of is what is the agenda?

70
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:16,340
There is definitely a technological, a very highly adept technological force out there

71
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:23,660
that has been interacting closely with humans for the last 70, 75 years.

72
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,740
And if you look at Jacques Vallée's work, then you're really going back centuries

73
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,820
and possibly beyond that.

74
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,660
But regarding the agenda of the UFO phenomenon, we're still up in the air regarding

75
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,660
agenda. But I will say that my experience that began with the National Institute for

76
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,660
Discovery Science investigating UFOs on the Skinwalker Ranch and investigating UFOs out

77
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,860
there, there is an element of deception that runs through the UFO phenomenon.

78
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,980
In my experience, we were hunting something on Skinwalker Ranch that was definitely

79
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:11,420
Nuts and Balls UFOs cloaking a panoply of other very weird phenomena that seem to go

80
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,260
hand in hand with the Nuts and Balls craft.

81
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,660
So we are talking about deception.

82
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,060
I think there's a thread of deception that runs through the entire interaction of the

83
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:31,460
UFO phenomenon with humans going back to 1940s, 1950s, where observers were able to

84
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,860
see Nuts and Balls objects, sometimes pretty close up.

85
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,300
But there was never any interaction between these objects and humans.

86
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,780
There was a lot of phases of this interaction with humans over the decades that includes

87
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:56,300
everything from the so-called contactees in the 50s through the so-called abduction phenomena in

88
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,260
the 1970s and 1980s.

89
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:05,260
And if you look at the different patterns that emerge, you do see an element of deception.

90
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:12,420
There is there does seem to be a concerted effort on the part of this phenomenon to prevent

91
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,300
accumulation of scientific data.

92
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:22,300
A good example of that is right now on this planet, there are probably 6.4 billion smartphones,

93
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,820
each one of which has a very high definition camera.

94
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,260
A lot of them have high definition camera.

95
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:35,340
But yet we're still struggling with very blurry sort of long distance photographs that should

96
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:42,260
not be happening with something that is not actively preventing the accumulation of data.

97
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:50,940
So I guess the short answer to your question is a technology that is engaging in deception.

98
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,540
Is it possible?

99
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,860
And this will go a little bit out there, but is it possible that it is a problem of perception?

100
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,260
In other words, people might be seeing something that their brains can't understand, say something

101
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,140
that's, you know, Carl Sagan once floated the idea of a tesseract, seeing something in an upper

102
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,420
dimension or whatever, and then it comes across to us as a phenomenon like this that doesn't

103
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,500
make any sense or seems deceptive or something like that.

104
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:24,180
Could it simply be that's the nature of it, that what we see isn't what it actually is

105
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,980
and that our brains are interpreting it, painting in, I think, a large amount of what we see

106
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,940
visually is the brain painting things in instead of, you know, what's actually there.

107
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,380
It's reconstructing.

108
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,700
So is it possible that that's what this is, is a phenomenon of the brain?

109
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,020
And to tie that in to the most disturbing aspect of the phenomenon, and honestly the

110
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,940
main reason I'm looking into it as a talk show host is injuries.

111
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,100
There have been people injured by exposure to UAP.

112
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,340
Well that opens up the question is what happens first, the injury or the sighting in those

113
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,620
few seconds, and that they might not really be remembering what they actually saw, and

114
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,900
might have been something completely different than what's in our normal experience in life.

115
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:16,820
I do tend to agree with you regarding human perception, which is at best imperfect and

116
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,740
always has been imperfect.

117
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,780
Eyewitness testimony, though, also has been used to convict a lot of people in the courts

118
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,620
over time.

119
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,860
But from the point of view of human perception, I think there is sort of a group of people

120
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,620
who are starting to really look at that from the point of view of UFOs, and that would

121
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,700
be people like Bernardo Kastrup, Donald Hoffman, Federico Fahin, the guy who actually

122
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,820
invented the microprocessor at Intel, Jeffrey Kreipalth from Rice University, even Robert

123
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,260
Lanza, who's a stem cell biologist.

124
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:05,580
All of these people are basically saying that human perception is imperfect at best, but

125
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:12,660
it's even worse than that, that there is a filter between what really is out there versus

126
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,780
what we perceive.

127
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,300
So, you know, that Bernardo Kastrup has this analogy of an airplane cockpit.

128
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,700
You're looking at the dials and the instruments of an airplane cockpit.

129
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,500
And outside this airplane, there's a storm, a really heavy duty storm brewing, and all

130
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,660
human perception is is really flying by these instruments in the cockpit.

131
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:45,660
And the UFO phenomenon is obviously much more adept at understanding human perception or

132
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,460
probably is much more adept at understanding human perception.

133
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:57,780
And therefore, what we see is kind of only in relationship to a set of dials in a cockpit

134
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,100
compared to what's happening with the UFO.

135
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,260
So I think your question is right on there.

136
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:11,100
But I think it's I think we're in a lot worse shape than a lot of people give it credit

137
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:18,260
for, because I think the laws of physics are based on how we read these cockpit instruments

138
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,180
and the phenomenon seems to be able to come in and out of the cockpit, so to speak.

139
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,500
Magnets on the compass, you can fool a compass with a magnet.

140
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,060
Exactly.

141
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:40,460
Now, this brings up the idea of, OK, well, you can't really at this point say this

142
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,460
phenomenon is of alien origin, even though we'd like to, you know, that would be convenient.

143
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,980
But maybe there is something out there that's weirder than aliens, something more elemental,

144
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,540
something more that's, you know, been with us.

145
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,020
That's a component to perhaps humanity itself.

146
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,060
And that, again, you know, references Jacques Vallée's work, because sometimes this looks

147
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,140
a lot like folklore or whatever creates folklore, let's put it that way.

148
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,620
And I think I wonder if we're just seeing something that we've always seen that has

149
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,100
recast itself as the UAP phenomenon and that it's something much, much older than that

150
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,940
and something not of the nature.

151
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,780
It's just that we currently have to happen to be thinking about aliens and SETI and things

152
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,020
like that, when in fact this might be something else.

153
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,580
Do you think that has legs that this this might be an evolving phenomenon?

154
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,580
Yeah, I'm obviously a great fan of Jacques Vallée.

155
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:41,300
Jacques Vallée joined the National Institute for Discovery Science Advisory Board in 1995,

156
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,340
and I was hired at NIDS in 1996.

157
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:51,660
So I've been, you know, it's almost like sort of Vallée has been almost like a mentor

158
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,100
because over the years, you know, National Institute for Discovery Science was spending

159
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,980
a lot of time and effort and money looking at the at the UFO phenomenon.

160
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,140
But Jacques Vallée was always a part of that.

161
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:14,100
He was fundamental to a lot of the brainstorming that happened in 2008 at the very early

162
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,460
stages of the OSAP program, the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Application Program,

163
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,900
that began through the Defense Intelligence Agency in September of 2008.

164
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,420
Vallée was was instrumental in designing the UFO database.

165
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,500
Well, actually, it was a data warehouse that was used during the OSAP program and the the

166
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,540
Vallée called it the Capella Data Warehouse.

167
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,140
And that data warehouse was actually a compendium of multiple different databases,

168
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,900
including the database from the National Institute for Discovery Science, which we had

169
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,660
worked on for eight years.

170
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,180
But it also had multiple pilot databases, you know, military pilots, civilian pilots,

171
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:09,740
it had a really interesting database that was fundamentally focused on the entire Brazilian

172
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:16,660
choleras incidents that were very pertinent from a UFO medical injury perspective.

173
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:22,260
So a lot of cases and a lot of testimony went into that choleras databases.

174
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,620
And then we also had multiple government, British government, French government,

175
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,820
Brazilian government went through the whole release process.

176
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,540
So I guess over many, many years, Jacques Vallée has been instrumental.

177
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,380
So a lot of his thinking has permeated through both the National Institute for Discovery

178
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,220
Science and OSAP.

179
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:51,460
So we have been very, I think, careful in sort of negotiating our way through the process

180
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,940
of interpreting all of this data.

181
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,580
And I'm very loathe to go down the road of what is actually happening here.

182
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,700
Are we talking about extraterrestrials?

183
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,100
Are we talking about interdimensional phenomena?

184
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,740
Are we talking about ultra terrestrials?

185
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:15,060
Are we talking about sort of breakaway civilizations, the so-called crypto terrestrials

186
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,260
or humans from the future?

187
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:26,420
Ultimately, it's from a scientific perspective, it's incredibly difficult to distinguish

188
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:32,660
between something like extraterrestrials from the very sparse data that we have

189
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:39,140
versus inter-dimensionals, for example, or something even more exotic, as you're

190
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:45,580
alluding to. I mean, fundamentally, from a scientific perspective, these kinds of

191
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,620
distinguishing hallmarks are very, very few and far between.

192
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,980
Do you think we have hope, in other words, with an even bigger data set and continued

193
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,380
exploration of the data set we have, can we find out more?

194
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,940
Absolutely. I would, yeah.

195
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,620
How do we do it?

196
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,940
Yeah. I think, you know, not to sort of toot my own horn, but I think the Advanced

197
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,420
Aerospace Weapons Systems application program, the way it turned out in terms of

198
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:21,140
how efficient it became over a 27-month period in terms of data collection and

199
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:27,620
also reaching out and establishing contacts was very, very efficient as a

200
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,820
template for, I think, what a future UFO program could look like.

201
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:39,700
Not only did the OSAP program get into collecting database, really getting

202
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,340
multiple databases together, but we also had multiple boots on the ground, people

203
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,780
who were willing to go out and investigate cases, sort of rapid reaction

204
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,380
force. We teamed up with MUFON, an organization that has people in 50

205
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,060
separate states, and we were able to really sort of get into investigating

206
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
multiple cases every month.

207
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,580
And from establishing a template for a future UFO program, we think the OSAP

208
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,580
program is probably a good candidate for doing that.

209
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,620
We also had a lot of good people on board, physicists, biologists.

210
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,780
We hired a bunch of database analysts.

211
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,100
We had military intelligence people.

212
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,820
We had counterintelligence people.

213
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,900
We had retired police investigators.

214
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:37,980
We even had a couple of MD-PhDs on our staff that were specifically focused on

215
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,940
these medical injury cases.

216
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,460
And we investigated a few medical injury cases during the OSAP program, but this

217
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,980
was only a very short 27-month program.

218
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,500
It was terminated at the Defense Intelligence Agency because basically, I

219
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,700
think, though not anticipate the level of the numbers of cases that would be

220
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,900
investigated, but also the kinds of weird phenomena that were coming up as we

221
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,100
followed the data.

222
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,140
Because once you start looking at effects of UFOs on humans, you start opening up

223
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,660
things like medical injury cases, physiological effects, pathological

224
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,700
effects, psychological effects, and even paranormal effects.

225
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,180
And we did follow the data and we followed the data down some pretty

226
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,780
bizarre rabbit holes.

227
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,020
And so ultimately, the program ended after 27 months.

228
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:41,260
But if that program had continued for maybe five to 10 years and expanded

229
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,220
according to what the program plan looked like at the very beginning of this

230
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,900
whole exercise, I think we would be a lot further along this sort of investigation.

231
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,140
Where do we go next?

232
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,780
In other words, say, all right, let me ask you this first.

233
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,180
Do you think Arrow is set up in the same way as OSAP?

234
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,740
Do you think Arrow has any hope of furthering this or is it just, is it

235
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,820
another blue book or something like that versus OSAP actually proactively looking

236
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,060
into this with a rigorous scientific method?

237
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,700
Well, Arrow was set up under the auspices of the Undersecretary of Defense for

238
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,220
Intelligence and Security.

239
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:31,020
And that particular organization in the Pentagon is not known for being

240
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,980
proactive in terms of a level of interest in the UFO phenomenon.

241
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:42,700
They tend to be not very proactive and not very aggressive in going after data.

242
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,460
So that has changed somewhat in the last six to 12 months when it became under the

243
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,260
purview of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks.

244
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,540
I think since then, progress has been made.

245
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,220
Dr.

246
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,860
Sean Fitzpatrick is now leaving by the end of the year.

247
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,940
There will be new leadership in Arrow, but, you know, fundamentally, it depends

248
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,540
on a number of internal champions within the organization that are really willing

249
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,700
and able to push the envelope.

250
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,900
I think Arrow will collect some interesting data from the classified sensors

251
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,260
and that data will never be released to the public, but whether or not they will

252
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:33,420
actually take the extra step and go where OSAP went, which is two separate lines in

253
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,980
the water, the first line being looking at UFO performance.

254
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,540
And yes, Arrow has that covered in terms of a battery of highly classified sensors.

255
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,060
But the second aspect is looking into effects of UFOs on humans.

256
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,500
And that's where it gets very, very messy, where you're going to get a lot of

257
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:00,060
bureaucrats at the USDA and in the Pentagon saying that all of these studies lie

258
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,540
outside the purview of the Department of Defense, that some other organization

259
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,460
should be studying it.

260
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:12,740
But the problem is if you ignore effects of UFOs on humans, you're ignoring a

261
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,980
pretty substantial part of the picture.

262
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:21,780
And I guess that's where we believe that the OSAP program really did sort of shine

263
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:27,820
because we were able to run both the so-called nuts and bolts investigations of

264
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,260
UFOs in parallel with effects of UFOs on humans.

265
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:38,780
And in order to study the entire UFO phenomenon, I do believe that you've got to

266
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:45,860
do both. Views on private scientific probes into UFOs, and we have quite a few

267
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,980
of them now. There's the Galileo project and we've got Gary Nolan at Stanford

268
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,140
looking into the injuries and things like that.

269
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,980
Do you think more fruit will come of that than trying to slam the government back

270
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,940
into looking into this?

271
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,420
Well, you know, one of the I think one of the sort of the strengths of the OSAP

272
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,020
program was the the ability of the United States government to contract out.

273
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:16,140
So there was some kind of a hybrid where Aero was able to work much more closely

274
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,620
with private organizations in sort of 100 percent collaborative capacity, sort of

275
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,900
like the the model that NASA and SpaceX engineered, this public private sector

276
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,980
collaborative framework that was very successful with NASA and SpaceX.

277
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:39,420
If something like that could be engineered over time with Aero on some of these

278
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:45,220
private organizations, I think something could come out of it because there is

279
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,700
flexibility and innovation in the private sector that is just very, very

280
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,980
difficult to replicate when you're 100 percent focused at the Pentagon.

281
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,380
Now, you worked in your newest book, Inside the U.S.

282
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,060
Government Covert UFO Program, Initial Revelations with Dr.

283
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:10,740
Lakatsky, and he said recently that he'd seen the craft and seen the inside of it.

284
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,860
What are your thoughts on this? Can you shed any light on that or is just off limits?

285
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:21,500
Well, I do know that when we were preparing this manuscript and that section of the

286
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,340
manuscript was sort of front and center and we discussed it a lot, we submitted this

287
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:33,620
manuscript to the Defense Office of Republication and Security basically for

288
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,340
permission to publish what was in it.

289
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,380
And we were surprised what Dr.

290
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,780
Lakatsky alluded to in terms of the this technology of unknown origin.

291
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,100
I actually survived the review process, but it was pretty obvious from the

292
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,420
conversations that were happening at Dobser that none of the authors were

293
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,900
permitted to go beyond what those statements were in the in the book.

294
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,660
So what Dr.

295
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:08,820
Lakatsky had put out was about as far as he could go and about as far as Dobser was

296
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,940
prepared to go. The previous book we put out, which was also on this program, but

297
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,820
it was focused on on the effects of UFOs on on people, which was skinwalkers at

298
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,500
the Pentagon. We went through the same process with Dobser and Dobser really

299
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,540
hacked this hacked that book up because there was a lot of cases that we

300
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,380
described that that involved people who were still active duty military.

301
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,620
So there was a lot of changes that were made with the skinwalkers at the Pentagon

302
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:48,620
book. Not so many changes in the initial revelations book that came out about a

303
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:54,060
month ago. But in terms of what we can say, going beyond what Lakatsky had

304
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,300
written in that book, I'm not at liberty to go beyond what was written in the book.

305
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:05,340
A tale of two cases, two particularly compelling ones, one semi old, one

306
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,420
semi new, both neither brand new.

307
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:17,260
The first is the RB57 case of made initially probably most known through the work of Dr.

308
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,060
James McDonald, who was an atmospheric scientist looking into UAP.

309
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:27,220
And that particular case was multiple witness and multiple sensor for its time.

310
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,140
Could you give us an overview of this case?

311
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,740
Well, yeah, that actually was one of the cases that we put in as a really good

312
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:41,540
demonstration of what UFOs performance looked like all the way back in the 1950s.

313
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:48,220
I believe it was 1957, but it was this RB47 aircraft from the United States Air

314
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,540
Force was equipped with electronic countermeasures gear.

315
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,900
And I believe there were six crew members and they were followed by a UFO.

316
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,100
And so this was not a couple of minutes.

317
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:07,300
This event actually lasted for 1.5 hours as it flew over Mississippi and then into

318
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,100
Louisiana and Texas and into Oklahoma.

319
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:17,620
And so the bottom line here is that both the cockpit crew saw the object visually.

320
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,660
And also it was followed by several ground based radars.

321
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,420
It was detected by the United States Air Force, the United States Air Force,

322
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:32,580
it was detected by the electronic countermeasures equipment on the RB47.

323
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,820
And so here we have ground based radar.

324
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,620
We have multiple crew members visually seeing this.

325
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,220
And then we had a battery of electric countermeasure ECM equipment that

326
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
was tracking this object.

327
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,940
And one of the studies that I saw on the RB47 case was that this thing was

328
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,660
emitting something in the kilowatt range.

329
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:03,180
This UFO was emitting probably maybe microwaves in the kilowatt range, but

330
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,700
electromagnetic radiation was picked up beautifully by the ECM detection system.

331
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,420
So this was a case that was kind of made in heaven for, you know, all the way back

332
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:22,660
in the 1950s for how a UFO performance exceeded anything that we had at the time.

333
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:31,140
So the RB47 case was also investigated by a guy called Brad Sparks from the, he

334
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,460
was associated for a long time with the Science Historical Group, which are sort

335
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,620
of one of the preeminent historian based groups that have been looking into UFO

336
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,100
performance and UFO cases for a very long time.

337
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,660
But Brad Sparks published a lot of data on this RB47 case.

338
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:56,700
We would see it as being one of these sort of stellar, well-documented cases that

339
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,060
go back all the way into the 1950s.

340
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:05,180
And the reason that our book, you know, Initial Revelations, focused on the, some

341
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,020
of these early cases is that was pretty obvious.

342
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,740
We're not talking about Chinese drones here.

343
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,660
We're not talking about Russian sort of countermeasures.

344
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:21,500
These are sort of UFOs that were documented a long time before the advent

345
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,780
of Chinese balloons.

346
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,220
Patterns.

347
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:30,580
So also during the 1950s and 1960s, people talked about flying propane tanks.

348
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:37,020
And these look suspiciously like the 2004 Nimitz Tic-Tac, and that we just

349
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,740
culturally call it a Tic-Tac today when back then they would have equated it to

350
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,500
a propane tank or a septic tank.

351
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,260
That you don't hear that one much, but the idea of patterns again comes up here

352
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:56,740
because you, you know, Tic-Tac versus a propane tank sounds like a very similar

353
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,220
craft.

354
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:02,860
Now, can you connect those cases together with the Nimitz event as a modern, you

355
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,260
know, a modern example of this versus what was seen in the 1950s?

356
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,780
Well, I think you're right.

357
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,740
There was a whole plethora of cylindrical shaped objects.

358
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,820
And yeah, flying propane tanks were relatively common.

359
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,820
Yeah.

360
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,980
I think we may be victims of terminology here because what Commander David

361
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:31,100
Fravor described was something that was about the size of a Hawker Harrier, which

362
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,940
was about 46 feet long.

363
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:39,180
And it looked like a very large version of the Tic-Tac, which is, it looks like a

364
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:45,940
very white propane tank with no flight surfaces, no acceleration, no obvious

365
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,460
propulsion mechanism.

366
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:54,700
And this thing, I mean, it's now a world class, probably is probably the best

367
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,980
known UFO case in the world now.

368
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:04,660
But this thing, just like the RB-47 case back in the 1950s, was detected by

369
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:12,940
multiple F-18 pilots off the USS Nimitz, and it was also detected by forward

370
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:19,940
looking infrared technology on the F-18s, as well as the USS Princeton had state

371
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:24,140
of the art Aegis radar systems that were also detecting these.

372
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:29,180
And by the way, these objects were coming in on ballistic missile trajectories,

373
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,380
coming in at 80,000 feet, being tracked day after day after day by the USS

374
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,020
Princeton.

375
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,340
And finally, they vectored these F-18s over to investigate probably on day four or

376
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,860
five.

377
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,660
I'm not sure exactly which day it was, but bottom line was that the Commander

378
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:55,500
Fravor's F-18 that went down to engage with this Tic-Tac object was left basically

379
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:01,020
flat because this thing accelerated from a stationary position close to the, not

380
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:07,060
that far from the water, to a position that was over 20 miles away and within a

381
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,220
couple of seconds.

382
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,620
And then a subsequent F-18 that was launched and vectored in did manage to

383
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,300
capture some forward looking infrared data on this Tic-Tac.

384
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,980
So the performance of this thing was pretty mind blowing and it did happen to

385
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:30,380
be one of the first cases that the OSAP program investigated because just as I

386
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:36,060
was gearing up for hiring a whole bunch of people for the OSAP program back in

387
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,460
November of 2008, a guy walked into my office interviewing for the program

388
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,660
manager position.

389
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:48,140
And this guy was a retired lieutenant colonel who at the end of the interview,

390
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:53,620
he told me that he was part of the F-18 group that was flying off the USS

391
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,020
Nimitz in 2004 and he was part of this Tic-Tac case.

392
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:05,780
So the OSAP program were sort of in this position back in November of 2008 where

393
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:11,580
we were essentially one of the few dozen people on the planet who knew about this

394
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,460
case. And so, you know, one of the first things that myself and Robert Bigelow did

395
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:23,380
once we heard this testimony from the retired lieutenant colonel was we call

396
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:29,220
Lukatsky on the East Coast and he put together a team with a guy we called

397
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:38,380
Axelrod that investigated the Nimitz case all the way back in 2008 and going

398
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:44,460
into 2009, a report of this case was submitted to the Defense Intelligence

399
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,740
Agency as part of the OSAP contract in July of 2009.

400
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:56,780
And sort of eight years later, the New York Times broke the story and the case

401
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,860
became global.

402
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:03,700
But for that few years, there was probably only a few dozen people who knew about

403
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:10,420
this case. And just like the RB-47 case, I think it's one of these sort of stellar

404
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:17,900
cases with top quality, highly trained observers, in addition to multiple

405
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:23,020
separate sensor systems that were able to triangulate the UFO performance.

406
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,460
How could these things be working to produce the effect that was seen by Fravor

407
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,780
and other pilots and quite a number of people from the Nimitz have come out now

408
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,660
that might explain how these things operate?

409
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:40,900
I mean, can we through dirts and things like that, can we try to envision how

410
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,020
these things are working based on their flight characteristics?

411
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:50,300
Well, one of the things that we were attempting to do with the OSAP program was

412
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,980
what we call project physics.

413
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:57,580
And actually, project physics is the sort of the guts, the heart and soul of this

414
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,100
book, Initial Revelations.

415
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:07,140
But project physics essentially contracted with 37, 38 separate people who are out in

416
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,340
the private sector or who are working for major aerospace corporations or research

417
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,140
institutes, universities.

418
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:22,140
And the object of this thing was to essentially forecast 50 years from where we

419
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:29,060
are now or actually 50 years from where we were back in 2008 and project into the

420
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:35,260
future about what technology would look like, what technology would look like 50

421
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:40,980
years from now and keep it in the same arena rather than sort of intense

422
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,900
speculation.

423
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:47,660
So project physics gathered all of these defense, which were eventually published

424
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,580
as Defense Intelligence Research Documents.

425
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:56,220
And they investigated things like a hypersonic performance.

426
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,700
They investigated things.

427
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,500
What would the cockpit of the future look like faster than light travel?

428
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:09,340
Would wormholes going through wormholes, would that sort of be a way for aerospace

429
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,780
technology to evolve into 40 or 50 years from now?

430
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,820
So the 37 papers were 38 papers were published on the J Wicks Network, which is

431
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,740
the top secret TSCI network at the Pentagon.

432
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:28,220
And the purpose of this whole thing was to establish a baseline of what UFO

433
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:34,580
performance would look like in project physics and how that might match against

434
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,620
what was being assembled through a database.

435
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:44,740
Now, like I said, the 27 month period of the OSSAC program was pretty truncated

436
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,460
compared to what was originally planned to do.

437
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:54,540
And the object of project physics was to see how close the Delta was between what

438
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:59,940
could be envisioned 40, 50 years out by the brightest minds and the best of the

439
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:06,140
best versus what could be observed with the, you know, UFO performance.

440
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,980
And, you know, that the sort of six observables of UFO performance were that

441
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,820
were sort of gleaned from the databases was the instantaneous apparent

442
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:25,340
accelerations, 90 degree turns, hypersonic velocities that really almost never

443
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,660
produce signatures.

444
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:32,020
So, I mean, these were without signatures, low observability and the ability to

445
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,260
cloak what looked like UFOs disappearing.

446
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:42,060
Transmedium travel has become the buzzword in the last three or four years and the

447
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:48,220
ability of an object to come out of the water and go through the air and then move

448
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,740
into low Earth orbit.

449
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:57,260
And also what looked like some kind of positive lift, the ability to, which

450
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,380
involve transmedium travel also.

451
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,260
So these observables were basically documented in the databases and project

452
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:11,980
physics was attempting to provide the least possible Delta between what was

453
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,980
envisaged with the best of the best in terms of technology versus UFO

454
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,580
performance.

455
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:24,420
So if the OSAP program had been allowed to continue beyond the 27 months and maybe

456
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,460
into five years and 10 years, we could have got an answer in terms of closing

457
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:35,260
that gap between the observables versus what these projections look like.

458
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:42,900
But even as standalone topics and white papers, these 38 papers got an enormous

459
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:48,140
amount of positive feedback when they were published on the JWICS network and

460
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,340
they got less of an enthusiastic reception when they were published out in

461
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,260
the public because a lot of people thought they were just kind of, you know,

462
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,700
blue sky stuff that really had no basis, but they were actually carefully

463
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,380
thought out.

464
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,460
Now, a serious question in regards to this.

465
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:13,980
So we have had people from the Pentagon going up in front of Congress and

466
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:21,620
testifying, high level people, and they seem to paint a one picture that, well,

467
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,780
we looked into this one time, Project Blue Book didn't find anything, which

468
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,540
everybody knows the problems with that program, but they don't seem to mesh

469
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,100
with what OSAP did.

470
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,140
In other words, surely they must know about Veli's database, which is

471
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,820
classified, but they have access to that.

472
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,660
Surely they must know about the Nimitz event.

473
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,180
Surely they must know about a lot of things, but the thing is they don't seem

474
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,860
to present, whenever you ask Pentagon officials, they don't seem to present a

475
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,300
deep knowledge of the subject that they almost certainly have.

476
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:00,420
And to make it even broader, if there is something here, an alien civilization's

477
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:05,420
presence, that is the biggest national or global security threat ever to face

478
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,580
humanity, why do you think that is?

479
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,580
Are they just saying, we can't do anything about this, so downplay it.

480
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,660
Or do you think that there's just some sort of cultural problem in the Pentagon

481
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,860
that, you know, makes them downplay the potential of this, you know, the

482
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,100
potential national or global security threat of the UFO phenomenon?

483
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:32,980
Well, I think the Pentagon has been sort of operating in a sort of, I guess, a

484
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,660
mode of secrecy since the very, very beginning.

485
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:43,180
I mean, the Roswell event happened in Roswell, New Mexico back in July of

486
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:49,820
1947, but it also happened in an area of extremely high security in New

487
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,820
Mexico, where a lot of the nuclear technology that was fundamental to the

488
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,980
United States national security was right there.

489
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:03,100
The place was crawling with Soviet spies back in 1947.

490
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,180
You know, Stalin wanted to get his hands on this technology.

491
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:13,540
So this so-called crash of Roswell happened right in an area and at a time

492
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:20,740
where the only possible reaction was to classify it at the absolute highest

493
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:26,140
levels to prevent sort of an army of foreign intelligence agencies from

494
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,220
getting their hands on it.

495
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:34,140
So the very genesis of the modern UFO era was a deep dive in terms of the

496
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,540
Department of Defense into the classified arena.

497
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,340
And it has remained like that ever since.

498
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,100
So I think you're absolutely correct.

499
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:50,340
Decade after decade, all the way through the Project Sign, Project Grudge, which

500
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:56,740
ended in sort of the late 1940s, it evolved into Project Blue Book, which ran

501
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,940
for a dozen plus years and ended in 1969.

502
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:06,220
But all of these were essentially public relations efforts on the part of the

503
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,180
United States Air Force and the various intelligence agencies to absolutely

504
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,460
downplay the importance of the UFO topic.

505
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:20,940
So the Pentagon has had a long, long history of avoiding the UFO topic.

506
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:28,820
And it's almost like they've been in autopilot for decade after decade, where

507
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:35,020
all of this material, all of this evidence has been buried deep, very, very

508
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,980
deeply, and it has never seen the light of day for decade after decade.

509
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,860
And then in 2017, when the New York Times broke the story, December of 2017,

510
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:50,820
New York Times broke the story about our program, the Defense Intelligence

511
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,620
Agency program, plus the Tic Tac case.

512
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,940
It kind of blew this sort of complacent arena of secrecy.

513
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,860
It blew it out of the water.

514
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,580
And the years since then, you know, it's been sort of the Pentagon and the

515
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:10,340
Department of Defense have been playing catch up with the events that have

516
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:17,580
unfolded. You had the UAP Task Force that was originated in the United States

517
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:24,020
Navy that was around the 2018 timeframe, 2017 timeframe, I believe.

518
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,620
And that was a really proactive scenario within the Department of the Navy,

519
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:33,740
where a lot of pilots were being interviewed regarding UFOs.

520
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,420
But the UAP Task Force did not last very long.

521
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:43,700
It was the leadership of the of the UAPTF was disbanded pretty quickly because

522
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:50,060
the Pentagon bureaucrats did not like what was happening in terms of the UFO

523
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:55,700
topic itself starting to surface in the media, which is what they had been

524
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,300
successful in burying the previous four or five decades before that.

525
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:08,060
And then the genesis of the what the early version of AARO was an organization

526
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,020
called AOIMSG.

527
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,220
As the Pentagon loves these acrimons, I can't even remember what the name

528
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:20,500
AOIMSG, but it was formed as a follow up to the UAPTF.

529
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:28,940
And so AOIMSG was under the wing of the USDA, the Office of the USDA and

530
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:35,060
Security, which is, as I mentioned earlier, is the exact opposite agency that

531
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:40,220
you ever want to be involved with the UFO investigation, because it will never

532
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:45,380
happen because they've had decades of practice at slow walking and keeping it

533
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,340
secret. And then AOIMSG evolved into AARO.

534
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:57,140
So you've got a sort of a legacy of decades of secrecy where the real hardware

535
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:02,340
is buried deep within the bowels of the Pentagon and deep within various

536
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,740
aerospace contractors.

537
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,300
And that's the way it has been for decades.

538
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:13,020
So the idea of sort of waking up this slumbering beast, you know, which has has

539
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:18,580
sort of started to happen in the last six years, I think it's a very long long term

540
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:24,580
project to actually have any kind of success, because I think the Pentagon is used

541
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:31,620
to, you know, essentially blowing this UFO topic off and that the standard line from

542
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:37,740
the Pentagon since the closure of Blue Book in 1969 has been that the United

543
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,940
States does not investigate UFOs.

544
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,660
It has no interest in UFOs.

545
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,860
UFOs do not constitute a national security issue for the United States.

546
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,820
Therefore, the public is invited to move on.

547
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,020
There's nothing to see here.

548
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:57,780
It can't possibly not represent a national security threat, though.

549
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:02,100
It's a it would be, you know, putting your hands to your ears and screaming, no, no,

550
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,020
no, no, no. But if there is, and this is hypothetical, and I'll go further than you

551
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,860
well on this one, that if there is a presence of an alien civilization here, it is the

552
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:18,140
worst possible calamity that the human that human civilization has ever faced because

553
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,700
the Fermi paradox reduces immediately to the zoo hypothesis.

554
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,780
No matter what you do, they are in control.

555
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:30,900
My question is, is why was this not taken more seriously before now in the halls of

556
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,380
the Pentagon? Is it simply that they just had no way to counter it?

557
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,340
It's advanced technology could be two million years more advanced than anything we

558
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:46,660
have. Now, the question is, all right, so when we look at the alien option and that

559
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,940
no matter the option, if you look at if you look at paranormal options or whatever,

560
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,620
what power do they have? Could they end the universe?

561
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,020
Could the simulation come to an end by their hand?

562
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,860
You know, these humans have gotten out of trouble.

563
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,980
You know, they're getting gotten into trouble and created nuclear weapons and

564
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,460
everything must end them done.

565
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,060
Or the alien civilization is here to make sure that we never develop generalized

566
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:15,140
artificial intelligence, their police or worse, the idea that von Neumann probe

567
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:20,380
came here long ago and it is replicated and self replicated, which effectively

568
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,660
makes it a 3D printer.

569
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,180
And it is now so corrupt from cosmic ray hits that it's behaving irrationally,

570
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,460
which explains the irrational behavior of the phenomenon.

571
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,940
Shouldn't we be looking into these ideas and discussing them somewhere, whether

572
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,780
in the halls of government or in the halls of science and papers or whatever,

573
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:44,260
where we look at the phenomenon as a true global international security threat,

574
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,580
that this could be very, very bad what we're living through?

575
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:54,420
Well, I think the organizations like the Galileo Initiative,

576
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,820
Gary Nolan, Saul Foundation, which had its inaugural meeting there recently,

577
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:06,340
I think there is a lot of really super talent in the private sector.

578
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,940
I mean, a lot of people in Silicon Valley are getting very interested in this.

579
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:16,500
I think Avi Loeb's initiative has galvanized a lot of interest in the academic community.

580
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:22,820
I think AIAA has sort of taken the UFO topic under its wing.

581
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:30,300
So out in the scientific arena, I think movement is happening that has not happened

582
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,900
in the history of the UFO phenomenon.

583
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:40,180
The problem is the sort of entrenched decades long culture of secrecy that the

584
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,900
Pentagon has gone with.

585
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:49,020
And the bottom line is, I guess the Pentagon feels that since there has not been an overt

586
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:56,660
attack on the United States by some outer force, therefore, there is really no need

587
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,980
to get their act together and to get their ducks in a row.

588
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,540
So the private, I think what's happening in the private sector and the academic

589
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:12,020
community is far, far ahead of what's happening in the United States government.

590
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:19,500
Now, the exception really to the rule is in the last couple of years, some of the

591
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:25,820
congressional hearings have been pretty incendiary and they have shone a light on

592
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,500
what's happening with AARO and with the Pentagon.

593
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:36,780
And I think there is hope in terms of the congressional hearings that will happen

594
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,500
again and again and again.

595
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:44,900
I think there is a possibility that some kind of movement will happen in the

596
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,700
Pentagon, but I'm not holding my breath.

597
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:53,060
I've been looking at this phenomenon since the 90s and I don't see an awful

598
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,060
lot of hope right now.

599
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:02,180
I think the existential aspect of the phenomenon has been here for decades.

600
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:06,700
And if you look at Jacques Vallée's books, probably millennia.

601
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:13,020
So I don't think there is a particular crisis that has happened in the last few

602
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,860
years that has not been here for an awful long time.

603
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:24,620
But if it has, and this phenomenon say the insane von Neumann 3D printer that had a

604
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:30,900
mission to make contact, but we came along far too longer than it's, you know,

605
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,580
best by date, it's not behaving correctly.

606
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:38,060
It's trying to adhere to it, you know, and make first contact in an

607
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,580
understandable way, but it no longer is.

608
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,820
And it's just throwing out damaged stuff, damaged programming, damaged data.

609
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:51,300
And then, I mean, could, if we ever discovered that, and this idea of close

610
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:58,220
technosignatures plays into this game over, because I mean, the thing could act

611
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,300
like an alligator and just say, well, this isn't working.

612
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,980
And suddenly we get EMPed in the stone age, into the stone age, out of nowhere

613
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:10,900
as we advance, or it starts dropping technology on the planet intentionally.

614
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:17,020
Recoveries, you know, Roswell, things like that, where it's saying, I am going to

615
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:21,260
influence your technological development to my end, not your end.

616
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:26,540
To my end, and maybe it's some lonely artificial intelligence created by an

617
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,580
alien civilization, a million or 10 million years ago, that wants the

618
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:35,980
aggregate collection of the biological experience of a species in the form of

619
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:41,460
an AI, do you think that that could be the source of the secrecy that they're

620
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,100
like, wait a minute, they're progressively dropping technology, you

621
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:49,540
know, first materials, you know, and David Grush has sort of suggested that

622
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:55,380
the first recovery of any material from a UFO was empty, and it was just

623
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,780
material science that you could do with it, but maybe it gets progressively

624
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:05,380
more complex as time goes on until it leads you to the creation of a damaging

625
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:10,420
artificial intelligence, general AI, that is able to be compatible with it

626
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,860
and be its companion or something like that, but not us.

627
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,580
And that is our extinction event.

628
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,820
That is why I say this could be the greatest existential threat to humanity

629
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,900
because we don't know any of the rules.

630
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,900
We have nothing to go on.

631
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,220
And it seems to me that we need to find out, right?

632
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:35,700
Well, if that is the reason for the secrecy, that through the decades, a

633
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:42,460
small number of people have been privy to information of that ilk, I think we

634
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,900
are obviously in serious trouble there.

635
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:52,940
There are sort of snippets and hints of information that the reality behind

636
00:51:52,940 --> 00:52:01,460
the UFO phenomenon is just too downright scary to really unleash on the public.

637
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:06,260
I've heard that kind of scenario for a long time, but I've never seen any

638
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:12,300
evidence for it and the best way to wake up the Pentagon, if that actually

639
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:18,260
is happening, I believe that the private sector and the academic sector have

640
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,540
a real sense of momentum now.

641
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:26,100
And I think if there is a sort of a clock ticking and we have a sort of a

642
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:32,900
damaged AI, to use your scenario, that is, and time is ticking down.

643
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:38,380
I think the fastest way of doing this would be a combination of pressure

644
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:43,260
from academia, pressure from the private sector and pressure from Congress.

645
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,100
Otherwise we're all doomed.

646
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,420
Last question, pressure from Congress, the Schumer amendment.

647
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,660
Do you think that's going to pass?

648
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,580
Do you think that's going to do anything?

649
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:56,340
Do you think there are loopholes that the powers that be might be able to

650
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:02,420
continue to hide this and that we end up with another round of more of the same

651
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:07,700
where we're like, well, we hear these rumors and things, but they find ways around it.

652
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:12,260
The lawyers find ways around it and we never actually see any kind of

653
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,940
disclosure, even if we do have artifacts of unknown origin.

654
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,020
Where are we headed?

655
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:26,020
Well, I know for a fact that both Secretary of Defense Austin and also

656
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:31,300
Congressman Mike Turner, whose congressional district includes Wright-Patterson

657
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:36,540
Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, both of these gentlemen have been putting

658
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:42,860
enormous pressure in the Senate and Congress, essentially trying to reverse

659
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,180
the teeth in the Schumer amendment.

660
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:51,860
And I am very, I guess, skeptical about whether or not that language will

661
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:57,260
actually pass in the National Defense Authorization Act because Congressman

662
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:03,260
Mike Turner especially has been very vocal in trying to limit the number of

663
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:08,100
congressional hearings that are going on.

664
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:13,500
And I think it's kind of, there is a clock ticking and I think the more

665
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,860
Secretary of Defense Austin and Congressman Mike Turner put pressure on

666
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:24,500
various congressional people, I think the chances of the National Defense

667
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,700
Authorization Act with all of the amendments, including the Schumer

668
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,940
amendment, I don't see it surviving.

669
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:38,740
To be honest, I think the knives are out and I think there's a lot of evidence

670
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:45,500
that a lot of pressure has been exerted behind the scenes to try to stifle

671
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,700
future congressional hearings.

672
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,740
And, you know, there's a battle going on for the hearts and minds of the

673
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:58,420
Senate and Senate staffers because, as you know, David Grush spent a lot of

674
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:05,100
time, many, many, many hours briefing members of the staff people of the

675
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,980
Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee.

676
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:16,100
So a lot of people are privy to a lot of what David Grush knew or knows.

677
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:23,300
And so the sort of battle is on between the forces that want to stifle this and

678
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:28,780
they're being led by Secretary of Defense Austin and Congressman Mike Turner versus

679
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:35,180
Congressman Tim Burchette and his allies that are trying to increase the pace of

680
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,900
congressional hearings and increase the amount of debriefings that are

681
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,460
happening in various skiffs.

682
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,860
Last question, and I know I said the last one was the last one, but one occurred to

683
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:52,300
me and I want to ask you in your capacity as a scientist, a doctor in

684
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:58,460
biochemistry, so say they towed out a frozen body, you know, some kind of

685
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:03,260
biological material, how do we determine that's of alien origin and not of some

686
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:07,380
artificial origin, artificially created DNA or something like that, you know, a

687
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:12,140
custom organism or something that might have been printed by a von Neumann probe?

688
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:18,100
If we actually do get the goods and there actually is biological materials,

689
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:23,580
which is one of David Grush's claims, where do we start in the science of

690
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,860
trying to figure out where that thing is from if it exists?

691
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:35,820
Well, I'm assuming that if this exists, that there's been a lot of work done

692
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:41,900
already, but definitely from a biological perspective, you've got sort of frozen

693
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:49,220
material that has even the best, the best preservation that exists will not

694
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:53,860
preserve something perfectly decade after decade, you know, you've got liquid

695
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:58,980
nitrogen options and you've got got ways of freezing tissue and preserving tissue,

696
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,220
but there's got to have been decay.

697
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:08,660
So the idea that you can, you can certainly do DNA analysis and you can do

698
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,580
a lot of biochemical analysis.

699
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:17,580
You can do the usual cast of characters, but extrapolating from frozen specimens

700
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:22,980
and from specimens without knowledge of what has been done before, I think is

701
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:28,460
very, very precarious because, you know, the human genome is, we know the human

702
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:35,100
genome is a tremendously flexible and from a biochemical perspective, a

703
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:40,860
tremendously labile template from which to produce a lot.

704
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:49,300
I mean, 3% of the human genome encodes protein, 97% of the genome encodes

705
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:57,100
regulatory sequences and a lot of very sophisticated ways of producing epigenetics.

706
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:03,060
So, I mean, it could be that the human genome is capable of producing either a

707
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:08,860
gray alien or something that looks like a nine foot tall blonde.

708
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:13,300
And the genome is, is, is that flexible and that capable.

709
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,580
So I think a DNA analysis would be insufficient to get any kind of

710
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:23,740
extrapolations going and whether or not data has been collected, I think is a

711
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:29,260
really important facet of this because if data has not been collected and

712
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:34,740
properly stored for the kinds of analysis that would be needed now, I

713
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:40,580
don't think we'd be able to distinguish between artificially generated, you

714
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:45,780
know, life forms from, you know, humans from the future, for example.

715
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:52,740
Could the message lay in the DNA because we're still just first broaching that

716
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,060
whole subject of trying to figure out DNA.

717
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:00,500
Yeah, I think the DNA would be insufficient to answer that question.

718
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,100
Interesting.

719
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,940
So no DNA study, right?

720
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:10,060
Well, I mean, unless, you know, I, I can't remember who it was.

721
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:15,540
Was it, uh, who actually sort of postulated that the, you know, the

722
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,460
ultimate messages will lie in the DNA.

723
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,180
It's wide open territory.

724
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,100
Dr.

725
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,020
Kelleher, thank you for joining us today.

726
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:28,140
Everyone should check out Inside the US Government Covert UFO Program

727
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,900
Initial Revelations by Dr.

728
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,100
Lekatsky, Dr.

729
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,580
Kelleher and George Knapp.

730
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,660
And I hope you'll rejoin us sometime in the future when we get more

731
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,580
information, hopefully we do.

732
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,420
Thank you very much.

733
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,500
It was a very stimulating conversation.
