00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You have fallen into Event Horizon with John-Michael Gadiel.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In today's episode, John is joined by Robin Hansen.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Robin received a BS in Physics from the University of California in 1981, an MS in Physics and an MA in Conceptual Foundations of Science from the University of Chicago in 1984, and a PhD in Social Science from Caltech in 1997.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
He is a proponent of cryonics, and that his ideas have found some acceptance among extropians on the internet, he has since written extensively on the topic.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He also coined the term great filter, referring to whatever prevents dead matter from becoming an expanding and observable intelligence civilization.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He was motivated to seek his doctorate so that his theories would reach a wider audience.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Robin Hansen, welcome to the program.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Great to be here.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Great to be here.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, you have come up with a number of ideas over the years, and I think my first exposure to you was back in the 90s with the idea of the great filter on solution to why when we look into the cosmos, we see no actual evidence of alien civilizations.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
25 years later, what's your view on the great filter today?

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I mean, do you think that we actually have a rather solid candidate one way or another for a great filter?

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, but I would say the great filter was a abstract observation that there was this big parameter that we could identify, which was the filter and that it was large and had components, but couldn't say very much about it numerically.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And my recent efforts in what I've called grabby aliens are an attempt to make a numerical model to estimate the great filter.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So there's a sense in which this is a direct extension of that.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That was sort of setting up the abstract question.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And this is numerically estimating where exactly it is and how big it is.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How do you begin to do that to numerically estimate based on a sampling of one on what could be out there as far as alien civilizations?

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Obviously, Frank Drake did this to an extent with formulating the so-called Drake equation.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But how do you come up with a numerical estimate of what could be out there based on just this single sampling?

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So the Drake equation is a formula with a bunch of constants that you have to guess to estimate the whole model.

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's a model with a bunch of parameters and basically you're using guesses to estimate the parameters of the model.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So instead, we have a three parameter model, each of which we fit to data.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So there's only three parameters and all of them are fit to data.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So none of them are guessed.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now, the parameters are only roughly estimated.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So there's uncertainty in the estimate of each parameter, but it's still each one is based on a particular piece of data.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And so it's no longer guesswork.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You could say you could guess about whether the model is roughly right and challenge whether the model is right or wrong.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But given that you accept roughly this model, it's not sort of picking numbers out of the air and guessing.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's fitting it to data.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So what are the three data sets?

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You know, just what's an overview of that?

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
There are relatively minor things we know, but the surprising thing is you can put them together.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So an analogy I like is long ago in BC, Greeks figured out how far away the sun was and how far away the moon was.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And you might think, how could they possibly figure that out?

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
They hardly need anything.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They just see these disks in the sky.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How could they know how far away?

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But they were clever and taking a few little, what you might think is pretty minor pieces of information and putting them together and saying how far away the sun was.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So that's what we're going to do here.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We're going to put together three pieces of information you might think is hardly anything, but it adds up.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
OK, first piece of information is our date.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We know how long ago the Big Bang was, a little less than 14 billion years ago.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And we know a lot about how long stars will last and when stars form and all sorts of things.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So our date is a data point.

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You might think it's not a big one, but it actually is.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Second data point is the fact that when we look up in the sky and we look for alien civilizations, which, you know, once we realize they might be there, we look for them and we don't see any.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And you might say, well, that's no data, right?

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Zero is a data point.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There are models and parameters, you know, combinations of the model such that we would see stuff.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So we can exclude those model parameter combinations.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The one that say we would see stuff, they can't be right because we're not seeing anything.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's data number two.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Data number three is when we look at the history of life on Earth, we see that stuff happened at particular dates.

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Now you might think, well, what does that say?

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
In particular, there's the first date at which we see any evidence of life at all compared to, say, when life was at all possible on Earth.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And that's roughly 400 million years.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And then the other data point on Earth is that we are now at a moment before life on Earth is no longer possible.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That is, when we project out how we expect the Sun to evolve and Earth to evolve, we see that in roughly 1.1 billion years, life like us will no longer be possible on Earth.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So that's the window life had on Earth to produce something advanced like us.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If it passed that window, it would no longer be possible.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So those times on Earth are the third data point because they are what let us estimate how many hard steps happened on Earth.

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So life on Earth to get to where we are had to go through a bunch of hard steps.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It wasn't that we didn't just appear straight out of the cosmos like this.

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
First, very simple life had to appear, and then it had to go through a sequence of steps.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And some of those steps were hard in the sense that they were really unlikely.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They were so unlikely that, in fact, on a typical planet, they never happened.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So an analogy is cancer in your body.

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There are many trillions of cells.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And by the end of your life, there's a 40% chance that one of your cells has cancer.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And in order for one cell out of all those cells to get cancer, it had to go through six mutations, roughly.

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Each mutation had to happen in that cell.

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And each of these mutations is really rare so that most of your cells in your body never get any of these mutations.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And only a small number ever get two.

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And six doesn't happen at all until the very end.

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And the chance that your body gets cancer is a function of time.

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And it increases with time according to a power, which is this number of steps.

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So since there are six steps, say, in getting cancer, then the chance of getting cancer in any one cell in your body increases with your lifespan by a power of six,

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
which is why almost all cancer happens at the end of your life.

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So that power, the number of hard steps, which then says the power law that will describe how fast stuff shows up, is the third parameter.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So we say life appears on planets somewhat like ours and six hard things have to happen,

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
which is roughly a guess from these two periods of 400 million years and 1.1 billion years.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You put those together and you roughly guess.

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Now it could be as low as three, high as 12, something like that.

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But in that range, so the power is roughly from roughly six, anywhere from three to 12.

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We don't see anything in our sky.

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And the models say if we saw something, they'd be huge.

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So anything we saw would be much bigger than the full moon.

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So we would if there was an alien civilization in the sky, it started somewhere, it was growing.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then at the moment, it was a certain size.

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And we looked out and we could see it.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It would be a huge chunk of the sky.

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And that chunk of the sky would look different somehow.

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Now we don't know exactly how different, but the key assumption here is if a civilization grows

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and it takes over star systems and galaxies, it does something with it.

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We don't know what, but it'll change it somehow in a way we would see.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And so we would look up in the sky, we'd see these basically discs representing spheres in the sky,

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and we would see them and we don't see any of them.

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And that's one of our parameters.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So these are the three pieces of data.

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Our date, seeing nothing in the sky and the history of life on Earth

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and therefore how many hard steps had to happen on Earth.

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Those are the three parameters.

106
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And with these three parameters, we put together a stochastic model of aliens in the universe.

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So now I can just tell you this model is very simple.

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We have these three parameters, each of which is fit to data.

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And now we have a stochastic model of aliens in the universe based on these three parameters.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So here's how the model goes.

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Aliens appear at random places in space.

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Now, actually, they only, say, appear near stars or galaxies, which are clustered.

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They're not all together.

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But at the spatial scales we're talking about, that's not really going to matter much.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So they appear in a random galaxy, say, and they appear at a random time.

116
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But that time isn't, the distribution isn't constant in time.

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That is, very early on, they're very unlikely to appear.

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And then the chance of them appearing increases in time according to this power law,

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
just like the chance increases on Earth according to the same power law over the universe.

120
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They increase in time.

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And then when one appears at a random place and a random time where the chance is increasing with time,

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
that civilization very quickly starts to expand.

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And it expands at a speed.

124
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And they all expand at the same speed.

125
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So basically, there's some maximum feasible speed that once you max out on technology,

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
you expand at that speed and you expand in all directions at that speed.

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And then they just keep expanding at that speed until they meet each other.

128
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And at that point, of course, interesting things will happen, but we don't care.

129
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The universe there is nearby is full of the aliens, one or the other, maybe the fight, who knows,

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
but no longer an empty universe.

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So our basic model just says the universe starts out empty, dead.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
These things appear at particular random points and times.

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They expand until they merge, at which point the universe is full of aliens

134
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and no longer available for new alien civilizations to appear.

135
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So that model has these three parameters.

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
One is the speed at which they expand.

137
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Another is the power law of their increase in time.

138
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And the other is a constant that also goes along with their increase in time.

139
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Each of those parameters can be fit to one of these pieces of data I told you about.

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So the constant in front of the power law, that comes from our current date.

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We are assumed to be a random sample from the distribution of alien times

142
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
when alien civilizations arise because we could do it soon.

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So we don't know if we will expand to go out there.

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Maybe we won't, but if we do it, the assumption is it'll be within 10 million years.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's a pretty long time.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's a short time for cosmology, so it hardly matters.

147
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So within the next 10 million years, we will, if we do it, go out and start expanding.

148
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Pretty soon we will do it at the maximum speed.

149
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That maximum speed we get from the fact we don't see anything in the sky.

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If things expanded slowly, then we would see stuff in the sky.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And the only way we can not see them is if they're expanding so fast

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
that we don't see them until they're almost here.

153
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And that apparently is what the data is telling us, because we don't see anything in the sky.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Either we're very luckily one of the very first or more likely

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
we're one of the middle ones, except they're expanding so fast that

156
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
we won't see them until they get here.

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's the second parameter, the speed.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And the third parameter is the power that we get from the history of life on Earth and the power.

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So now we've got the stochastic model of when aliens appear in space and time.

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And now I can run this model and give you distributions

161
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
over the key questions you might want to know, like how far away is nearest aliens?

162
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So for example, roughly the best middle of the distribution of these estimates is

163
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
alien civilizations of the ones that will expand and fill the universe

164
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
appear roughly once per million galaxies.

165
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So that's rare, right?

166
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Not just once per thousand stars or something, once per million galaxies.

167
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So the nearest one is a long way away.

168
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Which is also why when we ask, OK, when we start expanding out

169
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and we meet them somewhere in the middle, how long in the future would that be?

170
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And it'd be roughly a billion years.

171
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We won't meet them for a billion years on average.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And they're once per million galaxies.

173
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And that's roughly what these three pieces of data fit to the simple model are telling us.

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And the last thing I want to tell you is you might say, well, why should I believe this model?

175
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, you know, maybe it's just wrong.

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Maybe we're all alone and this model is just wrong.

177
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And for that, I would point to our date as being really early.

178
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So ask yourself if the universe would sit and wait empty for life to appear like us

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and nothing would happen to prevent that, then when would it appear?

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And remember, I told you there's this power law that life appears

181
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
as a function of the time on a planet to the power of six.

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Well, turns out our planet is kind of short lived compared to the typical star.

183
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Our planet will last five billion years before it runs out of this deadline.

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The typical star will last five trillion years,

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
a factor of a thousand times longer.

186
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And that power law applies over that whole extended period.

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So the chance of advanced life appearing on one of those longer lived stars

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
is a thousand to the power of six more than appearing on our star.

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's 10 to the 18.

190
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So we're crazy early if the universe would just sit and wait

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
for any advanced life to appear anywhere and then it would be all alone.

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But hey, it would be there.

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So in that scenario, it would eventually appear somewhere,

194
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
but it would be way later.

195
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
We are early.

196
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And the way we understand why we're early is there's a deadline.

197
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This model I told you, the universe fills up,

198
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
roughly a billion years, they all meet, everything's full.

199
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's too late to appear.

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You couldn't wait that long to appear.

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And whatever advanced life is going to appear,

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
it has to appear before the deadline of the aliens filling up the universe.

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And one last parameter is where are we in the distribution of aliens?

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Roughly halfway.

205
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And that means at the moment,

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
roughly half of the volume of the universe is full of alien civilizations.

207
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And you say, but I don't see them.

208
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm looking out there. I don't see them.

209
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I said, yeah, that's the selection effect.

210
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You won't see them till they're almost here because they're growing really fast.

211
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's sort of terrifying though, because say, for example,

212
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
by some trick of nature that you end up with two civilizations in a galaxy

213
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and one of them decides to expand very rapidly near the speed of light.

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The other one at the disadvantage doesn't see it until they're coming,

215
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
literally, especially if it's almost the speed of light,

216
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
which is difficult, but even still.

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Right. Now, you know, a galaxy is maybe 100,000 light years across.

218
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So if it's expanding at half the speed of light,

219
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
it only takes 200,000 years to get from one side to the other at the most.

220
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
OK, so we're talking about alien civilizations appearing at random

221
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
across a 14 billion year period.

222
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So if an alien civilization appeared somewhere else in our galaxy 200,000 years ago,

223
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
that's a crazy time coincidence with us appearing now.

224
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's almost never going to be that close in time.

225
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Either they'll appear later in the future, at which point we will preclude them

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and they won't happen because we will get there first,

227
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
or they would have gotten here in the past and we would never be here now.

228
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So there's just very unlikely that there'll be that sort of conflict.

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
In order to be that sort of conflict, you'd have to appear in time

230
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
with such a tight time coincidence that it's just crazy and it's not going to happen.

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The weird idea that, all right, so we formed in a stellar nursery

232
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and we know that the sun has siblings.

233
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We see chemically similar stars that appear to originate in the same birth cluster.

234
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So we see this.

235
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Well, back then, before the dispersion of that cluster,

236
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
we might have a situation of panspermic life.

237
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So it arises here or somewhere else and spreads into the cluster as it's dispersing,

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and you end up with a number of related civilizations that spawn from the same abiogenesis.

239
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
How does that change things?

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So I gave you the simplest model to start with.

241
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
In the simplest model, civilizations appear independently,

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and then they grow and each one has no correlation with the others.

243
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If they have a common origin, then there's a correlation,

244
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and that means they're going to appear closer in space and time to each other

245
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
than they would if they were drawn independently.

246
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So it certainly is possible, and we can discuss some of the reasons that it might actually be true,

247
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
that life appeared before Earth.

248
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So the peak of star formation in our galaxy and in the universe, it seems,

249
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
is roughly four billion years after the origin.

250
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We are now 14 billion years.

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Our star was formed four and a half billion years ago.

252
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Our star was formed well after the peak.

253
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It could be that some star formed near the peak when most stars form,

254
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and it developed life on it, and then that star, after five billion years,

255
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
seeded our stellar nursery.

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So this process would be some rock smashes into that planet,

257
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
kicks off another rock on that planet.

258
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Inside that rock is some life.

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It drifts, I don't know, maybe a million years,

260
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
while the inside of that life becomes, you know,

261
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
desecitated and maybe, you know, shrinks and suffers radiation damage,

262
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and maybe the vast majority of the little cells there die out,

263
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
but one or two remain.

264
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And when that hits our stellar nursery,

265
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
our stellar nursery has lots of rocks flying back and forth

266
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
all over the place with all these stars.

267
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And there might be a thousand, ten thousand stars all together in the same stellar nursery,

268
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
all very close, lots of rocks flying back and forth.

269
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So this rock lands on some place.

270
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It might be a cloud, an asteroid, a planet,

271
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
that has water and light and biochemicals,

272
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and that little cell lands in that pool and grows.

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And now it grows into the, fills this rock,

274
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and then this rock smashes into other rocks,

275
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and then life spreads, maybe spreads across, you know, many planets,

276
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
many, across many star systems.

277
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And then very quickly, within ten million years, these stars drift apart.

278
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
They are no longer all together.

279
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
They are now, and they spread in a ring basically around the center of the galaxy.

280
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
At our radius, there'd be, you know, another thousand or so stars

281
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
all spread out in this ring, each developing life,

282
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
whatever life it had on its planet.

283
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Each of them are going to go through this hard steps process, right?

284
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Now, the idea would be some of those steps already happened on the previous planet.

285
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So if six steps happen, we estimate roughly on Earth,

286
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
then maybe 12 steps overall.

287
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Six of the steps happened on a previous planet.

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Let's call it Eden.

289
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And then six more steps needed to happen to get to where we are.

290
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And on all these other planets,

291
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
they're starting to go through step seven, step eight, as best they can.

292
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But of course, these are hard steps.

293
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Most of them never make it to step seven.

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
A few of those only make it to step eight.

295
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And, you know, the chances are maybe only one of them

296
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
ever gets to step 12, where we are, in which case we're alone.

297
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But maybe these steps weren't so hard.

298
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Maybe one of the other planets got through all remaining steps before us.

299
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Then, now, if we say when would that happen,

300
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
the statistics say, well, look, you know,

301
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
it got a four billion year period to do these things,

302
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
then that would have happened at least a hundred million years ago.

303
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The idea that it would have happened even less than one million years

304
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
is really a big time coincidence.

305
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And it's going to be more than a million years.

306
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So think 10 million, think a hundred million years.

307
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
A hundred million years ago,

308
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
this other planet achieved our level of civilization

309
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and soon afterward was capable of expanding into the galaxy and the universe,

310
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
like these other gravity civilizations.

311
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And that's where we have to start our new story.

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Because if you postulate that, we've got a problem.

313
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We say, OK, a hundred million years ago,

314
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
some civilization shows up in another star system in our galaxy.

315
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's advanced.

316
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's capable of becoming grabby and expanding into the universe

317
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
at half the speed of light.

318
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Within 10 million years, it starts to do that.

319
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And then we wouldn't have a place to be, right?

320
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
They would have come here and replaced us with whatever they are.

321
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And we would no longer be who we are here.

322
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So we've got a problem.

323
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We can't really postulate panspermia siblings like this

324
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
who reach our level if we also presume that they become grabby.

325
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Because, you know, even if they were nice and decided to pass us by

326
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and leave our little star system as a zoo,

327
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
the universe around us would look really different.

328
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
There'd be a whole alien civilization everywhere we looked, all around.

329
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Everything we would see right outside of our star system

330
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
would look really different if we were in the middle

331
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
of an advanced alien civilization.

332
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So obviously, we aren't.

333
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So we have to assume, to make any sense of the scenario,

334
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
that, okay, they did not go grabby.

335
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So one scenario is, okay, they died.

336
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Okay.

337
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And someday we'll go out there and find their ruins and hear their story.

338
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What else can we postulate?

339
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, one might be that they're still alive and they didn't go grabby.

340
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And that means they had to choose not to go grabby.

341
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So you have to realize a civilization is a big thing.

342
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's got a lot of parts, right?

343
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And in order for a civilization to go grabby,

344
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
all it takes is for one of their parts to head out into the universe

345
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
and start colonizing and have descendants.

346
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The rest of that civilization can not like that fact.

347
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oppose it even.

348
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Find it repulsive.

349
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It doesn't matter.

350
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
If just one part does it, that's what happens.

351
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's selection. That's evolution.

352
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So this civilization would have had to prevent

353
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
any one part of itself from doing that.

354
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And it would have to successfully do that

355
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The 100 million years that they've been around.

356
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So they had to be kind of anal about this, right?

357
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Very thorough and systematic and really attentive to making sure

358
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
no part of themselves over 100 million years

359
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
ever leaves to go colonize the universe.

360
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That would have to be the kind of aliens who would be on this other planet

361
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
if they existed.

362
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And I'm not saying they do exist, but it's worth walking through the scenario.

363
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What if?

364
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah, this is if there was penpermia siblings, which is plausible.

365
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And one of them showed up before us out there,

366
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
then this is the kind of aliens that have to be.

367
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Now, there's also the possibility of going the opposite direction

368
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and asking the question if Earth life might actually be a little bit later

369
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
than it normally is.

370
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
For example, the leap from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life

371
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
took like 1.8 billion years on Earth.

372
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, what happens if that can happen earlier?

373
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So and that simple life can make a leap faster

374
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and get a head start for civilization.

375
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But again, we don't see the giant circles in the sky of evidence

376
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
that you would see of alien civilization.

377
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So my question here is what if they're subtle

378
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and that their technology is not obviously visible

379
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
until you reach a certain level of being able to observe it,

380
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
say, building a radio telescope of sufficient size

381
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
to actually pick up their signals,

382
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
or maybe they don't build Dyson spheres and Dyson swarms

383
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and things that would be all that obvious.

384
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But when you get exoplanet-hunting telescopes better than JWST,

385
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
you start to see biosignatures and technosignatures

386
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and obvious terraforming and things like that.

387
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Is it possible that we're just still too early as far as instruments

388
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
to be able to make a call on grabby aliens and say,

389
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
well, we can eliminate that there are a lot of these out there

390
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
just based on what we have,

391
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
or do we need another 100 years of development

392
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
before we can really say?

393
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So the question is, we see some parts of the universe

394
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and we don't see others.

395
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So for example, we know there's some form of dark matter

396
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and dark energy out there, and we're not sure what it is,

397
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and therefore we know that we can't see it very well.

398
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But there is stuff we do see, stars and galaxies and clouds and comets,

399
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and they could, of course, in principle,

400
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
be uninterested in the stuff we see

401
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and interested in the stuff we don't see,

402
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and if they were diverted enough to that other stuff,

403
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
then maybe they would just spend all their time and energy

404
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
with that other stuff that we don't see.

405
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But if you think about life on Earth and all the places it goes,

406
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
a simple rule would be life goes everywhere it can.

407
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's not making choices, it's doing everything.

408
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Life goes to the bottom of the sea and it goes to the top of mountains

409
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and it goes into caves and it goes in the air.

410
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It goes everywhere it can.

411
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The reason, if you see a place that's lifeless,

412
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it's because life couldn't get there.

413
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
If the moon is lifeless, it's because life on Earth couldn't get to the moon.

414
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Or if you see down 20 kilometers under the ground

415
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and you don't see life there, it's because it's too hot

416
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
or there's no energy or whatever it is, right?

417
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So the issue is the stuff we see, it might not be everything,

418
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
but we know it's useful stuff.

419
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
We're pretty sure that an advanced civilization could make use of it.

420
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
They might like other stuff better,

421
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
but again, they would go everywhere they could

422
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
unless they had some sort of a rule that they had imposed against it.

423
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So you might be a civilization that says,

424
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
leave the baryons alone, that's the stuff we see.

425
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Baryons and the photons, those are holy and must not be touched,

426
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
but you may go and be fertile among the dark energy and matter.

427
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So if they've got some sort of a holy script that tells them

428
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
to only consume the dark matter and energy

429
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
but not to touch the baryons,

430
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
well, okay, fine, they might be ignoring the baryons.

431
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But now they need to enforce this rule really strictly.

432
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It can't be just some of them only want to do the dark matter

433
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and not the baryons.

434
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It has to be that all of them agreed to prevent any of them

435
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
from touching the baryons,

436
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
because there's a lot of baryons and they're kind of tasty.

437
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
They can be used for stuff.

438
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You have to realize an advanced civilization

439
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
isn't tied to one particular kind of matter.

440
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It can figure out how to convert itself

441
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
into a form that could use another.

442
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
We will certainly be that in the next 10 million years.

443
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And advanced civilization is almost surely artificial.

444
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
They're made in factories, explicit designs.

445
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So they can redesign themselves and restructure themselves

446
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and make new versions that are better suited

447
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
to whatever new environments they want.

448
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So they could definitely come and use the baryons

449
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
if they wanted to.

450
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
If they're not using the baryons,

451
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
it's because not only do some of them not want to,

452
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
they've all set up a rule that none of them can't.

453
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But that could be true.

454
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And if it were true,

455
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
then there would be these disks in the sky.

456
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
We just wouldn't be quite sure how to see them.

457
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And eventually we might figure out the right kind of frequency

458
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
or the kind of detector to see.

459
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Maybe it's neutrinos.

460
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And then we would be looking at the right thing.

461
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And then we would see the disks.

462
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And so our analysis predicts, well,

463
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
how big are the disks going to be and how many of them

464
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
as a function of these three parameters in the model.

465
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And then, of course, once you see the disks,

466
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
you can use that to fit the model.

467
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So it might then be true all the expansion rate

468
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
is much less than the speed of light

469
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
because, woo, look at all these disks.

470
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And of course, it might be that we're already

471
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
in one of these spheres of influence.

472
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
There's already an alien civilization all around us.

473
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We're their pets.

474
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We just don't know it.

475
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We'll find out eventually.

476
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
The zoo hypothesis.

477
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But before we get to that,

478
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
the idea of faster than light travel

479
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
seems to get knocked out with this idea

480
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
because if anyone ever develops faster than light travel,

481
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
then just by the nature of relativity,

482
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
they're going to have time travel.

483
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Right. Exactly.

484
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Which means that they would be here.

485
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And you would see the sphere anyway.

486
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So it sort of eliminates that anybody ever does that, right?

487
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Right. So when you assume the speed of light is the limit,

488
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
then there's what we call our backward light cone.

489
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And the puzzle is why do we see nothing in our backward light cone?

490
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And that's a substantial puzzle.

491
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's the great filter.

492
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
That's exactly what we're talking about.

493
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And our explanation is there's a selection effect.

494
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
If they were in our backward light cone,

495
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
then they'd be here instead of us.

496
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So we were only going to be in the cones where they're not.

497
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
If you postulate faster than light travel,

498
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
then you're going to say,

499
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
well, it's not just why aren't they in our backward light cone.

500
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's why aren't they anywhere in the connected universe?

501
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Because they could have got here from there

502
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
wherever in space time they are.

503
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So now we ask, why aren't they here from anywhere?

504
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And that's a much harder question.

505
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Basically, well, there must not be anybody in all of space time.

506
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That's why they aren't here now,

507
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
which could be, except we're crazy early.

508
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So now we have to explain why are we so early?

509
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Well, that gets into, you know,

510
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I mean, you could ask another question along those lines is,

511
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
why are we around the star that we are instead of a red dwarf,

512
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
given that chances are, statistically,

513
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
we should be around a red dwarf, but we're not.

514
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We're around a weird sort of minority type of star in the universe.

515
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
We're weird in a number of ways.

516
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
For example, our galaxy is unusually large

517
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
compared to other galaxies.

518
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It turns out we're in a wall of galaxies

519
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and we're unusually like in a certain kind of wall

520
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
compared to other places.

521
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Of course, our place in the solar system

522
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
is in a certain distance from the center.

523
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm sorry, in the galaxy.

524
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
We're at a certain distance from the center galaxy.

525
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Why not far out? Why not closer?

526
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So for every way in which we're unusual,

527
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
you might think, oh, that's a clue that we couldn't be otherwise.

528
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Maybe small galaxies just can't support a dance slice.

529
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Or maybe you'll have to be on one of these galaxy walls

530
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
to support advanced life.

531
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Or maybe you've got to be around a star like ours.

532
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So that's a line people have tried to take.

533
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Some people have tried to say,

534
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
small stars that last longer can't support advanced life.

535
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And then they point to things that are different there

536
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and say, maybe that's why.

537
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And there are some things that are different.

538
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So small stars have about as many planets

539
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
that are about as big as big stars.

540
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So it's not about the number of planets or their size.

541
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It's not about the radius.

542
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
They're about as many that are roughly the right distance away

543
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
from their star to be a plausible planet.

544
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So none of those are the problem.

545
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But small stars do have bigger solar flares more often.

546
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Their stars have these bigger eruptions

547
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
that fry whatever the flare goes to.

548
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Small stars, the planets around them have more tidal lock.

549
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That is, because the planets last longer,

550
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
tidal rock is the thing that takes time.

551
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So Mercury, for example, at the moment,

552
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
faces the sun always around.

553
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And our moon always faces the Earth.

554
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So those are two things that are in tidal lock

555
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
in our solar system.

556
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But most planets in our tidal system

557
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
are not yet in tidal lock.

558
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But give them a trillion years, and they might be.

559
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Tidal lock is also something that will happen later

560
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
in these long-lived star systems,

561
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
the ones with the small stars.

562
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And it might also be that continental drift

563
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
slows down and stops.

564
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That is, continental drift happens early in the solar system

565
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and not later.

566
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So if you say, aha, the process that

567
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
produces advanced life like us, it needs either continental drift

568
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
or it needs not having tidal lock

569
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
or it needs not very many big solar flares,

570
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
then you say, aha, that's why we are on the shorter-lived,

571
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
bigger star, because these other ones no longer qualify.

572
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
All right.

573
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So the key question here really is, how similar does

574
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
another planet have to be to our dear Earth

575
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
for advanced life to appear?

576
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The closer it has to be than the more that other star

577
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
has to be just like ours in order to have the features that ours does.

578
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And I think sort of a generic response to all of these things

579
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
is to consider ocean worlds.

580
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Now, Earth was initially an ocean world.

581
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That is, initially, Earth had no land.

582
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And it took maybe a billion years for Earth to have land.

583
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But even so, that ocean is pretty shallow,

584
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
only 10 kilometers deep or something, right?

585
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Actually, about half of the planets of our size planet

586
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
are ocean worlds with oceans hundreds of kilometers or more deep.

587
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
On an ocean world, if the life is down in the ocean,

588
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
solar flares aren't a problem.

589
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Solar flares just don't penetrate very far into the ocean,

590
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
maybe a millimeter, and that's about it, okay?

591
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Solar flares aren't an issue.

592
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Neither is continental drift, because there are no continents.

593
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's an ocean world.

594
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And tidal lock isn't a problem either.

595
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That is, in a deep ocean world, you'd get strong currents.

596
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
If one side is always facing each other, the other is cold,

597
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the other is rich, but the water can move.

598
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So you get strong currents circulating the water around the planet,

599
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
which would create energy and be a source of life,

600
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
energy for life as well as sunlight.

601
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So if you think ocean worlds could support a dance life,

602
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
then these problems with long-lived planets are not really problems.

603
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
What becomes a problem on an ocean world, though,

604
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
is smelting metal and doing everything you need to build a rocket

605
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and to get off into space and become a gravity alien.

606
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You're basically stuck on your ocean world and your oceanic environment.

607
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And if it's a planet that doesn't really, you know, has permanent cloud cover,

608
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
you may not even ever even know that space is out there.

609
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Right, so when we're looking at the history of life on Earth

610
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and trying to guess what's hard or easy, the time durations are important.

611
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So we're now at 4.5 billion years, and so it took roughly 4.5 billion years

612
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
for life to go through its various hard steps to get to where we are.

613
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Now, you know, we had ancestors were not humans a million years ago.

614
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
We've only had civilization in much of any form in the last 10 or 20,000 years

615
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and only smelting metal at any substantial degree in the last few centuries

616
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and only being able to leave the Earth in the last few decades,

617
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
which are really short time periods.

618
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Imagine that on an ocean world, smelting metal

619
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and making things to leave the planet like starships was a thousand times harder.

620
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It took a thousand times longer, which means we take 300 years

621
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and we go to 300,000 years and we're still talking a really short time.

622
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So pretty much anything that happened in the last million years is easy,

623
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
or at least it was easy on Earth.

624
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It might be much harder elsewhere, but it's got to be harder by an enormous factor

625
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
for it to be relevant to the cosmological timescales.

626
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
What if it takes 10 million years on an ocean world

627
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
for them to figure out how to smelt metal

628
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and another 10 million years to figure out how to make a spaceship?

629
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, they've got lots of time. 20 million years is just not much time.

630
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I know we're all proud of the stuff we've done in the last few millennia,

631
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and we should be, but in terms of cosmology,

632
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
it wasn't hard because it happened really fast.

633
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
That's true. You know, anatomically modern humans,

634
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
it's what, 220,000 years? Well, that's nothing compared to 4.5 billion years.

635
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Exactly.

636
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Now, once humanity becomes the grabby aliens in this scenario,

637
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
once, you know, 10 million years where we're out colonizing,

638
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
we can do that in relatively short order, a few million years,

639
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
at some, like, easy speeds, you know, the old von Neumann idea.

640
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
We could fill the galaxy in a short time, certainly.

641
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah, and once we fill it.

642
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
The rest of the universe will take billions of years.

643
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Well, of course. The galaxy will be quick in geologic time.

644
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So once we do that and we become a galaxy-spanning empire,

645
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
you know, there's somebody that's a hundred million light years away

646
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
that we'll probably never know about, whatever.

647
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But then we become the aliens because then we all start forgetting

648
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
that of our common origin.

649
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So you end up with a populated galaxy in the far future

650
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
that's made up of effective pen-spermic aliens,

651
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
but just done in a different way than if it would have happened

652
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
early on with microbial life, right?

653
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So a grabby alien civilization is just the name for this cone of expansion.

654
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
An expansion that originates from a common origin.

655
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And in principle, that cone can include enormous variety

656
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and conflict and evolution.

657
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And they may not be very fond of their neighbors or their distant cousins.

658
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's entirely possible.

659
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
From the point of view of, like, explaining why the universe looks empty,

660
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
that's all irrelevant, but we still might be interested in thinking about it.

661
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
In anticipation of that, civilizations may pause and wonder

662
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
whether she should wait a little bit before they start this process,

663
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
because they should wonder, is there some way we could set this up

664
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
so that it goes smoother later on, or do we just got to let all the sparks fly?

665
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
This brings up the issue of quiet aliens.

666
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That is, we are now quiet aliens.

667
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I said within 10 million years, we could become loud, but we might not.

668
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And for example, the pen-spermia siblings,

669
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
they would have to not be loud aliens or they'd be here instead of us.

670
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So there's going to be some rate of quiet alien civilizations.

671
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And the question is, what's the ratio between the quiet and the loud?

672
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That ratio is relevant for two things.

673
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
One is, what's our future chances?

674
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So say if there's a thousand quiet to every loud,

675
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
then that means we only have a one in a thousand chance to become loud,

676
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
because 999 out of them don't.

677
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The other thing it's relevant for is how close are the nearest quiet?

678
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So again, the three data points we gave, we fit the statistical model,

679
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
we say the nearest loud one is roughly one in a million galaxies,

680
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
say if there's a thousand quiet for every loud,

681
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
then the nearest quiet one is only one in a thousand galaxies away, right?

682
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And they're closer.

683
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So if you hope to look out and see the remnants

684
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
or current live version of a quiet alien civilization out there,

685
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
you're hoping this ratio is large.

686
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
If it's a ratio of two, then you've got to look for a million galaxies

687
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
before you see one, and even just the ruins, right?

688
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
If the ratio is a thousand to one or a million to one,

689
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
well now you've got a much better chance of seeing them.

690
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
That's good for you searchers, but on the other hand,

691
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
our chances in the future are less.

692
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Now maybe you didn't want to become grabby,

693
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
so hey, that doesn't bother you,

694
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
but the most likely way that we won't become grabby is because we can't,

695
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
like we die or something, so that should bother you.

696
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You should at least want the option to become grabby.

697
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Oh, but there are many scenarios there, though.

698
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
For example, the unemployed alien civilization

699
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
that creates an artificial intelligence so capable

700
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
that they drive themselves to unemployment

701
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and can't become grabby because everybody's just sitting there

702
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
in a lotus-eater existence or completely broke

703
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
in a completely different, and I know you're an economist,

704
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
a completely different reordered economy forced by the development

705
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
of artificial generalized intelligence, right?

706
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
In a scenario where artificial intelligence shows up and it's very capable,

707
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
then it just replaces the previous biological features,

708
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and then it can go on to do all the things they might,

709
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
so it's not really prevented from doing things

710
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
unless somehow its previous biological ancestors

711
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
are controlling it somehow to prevent it.

712
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Artificial intelligence is just as capable or more capable

713
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
of expanding and being grabby than squishy bio-creatures are,

714
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
so I wouldn't predict that because AI shows up,

715
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that means they aren't grabby.

716
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I would predict more of the opposite.

717
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That's all going to more predict that they will become grabby sooner and faster.

718
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Or less so.

719
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
If you have just one overarching artificial intelligence

720
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
that says nothing's becoming grabby,

721
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
there's your ability to not have that extra...

722
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
If you have a correlation between degree of central control

723
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and how artificial they are,

724
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
but I don't see a particular reason to expect that correlation.

725
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I think humans can be centrally controlled,

726
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and so can machines, and it's about the same for both.

727
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Now, my last question for you before we go is the question of UAP.

728
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I know you've been speaking on that, and I'm intrigued by it,

729
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
but don't quite know, you know, what to think.

730
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm a skeptic by nature.

731
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
But at the same time, I think I've seen enough now

732
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
to say that there's something weird going on.

733
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
What's your view on that?

734
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Could that be an example of a weird, subtle example of grabby aliens?

735
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So it wouldn't be grabby aliens, but it might be quiet.

736
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So first of all, if we say weird stuff is reported,

737
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
we've got four major classes of explanations here.

738
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
First class is mistakes and delusions, right?

739
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
There's just nothing, and people are just screwed up

740
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and messy and messed up, and that happens, right?

741
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Second major category of explanation is hoaxes and lies, right?

742
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
People are purposely misleading us, and for whatever reason,

743
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
they want us to believe these things, but they're just not there.

744
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
They're making them up.

745
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Fourth is, okay, this is real, and these are real things,

746
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and they really have powerful abilities,

747
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
and it's some sort of hidden earth organization somewhere

748
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
that has much more abilities than they've ever owned up to,

749
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
and for some reason, they're letting it leak that they have it in some way,

750
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and you're trying to guess who they could be and why.

751
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And the fourth category is, it's a hidden non-earth organization,

752
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
i.e. aliens, right?

753
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Those are the four categories of explanation you've got to come up with now.

754
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
There's two things you need to do in an analysis like this.

755
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
We call a Bayesian analysis a way to draw a conclusion,

756
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
or we'll call it posterior, or beliefs after we've considered the evidence,

757
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and there are two contributions to that.

758
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
One is a prior, just based on other considerations before you see the evidence.

759
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What are the relative chances of the different hypotheses?

760
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And the second is a likelihood.

761
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Given each hypothesis, how well does that explain the data you see?

762
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
In this space, on the likelihood, I don't feel I'm very expert.

763
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
The comment I would make is just,

764
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
the delusion hypothesis doesn't seem to work very well for me.

765
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That is, it's really hard to believe that the most extreme cases here are honest mistakes.

766
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I could believe a hoax.

767
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's harder to believe an honest mistake for the most dramatic cases here.

768
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But otherwise, I'm not an expert in all the very particular of the reports.

769
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
But what I am an expert in from this Grabby Aliens work is some of the priors.

770
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
In particular, the aliens prior.

771
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So some people look at these reports and they say,

772
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
it's so crazy unlikely that this could possibly be aliens

773
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
that I don't care what you show me.

774
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Because it just couldn't be this, right?

775
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And yes, if you have a prior that's really, really low, that's what you should do.

776
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You should say, you know, you claim these are angels and I say angels are crazy.

777
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Angels don't happen. Angels are not a thing.

778
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And so I'm just going to dismiss your reports of angels, right?

779
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But the question is, okay, but how high is the prior?

780
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Is it crazy low or not?

781
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So that's what I can address through this analysis of aliens.

782
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I have to say, okay, they can't be the simple independent Grabby Aliens, right?

783
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Those are once per million galaxies.

784
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
There's very little chance they would be here.

785
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That's crazy unlikely, right?

786
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That they're here.

787
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But we go with this Penns Bermia sibling story we were talking about before.

788
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I go, okay, what's the chance that, you know, we arose from Penns Bermia?

789
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You know, one in 10 or one in 100.

790
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
What's the chance that that's, you know, spread life to other planets besides ours?

791
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
That's pretty high.

792
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
What's the chance that one of those got to our level before us?

793
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Maybe a third.

794
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And what's the chance then that this alien civilization now does all the weird stuff

795
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
that we have to postulate to explain the rest of what we see?

796
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So what's the weird stuff?

797
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So one part of the weird stuff is, look, they didn't take over the universe.

798
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
They didn't take over the galaxy.

799
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's all empty out there, right?

800
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
So we have to postulate this rule they had that they enforced against expansion.

801
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What's the chance of that?

802
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I don't know. Maybe another one.

803
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Third.

804
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Now we have to say, okay, and that gives us a reason why they'd be here.

805
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Okay, we don't need to postulate much there.

806
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Okay, they have this rule against expansion.

807
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
They see us out there away.

808
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
They see that we might violate their rule.

809
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So they'd have to make an exception from the usual no expansion thing

810
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
to send an expedition here to what convinced us to follow the rule.

811
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
We'll have to postulate they didn't want to just kill us.

812
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That doesn't, you know, that doesn't seem terribly unlikely.

813
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'll give that a two-thirds chance.

814
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
They didn't want to kill us.

815
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And so they're here to persuade us not to violate the rule.

816
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Okay, but we haven't explained everything yet that we need to,

817
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
because when they're here, okay, if the UFOs that we see are aliens,

818
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
then there's something weird about them.

819
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The following thing.

820
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
A civilization a hundred million years more advanced than us

821
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
could either be completely visible.

822
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
They can make themselves really obvious.

823
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
They wouldn't have to, like, be at their edge of visibility.

824
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
They could just, you know, show up and slap us in the face or whatever

825
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
and just make it really obvious they're here.

826
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Or they could be completely invisible.

827
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
There's no reason in order to see anything they wanted to see here

828
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
that they would ever have to make us notice it, right?

829
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Those would be both completely within their abilities

830
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
of a hundred million year more advanced civilization than us, right?

831
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And then apparently they're not doing either of those things.

832
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Apparently they're hanging out at the edge of our visibility,

833
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
let us seeing a few things about them and not much else.

834
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Okay, so that's kind of weird.

835
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So in order to have a hypothesis to explain this observation,

836
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
we're going to have to add something to the scenario to make that make sense.

837
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So again, they're here.

838
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
They're trying to convince us to follow the rule.

839
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And they're doing this weird thing.

840
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So what story can I come up with there?

841
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And I've got to give it, you know, prior one and third or something to that.

842
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And my story is going to be, well, they're one to domesticate us.

843
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
How do we domesticate other animals?

844
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Most animals have a status hierarchy who are social animals.

845
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The way to domesticate a social animal is to sit at the top of the status hierarchy,

846
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
to be the top dog, top horse, whatever it is.

847
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You have to show you're stronger, more powerful,

848
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
more impressive than them and peaceful enough that they can go along with you.

849
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That's how we domesticate animals and how we domesticate ourselves.

850
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Humans have domesticated themselves.

851
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Rulers, empires, domesticate humans.

852
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And they do it the same way.

853
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
They sit at the top of the status hierarchy.

854
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
The emperor sits on his throne, big temple, his great crown, his great army.

855
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And you say, yeah, he's top dog. Yep.

856
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm going to follow this guy. Right?

857
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So that's their plan.

858
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
The plan is to be here and domesticate us.

859
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
How? By being really impressive,

860
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
showing that they're really much better, more impressive than the rest of us,

861
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
being here, not somewhere else, and being pretty, you know, and being relatively peaceful.

862
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Not hurting us too much. Right?

863
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Okay. But you might say, well, couldn't they do that by just, you know, being really obvious?

864
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That would seem to make sense, except now, let's think about it.

865
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
We already know that humans can hate other humans for really small differences.

866
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Other humans around the world who are almost exactly like us,

867
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
we pick some small little thing and then we get really mad about that.

868
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And then we hate them when we fight wars. Right?

869
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So that's a problem because these are really actually aliens.

870
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
They are actually very different from us.

871
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And no doubt, if they just showed everything about us, we'd find something we hate.

872
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Maybe they eat babies like it's not a deal for them.

873
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's kind of cute, but we hate eating babies.

874
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So, you know, there's just no way that they could domesticate us if they if we knew they ate babies.

875
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So the strategy of domesticating us, it has an obstacle they can't reveal very much about themselves.

876
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
They have to be pretty much just at the edge of our visibility, impressive.

877
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
They have to convince us they're there, or they're peaceful, but they can't say very much.

878
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So that's what they've done.

879
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
You might say, well, what about like the whole agenda of like not wanting to expand?

880
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Shouldn't they have to explain that to us? And no, they don't.

881
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
We can figure that out. We just did.

882
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
That's the obvious reason why they'd be here.

883
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Look, there's the empty universe. They obviously didn't take it.

884
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Here they are. So why would they be here and not have gone anywhere else?

885
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Well, apparently they don't want us to go anywhere else either.

886
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So that would be the story.

887
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So, again, my challenge here was to come up with my best explanation,

888
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
given everything I know about the universe, of how we would make sense of UFO sales.

889
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm not saying they are.

890
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm saying that's part of the analysis task we have to do in order to consider the evidence.

891
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So I say the prior here is maybe one in a thousand, one in ten thousand.

892
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That means, you know, if you had no evidence, you would think that's pretty unlikely, right?

893
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But if you have some evidence, you've got to look at it.

894
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So think of a murder trial.

895
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Like, when somebody accuses somebody of murder, we have a trial.

896
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Now, you could say, what's the prior probability of a murder?

897
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
We'd say, OK, look, roughly one in a thousand people, when they die, are murdered. OK?

898
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And each person, if they're murdered, has maybe a thousand people around them who might have done it.

899
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So for any one of them, the prior is it's one in a million.

900
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
We still allow a murder trial because ordinary evidence is quite capable of overcoming a one in a million prior.

901
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
That's what happens in murder trials.

902
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Of course, the very fact that they're accused already raises your estimate.

903
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But that's not supposed to be enough.

904
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You're supposed to actually look at the evidence in addition to the accusation to verify that, in fact, there was a good reason to accuse them of murder.

905
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
There was actually evidence to support it.

906
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So you look at the evidence, you see that's enough, you convict, because evidence can quite commonly overcome a one in a million prior.

907
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
So this is a one in a thousand, one in ten thousand prior.

908
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah, evidence can overcome that.

909
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You have to look at it, consider it carefully, consider the other possible hypotheses.

910
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
But yeah, it's possible.

911
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So the answer is that's what you got to do here.

912
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You got to look at the evidence.

913
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You got to take it seriously.

914
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You can't just wave your hands and say, that's crazy.

915
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But you'd also don't just embrace it just because somebody's claiming it.

916
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I mean, you have to look at the evidence.

917
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Well, I think that I think the problem is the evidence that it's not overwhelming at this point yet.

918
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Maybe it will be with, you know, collect data collection and things like that, which there are pushes for.

919
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But at this point, I don't know that we have that that huge data set that we would need to actually say that we have evidence.

920
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
We just have a potential, I think.

921
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
What do you think on that?

922
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Well, I mean, I've read some books and watched some documentaries.

923
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And if we look at the dozen or so most often mentioned cases, there's a lot going on there.

924
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
You know, like take the Nimitz case, the U.S. Navy, you know, a lot of different kinds of instruments.

925
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
They're being used to measure a lot of different people, a lot of different angles.

926
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You know, you've got a lot of confirmation there.

927
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So it's hard to say that one guy was drunk or he misremembered.

928
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And that doesn't only work for these things, right?

929
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
There's something more going on there.

930
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
You got to you got to pay attention.

931
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So there's a bunch of these things where that's it's weird.

932
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And there's a lot going on.

933
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And maybe if you dig in, you'll eventually get, you know, so again, it's about how skeptical you're going to be.

934
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
If you're really going to insist and you haven't proved it yet because you basically have a very strong reluctance.

935
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Believe it's like setting a really low prior.

936
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
If you're willing to do that, then, yeah, I mean, almost everything anybody tries to convince you of.

937
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You cannot believe if you you try hard enough to say, how do I know that wasn't a camera there?

938
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
How do I know this guy didn't lie?

939
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Or how do I know you didn't swap that when I turn my head?

940
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Yeah, it's really hard to prove stuff when you're that skeptical.

941
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
But I don't think you should be that skeptical.

942
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You should be skeptical according to the prior you can calculate.

943
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That's what I calculated.

944
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It does seem to be there.

945
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
A fairly decent chance.

946
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You know, not the greatest chance, but a fairly decent chance that maybe that's what we're saying.

947
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But then you get back into grab the aliens and start trying to figure out exactly what they're doing and why.

948
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
That's why it's nice to have your best explanation, because then if you believe it, that tells you a whole bunch of other things.

949
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You say, oh, well, it's not just some strange alien.

950
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
We know roughly where they came from and why they're here, what their agenda is.

951
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That's knowing a lot.

952
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Well, at least it's comforting that even if it's one out of every 100 million galaxies,

953
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:38,000
at least we can say, given the sheer size of everything, that there's there's somebody else out there or was or will be.

954
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And that we probably weren't alone.

955
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
We'll just never know it.

956
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
But I find that, you know, not for another billion years.

957
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
All right, Robin Hanson, thank you for joining us today.

958
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And I look forward to the next billion years.

959
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I intend to still be here for another billion years.

960
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I look forward to further work and grab the aliens and any other ideas you come up with.

961
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And I hope you'll join us again when you do.

962
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Me too.

963
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Previously on Event Horizon.

964
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It's a possum convention.

965
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And now the continuation.

966
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Well, this sci-fi convention was nice and all, but including Sprocket's potluck food competition,

967
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:24,000
in which he was both the judge and the winner, though admittedly the pinecone salad was surprisingly good.

968
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
But I think it's time to head home, Anna.

969
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I think I've had enough possum interaction for one week.

970
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Well, John, when you're done with the exposition, look, you have a fan.

971
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
As in, an actual one.

972
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
A fan?

973
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Oh, must have read my books.

974
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
They want me to sign something, don't they?

975
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Gladly.

976
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Wait a minute.

977
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It's a possum dressed up as a Klingon holding a batlet.

978
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Wait, that, that possum just said Kapla and is coming at me.

979
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Anna, do something.

980
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It's just a blood feud between his clan and yours.

981
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
