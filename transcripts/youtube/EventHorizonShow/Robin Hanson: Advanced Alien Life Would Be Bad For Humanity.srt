1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,720
Oh, yeah, you can sing for us. Are you a singer? I used, I mean, in college, in high school,

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,840
in high school, you were singing in college, you know, just in the choir, but you know,

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,760
just like everybody, everybody likes to sing it as long as nobody's listening, right? Yeah,

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,080
that's for sure. Yeah, I like music. That's like hum along in the shower. What's your

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,200
favorite kind of music? I don't have, I'm not very specific. It's more about like emotional,

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,760
the emotional palette that it's playing with. It's different genres of music have the different

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,040
emotional palette. Exactly. I'm interested in which kind of palette I like, but I particularly

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:52,640
like sort of glorious music, glorious music, Vangelis, right? Like sort of like epic orchestras,

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,920
like as if there was like grand big things. Yes, like, like a big battle scene in a movie,

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,600
the kind of music you would see behind that, like just Brian Eno, for example. I don't even

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,160
know what that means. He's a musician. Sorry. Oh, he's a guy. Oh, person. Right. But obviously,

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,680
I could play you some. Oh, yeah. Are you a musician? Do you play any instruments? No,

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,960
I mean, I played a recorder a long time ago. That's okay. Like in college, I would relax by

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,600
going into like stairwells in the university and playing my recorder in the stairwell.

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,440
And I really got into, well, somebody, somebody told me I was doing that near their class and

16
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,000
they said they were hearing this music from the like air ducks in the classroom that couldn't

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,360
figure out where I was coming from. Interesting. That's very interesting. Okay. Well, let's

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,920
officially get this thing going. Mr. Robin Hansen. It's great to meet you. First of all,

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,040
nice to meet you, sir. For our listeners and our viewers, can you give me a brief description of

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,040
who you are, your background and your areas of interest? That's going to be hard because I've

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,320
just been all over the place. I know you really have. But if you could give me some sort of a

22
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,440
synopsis. So long ago, I started out in engineering in college. I switched to physics, got an

23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,960
undergraduate degree in physics, and then I decided I wanted to understand what the hell science was.

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,920
So I went off to University of Chicago to study philosophy of science, but then I kind of answered

25
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,960
the questions for myself and switched back to physics. And then I saw cool things happening in

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,480
Silicon Valley and heard about AI and hypertext. And so I left school with two masters in physics

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,080
and philosophy of science to go off to Silicon Valley where I did AI research and Bayesian

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,560
statistics as a job. And on the side did hypertext publishing and a bunch of other stuff for nine

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:51,560
years. And then I went back to school to get my PhD at the age of 34 with two kids, age zero and

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,400
two. Wow. Just in a four years in your out program, because they guarantee, you know,

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,280
that basically everybody gets kicked out after four years. That was good. And I got my degree

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,120
in PhD in social science from Caltech. And then I went on the market and did better in political

33
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,480
science than I did in econ, but I didn't get a job. I got a postdoc in health policy for two

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,280
years at Berkeley. And then I went on the market again and got my current job as a professor of

35
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:27,040
economics at George Mason University. And since I got tenure in 2006, I allowed myself to spread

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,880
out a bit more. And I started a blog called Overcoming Bias. And I've since written two books,

37
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,760
one a futurist book called The Age of M Work, Love and Life When Robots Rule the Earth, and then a

38
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:47,120
psychology book called The Elephant in the Brain, Hidden Motives in Everyday Life. And I'm still

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,840
pretty much all across the map. I've done a lot of different things. The thing I'm most famous for is

40
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,880
the idea of prediction markets, which I was working on when I was that computer researcher,

41
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,000
but back before I went back to school. And that's why I picked Caltech because they did

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,960
I thought that would help in these institution ideas. And I have a wide range of like, big

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,600
institution ideas I'm into too. But as you know, recently, I went back to my astrophysics work,

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:24,560
and I did this gravy alien stuff picking up on the great filter stuff I did while I was a postdoc

45
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:34,800
doing health policy at Berkeley back in that long ago. And so I think most intellectuals are just

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,040
naturally broad. And in fact, that's probably one of the main failure modes when people want to become

47
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:48,000
an academic, is they don't focus enough. And I was at risk of failing in that way, by not focusing

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,560
enough, because the academic world really wants you to be the best at one thing and stick with it

49
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,760
for the rest of your life. And doing a lot of different things, it doesn't reward so much. So

50
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:06,800
I slipped by I managed to sneak by being a little too broad. The Future of Humanity Institute at

51
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,400
Oxford. You're a researcher there. I have an affiliation there. When they were starting up

52
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,640
long time ago, they wanted to collect prestigious affiliations so they could, you know, credit

53
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,080
everything who there was listed associated with them for what they did every year. And so it

54
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,800
happy to be included in that when they first got started, when they were small, and now they are

55
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,000
big and don't need me anymore for that purpose, but I'm happy to still be affiliated. So the

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,960
purpose of that was to look at the big picture questions about humanity, right? Absolutely.

57
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,800
And what, to you, what are the fundamental big picture questions about humanity?

58
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,840
Well, there's where we came from and where we're going.

59
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,000
So the Future of Humanity, of course, focused on that future. But, you know, I think the first job,

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,680
as always, is diagnosis before you do prognosis. So the first thing you need to do is just have a

61
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:10,640
foggiest idea of what might happen, when and how. And then you can start to think about how could we

62
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,480
move it a little. So I think people start way too quick to say, what do I want the future to be?

63
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:23,440
What do I want the future to be like? And sort of map out their ideal case. And actually, it's

64
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,520
pretty hard to actually just figure out what's likely to happen if you do nothing. And you're

65
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,200
probably not going to be able to do a lot. So figure out what's likely to happen if you do nothing,

66
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,600
and then maybe nudge it a bit. So people thinking about the future, they of course think about

67
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,920
things like global warming, they think about population and fertility, they think about

68
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,440
the future of innovation, technology, like space travel, energy, but innovation of social

69
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,480
institutions too. I've been especially interested in forms of governance, ways that you can interact

70
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:07,840
with the economy. And people are usually focused on the future in our era mediated by technology,

71
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,560
that is people imagine particular new technologies coming, and then they think about how that will

72
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,280
affect the future. So that's been true for a while. And so obviously, artificial intelligence

73
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,960
is one kind of technology. I mean, since I did AI research for nine years, that was especially

74
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,120
salient for me. Obviously, people think about future energy sources, they think about

75
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:40,080
space travel, they think about environmental impacts. But there's just a lot more to think

76
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:48,640
about really, if you get creative about it. So I always thought that there was a neglect of the

77
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,840
intersection of social science and tech in thinking about the future. So most futurists that you hear

78
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,240
about are tech people. They know about some kind of a tech, and they want to tell you where they

79
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,400
think that tech is going, and then what social implications that will have. And like myself,

80
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,800
when I was a physics student a long time ago, they were probably taught that social science

81
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,520
doesn't exist. Most tech people are told that basically, that hard sciences like, you know,

82
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,600
physics or computer science or chemistry, even biology, those are real sciences, and people

83
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,680
really know stuff there. But over in those social sciences, that's all fluff and made up, and there's

84
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,960
really nothing there. So when tech people go to try to figure out the social implications of the

85
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,240
technologies they're imagining, they kind of wing it with their intuitions. They don't really use

86
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,640
expert social science. Whereas the social scientists who do understand social science,

87
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,600
when they think about the future, they tend to be skeptical about all those tech projections.

88
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,480
They look at the world around them, and they figure the technology of the future couldn't

89
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,640
possibly be that different from the technology they see around them, and science fiction-y

90
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,080
projections must just be fantasy. So they don't really take seriously the tech, and therefore

91
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,360
they don't really project, you know, what future tech might be, and then what the social implications

92
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,480
are. So there's this missing intersection, right? On the one hand, we have tech people who can

93
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,920
envision future technologies, and on the other hand, we have social scientists who can project

94
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,520
social changes as a result of whatever perturbations come, including technologies, but they don't put

95
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,880
it together much. And that's what you do. That's one of the things I've tried to do. So my highest,

96
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:40,080
most meta-level principle is to look for important neglected things. So, you know, that's

97
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,280
neglected there, right? You find a way that people are neglecting something that's important, and then

98
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:52,160
you can have it all to yourself. So what is the future of humanity and artificial intelligence

99
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,160
if we look into the near future and the distant future? There's a lot of people who have very

100
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:09,040
dystopian views of how this might look. What are your views on this? Are they dark or dystopian,

101
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:17,680
or are they optimistic? So, first of all, in terms of ordinary artificial intelligence of the sort

102
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,080
that most people see and have seen for a long time, of the sort that I did as a researcher,

103
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:30,000
I see that as accumulating gradually, improving steadily, and having a long road still to go.

104
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:39,600
So that sort of process looks like it will give you plenty of warning before you have bigger

105
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,520
problems to deal with. So we're a long way away from machines being able to do most everything

106
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:53,360
humans do, perhaps even centuries. And, you know, as they start to become more capable,

107
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,200
then they will basically take up a larger fraction of world income. The key signature of AI getting

108
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,760
more capable is you pay it more money instead of people. So because most income goes to pay

109
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,520
people today, you can be pretty sure that people are the main valuable thing today. But later on,

110
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,280
with time, we will pay more and more for the machines and the software,

111
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,440
because they'll be doing the important things, and then eventually they'll do most things.

112
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,520
But there's a long way to go before that, and that process will be pretty gradual. That is,

113
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:32,480
I don't foresee a sudden change where all of a sudden, you know, humans were doing, you know,

114
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,840
half the jobs yesterday, and next week they're doing almost nothing, right?

115
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,040
The scale, the timeline isn't necessarily linear in a sense that the exponential growth of tech,

116
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,120
the growth of technology becomes exponential, right? Like what we did in the last 100 years

117
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,720
compared to the next 100 years will be extremely sped up. Well, I actually think you should think

118
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,840
in terms of a log normal distribution over task difficulty, which is a mouthful, I guess. So

119
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:08,720
the idea is the difficulty of tasks in automating varies enormously. So, you know,

120
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,320
they are spread across a very wide spectrum in terms of how difficult tasks are to automate. So,

121
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,640
you know, as you know, Moore's law for a while, you know, computers got twice as cheap every two

122
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:29,520
years. But we didn't see an exponential displacement of humans from jobs, even as

123
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,960
technology was increasing exponentially. That is, we've seen a relatively linear steady displacement

124
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,840
of jobs, even though technology is increasing exponentially. And a way to understand that is

125
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,240
to imagine there's a distribution for each job of how hard it is, how much computing power does it

126
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,440
take to automate that job? And think of it in terms of many, many orders of magnitudes, right?

127
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,280
So if it was a number like some jobs take one and some takes 10 and 10 take 100 and 1000 and a

128
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,240
million and a billion, and that jobs are spread really far across this really wide range of

129
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,240
difficulty. So the very first machines automated some very simple jobs that people were doing.

130
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,200
And then over time, as computers have gotten better and cheaper, we've been able to automate

131
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,920
more jobs by moving up that spectrum. Like first, it was the jobs that only had a difficulty of one

132
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,240
and then the jobs have 10 and then the jobs that have 100. But the idea is the range is really wide.

133
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,960
Like there's jobs up at a trillion and the jobs at a quadrillion, right? And so that's why even

134
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,480
as technology has been improving exponentially, the fraction of jobs that the machines do has

135
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,200
not been increasing exponentially because the difficulty of job is just really widely spread.

136
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,720
And at the moment, we are, you know, automating a new set of jobs that we couldn't automate

137
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,480
10 years ago. But we have just a little still really long way to go. And so that would be my

138
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,320
picture for the ordinary kind of AI that we've seen so far. Now my book, The Age of M is about a

139
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,280
somewhat different kind of AI. And that different kind of AI has more of a threshold effect where

140
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,640
nothing happens until something happens and then a lot suddenly happens. And that's the idea of a

141
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,880
brain emulation. So you have a brain in your head and it has a whole bunch of cells of different

142
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,400
types which are connected to each other with little wires. And there's a system by which when

143
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,280
signals come into your eyes or your hand, it goes to the brain and they go signals go through the

144
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,600
cells and each cell takes signals in and send signals out. And we could in principle copy that

145
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,440
whole system in your brain and make a computer model of a brain like yours that has, you know,

146
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,880
a substitute for each cell and a model of how each cell works that send take signals in and send

147
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,960
signals out that sends it to the other cells just like in your brain. And if we could make a brain

148
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,880
emulation of your brain, then it would behave just like you in the same situation. And that would be

149
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,080
powerful human level artificial intelligence. We are a long way from being able to do that,

150
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,720
but we will sometime in the next few centuries be able to do that. And we might,

151
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,160
I think, be able to do that before we can do other kinds of human level artificial intelligence.

152
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,120
And this kind of AI has a threshold. That is, when we make this emulation of your brain,

153
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,000
say we get it wrong, like this cell models are off or the connections are off. If it's wrong enough,

154
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,040
it just won't work. It'll just be mush. It'll just be a mess. But once we pass a threshold of

155
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:46,000
the model being close enough to you, then it'll basically work. And so that's this threshold

156
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,720
where brain emulations before a certain point, they're just not really valuable at all.

157
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,040
And then after a certain point, they're really valuable. And then that would have more of a

158
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,800
sudden transition into this world where brain emulations were cheap and common. And that's what

159
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,720
my book is all about, is what that world looks like. Have you ever seen the movie or the show

160
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,400
Westworld? Yes, of course. Yes. Yeah, that is almost exactly what Westworld is about, right?

161
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:17,760
It's about a park. Can you explain? Right. Well, so the, I mean, initially it was a movie long ago

162
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,160
when I was a kid. It was also a movie long ago. Yeah. Right. And so the idea is it's an amusement

163
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,520
park where there are robots to entertain the guests and they don't really specify how the

164
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,840
robots are designed. So in fact, in the TV show Westworld, they also have brain emulations later

165
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,360
in the show as a different thing. And so the robots in Westworld are not brain emulation robots,

166
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,880
but they are AI that are as very effectively similar to humans. So they present them as very

167
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:53,680
human-like AI, even though they're apparently not designed that way. And of course, it's crazy

168
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,320
stupid. Like a lot of fiction is if you could actually make those robots as they made them in

169
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,240
that show, you wouldn't mainly use them in an amusement park. You choose them everywhere in

170
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,240
the economy. I mean, so the key thing is human workers are get more than half of world income.

171
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,960
So if you could have a substitute for human workers, you can make trillions of dollars,

172
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:19,520
basically replacing human workers with it. So the idea that you would just use that in an amusement

173
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,480
park and nowhere else is kind of crazy. Well, the idea of the main incentive for Westworld,

174
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,720
correct me if I'm wrong, I may be misinterpreting it. That's been a while, but I believe the main

175
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:40,720
incentive of it was to longevity, right? To live forever, to be able to learn enough from these

176
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,360
real humans that were interacting with them, to be able to copy them, to copy their minds. So when

177
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:56,160
their biological body dies, they can take that copy and put it in a cyborg or a robot.

178
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,000
There were three main lines of business that I recall from Westworld TV show. The first main

179
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,280
line of business was the entertainment of the amusement park. Right. Okay. A second line of

180
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,080
business was they were trying to make uploads. And I believe they showed that as failing. That is,

181
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,320
they just didn't work. And then the third secret line of business that they reveal later on is

182
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,320
that they're watching the visitors to the park very closely and therefore learning to predict

183
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,960
human behavior. And somehow the idea is that that was much more valuable than just having

184
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,360
human level robots. Because somehow you could market to them, right? You could send them

185
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,840
advertisements and predict what they do. And so in the later seasons, they have these big

186
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,440
spherical computers that are predicting the world. What will everybody will do, right? As if that

187
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,000
was some enormously economically valuable thing compared to the robots, which that seems crazy.

188
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,640
Because people predicting future behavior, the moment that doesn't command much income in the

189
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,680
world, there's not a lot of demand for that. There is some, but it's not that big. But people working,

190
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,920
there's a huge demand for that. The world is full of people working. And if you can substitute for

191
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,400
people working, you can make trillions. I don't think you can make trillions just because you can

192
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,040
predict what TV show somebody will watch next or which way they will turn on the street. There's

193
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,520
just not that much money there, but it sets up this dystopian thing. Oh my God, they can predict

194
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,160
what I'll do. I just feel dehumanized now, right? So the show went for this emotional threat of you

195
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,080
feeling threatened by the fact that a machine can predict you as the emotional anchor of the show,

196
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,200
as opposed to these machines can take your jobs. Pardon this brief interruption, but I want to take

197
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,720
a minute to talk about this incredible supplement that I've been using for over a year now after it

198
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:49,120
was recommended to me by nutritional scientist, Dr. Dominic D'Agostino on this podcast. I take

199
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,160
Dom's advice when it comes to anything related to nutrition, diet, and longevity, because as we get

200
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,440
older, these things become more and more important. That is why I started using Verso. Verso is a

201
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,600
company that is dedicated to translating scientific breakthroughs into products that

202
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,040
hold the potential to increase longevity. I take cell being this one right here, which contains

203
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,240
nicotinamide mononucleotide, or NMN-based supplement, paired with naturally derived

204
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,400
micronized trans resveratrol and TMG. These two chemicals are actually precursors to what's called

205
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,400
nicotinamide iodine dinonucleotide, which is commonly known as NAD. And NAD is essentially

206
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,040
the precursor to energy, cell repair, and longevity. If you've ever tried fasting,

207
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,080
or even intermittent fasting, and you've gotten that feeling of super high energy or mental

208
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,280
clarity, it's because your body is activating these genes called sirtuins, which are actually

209
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,800
longevity genes. The downside is as we age, NAD declines. When I found out I could naturally

210
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,480
increase my body's activation of sirtuins and naturally activate my body's production of NAD,

211
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,960
I was sold. And it is so much more affordable than doing NAD IV drips.

215
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,920
advertising type thing, right? Right. They can predict it. They can make money with advertising

216
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,600
to you or selling to you. Right, which is tiny compared to work. Right. Like advertising is like

217
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:35,600
two or three percent of GDP, right? Whereas work is like 70% of GDP. Oh, wow. Right. So,

218
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,920
you know, if you can take over the advertising industry, you can take over the work industry,

219
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:49,200
take over the work industry. Right. Do you imagine those little pearls, they call them,

220
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:56,000
do you imagine is that like a realistic physical form of what a brain might be uploaded to?

221
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,840
I mean, that's just to have a dramatic physical thing to look at. I mean, obviously almost all

222
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,440
computers these days have wires by which they transfer files by wires from one computer to

223
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,960
another. Sometimes when they want to like send a file physically, they have them on a tape and

224
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,040
they mail them. But I mean, the fact that have these little shiny silver balls doesn't make much

225
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,400
sense. But that's not forgivable because that's also not terribly wrong. I mean, you could do it

226
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,760
that way. Yeah, that you would. It seems like we're at least beginning one of the first steps

227
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:37,200
towards that with, for example, the Neuralink that Elon Musk is producing that directly interfaces

228
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,880
with the brain. I mean, it's essentially like a super evolved version of the iPhone, you know,

229
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,560
but it's in your it's actually attached to your brain. You would think about things and be able

230
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,920
to communicate without speech. In principle, it would just have a higher bandwidth. Right, exactly.

231
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,680
Your brain could talk to a machine and back and forth with a higher bandwidth. So I mean, obviously

232
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:02,320
bandwidth is valuable. The key question is for what? What is exactly the value of high bandwidth?

233
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,560
So well, I mean, your brain was designed for high bandwidth through your eyes and ears, right? So

234
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,120
your brain really wasn't designed to take high bandwidth input in through other channels. That

235
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,720
is your brain, you know, has a whole system there for what it's where it expects to get input and

236
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,600
then has a whole system for processing that input. So it's not obvious that we can actually usefully

237
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,800
give your brain a lot of input other than through the input channels it was designed to take.

238
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,480
Interesting. Yeah, because I always think about it. The first thing that I think about when I

239
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,640
think of things like Neuralink is being able to like the advantages that you would have

240
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,960
over other human beings, like being able to, for example, download a book into your brain and know

241
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,400
it in 30 seconds or, you know, the advantages you have in the economic world if you have that

242
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,280
technology. That would be hard. So the brain emulation scenario is a scenario where, you know,

243
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,160
you equivalently have Neuralink, you know, easy because they're just on computers anyway, so it

244
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,240
would be easy to send information in. But it's not clear you could just, you know, download a book

245
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:11,520
and they would know it because that requires that you restructure the brain. So. Oh, how so? Well,

246
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,360
you know, so if you imagine like having files on your computer you could download a movie and then

247
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,120
the movie's on the computer and if you hit play you play the movie. You need software. Right. But

248
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,920
if you have a large, say a library, right, a large library full of books and now you want all those

249
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,600
books to reflect some new insight in math, right, you don't just like put the math book somewhere

250
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,240
in the library. Right. All the other books don't update on the math book sitting in the library.

251
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,920
You'll have to get all the other books to change in response to this new thing, you know,

252
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,320
so that they've integrated into the rest of the books, right? So taking any large library and

253
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,840
getting it to reflect some new math insight would be hard, would be time consuming. You'd have to go

254
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,000
find all the books that actually are related to that. Understand them and rewrite those chapters

255
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,680
in order to reflect the new insight that you were trying to get in. Right. That makes perfect sense.

256
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:17,120
Um, so one of the most memorable quotes from that movie to me, which I've talked about on this

257
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,520
podcast many times, and I think about a lot, which I'm fascinated to hear your opinion on it, was

258
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:32,560
when Ford, the man who developed the theme park with the AIs, he said that human intellect is

259
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,000
like peacock feathers. It's an elaborate display to attract a mate. All of the best of Mozart,

260
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,520
all the best of Shakespeare, the best of Michelangelo, even the empire state building,

261
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:49,440
just an elaborate mating ritual. Um, and maybe that all the things that humanity has accomplished

262
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,520
doesn't even matter because it was done so for the basis of reasons. Even the peacock can barely

263
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,480
fly. It lives in the dirt and it picks insects out of the muck. What are your thoughts on that quote?

264
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:11,600
Um, I do expect that peacock feather kind of drives were an important drive in human

265
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:19,600
mind evolution, but it's also clear that human minds are spectacularly capable compared to most

266
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,200
other animal minds. It's clear that human civilization together with human minds has

267
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,240
been able to accomplish amazing things. Now it could be it's only accomplishing them with

268
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,280
10% of the brain and the rest of the 90% is peacock feathers, but still something in there

269
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,440
is amazingly capable compared to all the other animals that that's just obvious.

270
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:48,080
Yes. So then you might want to understand like which parts are which try to disentangle the

271
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,480
fundamentally, you know, more useful parts from the others, but certainly something in there

272
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,800
is useful, but the brain is huge, so it could well not be most of it.

273
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,920
Mm hmm. Well, it goes back to the main, one of the main or the main theory of your book,

274
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,280
the elephant in the brain, right? Where there's explain what the that that book is and what the

275
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:18,160
the basic idea of it is. So the idea is that you are wrong about why you do many things, right?

276
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,160
That is, if I asked you why you do most of the things you do, you'll give me a reason.

277
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,000
And it turns out most of those reasons are wrong. That is, it's the reason you have in your head,

278
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,880
it's the reason you can sort of explain and justify and to some degree your behavior is

279
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,680
driven by that thing, but not mostly. So, but most of the things you're doing

280
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,760
instead, the motives you have are reasonable motives to have, they just don't look as nice

281
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:55,040
as the motives you'd like to point to. So, for example, you go to school not to learn the material

282
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,080
because you don't actually learn much material. You go to school to show off, to show that you

283
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,120
are capable and also to sort of learn sort of modern workplace habits. You go to the doctor

284
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,400
not to get well, but to show that you care about people and let them they show they care about you.

285
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:20,240
You vote not to help the nation do better, but to show your allegiance to your political tribe.

286
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:29,120
Each of these things is a useful function for a social animal, it's just not the function you

287
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:36,080
claim. Now, some of these functions are more zero-sum or have waste at least, so many of these

288
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,400
functions that you don't like to admit that you're not really aware of are showing off.

289
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,120
And showing off is often wasteful, like going all those years to school just to show off how smart

290
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:54,160
and conscientious and conformist you are is a lot of waste, but it's not all waste.

291
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,680
It is important for people to be able to judge who's how capable and to sort them into different

292
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:09,200
kinds of tasks and roles based on knowing about their features. And, you know, large social

293
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:18,480
worlds, we do need to show and judge loyalty. And a lot of these signals are to show and judge

294
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,920
loyalty. So like the peacock feathers are just showing that you can put up with the feathers.

295
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,160
That is, you have enough, you know, other capabilities that if a predator comes after

296
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,520
you, you can usually survive even though you're carrying around this big wasteful set of feathers.

297
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,880
But those feathers aren't really useful for much else. But many of the capabilities that humans

298
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,600
have acquired that we show off are actually more useful for other things. Now, maybe evolution just

299
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,840
got lucky and didn't realize how useful they would be, but clearly something in the human brain,

300
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,800
the capacity the human brain has, has allowed us to do enormous things compared to most animals.

301
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,160
Like acquiring wealth would be an example of something that would be impressive and

302
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,680
also has many other right. Exactly. Sure. Or language. So for example, most people use a

303
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:19,440
larger vocabulary than they really need to because they show off how much they know to do a larger

304
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,880
vocabulary. And I noticed I use the word vocabulary instead of just saying, you know, many words. So I

305
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:33,680
was showing off that I had a bigger vocabulary, but words are useful. So you are learning things

306
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,800
like that. Many, you know, ancient societies, people who are rich, what they show off by

307
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,440
getting things from far away, strange, you know, things that local people wouldn't have,

308
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,480
that they would have an unusual thing. And that encouraged trade and long distance travel

309
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,840
interactions. War has actually been one of the largest drivers of innovation over the last 10,000

310
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,480
years. War is terribly destructive. Nevertheless, the drive to improve war technology has in fact,

311
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:11,840
you know, driven a lot of technological improvements. Right. So the key thing is once

312
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,200
you open some new territory of learning and expanding, even if you're wasting most of your

313
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,320
effort there, the remaining effort can just produce huge returns. Yeah. One of the most absurd

314
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,560
examples I've thought of when it comes to the idea of the elephant in the brain is Elon Musk.

315
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,120
You know, you think of him as this just crazy, flamboyant, you know, the richest man in the

316
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:42,640
world. And he also builds rockets and wants to make our species interplanetary. Or does he? Or

317
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,880
does he just want money and women? I'm not sure I care. I'm not sure I care. Right. Because at

318
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,880
the same time, whether that is his drive or not, the things that he's accomplishing are

319
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,640
valuable and very important to us. I mean, I think if you're going to pick one person on the

320
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,720
planet today that you want to be really impressed with, with what they've accomplished, it would

321
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,640
have to be him. That's true. So, you know, I have to give hats off. I mean, and he's going on to

322
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:18,880
accomplish more things, no doubt. Many of them will fail. But yes, we, humanity is on a tear

323
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:27,120
and we have a bright future ahead of us if we so choose, even if we are now wasting enormous

324
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:36,000
fractions of our civilization on peacock feathers. And in some sense, that makes the prospects even

325
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,200
brighter. If we could cut the waste, we could get even more. Right. Simulation theory. How far do

326
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,960
you go into simulation theory in your books and what are your estimations of the probability of

327
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,120
simulation theory? So many decades ago, the idea that we might be living with simulation was a

328
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,440
common theme on some of the mailing lists I was on. And then at one point, one of the people was

329
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,080
on the mailing lists, went off and wrote a philosophy paper based on that, Nick Bostrom,

330
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,240
and then that got more attention. And then at the time that inspired me to write a paper on how to

331
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:21,520
live in a simulation because that was neglected. So there are many of these topics where, again,

332
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,840
people want to mainly focus on the technology itself, when it might happen, is it possible?

333
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,240
And they rarely, they neglect the social implications. So I thought, let's just think

334
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,640
about the social implications of a simulation. If you were living in one, how should you live

335
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:42,720
your life differently? And so I do have that paper on that. But the key idea here is that

336
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,000
in the future, things like brain emulations will be possible and therefore it will be possible to

337
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,880
create creatures who are in a world that looks completely real to them, but is in some sense,

338
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,240
not. It's fake. So like in the movie The Matrix or things like that, it'll be possible to make

339
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:10,800
such creatures. And some of those creatures would be set in a world like the past of that world.

340
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,080
Just like today when we make movies, some of our movies are set in our past and some of our games

341
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,560
are set in our past or something like that. And so if there was a creature set in some, you know,

342
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,960
fictional world who doesn't know they're in a fictional world, and if that fictional world

343
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:35,680
is in the past of that symbolization, then if you are sitting here in your world, you could ask,

344
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:42,320
how do I know I'm not that creature? Exactly. I could be in principle, you know, in fact,

345
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,440
that future creature who thinks they're in this current day, but is actually in the future

346
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:55,040
in a simulated world made to look like their past. So the relative chances that I am a simulation

347
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,160
like that really comes down to a numbers game. Like how many people are there here today really?

348
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,720
And how many people would there be in the future simulating my time now? And that's, you have to

349
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,840
come up with estimates of those relative numbers in order to guess, could I be in a simulation? So

350
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,000
if you think there are relatively few people in the future who would be simulations of the past,

351
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,840
then you think it's not very likely that I'm in a simulation. But if you think there's enormous

352
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,000
numbers of them in the future, then you would have to think, well, then it's pretty likely, right?

353
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:37,840
Now, we should first notice, like, if you were simulating the past, you're not going to equally

354
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,920
randomly select from the past to simulate. So when we do movies or we do games, right,

355
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,480
we do Caesar all the time or Napoleon all the time and all the other people not so often, right?

356
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,360
So that means your chance of being in a simulation does depend on how

357
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,000
photogenic your life is in the sense, is your life the sort of life somebody might want to simulate?

358
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,040
Right. Would you be an interesting player? Right. Or are you a famous person? Did you

359
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,520
have a big impact on the future, right? So we'll often pick famous people in the past.

360
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:18,800
Who we see as having had a big historical impact as the people we simulate in our past when we do

361
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,960
novels or games or things like that. So then, you know, that would modify your estimate for

362
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,080
yourself. If you're a random person, that's different than if your life seems to be especially

363
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,760
good story, especially story that the future might. So Elon Musk himself

364
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,240
should assign a higher probability than the rest of us to living in a simulation because it would

365
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,600
be more likely somebody would simulate his life compared to ours. Right. Okay. But let's set that

366
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:55,040
aside and let's just think about an ordinary average person today and ask what's the chance

367
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:03,920
they're living in a simulation. Well, I'd say we're going to basically do an integral where we

368
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,160
multiply two numbers. So basically there's all these different years in the future and each year

369
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:16,560
in the future will have a certain size economy which has some amount of past simulations that

370
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,600
are happening in that economy. Right. So in each future year, there's some percentage of that

371
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,840
economy that they spend doing these past simulations. Right. So we could count that now in terms of our

372
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,720
how many historical novels do we have or historical games or something. Right. And

373
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,080
we could also have which past they're interested in, you see. So as the future,

374
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,560
as we get farther in the future, we expect the future to get bigger, the economy will get bigger

375
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,640
and then even if there's just a constant fraction of that future economy that spent thinking about

376
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,320
the past, that amount gets bigger. Right. Right. So the farther we go into the future, the more

377
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,600
past simulations we expect to be happening at that moment in that distant future time.

378
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,880
Okay. But we expect those simulations to be spread out across their past according to how

379
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:11,280
interested they are in their past. That is, which past are they interested in. Right. And so now

380
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,440
when we're thinking about the future, we're asking, you know, it's an integral over the future.

381
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,920
For each future year, one number is how big is that economy and, you know, what fraction of it

382
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,720
is devoted to historical simulations and the other is how large a fraction of that would we count

383
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,600
because we are competing with all the other dates at which they could be trying to make

384
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:40,400
simulations. Wow. That's complex. Right. But there's a simple answer. Okay. Which is that

385
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:52,640
if interest in the past fades faster than the world grows, then most of the simulations of you will

386
00:38:52,640 --> 00:39:01,280
be in the relatively near future. So say if, you know, interest in the future doubled at the moment,

387
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,240
sorry, the future economy say grows by a factor of two every 15 years at the moment. But if interest

388
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,520
in the fact falls by a factor of two every 10 years, then as you can see, even though the future

389
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:22,160
gets much bigger, it's even less interested in you. Right. Simulating your date. Right. So

390
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,240
they'll be much more interested in simulating things nearer their own date in terms of their

391
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:34,480
history. So the final bottom line is what we want to ask is how fast does interest in the past

392
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,160
or decline with time compared to the rate at which the population of the economy grows in time?

393
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:47,920
And there's something called Google n-grams and you can just type in a year like 1900 into Google

394
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,800
n-grams and it will show you how the interest in that year rose with time up until that year and

395
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,800
fell with time after that year. Really? And you can just pick all sorts of dates and see that.

396
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,800
And so you can see how fast does interest in the past fall away as you move away from that year.

397
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,760
And in fact, it falls away faster than the economy or the population grows.

398
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,120
But there are certain years that are way more interesting than other certain times in history

399
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,600
like the ancient Egyptians when the pyramids were built. Sure. Or World War II. But we're

400
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,040
just trying to do sort of the overall average first. Okay. Okay. So the overall average seems

401
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,840
to be that our interest in the past fades faster. And that also is roughly true. That is, say,

402
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,160
in the last 10,000 years, the world population doubled roughly every thousand years up until

403
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,280
recently. But I think it seems to me obvious that interest in the past falls faster than a factor of

404
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,360
two every thousand years. So, right. Okay. I mean, so if you look at most historical simulations,

405
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:50,800
you know, a thousand years ago, you know, almost all the simulations, the percentage of historical

406
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:57,760
simulations that are past the year 1000, probably well over 90%. Right. And you go back another

407
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,520
thousand years and it falls even faster. And, you know, the fraction of historical simulations that

408
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,960
are of 1000 BC, almost nothing. Right. Look on Netflix or some other thing. Find me a historical

409
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:18,240
story that took place more than 3000 years ago. Right. It's just almost nothing. But 3000 years

410
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,960
ago is only a factor of eight reduced population because it goes by a factor of two every thing.

411
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,920
So according to the, if it were proportional to population, then one eighth, say, of historical

412
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,640
simulations should be more than 3000 years ago. Right. But far fewer. I see. So here's the bottom

413
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,600
line, right? We should only expect the future to simulate us when it's relatively soon, but actually

414
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,920
we can't do simulations yet. It'll be a while till we can do simulations of the past. It'll be a

415
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,240
while before we can create creatures who are in a simulation that don't know they're in the past.

416
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,080
We're not able to do that yet. Right. And so by the time they can do it,

417
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,680
it'll be far enough in the future. They'll be hardly interested in us at all. Right. And then

418
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,200
they'll only be able to do a few at first. And as they get able to do more, they get even less

419
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,760
interested in us. Right. Why would they be? We're just too far in the past. We're too far in the

420
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,600
past. Unless we are somehow special. So some people have claimed that we are in the special era,

421
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:25,600
that the future will be unusually interested in us, especially because we are different.

422
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,200
Why would they be interested in us right now? Well, many people are attracted or tied to this

423
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:39,120
idea that this is a pivotal moment in history. And that's what motivates them to do a lot of

424
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:45,360
things they do because this is the moment that matters. And of course, it's a bit of arrogance.

425
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,760
Yes. It sounds like something that every... Obviously, it could be true in principle. I

426
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,880
don't actually think it is that true. I mean, some important things are happening now, but important

427
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,240
things happened a century ago and a century before that. What would be the social implication

428
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,960
of everybody being aware that they are in a simulation? If human beings being aware that

429
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,760
we're in a simulation, what would change? What would be the social implications?

430
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,680
Well, you have to ask what's the purpose of the simulation. So clearly somebody who made a

431
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,440
simulation could have told people in simulation that we're in a simulation, right? If they had

432
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,240
wanted to do that. So clearly they didn't want to do that, right? So if people in a simulation

433
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,240
figure out they're in a simulation against the wishes of the people who set up the simulation,

434
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,720
the question is, what can the people who set up the simulation do in response? And they have

435
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,120
enormous powers to deal with that. So I don't think they're actually going to suffer that problem.

436
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,520
So they wouldn't let us allow us to figure it out?

437
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,320
If they don't want to, it doesn't seem like they want to. Unless they want to do a simulation of

438
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,120
a world that finds out and see what they do. But that's going to be a kind of unusual special

439
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,480
thing to simulate. No doubt they do that sometimes, but not very often.

440
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:01,440
So one of the main things you can do in a simulation is you can sort of have noise and

441
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,600
error in how you do the simulation. And then if something happens that wasn't supposed to happen,

442
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:14,000
you just back it up and you do it again. So simulations don't have to just run forward.

443
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,280
They can back up. So that's just the nature of the way we do computer simulations, all sorts of

444
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,360
systems today. So that means if there's anything you don't want to have happen in a simulation,

445
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,120
it's relatively easy to prevent it. That is, if you see the thing go wrong, then you stop,

446
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,920
you back it up, and you take that, you know, you change something and then you roll it back forward

447
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,680
and you keep doing that until you get the thing you wanted. Right. Right. That makes sense.

448
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,400
So, you know, if you're in a simulation, you are very much at their mercy and you will not know

449
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,160
things they don't want you to know. What if they did want us? What if they did decide to let us know

450
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,880
we were in a simulation? Well, then we're in a simulation where they want to find out what

451
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,880
happens when they let us know. And of course they will try that different variations on that. And

452
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:04,480
then, you know, they will see the different variations. Wow. That's fascinating. And people

453
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,440
like Elon Musk, people who have more interesting lives, who have made a greater impact on him,

454
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,800
who have made a greater impact on history. Those are people that are more inclined to believe.

455
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,760
Well, they should be more inclined to believe that for them it is in fact true that they are

456
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:30,160
more likely to be living in simulation. Right. The great filter. What inspires you to write this

457
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,200
paper on the great filter? I believe you collaborated on it with a few people. Is that

458
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,240
right? And then what is the basic idea of the great filter? So the great filter is something

459
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:49,920
I did over 20 years ago, 25 years ago almost now. And 1996, right? It started. And that was about

460
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:57,520
just reframing the great, what they say, Fermi's question, where is everybody? So we look up in

461
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:04,160
the universe and looks empty and dead. And we look at our future, we see this prospect for us to be

462
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:10,880
lively and invisible. And there's a bit of a conflict here. We don't see around us the things

463
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:20,560
we expect to be in the future. So I reframed that question, just asked a different way. And I said,

464
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,720
well, big visible things of the sort that we hope to become soon, they will have to appear

465
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,440
by going down a path. They start with simple dead matter early in the universe, and then they're

466
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,720
on a planet, say, and life appears and then life goes through stages. And eventually it gets to our

467
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:43,200
stage and eventually goes from our stage onto this big visible stage. And going down that path,

468
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,200
it must be very hard to go from the beginning and get all the way to the end by this point in the

469
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,960
history of the universe, because almost nothing has done it. So that would be to say there's a

470
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,320
filter on that path. Things start in at one end of a pipe and almost nothing comes out the other end

471
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:05,600
of the pipe. Because look, this whole universe started on the pipe. Every piece of rock anywhere

472
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:12,080
could have started down this path to evolve life and spread. But we're the only thing we can see

473
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,920
that's farther down the pack. We don't see anything that's farther beyond where we hope to be.

474
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,480
So that's the claim that to get all the way to where we hope to be is very hard. There's a very

475
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,880
large filter between, you know, that final destination and the initial stage of simple

476
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,640
dead matter. And when you say filter, what specifically are you referring to? What would

477
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,240
a filter be? What's an example of a filter? So, you know, you could have a planet where it never

478
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,800
evolved even life in the first place, right? And then it failed to pass that first step. And then

479
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,800
you could have some place with simple life but didn't become more complicated life, like with

480
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,280
sexual reproduction, say, or photosynthesis, or, you know, a whole bunch of multicellular

481
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,200
things, right? So on Earth, life went through a bunch of stages. And we could say each stage,

482
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,080
when it made a key change, it passed through a filter step. It succeeded in accomplishing

483
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:16,640
something that maybe most planets never do. And that's the great filter is the difficulty

484
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:22,480
of going all the way down this path to the place where we are now and then on forward. So

485
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,560
the fact the universe looks dead and empty says that filter is big. And it also raises a question,

486
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,560
how far along the filter are we? Because we're not all the way. And so clearly it's a huge filter.

487
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,480
And even if just a small fraction is ahead of us, that says bad news about our future.

488
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,680
A small fraction is ahead of us. What do you mean by that?

489
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:48,400
So it could be say the total filter is maybe 10 to the 24, for example, like only one planet out

490
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,360
of 10 to the 24 ever becomes reaches advanced life that becomes visible in the universe.

491
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,920
Well, it could be that we've gone through 10 to the 22 of it so far.

492
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,440
And we only have 10 to the two left. But that would still mean we only have a 1% chance

493
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,960
of getting from here to that final destination. That is 99% chance we won't probably by dying,

494
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,160
which is kind of scary. Yes. What are the chances that we've already made it through the great filter?

495
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,680
Well, that's again about how much of it we have passed. So

496
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:31,600
you could look at our history and try to guess which things were hard. But the problem is

497
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:38,640
actually the timing doesn't tell you much. So it turns out that if we were very lucky on Earth to

498
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,680
get as far as we did, then even if the different steps before us had different difficulties,

499
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:50,160
the timing would be roughly equally spaced. And therefore, we do see roughly equally spaced timing

500
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,480
between major transitions. And so that actually doesn't tell us much about how hard those steps

501
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,800
were. If we were to find other life out there in the universe that had gone independently

502
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,280
down this path, that would be big information about how hard the steps were. So if we found

503
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,320
some other life out there, say that was just primitive life that didn't share an origin with

504
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:16,960
us, well, that would be big news about how hard that first step was. And it would suggest it's

505
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:24,720
easier than we might have feared. So paradoxically, any evidence we see of independent life out there

506
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,400
in the universe that's gone anywhere along the path to where we are is bad news about our future.

507
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:39,200
If we discover any sort of life out there, that's bad news for us. Because it would suggest that

508
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,360
maybe these earlier steps aren't as hard as we thought. And therefore, the later steps we still

509
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,520
have to go are harder than we thought. So that's all the great filter stuff. We were talking about

510
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,000
the work I did with some other people that's in the last two and a half years. Yes, like the

511
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,600
that's what work we call grabby aliens. Right. And that's basically giving numerical estimates

512
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:05,600
for the great filter. Right. Telling you just how big it is. And therefore saying more specifically

513
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:12,080
the distribution of aliens in space time. And we claim that we kind of have the answer to that.

514
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:21,680
So what are grabby aliens? So there's two kinds of aliens in the universe, the kinds you can see and

515
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,040
the kinds you can't. So we just postulate there are some kinds of aliens that would just be pretty

516
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:33,840
obvious. That is, they started somewhere, but then they expanded and kept expanding. And in the volume

517
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:39,680
they expanded to do, they changed things. They did stuff. We don't know exactly what they'll do, but

518
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,320
just like humans and life on Earth has changed stuff for it, wherever it goes, they would change

519
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:51,600
stuff. And if they do that to a big enough volume, they would be noticeable. And so we can think about

520
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:57,520
what our data says about the obvious ones in a much easier way than we can about the other kind,

521
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,240
the quiet ones. So we can come back to the quiet ones, but we're first going to focus on the big

522
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:10,160
obvious ones. And the key point is we don't actually see them, right? They would be big and

523
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,920
obvious and we don't see them. But if we think carefully, we can figure out a lot about what that

524
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:24,000
implies. You might not realize that it says a lot that we can't see them. So what we have is a

525
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,960
three parameter model of where aliens are in space time. And each of the parameters can be fit to data

526
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,120
and then you kind of need to believe this model to explain why we're so early in time,

527
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:43,600
which is one of the key data points, our current date. And so, you know, I'm happy to walk through

528
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,600
if you want. Yes, absolutely. Each of these parameters. Austin, you should be able to pull

529
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:53,360
up some sort of graphics that represent this concept and the study. Yeah, let's go through that.

530
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,160
We are here at 14 billion years into the history of the universe.

531
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,880
That sounds late. 14 million years seems like a long time, but it's actually pretty early.

532
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,760
The average star will last for five trillion years. Now, the peak of star formation in the

533
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,440
history of the universe is like a four billion years after the initial. So we're well past the

534
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:26,240
peak of star formation, but most stars will last for trillions of years. And so we are early in

535
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:34,960
terms of when most stars will exist. And we have a simple theory of when advanced life should appear

536
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,360
that says that the most likely time for advanced life to appear would be much later in the history

537
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,400
of these stars. So I've told you about how life on earth had to go through a number of difficult

538
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,560
steps. Yes. And that earth is probably lucky in having gone through all of those steps in an

539
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:58,000
unusually short time. That is most planets out there never get to our point before that planet

540
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:06,400
ends. Right. Certainly by now in history of the universe. So that suggests that it's just hard

541
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,560
to do each of these steps. And perhaps each of the steps just has a crazy long expected time,

542
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:20,160
but that our planet got lucky. So an analogy is cancer in your body. You have many billions of

543
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:26,240
cells and to produce cancer, a cell needs to go undergo like six different mutations

544
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:32,240
in that same cell in the entire history of your life. Now, these mutations are so unlikely that

545
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,080
most of your cells never have any of these mutations and only a few have a couple of them.

546
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,360
But by the end of your life, typically one of them will get all six mutations.

547
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,400
And that's analogous to all these planets in the universe who need to go through a bunch of steps

548
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,920
to produce advanced life. And most of them never even get to the first step and hardly any of them

549
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:02,640
get to, you know, four steps. And maybe our life got through all six steps to get to where we are

550
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:10,000
before the deadline of life closing on planet Earth. So that's like a cell in your body getting

551
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,040
cancer before the deadline of your lifespan ending. In other words, planet Earth has developed

552
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:21,200
malignant cancer. Right. Although this cancer is great. Depends on how you look at it. Sure.

553
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:28,960
But I'm going to take that stand. This life is great. But so what we know is that the

554
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:35,120
chance of you getting cancer as a function of time goes as a power law in time where the power is

555
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:40,240
the number of these mutations that have to happen. So typically around six. Okay. So you are far more

556
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,640
likely to get cancer near the end of your life than the beginning. It's not constant in time.

557
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,440
The chance just increases dramatically toward the end of your life. It goes as this power law of the

558
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:56,880
power of sixth of time because there's roughly six mutations. Okay. So similarly for planets,

559
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,040
if advanced life like us is going to appear on a planet like Earth, it's not equally likely to

560
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,680
appear at any moment in the history of that planet. It's far more likely to happen near the end of

561
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,120
that planet's life. And it actually seems like there's roughly six hard steps that need to

562
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:17,840
happen on a planet like Earth for us to produce life at our level as well. So that means

563
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:25,600
over time, the chance of advanced life increases with time. Right. Now,

564
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:32,960
now, but longer lived planets, they've got a lot more time for all these hard steps to go in.

565
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,800
And so the actual chance of life appearing on a longer lived planet also increases by this power

566
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:47,200
of six. So we are a planet with say five billion years long life and say the typical planet out

567
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:52,400
there will have five trillion years of life. That's a factor of a thousand more. And if there's six of

568
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,760
these steps, the chance that life would appear on one of those planets till the end of its life

569
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:04,320
compared to our planet at the end of our life is a thousand to the power of six or 10 to the 18.

570
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,600
That is, it's crazy unlikely for life to appear on a planet like ours so early in the universe

571
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:19,840
compared to on a longer lived planet later in the universe. So there's something wrong

572
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,160
with this analysis because our analysis is saying we are just crazy early. Sorry, pull that thing

573
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,160
just a little bit closer to you. You can adjust. You can pull it like this. Pull it closer. There

574
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:34,240
you go. So we're just crazy early compared to when we should expect life to appear. But the key

575
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,920
assumption we made of this analysis is that the universe would just sit empty and wait

576
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:45,760
until we appeared. And that's the assumption we're saying is wrong. So what's actually happening is

577
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,440
life is popping up and appearing in various places in the universe, advanced life. And then

578
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,920
sometime it becomes grabby. It becomes visible. And when it becomes grabby, it expands at some speed.

579
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,520
And then these civilizations appearing at different time expand. And then they're expanding

580
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,360
waves eventually meet each other. And then at that point, the universe is full of grabby aliens. And

581
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:14,320
then it's too late after that for life like us to appear. So there's a deadline in the history of

582
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:19,120
the universe. First, the universe starts out empty and then advanced life starts to appear.

583
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:25,440
And then it expands and then fills everything up. And then too late. You can't appear anymore. And

584
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,160
that's the explanation for why we are here so early in the history of the universe. We are now

585
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:35,200
at a period where the universe is filling up with aliens. And in a billion years or two, it'll be

586
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:41,360
all full. And we couldn't appear five trillion years in the future because it will have long

587
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:48,000
since been full then. So we are just extremely early compared to other solar systems and other.

588
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,320
We're extremely early compared to when we would have appeared had the universe just

589
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:58,880
waited empty for us. The universe is not waiting empty for us is the key point. There's a deadline

590
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:06,000
and that's why we're appearing so early. So that's the first thing to say is this is why you need to

591
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,600
believe in this theory is that we are crazy early otherwise. You have to believe there are

592
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,920
aliens out there and they are filling up the universe right now. And in fact right now roughly

593
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,680
half the volume of the universe is full of alien civilizations that we can't see. And in another

594
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,840
few billion years it'll just all be full. And we have we may well soon join them i.e. going out

595
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:33,360
and expanding and becoming a gravity alien civilization. So this model of aliens appearing

596
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:40,160
has three key parameters. First we're going to assume they just appear at random places in space

597
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,720
on the large scale of the universe. The universe is pretty similar. They just appear in a random

598
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:52,640
galaxy say. And then they expand at some speed after they appear. So that's one of the parameters.

599
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:59,120
How fast do they expand? And then the other two parameters are when they appear in time. So I

600
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:04,880
told you there's a power law that is the number of hard steps makes them appear later in time

601
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,680
more rapidly according to a power law. So a power law has two parameters. It has the power and has

602
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:15,840
a constant. And so these are the three parameters that we can fit to data. So the power comes from

603
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:20,800
the history of life on earth. That is the timing of when life appeared on earth and how much time

604
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:27,200
we seem to have left from now include. And other data we have suggests there's roughly six hard

605
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:33,200
steps on earth therefore a power of six roughly somewhere between three and twelve or something.

606
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,560
But roughly a power of six. The constant of the power law comes from our current date

607
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:46,400
because we are a random sample of when a advanced civilization appears. That is we're not advanced

608
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,360
enough to become gravity yet but if we do so it'll be within a million years or so. So a million

609
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:56,720
years which is relative short time on the on the scale of 14 billion years. So relatively short time

610
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,200
from now we will either become gravity or not but that makes our data random sample from when

611
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:06,080
these things happen. So that gives us the constant in front of the power law. So we have the constant

612
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:10,160
in front of the power law. We have the power of the power law and all we need is the speed of expansion

613
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:16,560
and then we've got the whole model. So how can we get the speed of expansion? Well if you run this

614
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:22,160
model and simulate it you find that when civilizations are born and they look in the universe we ask can

615
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:27,360
they see other civilizations in the universe? And what we find is if they expand slowly when

616
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,880
they're born and they look out they see lots of other civilizations. Huge you know spherical

617
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:39,360
volumes in the sky much bigger than the full moon full of aliens. Spherical volumes in the sky? Well

618
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:44,240
because they start at some point and they expand spherically away from there. Okay. And so you

619
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,920
would look in the sky and you basically see vast spheres of alien civilizations if everybody grew

620
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:56,080
slowly. That's what the typical civilization would see. Okay. But if they grow very fast

621
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,440
most of them won't see any others when they're born because they don't see them until they're

622
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:08,640
almost there. Because there's a selection effect you you couldn't appear within the volume of a

623
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:15,440
different alien civilization because they would preclude you. That is if they had born and using

624
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:23,760
the volume you would no longer be able to evolve there. At least if they so chose. So the fact that

625
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,760
we don't see any aliens in our sky is the evidence that they must be expanding at a very fast speed.

626
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:37,120
Say roughly half the speed of light or even faster. Which is extremely fast. What explains why we

627
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:41,120
wouldn't see them coming until they're actually here? Until they're nearly here but it might I

628
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,640
mean it might be millions of years before they're here you can see them but still

629
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,720
at a typical birth date you won't see them yet. Right. Okay. And now what is this what is this

630
01:02:51,360 --> 01:03:01,280
model? Explain. Austin is this there's no video? There's a video farther down. There you go. Yeah

631
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:09,280
that's the video. Following is a simulation of the grabby aliens model of alien civilizations.

632
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,280
Civilizations are born and then expand outward at a constant speed. A spherical region of space

633
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:19,840
is shown. By the time we get to 13.8 billion years this sphere will be. So this is you know a random

634
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:26,400
place in space civilizations appear they grow and then they meet each other and then eventually the

635
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,960
volume is full. And so you up the upper right hand corner you can see the date of the simulation so

636
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:36,240
we're past our current date now. Okay. And it's showing that the universe is expanding and it

637
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,480
counts how many of them. We're just gonna see the same thing again but now we can see through the

638
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,520
volumes maybe see more what's going on. So you can see up on the upper right we're before today at

639
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:51,280
the moment the universe is expanding. We show how many civilizations there are. There's there's

640
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:56,400
roughly you know four times ten to the eight galaxies in this volume so it's a very large

641
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:04,320
region of space and then it's all full. So that's the idea. Okay. So it's a relatively simple model.

642
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:09,520
Things just appear at random times and then they expand at a certain same speed but the time at

643
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,120
which they appear goes as this power law. That's the key thing here right. Right. At the beginning

644
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:17,040
hardly anything was happening and later till the end everything was just going. Everything goes crazy.

645
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:26,320
Right. Okay. What now what makes a civilization grabby? So the definition of grabby is that

646
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:34,080
it expands and changes the appearance of the volume it's in so that you wouldn't you would

647
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:41,280
notice it. That's the key idea. Now we could ask why would that happen and you know in some sense

648
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:46,160
you could just imagine it's like life on earth just once there's some competition of different

649
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:55,520
parts trying to colonize things eventually it all gets colonized. We will in our future perhaps

650
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:03,120
face a choice to become grabby or not and that may illuminate better the issues involved.

651
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:11,120
So if you just imagine technology just arbitrarily getting improved then eventually people could leave

652
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:16,880
here and go places and eventually they would then you know compete to grab things and when they grab

653
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,920
things they'd use them in some way and then they would change them and that would just be a naturally

654
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,000
way that they could become grabby. Of course they have to be capable enough to actually

655
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,440
do interstellar travel. Right. Which we are not yet but you know within a million years it seems

656
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:39,600
like we would. Yeah. So the simplest argument for being grabby is just to say if technology

657
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:44,160
and abilities just keep improving then eventually there'll be a point when interstellar travel is

658
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:50,400
possible and then it would be done and then people would move in different directions and then they'd

659
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,840
land somewhere and they'd colonize that and grow there and expand out. So just in the way you know

660
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:02,160
life expands across the earth when it's possible then it would life would expand through the

661
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:08,080
universe. Now of course you know there's that prerequisite you have to be advanced enough to

662
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:14,400
be able to do interstellar travel and then you have to not be dead at that point. Right. That's

663
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:22,320
important. And you have to allow it. So I actually think it's not clear what fraction of them will

664
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:30,560
allow. I think there may be in fact most civilizations don't allow it. That's a plausible possibility

665
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:36,960
but even so the universe is big enough that some of them will and so the grabby aliens model. So

666
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:43,680
the key idea is you start out as a quiet civilization and then eventually have the

667
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,960
choice to become loud. And there's this key question of the ratio between the quiet and

668
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:56,000
the loud. What fraction of quiet eventually give rise to allow? And that fraction matters for two

669
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:02,560
different things. One is our future. If say only one in a thousand quiet become loud then

670
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:07,760
until we know otherwise that's the best estimate for our choice was that only one in a thousand

671
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:15,680
chance we would become loud. And the ratio also matters for SETI the search for extra terrestrial

672
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:21,280
intelligence. This statistical model I was just telling you about we can fit each of these

673
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:27,360
parameters to data and I didn't tell you the actual final numbers which are roughly loud alien

674
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:33,680
civilizations appear roughly once per million galaxies. Okay. And right now is sort of the

675
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:39,120
middle of the distribution of when they appear and if we start to expand at the speed you know half

676
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:43,200
the speed of light like the rest of them are then we would meet them in roughly a billion years.

677
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:50,400
Okay. So that's the answers but those are the statistics for the loud ones. But if there are

678
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:56,080
a ratio of quiet to loud then the higher that ratio is the closer is the nearest quiet one.

679
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:00,640
Because we know the loud the nearest loud one is like once per million galaxies away.

680
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:08,000
Okay. But if say there was a million to one ratio of quiet to loud well now the nearest

681
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:15,920
quiet one might be in our galaxy. Whereas if it's only a 10 to 1 ratio you see the nearest one is

682
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:21,360
one in a hundred thousand galaxies away which is a long way away. Yes. It seems like if we were to

683
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:29,200
become that advanced and be able to achieve interstellar transportation it seems like we would

684
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,720
be based on what we are like now we would become a loud civilization because that's just human

685
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:39,840
nature now we expand we influence we grab things and the way economics are involved.

686
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:47,280
But there are contrary forces at play and so that's worth thinking through.

687
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:55,760
So as you know the world is pretty integrated at the moment. It's once upon a time empires were

688
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:00,560
separated across the globe and didn't interact very much distances were too far to communicate

689
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,920
or travel. But as we've made travel and communication easier the world has become

690
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:13,600
more integrated over the last century. Right. That integration has made an integrated economy

691
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:19,440
we trade across the globe and integrated society people meet and interact across the globe and

692
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:26,560
create communities across the globe and the size of nation and empires has also been increasing

693
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:34,640
over centuries. That is we now have things like the European Union large coordinations of nations

694
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:40,800
on large scales. Yeah. Now you know for a long time people have thought doesn't that mean we'll

695
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:46,160
have a world government soon. Won't we merge these into an even larger unit and people have

696
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:54,800
been concerned about that. Yes. And wary of that and so far we haven't. But what they haven't

697
01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:01,440
noticed is that we have created something like a world mob or world community which we did not

698
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:06,800
have a century ago. So if you look at many different areas of regulation say nuclear power

699
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:14,720
or medical ethics or organ sales or electromagnetic spectrum or plane safety or things like that.

700
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,160
It turns out that the world does it pretty similar everywhere.

701
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:26,080
So we have a world community that talks to each other about these things and people want to be

702
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:30,080
respected in those world communities and there's some conformity pressures in those world communities

703
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:37,200
and those conformity pressures basically induce a pretty high level of convergence of regulation

704
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:42,080
all around the world. It was especially dramatic in Covid if you recall at the beginning of Covid

705
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:48,400
at the very beginning the usual health experts had their usual recommendations which were against

706
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:53,840
mass and against travel restrictions and then elites around the world talked about the subject

707
01:10:54,400 --> 01:11:02,240
a lot and came to a different conclusion and then the whole world did it the different way.

708
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:08,640
That is almost everywhere people follow the new consensus about how to treat Covid which was

709
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:14,480
different than what the elite consensus had been a few months before because we just have this

710
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:19,520
large world community where people talk a lot and then they feel some social pressures to go along

711
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,240
with what everybody else thinks in the way that most communities do but now we have a world level

712
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:30,720
community. We have world level communities of many kinds of topics especially with regulation

713
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:37,840
and other sorts of business practices where we have a whole world where we do things together

714
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:44,640
in that way and I think a lot of people like that. That is instead of having a world a lot of

715
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,240
first world people like yes right instead of a world at war and in conflict around the world we

716
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:57,520
have a world where we have a lot more peace because we talk things out and decide together

717
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:03,840
rather than fighting and competing them out and that's been going on for the last century and

718
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:10,000
I think we have to predict that will continue and so the obvious prediction is that we will have

719
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,440
even stronger world communities that limit variation even more in the future. We may have

720
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,800
a stronger world government we may not but we will have the stronger world community

721
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,880
and we will correctly credit it and maybe incorrectly also for many advances like

722
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,440
dealing with global warming or dealing with inequality or dealing with overfishing.

723
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:33,440
That is these world communities have been trying to tackle those sorts of problems

724
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:41,040
and they have often had success so I think over the coming centuries we will have a more strongly

725
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:47,280
integrated world community that likes the fact that they can talk together and decide what to do

726
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:53,120
and in fact prevent destructive competition that they don't like i.e making the regulations

727
01:12:53,120 --> 01:13:00,000
everywhere in the world the same including preventing war and that's the near-term future

728
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:07,200
that we should expect given recent trends but now project that forward and imagine the point in time

729
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:13,840
a few centuries from now when interstellar travel becomes possible and imagine the choice to allow

730
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:20,800
that. People will know that as soon as they allow an interstellar colony to leave earth and go off

731
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:27,280
to another star that will be the end of this era when we could all talk and decide together and

732
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:32,800
exert enough social pressure to make sure we all do it together the same way. Once you send those

733
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:39,200
colonies out they are beyond your control for to regulate you cannot stop their competition

734
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:45,120
and you cannot stop their evolution they will evolve and become strange things so one of the

735
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,600
things I think over the next few centuries people will like is that they will prevent evolution they

736
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:56,240
will prevent our descendants from changing to become strange descended creatures. Wait wait wait

737
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,080
explain that again that last part how would they why would they want to stop evolution

738
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,120
why would they want to stop us from evolving so you're saying they would want to stop us

739
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:09,840
from becoming different? Yes so we've I mean as a futurist there have been many conversations over

740
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,800
the last few decades about the possibility of say genetic engineering or other sorts of changes

741
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:22,000
to people including artificial intelligence and a consistent theme is a fear even horror of the

742
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,400
changes that might happen and the ways that our descendants might be weird. People have been

743
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:33,440
pretty against allowing substantial genetic engineering to make our descendants genetically

744
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:38,080
different they are wary of allowing AI descendants to be mentally different

745
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,720
and they are often just wary of say population competition that is people have often been

746
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:49,600
worried about over worried about overpopulation and one of the fears they've had is that even

747
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,640
if most places limit their population the few places that don't eventually dominate the

748
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:00,320
population and so people have wanted to and talked about having regulation of fertility

749
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:08,560
to prevent overpopulation which is competition by population size. Okay so all of these themes

750
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,560
together are showing a wariness of allowing evolution of allowing our descendants to become

751
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,200
different from us that is we are human in a certain way and we like being human and we are wary that

752
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:24,880
our descendants might just not be very human they could have very different mental styles that are

753
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:31,440
in conflict with ours right and that scares people but when we have this world community

754
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,240
they will just stop those things that they don't like right just like today they would we have

755
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:43,280
like basically stopped nuclear power of the sort that scared people. So are you saying if we did

756
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:50,400
become a well integrated world community or if there was a one world governance somehow that

757
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:57,520
we would decide not to become interplanetary or interstellar? The key choice at that point would be

758
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,240
to continue to have a unified community world community now by world I mean the whole solar

759
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,640
system so within a few centuries right they would be spread across the solar system but still the

760
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:12,480
solar system small enough to allow this centralization and coordination. Our solar system so if we had

761
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,240
communities on mars right all these planets we would still be able to control it within the sun

762
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:20,320
right and anything right anything in the solar system you can throw a rock and smash it if you

763
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:28,160
misbehave okay okay basically yeah wow so so the solar system is still small enough to be within

764
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:37,840
the reach of central you know control okay so if we continue to enjoy this world community by which

765
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:43,840
where we have reduced war and conflict and harmful competition and you know things we are scared of

766
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,320
like genetic engineering or nuclear power or whatever by having this global community that

767
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:55,040
agrees on what things to stop and then at one point we have the choice to send out an interstellar

768
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:01,840
colony and we know the consequences of that that will be a hard choice I predict that is the

769
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,840
consequence of allowing interstellar colony is that we no longer regulate

770
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,840
behavior out there we'd be just letting go they would allow to do whatever they want they were

771
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:17,440
allowed to change however they want to adopt technologies however they want and then they

772
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:22,800
could come back here and destroy and test us test here control air right whatever they develop out

773
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:29,600
there whatever advances they produce out there they can come back here wow and the question is

774
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,080
would we then allow that so I can see it going either way but the point is I can see it going

775
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:40,720
either way right it's not a crazy thing for people to want to do to enjoy to continue their community

776
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:51,440
that they understand like versus allowing strange evolution and competition and perhaps fierce

777
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:59,360
unchecked competition right so the idea of panspermia is that a rock came here a long

778
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,440
time ago containing genetic material from somewhere else in the universe and then we

779
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:10,160
derived from that I've heard you explain even in more depth the idea that when the universe was

780
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:19,840
created the same life forms or biology that was on one rock expanded into everywhere so that the

781
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,520
idea is if there are aliens out there that are expanding or not that they all came from the same

782
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:32,880
source so the motivation here is that the simple grabby aliens model we just described again has

783
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:40,320
the nearest aliens being a million galaxies away right once per million galaxies so it has

784
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:45,120
almost no prospect of any aliens nearby under that simple model

785
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:53,520
but you might ask well but couldn't there be aliens closer than that might that not make sense

786
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:00,320
and you could ask me try to come up with the story where that makes sense and then I realize I can

787
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:06,560
as the simple model has things appearing independently randomly and independently

788
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,480
but what if they appear in a correlated way what if clumps appear appear together

789
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:20,800
together that would then allow the nearest aliens to us to be much closer even if on average aliens

790
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,760
appear only once per million galaxies if we're here and they're correlated then they could be here

791
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:32,240
too so the question is what sort of correlation process could there be that would make aliens

792
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:39,120
appear together in clumps rather than appear independently around the universe and panspermia

793
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:45,280
is a process that could create that correlation that's why panspermia is interesting in this

794
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:51,840
context is it would allow there to be aliens much closer than they would otherwise be

795
01:19:54,160 --> 01:20:00,560
so the panspermia story would be that life appeared somewhere on another planet not earth

796
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:06,400
and then that actually allows life to have had a much longer time to evolve so

797
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,560
if you actually look at the earliest life we can see on earth it looks really complicated

798
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,480
making it hard to believe that evolution could have produced that complexity in such a short time

799
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:25,200
so postulating an eden another planet before earth gives a much longer time scale for

800
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:31,360
much simpler life to have slowly gotten more complicated on eden and then maybe the life we

801
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:37,040
see on the beginning of earth is like halfway down the whole path so it jumped jumped to another

802
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:42,560
place to evolve right so it wouldn't do it on purpose of course but as you know rocks are

803
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,200
falling from the sky all the time and when rocks hit the ground they often knock rocks from the

804
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:54,800
ground back up into the sky right and inside those rocks is often life so that's the obvious

805
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:02,080
route by which life could move around in the universe is in rocks now at the beginning of

806
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,760
our solar system when the solar system started was born in a nursery where say a thousand other

807
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:13,600
stars were all being born in the same place at the same time and at the beginning of our solar

808
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:20,080
system there were lots of rocks flying back and forth you know enormous numbers of rocks flying

809
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:25,600
back and forth in that early solar system so if a rock came from outside that nursery

810
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:31,440
into that nursery it would have plenty of opportunity not only to land places but to get

811
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:37,840
you know smashed and knocked around and spread around so it would be plausible that life that

812
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:44,720
seeded earth at that early point of time in our stellar nursery would have also seeded many other

813
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:50,240
planets in that nursery at the same time so now we would have the scenario life appeared on some

814
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:58,080
eden many billions of years ago maybe lasted five billion years there then a rock you know hit that

815
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:06,560
flu maybe maybe that rock drift drifted for millions of years actually um and then eventually

816
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:13,600
landed in our stellar nursery where it seeded not just earth but many other planets and then

817
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:19,920
that makes the correlation so these stellar nursery only lasts for you know a few million

818
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:25,120
years and then it drifts apart these planets that were all born together drift away and they

819
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:30,960
basically form a ring around the galaxy right and we can actually find them in the sky that is they

820
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,840
all have the same mixture of chemicals because the stellar nursery was an integrated mixture

821
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,120
of chemicals so they just all have the same proportion of chemicals that you can see in

822
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:44,160
a stellar spectrum so we can actually find them in the sky find our stellar siblings

823
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:51,520
and they could find us so if life started on a whole bunch of planets

824
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:57,760
that was seeded in this nursery then over the last four billion years they would have all been

825
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:05,120
trying to advance and evolve and if the advancement of life from that stage wasn't

826
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:10,320
terribly hard then it might be that other planets also went a long way down that path

827
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,040
and that one of them might have reached our level before us

828
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:25,200
and then there could be aliens nearby this would be the best explanation for like the modern ufos

829
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:30,240
that we see today right right if you're trying to if you're trying to ask how could ufos be

830
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:35,600
aliens how could that make any sense at all then this is the best story i can come up with

831
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:41,840
because remember otherwise if they're you know once per million galaxies they're just crazy far

832
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:48,160
away and you know they would just be very unlikely for them to be anywhere near here this puts them

833
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:57,360
close now but we can go farther in trying to come up with a scenario to explain say ufos

834
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:04,960
by thinking more about the scenario i just described so if another alien civilization

835
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:12,080
appeared as a panspermia sibling there's another thing that we know about it which is that it did

836
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:18,720
not get grabby right right because otherwise our galaxy would be full of them right right

837
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,440
so we also know the timing would be they would have appeared say roughly a hundred million years

838
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,760
ago would be sort of a random time not not in the last thousand years of a hundred million years

839
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:33,840
would be roughly when they would have appeared so the scenario would be they appeared a hundred

840
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:39,120
million years ago somewhere in our galaxy and then in that hundred million years they did not

841
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:43,680
colonize the galaxy they did not expand and things so they must be one of these civilizations that

842
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:48,240
chose not to expand they chose to prevent it and succeeded at that so you have to realize that's

843
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:54,480
actually a pretty impressive achievement they're a big civilization and if any one part of them

844
01:24:54,480 --> 01:25:01,280
ever left with an interstellar colony that's the end the era of this unified thing ends and

845
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:05,040
competition returns so for a hundred million years they managed to stop that

846
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:12,960
right now couldn't an explanation for if there are aliens here if these ufos are aliens

847
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:21,040
couldn't they just be sort of like hall monitors or security guards making sure that

848
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:26,560
we could just list a large number of logical possibilities but it seems more useful to walk

849
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:32,080
through what we do know about them and then collect those implications because we we we can

850
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:38,880
draw some conclusions from the things we do know to limit the space of theories right so one thing

851
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:46,080
we know is they did not colonize the universe right therefore they had a rule that they

852
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,760
successfully enforced for a hundred million years against that in their civilization

853
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,920
so that's the thing we know about them right we know how old they are and we know they've

854
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:02,880
chosen not to allow expansion and then we know that they could find us that they could easily

855
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:08,320
see where their panspermia siblings were and they could look at them in telescopes and track them

856
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:15,680
so they could have been tracking us all that time and we know that they would know that

857
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:22,240
we threaten to break their rule they've had this rule against expansion and we don't

858
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:30,160
haven't been told about the rule and we with if they did nothing we might well break their rule

859
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:36,800
and then the thing they were trying to prevent would happen right the universe gets colonized

860
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,960
nearby by something else so that creates a plausible motive for them to be here right

861
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
so i mean the keith question is like if they've had this rule against expansion that's probably

862
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,320
a rule against a lot of travel too right they probably prevented people from traveling very

863
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:57,120
far from their home be a risk because every traveler becomes a risk to create this interstellar

864
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:04,560
explosion right so now now we have a reason why they would want to be here and take a chance

865
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:11,520
an unusual chance to actually allow someone to come here because this is a high priority like

866
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,920
we are at risk of breaking their rule a rule that kept success for for 100 million years

867
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,120
and a rule that's obviously very important to them because you know they've paid large costs

868
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:29,120
to to keep it right so so already we can see that they have chose we have a reason why they

869
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:34,400
would be here and why they wouldn't be other everywhere else those are the key things we're

870
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,800
trying to explain right and we could another thing we conclude is they didn't just kill us

871
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:47,600
that would have been really possible right so they must feel some affiliation some reluctance

872
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:54,560
to just kill us so they have some other plan to prevent us from expanding other than just killing

873
01:27:54,560 --> 01:28:02,880
us right which goes against well didn't Stephen Hawking have a famous quote on this subject

874
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,720
about another civilization coming here he said if it did come here it would be the end of us they

875
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:10,720
would come they would use farm us or they would consume us or something like that are you aware

876
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:17,040
of right right but it's certainly if you just took random past you know connect places when

877
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:22,640
humans met each other in the past as your data set you might well say yes those don't usually

878
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:28,880
go well right so which is fine but but we know more things here you see so so we we aren't just

879
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:34,640
making an analogy to a random path earth thing we are drawing step by step conclusions from the

880
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:39,840
things we know that is you know we know that they would be a panspermia sibling therefore

881
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:45,760
they would be even though they're near here the nearest other alien could be a million galaxies

882
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:51,440
way right right so they're near here but hardly anything else is right so it's not a galaxy

883
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:56,080
populated full of alien civilizations it's just them and us and maybe one other or something

884
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,440
like that that would all be all there is do you how deep do you i know you're very uh science

885
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:07,600
based analytical cold calculated person um when it comes to this stuff but how how much attention

886
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:13,840
do you pay how much attention do you pay to the stories of like interactions with other beings

887
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:18,240
that are accounted for i mean there's books and movies and documentaries about this kind of stuff

888
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:22,640
how much tend like ufos and nukes being around nuclear weapons weapons shutting them down

889
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:29,440
there's a store famous story of a ufo landing in africa in front of a school and communicating

890
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:34,960
with children telepathically about the environment and taking the dangers of technology what do you

891
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:41,200
make of those stories and how much how much credibility do you give them so this entire

892
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:49,440
topic is in disrepute in general among elites elite academics and elites of all sorts

893
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:57,200
so if i'm going to venture into this subject i want to do it very carefully so that my thoughts

894
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:03,040
won't be wasted if i am sloppy about this then i will be tainted with the same disrepute that

895
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:08,800
everybody else has been who touches the subject right so i'm i'm very eager to be methodical

896
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:16,560
and careful here and exactly how i do this right so um that means i want to sort of logically lay

897
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:23,040
out the space of possibilities and then lay out sort of the general inference task and then place

898
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:28,640
myself somewhere in that set of tasks and say which things i'm doing which things i'm not

899
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:32,880
i'm not going to present myself an expert on all the tasks that are relevant we're thinking about

900
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:38,160
this topic but i will venture into some of them and say for some of them i have relevant expertise

901
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:47,040
and i will speak to those okay so first of all we just say look there are things people think

902
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:53,040
they see right and they have to have some explanation and we can categorize the kind

903
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:58,240
of explanations they could be right so for example they could be aliens sure or they could be just

904
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:02,880
some other hidden earth organization who has capabilities beyond what they've advertised

905
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:12,160
um or it could all just be mistakes and delusions drunk drunkards and blowhards and you know people

906
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:16,720
trying to get attention right or there could be some organized hoax behind it all somebody's like

907
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:23,360
planning and purposely may having people lie and putting things up there that look like things and

908
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:27,440
just trying on purpose to write us think of something right right those are the four main

909
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,520
categories of explanation right and we're interested in judging which is the truth

910
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,960
so in general what we want is what's called a Bayesian analysis here that is we for each of

911
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:43,120
these categories of explanation we want what's called a likelihood and we want a prior a prior

912
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:48,800
is what's the chance of that scenario ignoring all this evidence just a priority what would be

913
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:55,760
the chance you would think of something like this happening and the likelihood is given that this

914
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:02,960
theory was true how likely is it that you'd see the sort of things you'd see that's and then you

915
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:07,440
basically once you have a likelihood and a prior for each of these then you multiply those two and

916
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,960
you do a weighted average and you get your posterior i see which theory you believe so

917
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:20,320
that's our task we need likelihoods and we need priors okay um so i am more of an expert on the

918
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:27,600
priors that is the likelihoods have to involve looking at these cases in particular in some

919
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,720
detail right because we're talking about how likely is it that these theories would account for

920
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:38,400
the particular things people see whereas the prior is just about what kind of things could have

921
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:44,960
happened in the universe what kind of things do ever happen you know that's and so my expertise

922
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:52,240
as someone who's done physics and astrophysics and economics etc puts me at i can speak to the

923
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:59,760
prior at least at least for some of these and less so to the likelihoods now i'll just say

924
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:09,280
i've looked at enough you know ufo reports to say it's more compelling than the data i can find for

925
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:14,640
fairies and ghosts i go look up online what's the best evidence for fairies and ghosts and

926
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:20,960
they don't impress me very much right by comparison okay i can also say in the past

927
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,920
there were things that were equally just similarly disreputed to ufos that in fact

928
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:31,600
turned out to be true so once asteroids people thought rocks falling from the sky was crazy

929
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:38,400
ball lightning is something people thought was pretty crazy except they made it in the lab and

930
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:43,360
they decided it must be true even though the actual like evidence of it outside the lab still

931
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,360
looks pretty weak but they made it in the lab so they figured okay i guess that must be true

932
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:53,120
and then there were these very high level lightning pink lightning that looks kind of like an octopus

933
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:57,040
that people said they saw a long time the first pilot said they saw and people thought that was

934
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:01,280
crazy and then a couple decades ago nasa took pictures they said oh like okay i guess it's real

935
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:07,920
so that would be my context is to say like just because this is in disrepute doesn't mean

936
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:14,000
it couldn't be because we've often thought things were crazy and then changed our mind about them

937
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:22,720
so and that um you know the actual evidence i can see i think again it's it's better than

938
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:29,920
ghosts and fairies okay okay but how much better is what you need an expert to go into those details

939
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:36,320
for but what i do want to say is the prior is high enough that you should be taking the data

940
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:43,440
seriously so think about a murder trial okay okay in a murder trial they claim a murdered b

941
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:49,520
right now if the prior on that was crazy low you would just say no that's crazy i'm not even going

942
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:54,880
to think about that right so how low is the prior in a murder trial well let's say roughly on average

943
01:34:54,880 --> 01:35:00,400
one out of a thousand people's killed and they might have a thousand other people nearby who

944
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:05,200
could plausibly be the one who did it okay so i'd say the prior is roughly one in a million

945
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:14,080
for any given murder accusation okay so a one in a million prior is something that evidence can

946
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:19,920
typically overcome that's not so crazy unlikely it's not like one in a quadrillion prior where

947
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:24,880
you'd say you know go away that's silly it's high enough that you got to take it seriously

948
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:32,160
so my rough guess for the ufos is aliens prior is roughly one in a thousand now that's quite a bit

949
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:36,320
stronger than typical murder trial which means you got to look at the evidence you can't just

950
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,760
dismiss it just like you would in a murder trial right now if you have an accusation in a murder

951
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,760
trial you don't stop there you don't just say okay you accused and so they're guilty right you have

952
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:49,440
to look at the evidence right yes and so similarly here just because this is in the realm of high

953
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:54,080
enough plausible probability that it could be true doesn't make it true it just means you got to look

954
01:35:54,080 --> 01:36:00,720
at the evidence so i could walk through my calculation for one in a thousand prior but i

955
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,560
might also just mention one of the other categories i think has an even higher prior

956
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:13,920
which is the hoax category that is the u.s government and other governments have at times

957
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:24,720
organized big hoaxes of capabilities of the sort and um i would give that a one percent chance

958
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:32,000
that's still like 99 chance no right but i'd still say that's the sort of thing that does happen at

959
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,920
times and so you got to take that seriously as well as a possible explanation and then again

960
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:43,600
it comes down to looking at the data like how plausible is it that you know they could pull

961
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:51,280
it off for the particular things we see i'm not very impressed with these delusion you know

962
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,560
mistakes theory that seems to me it's hard it's just harder to to account for all these stories

963
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:05,200
as all delusions and mistakes something more systematic would seem to be going on i would

964
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:15,040
judge but again to several other candidates what do you think the the probability is that

965
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:26,000
that there are private organizations aerospace organizations companies um that hold information

966
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:32,720
knowledge or technology that they are withholding from the public or academia that could explain

967
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:40,560
some of these anti-gravity sightings so i mean if you combine a theory of saying there really are

968
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:45,840
aliens and then some people really got that technology now you're you're you're basically

969
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,320
combining the two of these theory categories right if you just want to say there are advanced

970
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,680
organizations out there that have advanced technology they didn't get it from aliens they

971
01:37:53,680 --> 01:38:01,760
just made it up themselves then then it's hard to understand how they could be much more advanced

972
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:06,320
than everybody else because we know a lot about technology and how it advances in the world and

973
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:11,520
how you know it happens by diffusion and people hearing of other things so we just almost never

974
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:18,000
see enormous advances by some sides compared to others right it's usually within a range of the

975
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:25,840
kinds of things we expect so um the kinds of abilities reported for ufos do seem to me

976
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:33,840
substantially beyond the sort of things you might expect at least you know for several decades ago

977
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:41,600
now more recently there's this technology whereby you might say send a laser to some place in space

978
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,640
in the sky in the atmosphere and say heat it up and then make a little plasma there and then like

979
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:53,360
be able to draw that and then basically like on tv screen draw a image in space and then move it

980
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:59,120
around and you could move an image that you drew around very quickly so that seems to be an ability

981
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:05,520
that's near feasible now that could explain ufos but that wouldn't explain ufos seen in 1960 or

982
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:11,600
something right that would have to only be explaining very recent ufos because that's a very

983
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:16,880
recent capability that apparently people have now is the ability to draw like a laser pointer

984
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:22,560
right basically but except it doesn't go against a wall that stops a place in space and draws

985
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:27,680
something there right um that's exactly how some of these pilots have been describing the things

986
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:32,800
that they've been seeing like commander graver and ryan graves so from from very recent observations

987
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:39,040
that becomes a more plausible story but not for more ancient observations aerospace organization

988
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:43,760
similar to lockheed martin containing some sort of technology that could explain this stuff

989
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:48,880
would have to be directly it would have to be because they discovered some sort of alien

990
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:54,480
technology it wouldn't be something that was just created here if it was far more advanced than

991
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:59,920
the stuff that everybody else has which it is right i mean i i mean i don't know if it's true

992
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:04,240
if it is true it would it is clearly way more advanced than the kind of propulsion that we

993
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:11,280
have so i didn't finish describing the most plausible scenario so there's another thing

994
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:15,520
we know about ufos that you would need to explain to explain ufos as aliens

995
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:22,480
it's a crucial thing many people have noted which is they could have either been completely

996
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:28,720
invisible or completely visible those were i mean 100 100 million you know year more advanced

997
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:32,960
civilization than ours they could have just been completely dark orbiting and seeing everything

998
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:38,160
without being at all visible or they could have just shown up on the white house lawn as they say

999
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:43,440
and just been completely visible so apparently they are not doing either of those things

1000
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,560
so we need an explanation for why they're doing this weird thing of hanging out at the edge of

1001
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:57,600
visibility to sort of make themselves be somewhat visible but not more visible that's weird so

1002
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,840
you know if i weren't trying to explain that part i might give a higher prior

1003
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:09,280
to ufos as aliens but i need to explain that part too because again the the other weird

1004
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,720
thing about aliens is like why aren't they in the rest of the universe right why didn't they

1005
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:17,280
take over the galaxy why are they only here nowhere else that's the first thing to explain

1006
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:22,560
and so we postulated for that that they have this rule against expansion and then that's why

1007
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:27,280
they're here but then we also need to explain why are they hanging out at the edge of visibility

1008
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:33,040
not making themselves aware to everybody right but also not completely hiding exactly right why

1009
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:37,040
be partially visible what's the point right because they clearly could have chosen anything

1010
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:43,520
else if they wanted um so we want to explain that and we want to do that in the context of

1011
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,840
what we know of their motives to be here right right they're here to convince us

1012
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:53,200
not to expand without killing us right because they could have killed us those are the other

1013
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:57,040
things we know so they somehow are going to use this method of hanging out the edge of our

1014
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:05,040
visibility to convince us not to expand and not kill us that's that's the purpose of this so how

1015
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:14,720
does that work so the thing i notice is that humans have domesticated other animals primarily

1016
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:22,480
by being the top of their pecking order if we make dogs do what we want it's because we are the top

1017
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:30,000
dog okay we go into a pack of animals and we convince them we are in their status hierarchy

1018
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:36,160
and we are at the top and that's how they do what we say that's how we domesticate other animals and

1019
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:41,440
it's how we domesticate ourselves that is all through histories emperors have convinced people

1020
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:46,560
to obey the emperor because they showed they were the top person in the society they had a big crown

1021
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:53,280
and a big palace and a big army right and they displayed themselves as the top of the pecking

1022
01:42:53,360 --> 01:43:01,520
order to convince others to go along right so the hypothesis is that's what the aliens want to do

1023
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:08,000
here they want to be the top of our pecking order how do they do that they show that they are better

1024
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:16,080
than us they show very impressive abilities but not violent confrontation with us they are they are

1025
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:22,400
they are not hurting us but they are better than us just like you can't really make a bunch of dogs

1026
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:28,400
obey you if you kill half of them right okay you have to be in their tribe but they're not being

1027
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:34,960
like benefit threatening right not threatening but better better clearly better right right

1028
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:42,080
and we should be smart enough to figure out why they're here and what their agenda is they don't

1029
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:49,280
even have to say anything they just have to show themselves as very impressive better creatures

1030
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:54,160
nearby now you might think well yeah but why don't they show a little more what's the harm

1031
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:58,720
in that well why would it be a problem if they were to give us a little more detail and then

1032
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:04,160
you realize well think of how much humans have hated other humans for pretty minor differences

1033
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:10,480
between human civilizations right right right humans are pretty similar to each other nevertheless

1034
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:16,640
we find these reasons to hate each other based on what to an alien must seem like a pretty minor

1035
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:22,880
difference right so they would know that they would know that if they showed us details of their

1036
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:29,120
lives and history something about it could really put us off right maybe they eat babies they don't

1037
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:33,040
think that's a problem but we hate eating these maybe they have tentacles we hate tentacles some

1038
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:39,360
who knows right right point is they don't want to take that chance so they're just gonna not

1039
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:45,760
ever show us much detail about us about them but just clearly show they exist and that they are

1040
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,840
much more capable than us and that they're peaceful that's it that's all they have to do

1041
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,760
and that's a very simple strategy they could have approved from the beginning so remember

1042
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:58,560
another constraint in this whole process is they're scared of any expedition getting out of control

1043
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:05,120
and you know ending their era of no interstellar colonization right so when they authorize this one

1044
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:08,800
expedition not only do they only authorize it but they have to ask how are we going to keep control

1045
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:14,000
of it how do we limit its behavior how do we make sure it only does the thing we want it to do

1046
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:19,280
so they have they would want to pick a very clear strategy a simple strategy that they could

1047
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:24,960
authorize it to do and only do not be creative and come up with a bunch of new ideas when it got here

1048
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:30,000
they don't that's taking too many chances right they want to say let's have a plan they're going

1049
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,200
to go there execute the plan that's all they're going to be authorized to do that's all they're

1050
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:38,400
going to be capable of doing hopefully and then we are taking the minimal risk with this expedition

1051
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:45,200
out there to to you know go convince these people not to expand right and so you have to think what

1052
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,960
would be a plan they could think of ahead of time without knowing much about us like they can't wait

1053
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:52,480
till i get here and like learn a lot and then make a plan based on that because that would give too

1054
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:57,760
much discretion to the local team they say from a distance what we could what can we know that will

1055
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:04,720
make a plan that they could execute it seems it's interesting though like if you look just in the

1056
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:17,840
last 150 to 60 years how the stigma of the subject has become less and less it's still pretty high

1057
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:23,360
it's it's but now that the government is talking about it and the new york times is talking about

1058
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:28,560
it still pretty high that mean if you talk to other intellectuals i think you'll find

1059
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,680
doctor professors of various sorts right astrophysicists you know let's talk to

1060
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:38,720
just all sorts of prestigious people i still think you think that stigma is still pretty high

1061
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:44,640
where does it go if it keeps going on this trajectory of less and less stigma more people

1062
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:49,440
entertaining this conversation that you and i are having right now right and the world everyone

1063
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:56,480
every a larger percentage of human beings on earth being aware of this idea and being

1064
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:03,040
understanding it what how does that affect us if say the u.s government's new willing to flirt

1065
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:09,040
with the idea produced more concrete evidence that then persuaded other people that would make

1066
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:13,840
a big switch but if all they do is just release the sort of thing they've released so far

1067
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:20,720
and they don't release anything more that's more persuasive i don't think it'll tip the balance

1068
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:26,880
for a long time i mean it's basically just going to be the slow accumulation of more and more solid

1069
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:31,360
evidence that tips the balance because people are just not that willing to accept this so that's

1070
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:36,960
but it'll just take a long time but of course that's fine from the under this theory that's

1071
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:41,440
fine for the aliens they're not in a rush we're no long we're nowhere near threatening to do

1072
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:46,800
a learning style colonization yet and what would human beings do if they did discover it like if

1073
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:53,440
a small group of human beings discovered this somehow well i mean many people claim they already

1074
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:57,440
have right yeah problem exactly small groups discover but they can't convince the rest of

1075
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:00,960
people yet right would they even want to convince them some do some don't but where would they want

1076
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:06,000
to just find some economic benefit for it and try to find some leverage of competition between

1077
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,880
nations or between it's hard to see much benefit here i mean the whole point is like look they're

1078
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:15,520
not like handing out christmas goodies or something yeah but like they're just off in the

1079
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:20,960
distance being impressive right but i'm saying like if we did if if we did find evidence of this

1080
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:26,400
like like the story of bob lazar is the most famous one of i'm i'm i'm sure right yeah sure

1081
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,760
yeah where he just claims he worked on back engineering these anti-gravity crafts and the

1082
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:34,400
government had has been has been working on it for decades but we haven't been able to figure it out

1083
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:41,040
and we want to use this as sort of leverage against other nations for weapons and war so again

1084
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:45,920
there's this vast space of possibilities but i have to sort of stay anchored on the possibilities

1085
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:51,120
that make sense right i understand i can make sense of so in the simple theory the the aliens

1086
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:55,600
are just here to impress us and like convince us they exist and that we should do what they say

1087
01:48:56,160 --> 01:49:00,000
under that simple theory they don't have any particular reason to hand out goodies to some

1088
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,400
people or to like reveal our their technology to us yeah it seems kind of crazy that they would

1089
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:08,560
just accidentally crash their vehicle and leave it behind i mean again 100 million years more

1090
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:15,200
advanced it's like and so so we can be able to capture and similarly i gotta say abductions

1091
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:22,000
still don't make that much sense in this story right what they need to do is just be visibly

1092
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,480
impressive why they would need to pick some people up and like study them personal experience yeah

1093
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:32,160
there would be no need for that again 100 million more advanced they could study us just fine from

1094
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:36,160
orbit they don't need they wouldn't need to physically pick us up and poke us no exactly

1095
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:42,400
no that that would be crazy that they would a very primitive civilization would need to do that

1096
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:52,640
really so if they had that if they had the technology to to traverse so light years to

1097
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:58,320
get here they they would let's talk about what we can roughly guess about very advanced civilizations

1098
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:03,520
actually so the first thing we should be able to guess about very advanced civilizations is they

1099
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:11,920
are just artificial like they are made in factories they're designed you know they

1100
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,800
can swap their parts out you know just like we make artificial cars instead of growing horses

1101
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:22,640
right they are just artificial creatures that that and they are their minds are even artificially

1102
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:28,400
designed like and you know there's a new product line that comes out from some source and they're

1103
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:34,080
all the same in the product line and then they have some they just the modern economy where you

1104
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:38,800
make things in factories and you have firms that make them at scale and distribute them that's the

1105
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:45,280
kind of way they're made in the kind of way they run everything basically so they aren't you know

1106
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:52,080
made they don't reproduce with cell mitosis or whatever the way right they found a much more

1107
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:58,320
effective way surely that's how they would be so there was long since become artificially so

1108
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:02,080
they've long since like been able to be any physical form they want to it's not like they

1109
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:05,280
have a certain shape body that they have to fit into a craft or something right they can

1110
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:10,880
they could move into any kind of body they want to make right just like on a construction side

1111
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,960
we make different kinds of trucks and different kinds of shovels or whatever it's not like the

1112
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:18,640
nature of a construction worker to have a certain kind of shovel it's like you have a bunch of

1113
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:23,840
different things for whatever purpose you want to make make them right so there's not going to be

1114
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:29,120
the size of the aliens right or or even their lifespan or how many eyes they have none of that

1115
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:34,880
makes sense they are artificial creatures who can have as many eyes as they want to in any given

1116
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:40,160
circumstance and they can add eyes and take them away just fine right just like we can add a

1117
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:47,840
headlight to a car so that's one thing i think we can say robustly about aliens is that they are

1118
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:55,840
artificial the other thing we might want to say depends on how much they've controlled

1119
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:02,160
their competition so you know they prevent interstellar colonization and they probably

1120
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:07,920
prevent some other kinds of evolution but how much evolution do they prevent how how restrictive are

1121
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:15,040
they about their evolution so i think we can imagine two extremes one extreme is they are

1122
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:18,800
minimally restrictive like they prevent people from leaving their solar system but

1123
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:23,280
most everything else inside their solar system they just allow relatively free evolution and

1124
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:30,080
competition right all they do is just prevent stuff from leaving right under that scenario we

1125
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:34,720
should expect evolutions to continue and then we can ask what do we expect evolution to produce

1126
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:41,760
in the long run for various features of creatures the opposite extreme is where they have a very

1127
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:49,280
restrictive very centrally controlling society that has prevented and most competition and

1128
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:55,200
evolution under that other extreme their technology may have stagnated at some point

1129
01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:02,240
when they could no longer if you know innovate more because they were being so restrictive

1130
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:09,840
and even worse their society might have come to rot rotting is a feature that we see consistently

1131
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:16,880
in large complicated systems that humans have built and even observed and rotting is the sort

1132
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:23,040
of thing that central control risks and it becomes a big issue for a long-term civilization that

1133
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:29,280
has maintained central control for a long time um i think most people don't know enough about

1134
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:34,240
rotting can you give me an example of rotting in today's our world so i'll send hold on austin can

1135
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,840
you turn the air down it's getting hot in here

1136
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:43,520
sorry nope don't pause while he does that or uh you know we can keep going it's okay

1137
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:52,720
unless you want to take a bathroom break i'm fine okay cool so most

1138
01:53:53,520 --> 01:54:00,560
large software systems are these not tiny systems rot think of the apple operating system or google

1139
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:07,440
operating system or the system that runs any large bank or anything like that large software

1140
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:14,880
systems over time become harder to usefully change they become more fragile and eventually

1141
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:19,680
they are thrown away and replaced with brand new systems this is the consistent software practice

1142
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:26,640
at enormous cost if you think of any big company most large companies have a big software system

1143
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:32,320
somewhere in their process that they developed and it's a big part of their value that they have

1144
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:38,560
compared to their competitors and all of these large software systems rot with time and are

1145
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:42,880
typically just thrown away entirely and started over from scratch this is because they're

1146
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:48,240
overlooked because they're so large and complex they are looked at carefully but still the key

1147
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:56,400
thing is the process of changing them makes them rot so if you have a large software system and

1148
01:54:56,400 --> 01:55:00,960
nothing changes then you never have to change anything it can just keep going but typically

1149
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:05,200
you're trying to add features the environment that's in changes maybe the kind of hardware

1150
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:10,640
it connects to changes and so slowly over time things are changing and you need to adapt it to

1151
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:17,040
those changes customers may change customer preferences because things like firmware updates

1152
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:21,120
right all sorts of changes but the key things you have a big complicated things and stuff is

1153
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:27,280
changing so you constantly have to adapt the system to deal with these changes and the key

1154
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:32,640
thing that happens is you have dependencies between different parts of the system so if you

1155
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:37,120
if you if you don't have any dependencies then you'll just change one part of the system

1156
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:41,440
and you don't have to change anything else but when you have to have dependencies when you change

1157
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:47,600
one part you also have to change the other parts that are connected to it in a matching way

1158
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:52,720
otherwise it's broken and the problem is when you take a system with two parts that are connected

1159
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:58,880
to each other and that you change both parts to to manage something you tend to make that

1160
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:05,760
those things more fragile that has become harder to change in the future this is sort of tied to

1161
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:10,560
what we were talking about in the beginning of downloading books to the human brain right exactly

1162
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:18,480
so in fact the human brain rots too not just the cells rot your mind rots in the sense that

1163
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:22,160
you start out with what's called fluid intelligence and you end up with what's

1164
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:27,680
called crystallized intelligence crystallized intelligence means you know many specific things

1165
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:33,360
but you can't learn new general skills very easily not compared to when you were young and

1166
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:40,560
had fluid intelligence so your mind over your lifetime becomes harder to usefully change

1167
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:48,480
old dogs in fact find it hard to learn new tricks that's actually true about brains so human minds

1168
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:56,480
rot with time just like software does and plausibly even large rule systems like legal systems or

1169
01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:01,600
systems of organizations they rot with time corporations rot that is most corporations

1170
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:08,320
eventually die and are replaced by new ones even when they try to you know prevent that it

1171
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:15,600
consistently happens right rot and the the only solution we've ever had as a robust solution to

1172
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:23,520
rotting is dying and replacement right so human bodies rot and are replaced with new organisms

1173
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:29,280
our minds rot and die are replaced our software has to be replaced our firms have to be replaced

1174
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:35,200
and all at great expense we have make enormous investments in things that slowly rot and then

1175
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:42,160
have to be thrown away now but so so far like that's been the nature of history but now we

1176
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:46,000
are starting to create global structures that we don't want to replace at a global level

1177
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:51,280
like these global communities and these global habits of regulation and so now we're entering

1178
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:56,640
a new era what happens when the world as a whole coordinates on say how we regulate nuclear energy

1179
01:57:56,640 --> 01:58:01,200
we regulate nuclear energy and nobody is allowed to do it different and then that system

1180
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:08,640
rots with time what will happen then will we be willing to throw it out at some later point

1181
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:16,400
or we just deal with it slowly getting less efficient because like systems that rot typically

1182
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:23,840
can function just at a lower efficiency like the old software was working it just got harder and

1183
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:30,720
harder to change but you could just change it less and gain fewer advantages from changing if

1184
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:35,760
you insisted on sticking with it the reason why we throw it away is because the new thing will be

1185
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:39,840
cheaper and easier to change and we want to change things yeah but don't we just

1186
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:44,320
install like now we have these firmware updates for everything for all these systems are constantly

1187
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:49,600
being updated improving fixes that's part of the rot the firmware updates are part of the rot yes

1188
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:55,840
absolutely they are changes that are trying to make other things fit each other okay the reason

1189
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:59,920
why you have the firmware update is because something changed and this is the strategy

1190
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:07,520
to do that but in the process what is becoming crystallized or hardened or or becoming i don't

1191
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:13,520
understand so the key idea is that it's harder to usefully change so like the bits of the software

1192
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:18,880
don't disappear right they stay there but still it gets harder to change them okay i mean i don't

1193
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:24,320
know think of the marvel universe or something right the marvel universe is rotting in some

1194
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:29,520
sense that like they keep making new assumptions and new characters but they are limited in how

1195
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:33,360
many new things they can do because it has to be consistent with all the old things they've done

1196
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:38,160
i understand slowly over time they will be more limited what they can do in the marvel universe

1197
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:45,200
right um i mean it may still be a fun universe but it would be you know but eventually it will be

1198
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:50,720
thrown away and replaced with other universes right right so what is this rot i forgot what

1199
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:58,240
this was in context to so first it's a rot that say the aliens would suffer if they had a central

1200
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:04,720
government that limited their changes and it's a rot that we may suffer in our future if we

1201
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:12,640
you know have a strong central government or global mob that makes us all do everything

1202
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:19,520
together the same but it's a very difficult choice because you know the alternative is

1203
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:30,000
competition and therefore conflict and what do we do right so say think of nuclear power slow you

1204
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,640
know apparently we could have had a vastly more powerful nuclear power industry than we did now

1205
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:40,000
we were scared and we overregulated but now we kind of overregulated everywhere similar ways

1206
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:47,600
similar degrees what if someplace wants to not be so heavy regulated nuclear power are other people

1207
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:55,040
going to be scared of that will they allow it or will they just insist that everybody keep on with

1208
02:00:55,040 --> 02:01:02,400
the current program right to prevent the things they're worried about and that'll be true for

1209
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:09,760
lots of different ways we're organized so the key thing to notice is up until recently the world has

1210
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:16,560
competition at the highest level empires competed species competed right the fundamental thing that

1211
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:22,240
happened was empires rose and fell and empires fell in substantial part because they rotted

1212
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:26,880
but humanity could go on because humanity wasn't tied to any one empire

1213
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:36,880
we were the thing that lasted past the empires but once humanity becomes tied to an empire

1214
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:45,280
and then the empire starts to rot well then what happens then and that would be like a like a world

1215
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:51,840
civilization right with being tied to with where we agree together to do things the same way and

1216
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:57,200
collect more and more rules about such things and that begins to rot what happened the question is

1217
02:01:57,200 --> 02:02:03,520
what happens then yes are we willing to allow competition enough to drastically replace big

1218
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:10,720
parts of such things or do we just slowly get less competent and less capable you've mentioned in the

1219
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:18,240
past that uh you plan on doing something with your body after your physical being passes away

1220
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:28,000
right so i am a cryonics customer cryonics yes holding this neck tag here up if you're not

1221
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:33,600
watching and basically it says that if there's a medical emergency they should call this number

1222
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:40,560
and the plan is then to freeze my brain in liquid nitrogen and once it's frozen it won't change

1223
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:46,480
basically for centuries if they keep it frozen and then that would give me a chance to come back

1224
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:53,760
as a brain emulation later if the world i describe in the age of m comes to pass so

1225
02:02:54,160 --> 02:03:00,480
um that's a chance i have at immortality i'd say another thing we can know about

1226
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:04,160
you know advanced civilizations is they are immortal

1227
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:09,360
but immortality doesn't necessarily mean what you think it does

1228
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:16,400
the civilizations are immortal or and entities within them are in principle immortal that is

1229
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:20,160
immortality is just another robust feature of advanced civilization meaning their consciousness

1230
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:26,160
is immortal it's capable of being immortal that's the key distinction so today being immortal

1231
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:32,400
today houses and cars are immortal in the sense that if you keep maintaining them and repairing

1232
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:40,240
them they can go on indefinitely but we don't always choose to keep repairing and maintaining

1233
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:47,520
them that is they over time become more expensive to maintain and the value goes down because new

1234
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:54,400
things are more competitive or you know more capable compared to them so that will also happen

1235
02:03:54,400 --> 02:04:00,800
for our descendants who are immortal or aliens who are immortal that is in principle they could last

1236
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:08,160
forever but it will cost to keep them going and their value may decline because new things are

1237
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:14,640
just more capable where they are right so that would be an issue for me wanting to be immortal

1238
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:24,320
that is they could bring me back in the future but will they and even if they do how long would

1239
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:29,680
they keep me and so that's an issue i describe in my book the age of m about a world where

1240
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:36,000
everything is in principle immortal but it's still a matter of choice right right what would be the

1241
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:42,080
incentive to bring you back or to keep me back if i had been brought back temporarily right this kind

1242
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:46,720
of is the same thing as why would aliens abduct human beings and poke them problem right to try

1243
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:54,480
to say what's the point right because it's so out of date now i do expect that because there

1244
02:04:54,480 --> 02:05:00,400
are so few of us cryonics customers like only maybe 200 people have been frozen so far that's

1245
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:06,640
it maybe you know 3000 people are signed up for it wow even though it's had free national publicity

1246
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:14,000
for many for a half century so if unfortunately if it continues that very few people do this then

1247
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:19,600
the few of us who are available later on would be celebrities of sorts and so they would almost

1248
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:26,080
surely bring back the few of us however if what i prefer is like a large fraction of the earth's

1249
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:32,720
population we're crying customers well now it's much more of a question how many of those billions

1250
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:39,360
would be brought back if you're relying on the generosity of the future to help your future self

1251
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:45,680
out you may be taking a needlessly large chance you know what we often do is protect ourselves in

1252
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:50,800
the future that is when you retire you often retire on the basis of assets you've saved yourself

1253
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:56,400
rather than throwing yourself on the mercy of your grandchildren or something right to help you when

1254
02:05:56,400 --> 02:06:01,600
you retire right so similarly i might think well the best thing would be for cryonics patients to

1255
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:07,440
pay for their own revival to set aside assets that are available later to cover their own

1256
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:13,600
case and this is not done it is often done yes oh it is often done yes oh wow who are the type

1257
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:19,680
of people what type of people typically do this cryonics brain freezing so many friends that do

1258
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:25,200
it well yes but it's a very small fraction as i told you there's only like 200 people have been

1259
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:29,840
frozen so far and maybe 3000 people have signed up or something yeah so far that very tiny fraction

1260
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:34,480
so basically first of all contrarians right country yeah obviously you have to be willing

1261
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:40,160
to sort of put up with the social pressure that disapproves and do it anyway what um what is the

1262
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:44,480
process like so they actually take your brain out of your skull and they put it in like a bag

1263
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:52,800
or they freeze it in carbonite like uh what does this look like so the usual approach today

1264
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:58,240
there's the there's the option of whole body where they would freeze your whole body or there's

1265
02:06:58,240 --> 02:07:03,280
their head only where they would just freeze your head and not freeze the body with all of this

1266
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:06,480
yeah it was with everything so i mean the key thing is they're just trying to

1267
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:12,240
get you cold fast without too much damage happening while they get you cold so then

1268
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:19,440
the main thing is just they basically pumped anti-freeze through your blood veins okay right

1269
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:24,080
and so they don't want to rip off any skin or anything they just want to pump you as fast as

1270
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:27,600
they can with anti-freeze so the least amount of damage right with the least amount of damage so

1271
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:33,120
that you get cold as fast as possible and then they just want to preserve you in that state

1272
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:38,960
where uh again so the usual approach is through liquid nitrogen now there there is an alternative

1273
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:44,240
technological approach that seems feasible which is sometimes called plastination basically where

1274
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:54,240
they would fill your body with plastic in essence and sort of freeze the the the chemical reactions

1275
02:07:54,240 --> 02:07:59,680
that way not not just by being cold but by just basically putting stuff in between stuff that

1276
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:04,560
prevents the reactions and then that could in principle be preserved at room temperature

1277
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:09,520
which would make it easier to preserve these things but the problem is that that's a whole

1278
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:13,440
separate technology that would have to be developed there's just too few customers here to justify

1279
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:19,520
having separate technologies many of the customers today would not like the plastic approach

1280
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:25,200
because they're hoping that their current bodies will be revived i'm skeptical about that but

1281
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:31,760
again the key problem is just not enough customers here and i mean honestly i think this is a terrible

1282
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:39,040
shame in the sense that it seems to me that most people today don't need to die that is

1283
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:43,680
the main risk about cryonics is that these organizations can't last because they don't

1284
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:48,880
have enough customers so if they had lots of customers this would just be much cheaper and

1285
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:55,600
more reliable so if millions of people use this stuff then the price would come way down and the

1286
02:08:55,600 --> 02:09:00,400
chance of you not surviving would go way down what is the name of the company that does this

1287
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:04,640
is there only one there are several there are several okay my my suppliers called

1288
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:10,960
alcor but alcor okay there's also cryonics institute which is an alternative and several others

1289
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:15,760
but again the key thing is they just hardly have any customers what is the price of doing this

1290
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:21,760
um you know i'm sure it ranges a few tens of thousands of dollars up depending on how much

1291
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:26,880
you want and you know which firm you go with right basically it's quite accessible via life

1292
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:34,400
insurance for most people at least first world people right uh wow so a similar an interesting

1293
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:40,800
comparison that often strikes me is there are some people who when they die have their ashes thrown

1294
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:48,160
into space into space yes some people are turned into ashes and have their ashes thrown into space

1295
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:56,320
and beautiful that costs a similar amount and a similar number of people do it that's pretty wild

1296
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:05,360
it is so and that causes a lot less marital problems so cryonics customers do actually

1297
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:10,160
have a lot of problems where their family and friends or spouses are upset that they are

1298
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:15,440
going to use cryonics interesting and people are not upset about ashes into space

1299
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:22,240
isn't that weird similar amount of money but but i mean so obviously one would seem to have a

1300
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:27,360
chance of working ashes into space is not going to bring you back but it's in fact the fact the

1301
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:34,240
fact that you think it might work that bothers people that is it's like betrayal and abandonment

1302
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:39,440
like you're willing to leave them to go to this future world without them right right that bothers

1303
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:46,080
people whereas ashes into space doesn't so that's one of the main obstacles to cryonics is often

1304
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:52,480
people who are inclined in that direction face resistance from family and friends who not only

1305
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:57,760
find it weird but find it like it's somewhat emotionally threatening in the sense that you're

1306
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:05,280
willing to leave them go somewhere else yeah no it's uh i mean the idea of wanting to preserve

1307
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:13,280
your body after you die to be saved for potentially thousands of years to be brought back by a future

1308
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:19,840
civilization it's uh it goes back to something that you've talked about before of wanting to

1309
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:28,160
create more descendants of yourself or more versions of yourself to last into the future

1310
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:37,520
how how does that idea relate to us compared to potential alien civilizations

1311
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:48,480
the main way in the past our ancestors have influenced the future is via descendants

1312
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:55,600
right even in the last 10 000 years with a lot of cultural evolution still i'd say the main way

1313
02:11:55,600 --> 02:12:02,240
most people have influenced the future is via descendants that's because biological and cultural

1314
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:11,600
evolution have just been powerful forces in the world um so the question is for any one person

1315
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:16,160
how how do they want to be involved with that process that is do you want to influence the

1316
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:26,000
future and if so how do you expect to do that um you know if you imagine a corporation or something

1317
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:34,400
right it has a large structure that plans and then it creates future version of itself more in many

1318
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:41,200
ways through planning than through sort of random variation and selection right so sometimes firms

1319
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:47,440
have spin-off firms and then new firms are based on that but firms influence their future selves

1320
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:53,120
more through planning in some way that's right they decide to make a division and they decide

1321
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:58,640
to build a factory and they decide to promote somebody and things like that right so there's

1322
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:04,720
there's a sense in which we we influence the future at least in short terms often through planning

1323
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:08,400
and then you might think of that sort of the main alternative to

1324
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:16,080
evolution as a way to influence the future right and that's very popular in the sense that when

1325
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:19,840
people think about how do we want to influence the future they often think in terms of plans

1326
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:23,920
they say global warming how are we going to solve global warming let's come up with a plan and

1327
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:27,440
implement it or something right or war how are you going to stop war let's come up with a plan and

1328
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:35,520
implement it right so i would see you know planning versus sort of some sort of competitive

1329
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:43,600
adaptation as the two main forces that we know about for influencing the future and up until

1330
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:49,280
recently planning only ever had much impact on pretty short time scales you could plan your short

1331
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:56,240
your lifetime near in your near future right you could plan a town plan a firm but over longer

1332
02:13:56,240 --> 02:14:04,240
time scales it was evolution and adaptation that had most of the impact on change if if those are

1333
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:11,040
the only two processes i guess aliens would have to choose between them too right right um and

1334
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:18,240
you know planning has become ascendant right in recent centuries we are doing more planning

1335
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:23,200
that's in the past we didn't even have large firms right most people were small artisans working

1336
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:27,840
on a small scale firms are a new thing or large government agencies those are a new thing

1337
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:34,480
uh large longer term projects building a huge dam things like that those are all relatively new

1338
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:40,320
things so planning is ascendant right more of the world today is structured by plans

1339
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:48,800
than was true in the past but still even so at the larger scale of our society most of it isn't

1340
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:58,160
planned right new firms arise old ones go away you know new technologies arise mostly not through

1341
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:04,560
long-term planning right but planning is growing and i think that tempts people to think what if we

1342
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:10,240
could do everything with planning and then we wouldn't need competition and that's i think

1343
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:14,480
what's happening with these world mobs or world government i think that's sort of the key choice

1344
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:18,720
when we're thinking about which future we're going with the quiet or the loud aliens really

1345
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:26,560
that is in some sense the quiet aliens are likely the ones that liked planning liked

1346
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:30,720
collective decision making liked having a world community that decided things together

1347
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:37,360
and chose consciously what to do and controlled things consciously and the loud aliens are the

1348
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:45,520
ones who allowed competition allowed evolution and allowed adaptation and all the conflict

1349
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:53,360
and strangeness that would produce right so the the loud aliens are the ones that

1350
02:15:54,240 --> 02:16:01,120
cared more about descendants or they failed at the other approach i mean or they just failed

1351
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:04,240
with the other right they could have wanted to do the other one and just failed at it right

1352
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:09,440
remember just it just takes one colonist whoever leaves through the entire history of civilization

1353
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:15,200
and goes off to another star that's all it takes to end the era of the central control so it's a

1354
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:22,160
it's a high bar right so quite likely they never intended for it it was the outcome they you know

1355
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:28,720
happened because they failed to achieve the other one you talked about how humans today are becoming

1356
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:35,600
more and more like foragers because we are the the way society is structured in the last few

1357
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:43,040
centuries compared to and this is something that you've written extensively about how are we more

1358
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:48,800
like foragers foragers are the way humans live for a million years before say 10 000 years ago

1359
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:56,000
roughly right and we lived in small groups and these small groups were governed sort of informally

1360
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:00,080
by collective decision making where we sat around the campfire and decided things together and if

1361
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:05,600
people didn't like it they could leave and that's how we did things for a million years and we had

1362
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:10,960
a lot of cultural flexibility that allowed us to enter a lot of different regimes some of us became

1363
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:16,560
eskimos and some of us lived in the rainforest etc but we still mostly had the similar social

1364
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:22,400
structure of these small bands who lived collectively and then basically you know they

1365
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:26,560
had a lot of things that are different must they were relatively promiscuous they didn't so much

1366
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:31,520
have marriage they shared a lot of food made decisions collectively they had a lot of leisure

1367
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:41,200
time they had a lot of art and travel and then at some point farming became possible which i'm

1368
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:46,160
including herding and farming and farming just requires a very different social organization

1369
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:51,040
and sort of attitudes toward life in the world farmers lived in higher densities for example

1370
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:57,040
maybe communities of a thousand instead of communities of 30 they had to plant seed and

1371
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:02,560
save for the future and they had to have self-control they had property instead of sharing everything

1372
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:05,360
they were living close enough to each other they could have war and trade

1373
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:11,920
they needed to manage self-control for war and they needed to deal with inequality because they

1374
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:18,000
had these large groups that would produce inequality and farmers were just very different than foragers

1375
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:23,600
and you might think it just couldn't happen that foragers could become farmers but humans had enough

1376
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:30,320
cultural plasticity that we could change over maybe 50 000 years slowly changed to become

1377
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:40,720
farmers and and farmers then accept more slavery inequality marriage property war trade working

1378
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:47,520
harder less nutritious less travel all sorts of ways in which farmers were just different than

1379
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:51,760
foragers but that's the way the farming world lasted for 10 000 years under this new

1380
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:56,480
economic thing which was much more productive in the sense that people could just live much more

1381
02:18:56,480 --> 02:19:01,600
densely much more people per square mile living as farmers than they could as foragers so farmers

1382
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:10,000
won in that sense of just displacing foragers and then in the last few centuries we've gotten rich

1383
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,960
as we found ways to generate wealth faster than we grow the population so the wealth per person

1384
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:22,560
has gone up and in that time period as we've gotten rich the cultural pressures that turned

1385
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:29,200
foragers into farmers have weakened that is a lot of what made foragers into farmers was cultural

1386
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:35,760
pressures that was mediated by the threat of poverty that is so if you take so foragers were

1387
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:39,920
pretty promiscuous okay they didn't really marry they stayed with the partner for a couple years

1388
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:48,160
and switched okay farmers were supposed to be monogamous right for a lifetime and um so if you

1389
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:56,000
take say a young farming woman who is tempted to be promiscuous what makes her not well she is told

1390
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:03,120
over and over again at great expense and clearly if you break our rules about promiscuity you and

1391
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:10,880
your child may starve and we can show you examples of people to whom that's happened and that tended

1392
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:18,320
to be persuasive farming young women and men learned enough self-control to follow the farming

1393
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:24,560
norms that were different than the forging norms because they would die otherwise and they had

1394
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:32,480
substantial threats that were powerful but when you get rich and somebody says you know if you

1395
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:36,640
don't follow the rules then we're going to disapprove of you and you say yeah but i'm rich

1396
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:42,800
i can afford this then that doesn't work so well so in the last few centuries as we've gotten rich

1397
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:49,040
we have been felt less inclined to go along with the forager norms and rules we've looked inside

1398
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:54,640
ourselves and said yeah but what do i feel like and we've done those things and we continue to

1399
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:59,920
move in that direction of doing those things that we feel like doing because we can we're rich enough

1400
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:04,400
that we can so today a young woman is told hey if you have a child out of wedlock then you and your

1401
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:08,960
kids may have problems they go okay but i've seen other women they have kids they seem to do okay

1402
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:17,680
i think i'll do okay so you know don't bother me and so we've been moving back to forager values

1403
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:23,040
outside of work now work is different in the sense that work is the goose that lays the golden egg

1404
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:28,160
it's the reason we are rich so in fact at work we are hyper farmers

1405
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:33,840
we put up with domination and ranking and stuff at work that most farmers will put up with and

1406
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:39,280
certainly not less foragers so we are a schizoid in the sense at work wait what do you mean by

1407
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:45,680
that last part we put up with more dominance and ranking so at work most people at work

1408
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:50,320
in the modern workplaces are told what to do all the time and they're told they're doing it wrong

1409
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:55,360
and they're shown they are worse than somebody else who's shown to be higher than them even if

1410
02:21:55,360 --> 02:22:00,560
they they don't agree with that people and most farmers would never put up with that

1411
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:08,880
most farmers were relatively independent farm you know farmers or cobbler or fisher or whatever

1412
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:14,160
they worked in small groups as relative equals and they didn't have a boss telling them what to do

1413
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:18,640
all the time and after an initial apprenticeship they were in charge of how they did things and

1414
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:21,360
they could just do it that way for the rest of life because things hardly changed

1415
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:30,400
and so and even that so most foragers again are very egalitarian they're hyper egalitarian they

1416
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:35,280
just they refuse to do they won't tolerate any sort of implication that anybody's better than anybody

1417
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:39,840
else they're really sensitive that and they were really squashed that very is this also because

1418
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:47,200
there are way less people and it's not that's not central to it it was more just the norm that

1419
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:52,560
nobody should stand up so compare it to chimpanzees in a chimpanzee group there's

1420
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:59,200
a dominant set of chimps who rule over the group and are unequal okay and humans didn't want that

1421
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:04,720
to happen so humans are consciously and purposely preventing themselves from having a dominant

1422
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:09,360
group like chimps do and making sure everybody is treated equally but that means they're constantly

1423
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:13,840
wary of somebody thinking i'm the big chimp and i'm gonna i'm gonna take over here and so they

1424
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:18,880
have to be wary for that and stomp it as soon as they can okay because foragers are very egalitarian

1425
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:26,800
and they enforce that vigorously and so part of that is nobody tells anybody what to do in part of

1426
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:31,360
the forager groups and even children are not told much what to do in fact children are basically

1427
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:36,240
you know raised in a forager group by children get bored and then they follow an adult around

1428
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:40,240
and maybe the adults will show them what they're doing if they're nice and that's how children

1429
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:48,080
learn to do what adults do and so farmers have more ranking because farmers have classes right

1430
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:53,120
there's the king and there's lords and maybe slaves but it's usually only a limited range

1431
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:57,840
of classes and most people interact mainly within their class so most farmers still have a relatively

1432
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:02,480
egalitarian world where most of the people are at their level and nobody's giving orders

1433
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:10,880
and that's how most of the farmer life is and so at work but we put up with a lot of domination

1434
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:16,880
and ranking at work and it seems like school is a big part of why that's possible school seems to

1435
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:23,840
make the modern worker in a way that non-school doesn't so we've we have many stories from around

1436
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:29,600
the world when modern you know companies would go into some local area and try to put up a factory

1437
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:34,240
or some modern workplace and try to get the locals trained to work in the modern workplace

1438
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:39,280
and that often failed badly because the locals would just not do what they're told even if

1439
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:43,520
they're offered large wages and would be fired if they wouldn't do what they're told they just

1440
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:50,080
won't do what they're told so like one classic example was in India and England at the same time

1441
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:56,000
they had the same factory for you know spinning making clothes whatever you know making textiles

1442
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:00,800
right and in England the factory was six times as productive

1443
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:09,520
than the Indian factory because an Indian worker would you know have a machine and they would sit

1444
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:13,120
next to the machine they would tend that machine and the English worker would have six machines

1445
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:17,200
and sit next to them and tend them if you told the Indian worker to tend six machines he'd say no

1446
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:26,800
no that's not what I'm going to do I refuse and quite consistently across a wide range of stories

1447
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:31,840
that I've heard it's just hard to get local people to do what they're told in a workplace hard to get

1448
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:36,240
them to show up on time and especially hard them to just tell them that they're doing it wrong that

1449
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:40,640
is workers just are typically very proud and they think however they do it is right and they don't

1450
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:45,520
want this foreigner person telling them wrong especially commonly like I've told this story

1451
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:50,640
someone I knew worked like near a United States Indian reservation and basically people off the

1452
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:56,000
reservation coming into a workplace they would have this sense of status in their work from their

1453
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:00,880
reservation and they insisted that all their work tasks in a job reflected that relative status

1454
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:05,120
they would not want to do a task that was lower status than somebody else they thought was lower

1455
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:10,240
status than them right in the workplace and so I mean for example I understand why like when the

1456
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:17,600
United States went into like when United States goes into Arab countries and like tries to train

1457
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:21,360
militaries say in other parts of the world what they often has if they have a room full of people

1458
02:26:21,360 --> 02:26:26,480
are training and some of them are higher than others in the room then they can't do anything

1459
02:26:26,480 --> 02:26:29,840
in the room that would ever make a higher person look lower than somebody else in the room in terms

1460
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:35,760
of their ability on any task okay right and so they either have to only train people all at the

1461
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:39,920
same level or train them in a way that they never actually do anything because they might look worse

1462
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:45,600
and this is just a very common sort of thing people around the world are just very sensitive to

1463
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:51,520
the status they think is due to them and then the tasks on the job might threaten that status and

1464
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:56,880
make them look worse than somebody else who's supposedly lower status so but the key thing is

1465
02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:03,920
that school changes this because the main thing that happens at school is every day you are ranked

1466
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:10,160
and rated many times in a way that most adults wouldn't put up with like on most jobs most people

1467
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:15,440
get an annual evaluation right and that's a big sensitive thing you're not ranked every damn day

1468
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:22,160
constantly but students in school are ranked every day and in fact we know that that level

1469
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:26,880
frequency of rating and ranking of students makes them learn slower that's actually a thing we know

1470
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:31,920
we know they would learn faster if they weren't rated so often but we do rate them so often

1471
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:35,040
plus because that's the product that's what we're trying to do we're trying to produce

1472
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:41,840
kids who will accept a modern workplace why are we trying to do that though because that's actually

1473
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:46,880
more productive that is because it makes us rich that's the thing that makes us rich we get rich

1474
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:51,680
because modern workplaces require a high degree of organization a high degree of specialization

1475
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:56,720
and they change fast and so people have to be told what to do and told how to change it

1476
02:27:57,440 --> 02:28:02,800
and that's the goose that lays the golden egg that's how we can be more more agreeable or

1477
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:07,520
people that are more willing to take orders right and we want to produce people like that

1478
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:15,920
because it makes us more rich and it makes us more productive wow at the beginning of the

1479
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:21,280
industrial revolution people saw this and they were terrified many people so you can see like

1480
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:28,080
famous movies and novels around say you know in the year 1900 as people were seeing the

1481
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:33,120
industrial revolution spreading and they were seeing this degree of regimentation and structure

1482
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:39,120
in workplaces and they were terrified that that would spread to everything and that was plausible

1483
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:44,480
in the sense that they could see that in a factory or a shipyard or one of these very structured

1484
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:49,200
modern workplaces people did not have much discretion about how they did things or what to

1485
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:55,840
do they were told exactly what to do and how to do it and when and that seemed inhuman compared

1486
02:28:55,840 --> 02:29:01,840
to prior workplace habits and then they thought that'll spread to everything and so people wrote

1487
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:07,280
science fiction novels in the late 1800s describing what would happen if everything were regimented

1488
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:11,600
that way what if society told you who to marry and where to live what to eat for breakfast and

1489
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:17,440
what clothes to wear all the time always right and that was this terrifying vision of the future

1490
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:20,960
that people were imagining because they were seeing how regimented work was

1491
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:25,600
and they were thinking that will happen to everything right and it could have happened

1492
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:31,840
everything if we hadn't gotten rich but well as we got rich we could spend our extra wealth on

1493
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:39,760
not having that happen outside of work so you know in in a modern world living in a big dormitory

1494
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:47,760
with a big cafeteria where you all wear the same clothes is much cheaper to supply so like i visited

1495
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:54,320
a commune and there are communes out there that are you know living very poorly because they're

1496
02:29:54,320 --> 02:29:59,440
basically supplying their own food and clothes and stuff but they can do it by having just a

1497
02:29:59,440 --> 02:30:03,600
high degree of regimentation and structure where people live in communal housing and have communal

1498
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:10,800
food and clothes and that is much cheaper than the way we do things but as we got rich we decided

1499
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:14,560
instead of living in big communal housing and things we would have personalized housing and

1500
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:19,600
personalized kitchens and personalized clothes because and in fact that's what we've spent most

1501
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:26,320
of our wealth on in the last century so a century ago people were looking ahead exactly variety

1502
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:32,000
individual variety that's what we've spent most of our wealth on we could have say vastly more

1503
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:38,080
food we could say maybe work two hours a week or something with all this technology we have we don't

1504
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:44,400
need to work very much if only we would be willing to accept very standardized communal food and

1505
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:51,440
clothes and housing etc but we weren't we chose we'd rather work a lot more and have a lot of

1506
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:56,320
personal individual variety that is what you're explaining when you're saying we're becoming more

1507
02:30:56,320 --> 02:31:01,680
like foragers the individuality individual as part of the forager trend i think but so a whole bunch

1508
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:08,240
of trends are explained by this forager so we say over the last few century we have less slavery

1509
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:17,120
less religion less war more of the less less less marriage more promiscuity

1510
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:26,320
more leisure more travel more art less overt domination of all sorts at workplaces

1511
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:32,160
and in all sorts of contexts these are all trends that are explained by this

1512
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:38,880
moving back to forager styles outside of work and many people have painted science fiction futures

1513
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:43,360
where this trend continues and they love this idea like star trek is partially like this or the culture

1514
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:48,640
novels where basically in the future people work less even less than they do now they have even

1515
02:31:48,640 --> 02:31:56,560
more variety they have even more promiscuity they have even less religion they have even less war

1516
02:31:57,280 --> 02:32:02,640
um so where does that go where does that fertility where does that end up oh less fertility is part

1517
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:07,440
of that yes fertility is also for foragers had lower fertility than farmers why is that

1518
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:19,840
and why would we why would our fertility be declining so i have a more detailed theory

1519
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:26,080
but the first thing to notice is in fact foragers are lower fertility than farmers so farmers are

1520
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:30,080
farmers are often in a situation where they can have a lot of kids and they do

1521
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:34,320
whereas foragers are usually in a relatively stable environment where they control their

1522
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:38,720
fertility in order to make sure that they can stay in that stable environment so farmers have had

1523
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:43,120
just more variety in the size of their environment where they they go into a new area and they can

1524
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:47,680
just make a lot of farms etc and they can just expand a lot whereas foragers haven't had that

1525
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:53,040
same ability but it is basically also just true that foragers just tended to have lower fertility

1526
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:59,040
the space births say you know farmers might space births once a year and foragers might space them

1527
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:05,440
every three or four years or something okay um but i have another theory that also can try to

1528
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:10,160
explain this lower fertility because this is a central fact about our civilization today that is

1529
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:14,800
if you want to complain about our civilization it's like one of the biggest things to complain

1530
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:20,880
about you can say well any any decent civilization wouldn't do this in terms of if it was hoping to

1531
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:25,760
survive and reproduce right it would it would just why would it have such a lower fertility so

1532
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:30,720
i do think there's a serious puzzle to be explained and why we have low fertility and i do have a

1533
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:38,960
favorite theory but it's not just the forager theory actually it's a a variation but i mean

1534
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:42,640
but i do have to admit the forager correlation does at least predict the sign of the effect

1535
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:50,560
okay well please expand on it okay but um so the idea is that over the last 10 000 years we lived

1536
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:55,600
in these larger groups which often had things like kings and queens right like king and queen

1537
02:33:55,600 --> 02:34:00,560
of a thousand people isn't quite the same thing but still you had somebody at the top of a hierarchy

1538
02:34:00,560 --> 02:34:08,240
who had much better long-term success for having grandchildren say so over the last 10 000 years

1539
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:15,040
and and the prior 50 000 say as people were adapting to this we evolved to ask should i

1540
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:21,040
take a shot at being king or queen that's a new strategy option that didn't exist before foragers

1541
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:26,640
didn't really have kings or queens but now that we have king or queens you might ask well should

1542
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:31,760
i go for that so i could go for that or i could have my kids go for that right should i try to

1543
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:36,000
raise king kids in a such a way as they might be king but only certain people would have that

1544
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:42,160
option only people that was in yes in their lineage no so well the question is what are

1545
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:47,120
the conditions for having a shot at being king or queen so evolution cultural evolution and

1546
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:51,120
biological solution had to find a way to code that that is you know there's a lot of different

1547
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:55,360
variety of civil of groups they have different practices everything what would be a robust

1548
02:34:56,080 --> 02:35:03,280
indicator that you had a good shot at being king or queen and the hypothesis is relative wealth

1549
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:09,120
would be a good indicator that is in almost all societies if you were higher status you would have

1550
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:14,960
more wealth so you're seeing that you had more wealth than others would be an indication that

1551
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:20,160
you had a shot at being king or queen you lived in a bigger place you had more food more clothing

1552
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:25,040
more leisure just all sorts of indications of wealth would be a robust indicator that you had

1553
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:32,000
a better shot than most of being king or queen so first let's ask what would you do if you had a

1554
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:37,680
shot of being a king or queen so in most societies there's an elite culture and then there's signs

1555
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:42,240
of being a member of the elite culture and what you're trying to do is acquire those signs that

1556
02:35:42,240 --> 02:35:49,520
show that you deserve to be a member of the elite culture so you might do embroidery or poetry or

1557
02:35:49,520 --> 02:35:54,080
learn to do balls or like the different societies have different things but almost all of them will

1558
02:35:54,080 --> 02:36:00,960
have a set of cultural practices that elites have or rich elites have that others don't that mark

1559
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:06,640
you as a valid member of elites such that you are a valid candidate for being king or queen

1560
02:36:07,360 --> 02:36:13,280
right right so now the story is if i or my child has a shot at being king or queen then i want to

1561
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:19,280
invest in them in developing these cultural markers i want to teach them poetry to dance

1562
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:24,880
to embroider to sing play the piano whatever it is that in anyone's society is a marker of the

1563
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:31,040
elites maybe read more fiction know how to you know etc but it will take time to invest in that

1564
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:36,480
right and so the idea is that if i have a shot at being king or queen a better shot than most

1565
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:40,880
for me or my child then for me or my child i want to invest more in these cultural markers

1566
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:47,600
and the key point is that will come at the cost of fertility that is it'll take time away from

1567
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:52,800
other things and that if i want to invest more in each child i can't have as many children right

1568
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:57,200
okay so the idea is if i had a shot at being king or queen i would have fewer children

1569
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:03,600
or they would have fewer children because they have a better shot at being king or queen and if

1570
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:07,680
they do then that will more than compensate for the current fertility loss because king or queen

1571
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:14,800
will have lots and lots of grandkids so now the question was you know what would be the indicator

1572
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:18,960
that said i did have a shot the indicator would be relative wealth that would work so

1573
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:25,520
that's the simple story but that story doesn't work yet because in fact over the last few centuries

1574
02:37:26,080 --> 02:37:30,240
we haven't had an increase in relative wealth we had an increase in absolute wealth

1575
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:36,240
so the strategy i've just described says look around yourself at your relative wealth to the

1576
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:40,960
people around you and if you have a high relative wealth then you have a shot at being king or queen

1577
02:37:40,960 --> 02:37:44,960
then you should lower your fertility now invest more in the signs of cultural markers that would

1578
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:50,000
make you an elite qualified to be king or queen but the story doesn't work yet so i have to add

1579
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:56,240
one last mistake to my story i have to say well up until the last few centuries

1580
02:37:56,560 --> 02:38:03,360
the average wealth never changed societies pretty much always had the same average wealth which was

1581
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:08,000
pretty pretty near subsistence people varied within a society about their relative wealth

1582
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:12,960
compared to the average but the average almost never changed so this heuristic look at my relative

1583
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:17,680
wealth was perfectly fine as a heuristic look at my absolute wealth because my absolute wealth

1584
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:22,880
always told me my relative wealth until the last few centuries so why bother to do this relative

1585
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:27,440
thing just look at absolute so the story is evolution culturally and biologically encoded

1586
02:38:27,440 --> 02:38:34,320
in us this habit of looking at our absolute wealth as an indicator of whether we had a shot at being

1587
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:38,320
king or queen and if we did we would lower our fertility in order to invest in the cultural

1588
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:43,520
markers of eliteness such that we would then be a valid candidate for king or queen

1589
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:49,200
and then the problem is in the last few centuries all of a sudden absolute wealth did vary

1590
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:56,160
absolute wealth did vary we got rich consistently the whole world not just temporarily but

1591
02:38:56,160 --> 02:39:01,120
persistently and that threw off this heuristic so now everybody thinks they have a shot at king

1592
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:06,640
or queen and everybody's cutting back their fertility to collect cultural markers of eliteness

1593
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:11,440
so that they can all be king or queen which is not working very well because they can't all be king

1594
02:39:11,440 --> 02:39:17,680
or queen what is happening it seems like right now in society especially with young people

1595
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:23,760
is that people are investing more and more in their education or their careers people my age

1596
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:30,480
in particular they they are especially you know young men and women they are putting way more

1597
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:36,800
value into their finances their education their careers and i would say these are markers of

1598
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:42,320
eliteness that is the things they're collecting instead of kids are markers of status in our

1599
02:39:42,320 --> 02:39:51,440
society right and this is part of the reason that fertility is going down because we are

1600
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:58,560
we have less value on producing more children and more value on gaining eliteness for ourselves

1601
02:39:58,560 --> 02:40:04,320
and my explanation is that's executing this strategy of trying to have your kids or you be

1602
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:11,920
king or queen right so by the time you do have kids you have developed this wealth or you have

1603
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:16,320
accumulated enough you can train them to have high cultural markers so that they have a shot

1604
02:40:16,320 --> 02:40:20,800
of being king or queen so except neither none of you have a shot of being king or queen

1605
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:26,880
anymore i mean in the past you would have but now you don't so why why did we how did we end why

1606
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:34,560
did we end up here how did it get like this so the key idea is that evolution evolves strategies

1607
02:40:34,640 --> 02:40:44,880
that are heuristic and that use the cues available in in a crude way right so evolution can't can't

1608
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:48,960
look at the world you're actually in and tell you exactly what to do in your world right it

1609
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:54,480
can only find markers of the world you're in and then find correlates between things you should do

1610
02:40:54,480 --> 02:41:00,080
when those markers exist that's how evolution tells you what to do it can't look at more detail

1611
02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:05,120
right so it evolves this connection between the cues you see and the behaviors you should

1612
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:10,720
do to respond so and the way it encodes those is going to be opportunistic it's going to be

1613
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:18,560
based on what happens to be stable or not so so for example imagine there was things like water

1614
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:23,600
except they weren't water okay right so imagine there's something like water that tastes like

1615
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:28,160
water it isn't water or something else that smells like water that isn't water right now in

1616
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:31,760
our world everything that smells and tastes like water is water it's not a problem right

1617
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:35,360
so in our world evolution could have taught you when you're thirsty to get water based on the

1618
02:41:35,360 --> 02:41:39,920
taste or the smell either one it would work fine or just the way it flops when it when it moves

1619
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:44,960
or something right when evolution wants you to go get water it has a whole bunch of cues to work

1620
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:50,560
with that are all go together in our world so it doesn't that much matter right so you know maybe

1621
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:54,320
you queued off the smell of water and then that smells good and now i'm going to drink water right

1622
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:59,120
so now imagine a world where okay there's a thing that smells like water it isn't water that isn't

1623
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:04,400
really isn't actually healthy for you right well now if you appeared in that world all the sudden

1624
02:42:05,360 --> 02:42:09,200
where you had been trained in the prior world then you would start drinking the stuff that

1625
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:14,240
smells like water and and that would hurt you because it's not actually water right but you

1626
02:42:14,240 --> 02:42:19,280
know that's because you moved into a new world right you moved from a world where all the

1627
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:22,640
different cues about water all went together so you didn't actually need to use them all you could

1628
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:25,840
just pick any one of them you moved into a world where all of a sudden it makes a difference

1629
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:33,040
and now you'd be making a mistake so the key idea is evolution has this general task of figuring out

1630
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:38,080
what cues in the environment should trigger what behavior but it's only going to bother to like

1631
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:41,920
look at the actual variation in the world you're around not all possible variation

1632
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:50,320
in order to figure out what to get you to do so the story is that out for our ancestors for a

1633
02:42:50,320 --> 02:42:57,440
million years our ancestors lived in societies whose average wealth never varied so there was

1634
02:42:57,440 --> 02:43:04,000
no point in evolution coding you with this way of checking your relative wealth to other people

1635
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:08,880
was much simpler to have you just check your absolute wealth all right that was the perfectly

1636
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:16,240
fine cue up until recently to decide whether you had a shot at being king or queen but all of a

1637
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:21,600
sudden the world changes and now this heuristic that worked fine in the old world doesn't work

1638
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:28,320
so well in the new one and that's why fertility is declining we're just executing a heuristic that

1639
02:43:29,360 --> 02:43:34,320
is misfiring because it's in a new world and there's projections that show birth rate

1640
02:43:34,320 --> 02:43:39,120
where it's going and i think elon musk is one of the most vocal people about this

1641
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:44,880
so which is why he's having like so the question is like how will this problem get fixed

1642
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:52,080
and you might think okay eventually say evolution would fix it but now we have to ask well how

1643
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:59,120
exactly would evolution fix it so i think the key question is how much cultural conformity pressures

1644
02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:06,720
are involved here that is you know so for example we've seen societies like you know the mormons say

1645
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:13,920
or orthodox jews who have an unusual culture that promotes fertility right but nevertheless their

1646
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:22,880
fertility has also been falling at a similar rate just at a delayed time and even those societies

1647
02:44:22,880 --> 02:44:30,480
apparently aren't failing to resist the larger cultural pressure to adopt the larger cultural

1648
02:44:30,480 --> 02:44:37,440
attitudes toward fertility right so that is your attitude toward fertility is a combination of like

1649
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:42,880
your genetic unique attitude toward fertility plus the cultural attitude toward fertility around you

1650
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:50,880
that you're being taught right right so biology can only fix this when that if that cultural

1651
02:44:50,880 --> 02:44:55,520
that biological attitude got so strong as to overwhelm this cultural attitude and that doesn't

1652
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:59,280
seem to be true most people today that most people are pretty culturally influenced by the people

1653
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:04,000
around them some people might have more of a biological inclination toward fertility but they

1654
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:11,280
all seem to be pretty influenced culturally by the people around them so either over i mean so if

1655
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:16,480
you think about i think i did the numbers like in 1500 years humanity would go extinct if the

1656
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:21,760
population went down by half every two generations or something like that so that's kind of the

1657
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:26,880
time scale we have to work with wow so the question is well first of all can biology

1658
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:33,760
create humans who resist cultural pressures enough over that time scale which i'm doubtful

1659
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:40,480
for more likely scenarios can culture create a new culture that resists outside cultural influence

1660
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:46,080
over that time scale and that seems more plausible because we have seen cultures that are somewhat

1661
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:50,960
insular in the past right cultures that train people in that culture to follow that culture

1662
02:45:50,960 --> 02:45:55,520
and to ignore outside cultures say forget all of them they're evil they're wrong just just listen

1663
02:45:55,520 --> 02:46:03,440
to us right so then the the win scenario seems to me is that we end up with a especially insular

1664
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:11,840
fertile culture that as a culture arises which has a strong value of fertility and

1665
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:16,960
insularity that is it teaches people to not listen to outsiders and to stay away from outsiders

1666
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:22,320
and to just listen to people in the culture this has to be more insular as i said than the

1667
02:46:22,320 --> 02:46:28,560
mormons are now because they are failing they are in fact have you know responding enough to the

1668
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:35,760
outside cultural influence that they are on track to all with everybody else so this new insular

1669
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:40,880
culture is going to have to be pretty damn insular and that's going to cause a lot of costs right

1670
02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:48,080
that is you know that insular cultures have caused wars and a lot of things and you know

1671
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:51,440
especially they're going to limit innovation right this insularity is probably going to

1672
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:55,600
resist other things from the outside culture not just fertility attitudes or it's going to

1673
02:46:55,600 --> 02:47:01,360
resist technology maybe all sorts of things it might resist right and so and who knows what

1674
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:06,560
it'll be but unless we can like engineer it'll be kind of random right which insular culture

1675
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:13,280
appears that manages to to persist and of course it'll have to not only arise as an insular fertile

1676
02:47:13,280 --> 02:47:18,160
culture but also resist the outside's world trying to crush it right because the outside world may be

1677
02:47:18,160 --> 02:47:25,440
very offended by their insular fertile culture i'm less i'm less assured of biology solving the

1678
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:30,720
problem than culture that is i'm less assured that like some humans will just evolve a biological

1679
02:47:30,720 --> 02:47:35,120
inclination to just want to have a lot of kids regardless of cultural pressures or we can start

1680
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:42,720
genetically making our own kids in test tubes i'm not i don't think that helps that is it's about

1681
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:46,480
again how much you invest in each child right getting pretty far it's about how much you

1682
02:47:46,480 --> 02:47:51,280
invest in each child not so much about how mechanically you make the child in the first

1683
02:47:51,280 --> 02:47:58,880
place right most of the cost of raising children isn't the first year or the pregnancy the cost is

1684
02:47:58,880 --> 02:48:05,200
all that time it takes to raise the child to be a elite cultured child and the time it takes to

1685
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:09,600
put into them and to teach them things right so if you'd have to imagine a future where people

1686
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:13,760
are willing to like hand all that off to robots or something right well people are selfish too like

1687
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:21,440
i feel like right now people are are they're not they're inclined to produce more kids but it's

1688
02:48:21,440 --> 02:48:27,600
the time they're willing to spend on the kids because you're taking time away from yourself

1689
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:32,960
and putting it right towards this other human and you have to have enough faith and enough belief

1690
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:36,880
that you're going to right so so you have to imagine something like uh you know where where

1691
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:41,280
the kids the elites kids send their kids off to boarding school or something right where now the

1692
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:44,640
elites aren't spending the time the boarding school does now you have to imagine a very

1693
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:49,120
efficient cheap boarding school right right because somehow it's going to be able to raise

1694
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:53,920
these elite kids at a low cost to the parents so that they're willing to have a lot of them

1695
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:59,760
right that's that seems a tough game i i would more predict the insular fertile culture

1696
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:06,320
and the faster than that well robin we've hit three hours um thank you for doing this man

1697
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:11,120
hey it's been fun uh thanks for letting me spout and ramble and i'm gonna have to watch this over

1698
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:16,160
so i can understand it better but it's been quite educational i appreciate it very much

1699
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:19,120
where can people watching and listening find more of your work find your books

1700
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:28,000
find you on the internet etc well i have a website hansen.gmu.edu i on twitter at robin hansen

1701
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:34,400
i have these two books the age of m and the elephant in the brain and just google my name

1702
02:49:34,400 --> 02:49:39,040
of course we'll find it a lot or even videos on youtube google my name well thank you very much

1703
02:49:39,040 --> 02:49:42,160
again um it's been a pleasure i very much enjoyed it
