1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Counterpoints.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,800
With this double interview series, I wanted to do a pair of balanced, fair interviews

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,600
probing the differing views within the US government regarding the UFO UAP phenomenon.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,960
In this interview I am joined by Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, the recently retired former director

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,260
of AERO, the US government's all domain anomaly resolution office, tasked with trying

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,520
to identify reports of UFOs.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,120
But also to look into the US government's past involvement with UFOs and find out whether

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,200
there ever really were retrievals.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,000
More importantly, I asked how those would be classified and a number of other questions

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,880
including about the Nimitz event that has made so many waves and a number of other things.

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,280
So this serves to show the skeptical side of interpretations within the US government,

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,720
something of great interest during a time of continued congressional hearings trying

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,360
to figure out just what's going on here, if anything, along with the previous interview

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,720
on the pro side.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,480
I leave it up to you, the audience, to decide.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:23,280
You have fallen into Event Horizon with John Michael Gaudier.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,200
John is joined today by Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick.

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,240
Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick is a laser and materials physicist and senior intelligence officer

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,800
who served as the first director of the United States Department of Defense's all domain

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,760
anomaly resolution office, AERO.

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,080
He served in a variety of no-fail roles including deputy director of intelligence, US Strategic

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,760
Command, director of national security strategy, national security council, deputy director

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,880
of intelligence and the DNI representative for US Spacecom.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,680
He also served as chief scientist at DIA's Missile and Space Intelligence Center.

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,280
He is the recipient of several scientific and military intelligence awards.

26
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,880
These include the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service, the Joint

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,120
Meritus Civilian Service Award, the National Intelligence Exceptional Achievement Medal,

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,800
four National Intelligence Collaboration Medallions, the NRO Innovation and Achievement

29
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,440
Award, the Cleary Award for Scientific Excellence, and the DIA Director's Award for Excellence.

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,680
Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, welcome to the program.

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Thank you.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
It's a pleasure to be here.

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,040
Now, Dr. the Fermi paradox, and this gets into physics in general, the Fermi paradox

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,640
comes from Enrico Fermi back in the day, the 1950s, thinking about alien life over lunch

35
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,000
and saying, well, where are they?

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,600
We should be seeing them if they were common.

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,460
What is your view to sort of set the stage here?

38
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,200
What is your view of alien life in the universe as a physicist?

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,320
Do you think it's probably out there or are you in the camp that now this is rare and

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,800
that we shouldn't see it?

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,560
Okay, so the Fermi paradox is fascinating in its simplistic approach to the universe.

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,800
It's a very apt question.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,800
It's spawned lots of research, it's spawned lots of NASA programs, it's spawned lots of

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,720
SETI programs, it's spawned lots of conjecture and a lot of scientific research.

45
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,760
And coming out of that, as you all know, right, was the famous Drake equation, which calculates

46
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,680
at least at first order the probability of intelligent life in the universe.

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,480
And statistically, most of the scientific community would agree that, well, one, it

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,640
is statistically improbable that there's not life in the universe outside of Earth and

49
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,440
that across all time that the universe has existed, it is statistically impractical to

50
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,400
believe that there hasn't been other intelligent life out in the universe.

51
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:20,160
But that conversation and that exploration of that question is scientifically grounded

52
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,800
in a lot of the observations that NASA undertakes to probe the different types of planetary

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,240
systems throughout the universe as far as we can see today and how that factors into

54
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,560
the calculations for the Drake equation.

55
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,680
And just within our galaxy alone, the last couple of papers I looked at on this was estimating

56
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:55,840
based on current Webb telescope measurements, somewhere between 30 and 300 planets that

57
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,080
can sustain life and may have some form of intelligence in it.

58
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,640
That's across one galaxy.

59
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:13,560
So as a scientist, it's just mathematically impractical to believe that there's not other

60
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,880
intelligent life throughout the vastness of the universe.

61
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:26,000
Where it becomes interesting is carrying that conversation closer to this solar system and

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,120
closer to Earth, because those same statistics apply and that the probability of there being

63
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,480
an intelligent life form out in the universe that has found this particular solar system

64
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:46,020
and this particular planet is just as rare as us finding them.

65
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:55,400
So I can't see or fathom how that rationally translates to the underlying stories that

66
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,280
pervade public perception today.

67
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,320
Well, there's a plausible way, at least now, space is vast and crossing space is costly.

68
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,640
You know, you're going to need a lot of energy and a lot of time.

69
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,880
And we're constricted by things like relativity and the speed of light and things like that

70
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,640
that really put a damper on the notion of traveling between star systems.

71
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,800
But you can do it as long as you don't care about time and you've got the energy and you

72
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,400
don't care about having any connection to where you left, you know, your time, because

73
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,480
everybody's going to be dead by the time you get back unless they live for ridiculously

74
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,920
long periods of time.

75
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,720
But one plausible way, and I've talked to other physicists about this, is the idea of

76
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,000
a von Neumann probe where you have a machine, essentially a self-replicating machine that

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,160
can populate a galaxy inside of a few million years at sublight speeds, at comfortable speeds.

78
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,560
And a machine doesn't really care about the passage of time.

79
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,280
So that is the one way that this could happen, where you could have an alien presence in

80
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,200
most star systems.

81
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,960
And let's face it, 3D printers exist and something could be printing out UAP or atmospheric

82
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,600
probes to look at the most interesting planet in this star system.

83
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,560
Presuming this one is the most interesting one.

84
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,120
So there is a plausible way.

85
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,800
Did you account for that in Aero?

86
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,680
Did you think, well, maybe?

87
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:28,800
So when we set up Aero, one of the key tenets of setting up Aero and all the processes that

88
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,600
I put in place to do so was to follow the data.

89
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:41,720
It was to be open to all hypotheses of what could be possible and then look at where the

90
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,000
data led you.

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,520
And none of the data supported that theory.

92
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,000
So we did have a range of hypotheses.

93
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,520
I had on one end of the spectrum, you have the alien hypothesis, whether it's probe or

94
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
otherwise.

95
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,000
On the other end of the spectrum, you have adversary technology, leap ahead technology

96
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,760
that they are intentionally trying to hide from us.

97
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:13,400
And then in the middle, you have really all of the mundane known objects that just manifest

98
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:20,640
themselves in weird ways because we haven't calibrated our sensors against those.

99
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:28,160
And so what was established was a very rigorous scientific method for how do you test that

100
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,520
range of hypotheses against all of the reported observations is that one, you had to start

101
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:42,640
with all of those military sensors, all of those ground based or air based sensors or

102
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,000
even space based sensors need to be calibrated against known objects.

103
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:57,680
Most of the reporting comes from military or Intel, mostly military platforms and pilots.

104
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,480
And what everyone needs to understand is those platforms are purpose built.

105
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,560
They are designed for one thing, and that is to identify large metallic types of objects

106
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,680
coming at them and put a weapon on it.

107
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,720
So if it's a missile or an aircraft or a ground system or whatever it might be to identify

108
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,720
those large, fast moving objects and put a weapon on it, they are not designed to identify,

109
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:38,280
for example, weather balloons or small drones or other types of objects that have been used

110
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
for a variety of different purposes.

111
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,440
And one of the things that one has to do when approaching the scientific method out in the

112
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,880
world is start with calibrating all of your sensors and make sure you understand what

113
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,240
those sensors would see.

114
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
And so that was one piece, right?

115
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,680
Set up the calibration program to identify those known objects.

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,360
What do they look like in, for example, an F-35?

117
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
What do they look like in an F-22?

118
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,080
What do they look like in a ground radar?

119
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,520
And catalog all that, understand what those characteristics are.

120
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,240
Then you take the reported observations and any data that has been collected with that

121
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,080
and compare to the known objects.

122
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,120
That's sort of step one.

123
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,120
The next two steps involve two different communities.

124
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,880
So if you look at that range of hypotheses again, if I go to the end of the spectrum,

125
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,120
that could be adversary advanced technology.

126
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,320
That is the purview of the intelligence community.

127
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:51,200
And so I had chartered the intelligence community to go and look for what were some of

128
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,480
the research programs that our adversaries were working on and what would happen if they

129
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,280
had a breakthrough and that what we thought they were working towards in a decade they

130
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,760
were able to achieve today.

131
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,440
And what would that look like?

132
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,920
And what were those signatures?

133
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,120
So then you'd have a body of knowledge that involved validated here are the signatures

134
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,920
and capabilities that the intelligence community assesses an adversary would manifest

135
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,040
with. You have the measured signatures of all the known objects.

136
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,520
And then your last bit is, OK, well, what would what would alien tech look like and

137
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,000
how would it potentially manifest itself?

138
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,200
And so that was part of the challenge to the scientific community through NASA.

139
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,200
Oh, all right. Well, we know theoretically how interstellar travel works.

140
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,840
While we may not have been able to achieve it from an engineering perspective, we know

141
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,320
what the basic underlying physics are.

142
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,640
We've seen lots of papers and literature about it.

143
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,200
What does that look like?

144
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,080
What kind of signatures would that manifest as?

145
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,160
And then keep all of that as your measurement stick.

146
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Right. And so when you get different reports and you get different data that we then had

147
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,560
directed to the military and the IC, you know, new reporting requirements to maintain

148
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,640
and transmit all of that data, you can then have something to compare to.

149
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:29,400
And as you go through that exercise time and time again, it turns out to be in the

150
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,800
middle. It turns out to be mostly the known things that you've characterized and

151
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,760
compared to. Was that frustrating, though, when dealing with that with with instrumentation

152
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,800
that is not ideal for studying something other than a Chinese fighter jet?

153
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,360
Was that frustrating in trying to resolve cases in aero?

154
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,640
In other words, did you wish you had more data?

155
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,720
Oh, absolutely. Always wish we had more data.

156
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,320
And so part of part of what I had done was also design purpose built monitoring sensors

157
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,320
for areas that had high levels of reporting so that we could go out and do persistent

158
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,200
surveillance and monitor on a continuing basis what was passing through the airspace and

159
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,160
what characterize it as best we can to augment the sensors.

160
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,800
There were not designed to do that.

161
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,480
So, you know, what I think a lot of folks fail to understand is that a U.S.

162
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:35,520
aircraft, an F-35 or an F-22 or an F-4 or 14 or whatever it is that's flying around

163
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,520
and collecting is not a scientific platform.

164
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,040
It is not meant to collect and characterize unknown things.

165
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,480
It is only meant to do one thing.

166
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,480
And that is type a set of known objects, foreign adversary aircraft, missiles,

167
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,280
what have you, and put a weapon on it, not characterize an unknown object.

168
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,200
And so when it sees an unknown object, these advanced aircraft and these advanced

169
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,560
platforms try to the algorithms try to make sense of it.

170
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,480
And when they try to make sense of it, they make mistakes.

171
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,120
The algorithms make mistakes.

172
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:20,160
I mean, it's just like if you take an AI, you take a chat GPT and you give it bad data

173
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,800
to train on, it's going to give you really weird answers when you talk to it.

174
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,400
It's the same concept.

175
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,440
It's it's just in a machine characterization language.

176
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,240
And so, yes, it has been very frustrating because people then pull on the, well,

177
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,360
somebody saw X and the radar said this, and so therefore it must be an alien.

178
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
I'm like, well, no, it doesn't, right?

179
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,040
Because radars make mistakes when the algorithms don't understand what they're looking at.

180
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,840
And a great example of that is how a radar operates.

181
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,640
So a radar sends a series of pulses out to a target and it looks for the reflections back.

182
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,520
And from that, it classifies and characterizes speed and range.

183
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:13,000
If that object is semi-transparent, like a translucent weather balloon that only has

184
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,320
a few thick wires through it, those reflections are they're not well defined.

185
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,280
They're sporadic and they they tend to give a false range.

186
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,720
They give a false speed because the algorithm is trying to fill in the gaps of the missing data.

187
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,520
And we've shown this time and again in the lab and in the field where we did live

188
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,560
characterization events and tried to get that into our quiver of how do we compare

189
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,280
unknown objects to the sensors.

190
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,200
You know, folks don't understand that and they don't know that that's how these things

191
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,560
operate and they pull on this as as it must be factual.

192
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,160
So, yes, that's a long way of saying it's very frustrating.

193
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Now, biases.

194
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,880
And in science, you always want to try to remove biases and at least recognize them

195
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
and your assumptions as well.

196
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,280
But in this case, Arrow wasn't making the assumption.

197
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,080
You didn't go into this saying, well, it's not aliens.

198
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,960
You went into it going with an open mind.

199
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,200
Now, do you think that's a problem with NASA and technosignature searches?

200
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,920
In other words, and you've said it to paraphrase you, the orbit of Mars and views change

201
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,960
the closer you get.

202
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,920
So a technosignature out of Jupiter would be seen as one thing or you co-authored a

203
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,720
paper on that, that that's one thing.

204
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,280
But the closer you get to Earth, the views begin to change and the profile changes.

205
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,680
Now, I have a caveat here.

206
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,560
The thing is, I can't tell you the difference between a von Neumann probe in the orbit of

207
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,080
Jupiter versus one in the atmosphere.

208
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,720
It's the same thing functionally.

209
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
So how do you rectify that?

210
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,800
What's your view on that?

211
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,800
That where does that bias come in and what does it mean?

212
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,920
Yeah. So let me let me give you my my actual characterization of this, of the scientific

213
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,800
discussion. And at some point, I think I want to turn it into a political cartoon or some

214
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,880
sort of cartoon. So if I have this conversation about the search for for extraterrestrial

215
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:30,440
whether that's intelligent or a bacterium, and I'm doing it in the context of the scientific

216
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,160
community and NASA's mission to find it.

217
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,520
And it's as long as we're talking about it out in the universe, across the Milky Way

218
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,800
or even into the vastness of of the universe with all the other galaxies that are there,

219
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:53,280
then it's a very scientific, objective, data driven, evidentiary driven discussion and

220
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,880
analysis. As I move that conversation closer to Earth, somewhere around my conjecture is

221
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,080
somewhere around Mars ish, it becomes more science fiction.

222
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,280
Right. You're you're now there's a there's a there's an element of science fiction that

223
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,760
creeps into the discussion.

224
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,000
Any number of movies about this have happened.

225
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:26,000
And then as I get that conversation closer to Earth, somewhere as I cross the ionosphere,

226
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,160
it crosses into conspiracy theory.

227
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,760
And clearly, the government's lying and we've been hiding alien tech that has crash

228
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,360
landed, I don't know, 12 times in the United States, and we're hiding all that.

229
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,360
So these are the kinds of things that that make it very difficult to have a rational

230
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,600
discussion about the evidence and about the data because of that, that transition from

231
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,800
scientific to conspiracy.

232
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,880
Now, that being said, how do you fix that?

233
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
I think to your point, how do you get to this?

234
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,120
How do you actually have this conversation?

235
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:13,160
How do you distinguish between a technosignature of a probe at Jupiter versus Earth?

236
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,680
And the answer is it comes back to the scientific community.

237
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,320
And this was something I challenged them with very early on.

238
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:29,040
And I was enlisting the help of NASA to help push that is, OK, you know, it's a it's a

239
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,000
valid hypothesis.

240
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,440
It could be a hypothesis.

241
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,160
What is the data that supports that and what would those signatures look like?

242
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,960
What kind of propulsion would be evident?

243
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,520
What kind of signatures would that propulsion give?

244
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,080
What kind of refueling and energy harvesting would need to be done?

245
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,960
Why would one put a probe here?

246
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,960
All right. And we can talk about that a little bit in the context of NASA sending probes

247
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,360
out. Why would we do that?

248
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,840
What would we be looking for?

249
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:09,800
And put some peer reviewed scientific papers into the into the domain that point to

250
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:18,560
if there was a probe in Earth's atmosphere, how would it get here?

251
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,080
What are the three most probable ways it would get here?

252
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,560
What are the three most probable ways it would maneuver around the Earth?

253
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,920
What are the three most probable ways it would harvest energy and take all of that

254
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,760
and figure out what the resulting signatures and indicators would be and then

255
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,720
marry that to the data that we have?

256
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,680
And what you'll find is none of that matches.

257
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,920
And so what you what you're left with is, OK, well, then that hypothesis, while

258
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,760
it's still a valid hypothesis, has no data to support it as being the answer to

259
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,880
what you're seeing.

260
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:03,000
So people, when they don't get the when the answer doesn't when the data doesn't

261
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,440
support that hypothesis in the scientific community, that means that hypothesis is

262
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,920
not correct and that you have to change your hypothesis.

263
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,080
It doesn't mean your data.

264
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,600
You have to change your data in this particular topic area for reasons that are

265
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,640
fascinating from a psychological perspective.

266
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,840
The human condition wants it to be an answer that data does not support.

267
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,280
So scientifically, to answer your question, if I wanted to distinguish a probe in

268
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,560
Jupiter or Earth, you still have the same signatures.

269
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,640
Now it's a matter of do any of the signatures you've measured either in Earth or

270
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,200
around Jupiter match your hypothesis?

271
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,120
Does that make sense?

272
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,400
It does. It does.

273
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,640
Now, I have to ask the point blank question that I'm sure you get a lot.

274
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,400
Just to clarify, did you find any evidence or see any evidence of a non-human

275
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,920
intelligence present here?

276
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,200
And I use that word very specifically because there's ideas floating around, like

277
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,360
the the Solarian hypothesis where it isn't aliens, but it's still weird and things

278
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,960
like that. Did you or did you not see any evidence or even something slightly that

279
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,920
made you go, hmm.

280
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,720
No, I have there was nothing in the over.

281
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,880
I think by the time I retired, I think we were well over 1300 cases or something

282
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,680
like that. And none of them had anything that would give an indication of a

283
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,160
non-human intelligence.

284
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,920
Now, did we see things that were weird within some of the sensors that did

285
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,960
produce data?

286
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,160
Yes. Were any of those alien signatures?

287
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,400
No. Could they have been adversary signatures?

288
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,080
Could they have been commercial signatures?

289
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,280
Sure. They could have been a number of other explanations that we uncovered.

290
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,600
And I think that's the important part is, all right, let's say I have something

291
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,800
that's unusual.

292
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,000
If I can come up with three different explanations, one of them being, OK, it's

293
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,920
an alien and we don't know anything about it.

294
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,480
The second one being, OK, well, maybe it's this commercial product that this

295
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,920
company is advancing and the U.S.

296
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,560
government's not really paying attention to, and it just happens to be there and

297
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,760
we see it. Or the third one being, it's an adversary that's doing something that

298
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,920
we didn't expect them to do.

299
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,480
But there's evidence that they're doing that.

300
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,440
Which one are you going to believe is more likely?

301
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,560
Is it the alien or is it the adversary or is it commercial?

302
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,200
And you don't you don't know right off hand, but logic would suggest that one of

303
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,320
the more common and simple answers like, I don't know, it's a commercial thing

304
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,240
that's just out there and we can go find what it is and here's what it is.

305
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,960
And it could have been this, likely could have been that.

306
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,000
That is Occam's razor, right?

307
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:10,680
So that would suggest the more simple explanation is likely versus an alien.

308
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,600
But then from a national security perspective, we have to investigate.

309
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,360
And this is where the real rub is.

310
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,120
And this is really what Arrow is kind of focused on is, let's make sure that the

311
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,840
adversary is not doing something.

312
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,960
We need to make sure that the adversaries aren't aren't jumping ahead in a

313
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,720
technological advancement and say, I don't know, propulsion or signature

314
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,160
management that we weren't tracking or else we were tracking, but they had a

315
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,200
breakthrough that we didn't anticipate.

316
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,400
Now, something that was looked at as an evolutionary technology has suddenly

317
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,800
become revolutionary because they had a leap ahead and they're employing it

318
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,520
against us.

319
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,840
Well, that would be bad, right?

320
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,320
From a national security perspective, that's, that's bad.

321
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:05,840
That's called a, that's called a, it could be a technological surprise and we

322
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,160
don't want that, right?

323
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,600
So you, you, you got to look at all of all aspects of this and it becomes

324
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,760
frustrating and even to the point of maddening of where some people come out

325
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:27,120
on, well, it can't be that it must be aliens and there's no logical reason why

326
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,640
one can make that known at all other than, than belief.

327
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,400
And that's just frustrating.

328
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,560
Now, methodology to get a little bit deeper into that with Arrow, visual

329
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,880
artifacts and compression in videos, not to, not to frustrate you further and

330
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,440
remind you of frustrating things, but how big of a problem was that when you're

331
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,360
looking at something that just isn't there, it's an instrument error?

332
00:25:52,920 --> 00:26:00,080
Yeah, that, that happened a lot and, and a lot of folks don't understand it.

333
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,680
If you've not dealt with imagery or imagery intelligence for a large part of

334
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:14,920
your career, you can't understand the types of weird artifacts that show up

335
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,160
in advanced sensors that you just would think is something else.

336
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,840
And there's an example that we put on Arrow's website.

337
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,520
It's one in which there's an apparent UAP that's leaving some sort of a wake

338
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,240
in the, in the video.

339
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,880
As you watch the video, it looks like an atmospheric wake behind it.

340
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:43,520
And at first, when you look at this, your gut reaction is, wow, that is really weird.

341
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,440
That is so cool.

342
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,720
That looks like what you might see in some sort of advanced propulsion system.

343
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,640
And that must be, you know, evidence of, of an advanced propulsion

344
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,560
system that we don't understand.

345
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,840
Well, when you peel that onion back, and by that, what I mean is you have to go

346
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,200
frame by frame and pixel by pixel with the raw data, not the compressed data.

347
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:21,360
And what you'll find is that, that, that wake that you see in this video is, it's

348
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,440
a, it's a shadow image of the object from the frame before, and that's an artifact

349
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,560
of the signal processing that occurs frame by frame in this sensor.

350
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,520
And so what you have to do in order to accurately analyze some of this data is

351
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,960
you have to, A, you have to understand what sensor it came from.

352
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,360
And B, you have to understand what kind of signal processing and algorithms

353
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,800
are done on the platform.

354
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,440
And the only way you can do that is you have to go to that particular program

355
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,000
office that, that builds and integrates those sensors on our military platforms.

356
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,080
And you get a surrogate sensor or you get the software or you get the, the

357
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,440
underlying models that are used to validate the sensor performance and you

358
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,640
recreate what it saw and you validate, okay, well, this is actually, you know,

359
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,920
not a wake, a real wake in the atmosphere.

360
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,040
This is an artifact of the signal process.

361
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,880
And we, you can find these kinds of examples in a variety of sensors that

362
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,960
actually show, like we had one in comparison for that particular example of

363
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:48,240
a predator looking at a ground, a scene, and there were people walking across the

364
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:55,680
scene and the people were leaving shadows behind them that looked like a wake that

365
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,520
was the cutout of the person.

366
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,280
And so you see the same artifact in other imagery examples, and you really have to

367
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,920
understand that, how those work and how that operates in order to draw a

368
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,720
conclusion.

369
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
And in that particular case, I believe that was turned out to be another

370
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,720
aircraft and it was out of focus.

371
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:25,280
And so it looks like a oblong cigar and it's leaving a wake because it's the

372
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,240
signal processing of the saturated areas of the scene.

373
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:38,080
So it's a very complex analysis that has to be undertaken for every single one of

374
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,280
these ports.

375
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,240
And, you know, people get frustrated out in the world because they're like, well,

376
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
why can't you do this faster?

377
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,640
Because that's why you have to pull apart every frame.

378
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,240
You got to pull apart the sensor.

379
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,880
You got to pull apart the pixels.

380
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,560
And you can't do that level of analysis with a compressed video off the internet

381
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,840
because you lose all of that information.

382
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,440
Compression, to put it onto the internet, gets rid of all of the valuable

383
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:17,520
information at the pixel level, of the metadata, of the information about the

384
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,680
sensor, which you need in actual to do the analysis.

385
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,480
So if you were to look at a compressed image of the same sort of weird artifact

386
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,720
without having any of that other information to do that analysis, your first

387
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
response would be, hey, that's really weird.

388
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,720
That looks like evidence of some sort of atmospheric effect when in fact it's not.

389
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,520
Yeah, that's I mean, technology comes with its problems and with our ever improving

390
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,440
technology, it actually sometimes seems to get worse and new problems crop up.

391
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,080
Now, one of the most famous cases regarding the military and UAP of recent years, 20

392
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,960
years, is the 2004 Nimitz case.

393
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,320
And I know that you've said there was a sort of a lack of data, you know, this

394
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,160
distant from that 20 years again.

395
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,480
But did you see anything?

396
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,760
And I want to ask this a little bit differently than probably most people would ask you.

397
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,280
Did you see anything that indicated that it was our technology and the pilot simply

398
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,080
didn't know about something that we had?

399
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,400
So that, you know, obviously I get asked about that case a lot.

400
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,560
I got asked about that case a lot in Congress.

401
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,520
There are a number of challenges and I'll get to the answer to your question.

402
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,000
There's a number of challenges with that case.

403
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:46,880
One is it's 20 years ago and 20 years ago there was no requirement to save all of the data.

404
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,240
There was no requirement to process that data.

405
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,520
There was no requirement to even report the incident.

406
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,120
All of that we changed when we stood up Arrow.

407
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:05,200
And it's important to note that it took however many years that was, 16 years, 17, 18 years,

408
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,200
when we stood up Arrow from the Nimitz event that that's when we changed all of those

409
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,440
policies and made it a requirement that you will report.

410
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,640
And here's what you will report and you will maintain all of that data and you will transmit

411
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,000
it to Arrow and to the service for analysis.

412
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,000
So there, you know, there was no requirement to keep all of that.

413
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,280
So when people question, well, why is there no data?

414
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,480
Well, it's not a big conspiracy.

415
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,440
It's a it's a logistics issue, right?

416
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,600
These platforms don't save the data.

417
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,440
They have a single recording device that is overwritten every mission.

418
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,160
So there's no data off of those platforms.

419
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:55,680
Now there's allegations that, hey, there was a Aegis around and it collected data.

420
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,600
And, you know, why don't we have that data?

421
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,840
Well, it's a similar argument.

422
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,760
There's no requirement for that.

423
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,840
We don't have the Aegis data for every mission that was ever flown, including

424
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,960
every training exercise, which this was.

425
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,840
And your training in an in a range that is a test range.

426
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,200
So let's now let's walk into answering your question.

427
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,720
I spent a good amount of time talking with one of the pilots to get some descriptions of,

428
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,120
you know, what exactly was being seen and how is it being seen so that we could get a little bit

429
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,240
better understanding of some of the signatures associated with it.

430
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,520
For example, was this something that may have come out of the water versus going into the water?

431
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,400
And if it came out of the water, and what does it look like?

432
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,880
What did it look like as you were flying?

433
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,000
What's the what angles and so forth?

434
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,120
It's interesting to note that there are several programs, both U.S.

435
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:09,680
and foreign, that could explain that, especially if you're in an experimental test range

436
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,560
where one side of the range doesn't know what the other side of the range is doing.

437
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,520
If you're thinking it's the U.S. technology.

438
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,600
And if it's an adversary, well, you know, they want to know what we're doing in our test range.

439
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,040
There are some ways to do that.

440
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,960
So there's let me give you an example.

441
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:36,480
There was a declassified CIA program back in that time frame where they would launch

442
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:46,160
their balloons with retro reflectors inside of them from the water to monitor what responses

443
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,120
would be from ground radars and aircraft responses.

444
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
What would they see and how would they respond?

445
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,560
Why would we think we're the only ones that thought of that?

446
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:05,280
So I'm not saying that I have data to support that that is exactly what it was,

447
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,200
but that is certainly a more logical explanation than it was.

448
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:17,600
And the problem is I can come up with a couple of hypotheses for what that was,

449
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,760
but we don't have any data to analyze.

450
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,080
So you're never going to answer that question.

451
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,000
We're just not going to be able to answer what that was

452
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,680
because there is no data.

453
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,520
I am glad that I don't work for the U.S. government because that just got me thinking

454
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,920
when I was growing up, my dad was a field test engineer and worked at the Nevada test site,

455
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,280
which is enormous.

456
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,120
And I could just imagine how many different tests are going on.

457
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,880
And the person that knows about all of the tests happening at the same time

458
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,920
and has all the details, which probably is a very few people do,

459
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,040
imagine coordinating that to make sure your F-117 doesn't hit a

460
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,400
weather balloon or something like that.

461
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,000
It's got to be maddening, wouldn't you think?

462
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,760
Exactly.

463
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,760
That kind of deconfliction is what test range managers are supposed to be doing.

464
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:15,760
And there's no, you know, if a test squadron on one end of the range happens to see

465
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,840
a classified program on another end of the range,

466
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,240
you know, mitigation of that can range from ignoring it and pretending it never happened to

467
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,640
bringing the people in and making them sign inadvertent disclosure agreements,

468
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,360
which is essentially an NDA that says, hey, you saw a classified program

469
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,360
you weren't supposed to see and you're not briefed to and you're not allowed to talk about it.

470
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:49,200
That is a standard practice of inadvertent disclosures across the classified community,

471
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,760
whether it's DOD or IC or anybody.

472
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,640
So there's no, but again, there's no hard evidence one way or the other.

473
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,920
So we could come up with all kinds of these scenarios and explanations and hypotheses,

474
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,200
but unless I have data, there's not a lot to be done about that.

475
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,120
Yeah, no data then might as well be confetti, unfortunately, you know?

476
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,600
Right.

477
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,240
And I think everybody wishes there were more data, but again, I have to hammer home the point that

478
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,520
you're dealing with sensors or we're dealing with sensors that weren't designed to look for UAP.

479
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,560
They were designed to look for Russian and Chinese aircraft.

480
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,120
That's right.

481
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,440
However, we do have some interesting wild cards and that is the NRO.

482
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,680
Now there was a Freedom of Information Act release that they had seen something that

483
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,840
looked like a tic-tac from orbit.

484
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,000
And I was wondering, did you look into that?

485
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,040
Are you aware of it?

486
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,800
And did you, were you able to do anything with that satellite data?

487
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,280
Yeah, so there were a couple of those reports and we actually worked with them very closely

488
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:58,320
to do some research into historical imagery and forward imagery and even tasking,

489
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,320
trying to get tasking in real time to when an event may have been seen.

490
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:14,080
And all of those turned out to be weather balloons, radio songs, and in one instance,

491
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:22,800
it was, you know, it was another sensor anomaly on basically cosmic ray in the sensor.

492
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,040
So without getting into details about NRO's business, because that's obviously all very

493
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,040
classified, yes, we did look into a number of these things.

494
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,280
None of them turned out to be tic-tacs in the popular sense.

495
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,280
They turned out to be, you know, aerostats or weather balloons or radio songs.

496
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,360
I guess that's probably going to be pretty crazy too is because anybody can launch a balloon,

497
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,240
right?

498
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,720
Anybody and, well, obviously drones, but there's limits on that.

499
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,440
But the balloons, I don't think there are much limits.

500
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,440
And any private individual or group, you know, say you like to study clouds or whatever,

501
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,840
that's your hobby, can launch a balloon.

502
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,960
So there's stuff all over.

503
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,240
But does that worry you?

504
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,840
And then I got another question related to this, but does that worry you about aviation

505
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,400
safety that these balloons are going unchecked?

506
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:14,880
Oh, yeah.

507
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,600
So that was one of the primary drivers for why the department agreed to stand up aero

508
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,200
was safety of flight, safety of flight issues, not just for the military.

509
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,840
But for FAA and NASA and everybody else associated with it.

510
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,360
So there's a couple of key things to understand that we learned as we were standing all this

511
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,920
up.

512
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:45,840
There is a, you know, an international community of balloon, professional balloons,

513
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,960
civil scientific balloon organizations.

514
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,520
And they are, they have agreed amongst themselves.

515
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:02,080
And I think there's some sort of agreement that underlies this to put essentially beacons

516
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,600
on their balloons.

517
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,640
And they launched them.

518
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,760
And you can track them in real time.

519
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,240
In fact, we put the website links on Aero's website.

520
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,720
If you go there and you look under the resources, you can go and look up.

521
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,120
Here's all the balloons that are registered with this community.

522
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,160
Here are the beacons.

523
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,600
Here's where they are today.

524
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,160
Here's what country owns them.

525
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,560
And then there's a hobbyist community that has done the same thing.

526
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,920
So there's another website that you can track hobbyist balloons and you can watch them and

527
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,720
see where they are.

528
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:48,080
So on one sense, you have a database of overt, legitimate balloon payloads and operators

529
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,320
around the world in real time.

530
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,800
So you should be able to de-conflict with those.

531
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,880
It's the ones that don't have those beacons or are flying in the air spaces they're not

532
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,800
supposed to be that you got to worry about.

533
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,680
And so part of what we established were rules for how to de-conflict that and get that out

534
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:18,640
with the operators and all of the air spaces to go, hey, if you see something, first thing

535
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,240
you need to do is de-conflict with these two websites and let's make sure those are

536
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,440
not what you're seeing.

537
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:35,280
And then there's a third place and that's NOAA and NASA have a database as well.

538
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:44,000
It's not quite as user-friendly as the two websites, but it is complete and tracks

539
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,480
everything that is registered with a beacon on it.

540
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,480
So you can think of these beacons much like aircraft AIS systems and they beacon out here's

541
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,280
who I am and here's where I am and here's where I'm going and you can follow them around.

542
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:07,120
But it does still worry everyone and it worries me that these balloons don't, while they're

543
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:13,440
beaconed and they're tracked and they're there, there's not a lot of coordination between

544
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:25,120
that community and say the test ranges of military or even the FAA on knowing what to do with that

545
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:30,240
because many of them are at the, of course, the mercy of the winds and the climate.

546
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,400
Some of them have the ability to maneuver, limited though it may be, but they can.

547
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:50,640
So how do you integrate that airspace in a safe manner and alert the pilots and the

548
00:42:50,640 --> 00:43:00,160
operators that what you're seeing is this balloon from a group in Japan or Norway or

549
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:08,160
the US and you need to avoid it, but there's a lot of them out there.

550
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,680
I mean, there are thousands and thousands and thousands of these balloons that are launched

551
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,440
daily and are tracked all over the world.

552
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:25,760
It's just phenomenal to me that we've got that kind of air domain congestion problem that is

553
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:33,680
increasing and we haven't quite figured out how to deconflict and instead people come upon these

554
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:42,640
things and don't know what they are because they're flying really fast by them and it causes

555
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,120
challenges, causes problems because if you run into one of those things, especially one that's

556
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,160
got a payload hanging off of the bottom, that's going to rip a wing off if you're flying it,

557
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:00,160
mock one in a jet and you happen to run into a balloon with a payload hanging off the end.

558
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,280
That's probably not a good day for that pilot.

559
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,440
No, that is scary. I've thought about that at high speed. You're in an F-22 or something like that

560
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,280
hitting one of these balloons and like you say, a payload, not good. It seems like an accident

561
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:22,880
waiting to happen. Now, all domain anomaly resolution office arrow, all domain,

562
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,560
what are the submarines seeing? Because I know that the hydrophone network has picked up some

563
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,480
strange sounds that took 20, 30 years to come up with a hypothesis as to what they were, which is

564
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:41,840
usually ice moving in Antarctica, things like that. What are they seeing and is that a lot

565
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,200
harder to deal with than things in the air? Oh, absolutely. So the maritime domain,

566
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,680
integrating the maritime and the space domain was something I had started last,

567
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:03,760
I guess, the summer a year ago. Space is actually, I think, an easier step than the maritime domain

568
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:12,320
because in the maritime domain, undersea is noisy and not only is it noisy, but everything is

569
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:19,760
anomalous because there are so many unknown noises that crop up that people have to try to sort out.

570
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:27,760
I had one report that turned out to be some guy scraping barnacles off of his boat with a new

571
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:35,520
type of scraper, two bays away from where the sound was picked up. But it took six months to

572
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:43,600
figure that out. I mean, these are not trivial events and they haven't in the maritime domain,

573
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,640
at least by the time I retired, we hadn't come up with a good way of distinguishing.

574
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:56,720
When you hear something, what are the characteristics that would cause you to claim that is

575
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:06,160
an anomalous technological thing that we need to go investigate versus it's an underwater volcano

576
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:15,120
or it's a whale or it's a school fish or whatever the things are that while we may know what those

577
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:21,520
sound like, again, I go back to the way the architectures are set up, a lot of this is

578
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:28,000
automatic. You record some noise and the algorithms don't know what it is and so they

579
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:36,400
put it off to the side for somebody to listen to and analyze. Well, okay, how many of those do we

580
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:45,280
get? And there's a lot of unknown. So we didn't have a lot of, to answer your question more

581
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,520
directly, we did not have a lot of undersea reporting because of that very fact, because

582
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,280
everything is anomalous and nobody knows what qualifies as something we would report. That's

583
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:06,320
just not there yet. Now in space, it's a little easier. We have a good track of everything that's

584
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:16,160
in space and we have a catalog that monitors this and we have objects that show up that are

585
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:23,040
designated UCTs, right? So they're uncorrelated tracks. That's what that stands for. And basically,

586
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,360
it's an object that shows up, could be a micrometer, right? It could be a screw that fell off of

587
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:36,560
somebody's satellite, it could be anything. And it gets us a couple of returns off of one of the

588
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:42,480
radars and now we've got a track and well, what is it? And now you've got to figure out what that

589
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,800
is. Well, I hate to tell you this, but space congestion is a really, really bad problem.

590
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:59,280
When we turned on Spacefence, I want to say, if I remember correctly, we had the number of

591
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:11,040
UCTs went to 40,000-ish and it was a daily deluge of thousands of objects that nobody knows really

592
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:19,920
what they are. But the good news is they all obey Keplerian physics, right? So if it's not obeying

593
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,040
Keplerian physics, well, that would be anomalous and that would be easy to pick out and report

594
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,960
and no, there were none of those. But trying to work through the,

595
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:35,120
okay, well, what's going to be the reporting process and how do we build that into the sensors

596
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:40,240
and the algorithms so that you can pull those kinds of things out? That takes time, but there

597
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:47,040
was a good path forward on how to do that. So I think that one is more achievable than the under C

598
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,880
one at this point. Yeah, but the thing is that that problem is going to get worse space with the

599
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,760
amount of launching. I mean, just look at Starlink, speaking of something that could be mistaken for

600
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:04,240
a UAP. It's just astounding. Thousands, tens of thousands of satellites and constellations,

601
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:12,800
all full of parts that can get lost. And Starlink is a great example of we had many multiple reports

602
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:23,360
of UAP and multiple UAP, some of them from very reputable groups, right? And whether it was special

603
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:31,600
forces or radars or what have you, that it would say it would be a Starlink launch that was

604
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:40,560
letting loose a string of 20 to 60 satellites. Well, if you look at a string of 20 to 60 satellites

605
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:49,840
being ejected from a launch through say an infrared system or a radar system, that looks

606
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:56,800
really weird. And unless you know that that's a Starlink launch, you're going to report it as a

607
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:04,640
weird UAP thing because that's what everybody was doing. So we had lots of that, lots of UAPs that

608
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,160
turned out to be Starlinks that we had to go back and correlate to a Starlink launch and correlate

609
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:17,520
to the trajectory of the satellites. And yes, that was just Starlink. Now you had a slide,

610
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,720
and I believe you showed it at your NASA presentation. You had a slide about UAP reporting

611
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:29,440
trends and it had some interesting stuff hidden in there. One was radio emission section. It said

612
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,040
one to three gigahertz and then eight to 12 gigahertz. How did you arrive at those radio

613
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:41,440
frequencies as being associated with UAP? So let me be clear about what that section of that

614
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:48,160
chart said. If you look at the top of that, it should say reported UAP or something to that effect.

615
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:57,600
That set of characteristics that we put in there, it was taken from all of the various reports

616
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,440
at that time. We've had reports about, you know, they're spherical, we've had reports about

617
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,280
there being possible radio frequencies that might be correlated with it. And those were the

618
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:16,160
radio frequencies that were reported. We never measured those radio frequencies, but there were,

619
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:22,160
you know, some, like I want to say it was one or two reports that said that those were potentially

620
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:31,280
correlated with the observation of a UAP. Now what's important is it just so happens that one

621
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:44,400
to three gigahertz is also Wi-Fi and the eight to 10 is near one of the X band radars. So there's,

622
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,600
there are other potential explanations for what those radio frequencies were, but that was what

623
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:56,720
was reported. And we were trying to capture in that chart, here's kind of everything we're looking

624
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,760
for. And how we're trying to go about doing that is, well, yeah, all right, we're going to

625
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,000
put some sensors out to measure those frequencies and we're going to look at, can I correlate that

626
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,640
with any observations of UAP? And we did not, we found none of that. Now the other part of it

627
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:19,680
that I found interesting was stationary to Mach 2. Did you ever see anything anomalous that was

628
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,400
going Mach 2 because a balloon is not going to do that? Or was that just the, under that same

629
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,280
categorization that you're like, well, this is what we should look for at these speeds,

630
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:36,000
but why not faster? No, that's what was, again, that was what was reported. The high end of that

631
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:44,320
range came from some, from a report from a radar that, that seemed to indicate that an object was

632
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:52,640
going from roughly, I want to say it was around 0.4 Mach up to, you know, not quite two, but one,

633
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,200
one and a half Mach or something like that. And then dropping back down. And what we think that

634
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:08,560
actually turned out to be was this phenomenon with the radar where the pulses were not all returned

635
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:16,640
and the onboard algorithm, which was trying to calculate range and speed, was filling in the

636
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:23,760
gaps with the missing data. And that gave it, that essentially made it calculate this,

637
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:33,760
this very rapid acceleration. So we think that particular case was essentially a radar artifact,

638
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:40,320
but again, all of those parameters are things that had been reported. And so we wanted to

639
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:48,640
capture all of that as a holistic, here is the entirety of what's been reported and we're going

640
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:55,040
to be investigating each of those. And we're going to see if we can measure anything in a more

641
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:02,320
controlled fashion with better fidelity that would substantiate any of those characteristics

642
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:09,680
that were reported. Other countries. Now, we're not the only country in the world and other

643
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,600
countries have looked into UAP. In fact, France has looked into it for decades through their

644
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:22,080
Gaipin program and they've correlated all kinds of stuff. And there was even a semi-official report

645
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:28,320
that concluded that aliens were the best option. Was there any international coordination between

646
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:34,320
Aero and other countries regarding what they see with UAP and in particular France, because a lot

647
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:40,240
of people associate UAP with nuclear energy and France is the only other country that operates a

648
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,120
nuclear powered aircraft carrier. Did you ever call the French and ask them, what do you guys see?

649
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:51,680
Yeah, we've, we've, we had coordinated with a number of countries and we were trying to get

650
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:58,480
kind of a level set of what, what does each country actually see? What do they have data to support

651
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:05,840
and what kind of framework are they putting in place, if any, to do the same sort of measurement

652
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:11,840
and analysis that we were. And most all of them, in fact, all of them came back with, we don't

653
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:19,040
actually have any substantiating data. We, however, like your framework and we would like to leverage

654
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,840
your framework on how we're going to go about collecting and analyzing this. And we'd like to

655
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:29,680
share data and, and see if we can try to get to the bottom of some of these things. Now

656
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:37,360
they put into place to my knowledge, many of the same reporting requirements and data requirements,

657
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,000
but they didn't, they, they haven't gotten anything and they certainly hadn't provided

658
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,040
anything to us by the time I retired. Now moving further instrumentation and

659
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,960
mounted on military assets. Now you've touched on this a little bit, but let's go into it deeper.

660
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,760
The idea of classification, and you've said this many times, is not because of what you're seeing,

661
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:05,280
a bird isn't classified, the instrument is, and you can't tell other nation states your capabilities

662
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,640
and you want to keep that as secret as possible. But can you go out and take, I don't know, off

663
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,080
the shelf stuff, sort of like what the Galileo project is doing and create an experiment to

664
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:21,120
watch and then mounted on an aircraft carrier in a way that doesn't show anything sensitive

665
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:28,560
and do a data set like that. Will Arrow try to proactively collect data on UAP from military

666
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:35,440
assets? So that was the plan. You know, I'd have to refer you back to them to see how far they've

667
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,600
gotten down that roadmap. But let's, let's talk about the classification of data for a minute,

668
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:48,800
because it's an important aspect that, that keeps coming up. So there are two ways data gets

669
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:56,320
classified, right? I can have a classified sensor that has state of the art technology.

670
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:01,920
I don't want my adversary to know what my sensor can do, because if the adversary knows what my

671
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,640
sensor can do, then they can defeat it or they can spoof it or they can jam it or they can do

672
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:14,800
whatever. But if I have a great sensor and it's on a platform and it takes a picture of a Coke can,

673
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:23,120
that picture is classified because if I, if I release that picture as it is, then somebody

674
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:29,680
can take that picture and reverse engineer the picture and figure out what the sensor can do.

675
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:38,960
And then you've, you've given away a susceptibility of the sensor. That doesn't mean that the Coke can

676
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:46,480
is classified. It just means that the image is because of that. So to declassify that takes time

677
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:55,920
because the owner of the sensor and the platform has to do a couple of things. One, they have to

678
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:03,360
scrub the data down to remove anything that could be exploited by an adversary. And that can,

679
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,200
that can mean everything from reducing resolution to scrubbing all of the metadata and all the

680
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:16,400
things off of that. And then they have to evaluate it based on where it was taken,

681
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,960
because if it was taken during a sensitive operation, you don't want to give away details

682
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:30,640
about the operation. And so, you know, the owner operator has to sign off on that. All of that

683
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:37,520
takes time. And, and the time that it takes is directly proportional to the priority of said

684
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:44,560
thing. And so, for example, there was the incident last year, I think it was last year sometime where

685
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:53,360
the, where the Russians, you know, flew at the predator and we had the video, we got the video

686
00:58:53,360 --> 00:59:00,320
declassified. And I want to say it was like 36 hours sent out. Well, that's because there was

687
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:08,720
a high, high, high priority with international relations with Russia. And the White House was

688
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:15,200
very interested in making sure we got that out. So under that kind of pressure, that declassification

689
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:21,600
is going to happen very quickly. Now, there's a whole other way that a set of data can become

690
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:27,600
classified. And this, this gets to, you know, commercial technology or scientific technology

691
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:34,480
that isn't, the sensor isn't classified. But if I take a camera and I go out and I,

692
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:43,120
I take a picture of the back end of the new B-21, that's classified because we're hiding

693
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:50,720
certain characteristics of the platform, even though the sensor wasn't. So you have to balance

694
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:57,600
and you have to understand what is being collected. So one of the, one of the,

695
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:06,640
one of the issues is not imagery, but actual signals. So what signals are being collected

696
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:16,640
off of say military comms systems or radar systems or platforms that you don't want others to know

697
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:23,840
about? Because then that gives them access to, you know, command and control and how the,

698
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:33,040
how the sensor RF might operate. And that's a, that's just as vulnerable as the imagery aspect.

699
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:39,920
So there's a, there's a wide range of things that affect classification,

700
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:50,720
but the collection of a UAP is not classified unless it comes from a classified sensor

701
01:00:51,520 --> 01:01:00,080
that we have to then have declassified, unless it's being taken in front of a new stealthy

702
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:05,280
platform that we don't want anybody to know about. So those are the kinds of things that,

703
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:09,600
that affect classification and how fast you can get it declassified.

704
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,000
Now, what of agencies within the Pentagon that have a different classification system,

705
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,800
lesser perhaps, or classified for completely different reasons? And I would implicate the

706
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:28,800
Coast Guard here because they do similar things to the Navy. The Navy sees UAP. What does the

707
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:34,800
Coast Guard see? And is that less classified? So if the Coast Guard saw anything,

708
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:40,560
unless they're using a special sensor to collect it, it shouldn't be classified,

709
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,360
but the Coast Guard didn't give us any reports of any.

710
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,720
So nothing from the Coast Guard. That's interesting. Nope.

711
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,040
For comparison reasons, you know, with, with the Navy, but different, different instruments.

712
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:56,720
They're working with a completely different set of Coast Guard. Yeah. A Coast Guard cutter is

713
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,120
going to have a lot of different equipment related to law enforcement more than the military.

714
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,360
At least in peacetime anyway. Now, as the director of Arrow, now former director,

715
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,360
had you found something in the halls of government? Let's say a frozen alien body

716
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:19,040
sitting at an Air Force base or something like that, Area 51 or whatever. How would you have

717
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:24,800
handled that? And would you have disclosed it? I mean, what would you do if you had found something

718
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,200
and then a future director of Arrow? What, what if they find something hidden and they're like,

719
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,440
how do I release this or do I?

720
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,560
So nothing would have made me happier than to be able to actually find aliens, but I didn't.

721
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:46,880
So I've actually had this conversation with multiple folks in leadership, both my previous

722
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:53,360
boss, the deputy secretary and the undersecretary INS. And the, and the question was just that,

723
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:58,320
right? If we find something or we measure something or we collect on something,

724
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:05,440
what classification is it? What should it be? Is it even classified? And the answer that I think

725
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:12,560
we all settled on was the discovery of extraterrestrial life is not a department

726
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:20,320
of defense or IC mission. It is NASA's mission. And so if we had found anything to that sort,

727
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:26,400
it would have been turned over to NASA for disclosure and announcement and analysis.

728
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:32,720
Yes. But what if it was technologically advantageous? So you get a piece of UFO

729
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:37,200
that's very, very high technology that we could back engineer and use. I don't know that you

730
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,200
would hand that over to NASA. So how would you classify that? I don't know that anybody,

731
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:52,640
I don't know that anyone would actually do so. They might keep the technology to try and understand

732
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:59,520
how to use it, but the existence thereof would still be turned over to NASA.

733
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:05,600
So openness, were you happy with the openness that you got with, within investigating branches

734
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:10,480
of the government and asking around, were they, did you run into anything where you're like, well,

735
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,520
this person's being invasive or anything like that. And the thing is, is that, you know, you can't

736
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,800
read a person into every program, every SAP or everything, because that's dangerous. You don't

737
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:26,640
want somebody knowing too much. So were you happy with the openness or did you ever hit any brick

738
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:31,360
walls? Now people sometimes speak about that, that hitting brick walls in government, like the

739
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:39,040
Department of Energy perhaps, did you run into any of that? No. In fact, everybody across multiple

740
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:48,720
departments, Homeland Security, DOE, DOD, IC, everybody, NASA, everybody was fully open and

741
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:58,000
transparent because they wanted to put data to this problem. They wanted to address this problem

742
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,160
because frankly, they wanted to stop having to answer the questions. They wanted to move on with

743
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:11,040
the missions that were really important to them. I don't know, like a couple of world wars and

744
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:17,920
some conflicts and maybe going back to the moon and things of that nature. So I never ran into any

745
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:25,920
hesitation. I was given access across the board on everything that we needed, everything that we

746
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,360
came across. If I came across something that I didn't already have access to, I would get access

747
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:38,880
to it. And then we analyzed and assessed everything. And it's fascinating to me how folks

748
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:47,280
try to hide behind that. And I don't know how many ways I can say this clearly. Every program that

749
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:57,680
people named as being potentially part of this conspiracy, we had full access to hold the programs

750
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:05,840
out of the archives in many instances, got exactly what they were. And when I wrote up the final

751
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:14,400
assessment, there was a very classified version that had all of those programs that were identified

752
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:20,080
in there and what they actually were and what the conspiracy theorists were claiming they were.

753
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:27,200
And that is with the congressional leadership and with the department leadership and with the

754
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:35,760
IC leadership. And so going in the future, that will continue. The next director will

755
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:42,000
finish that analysis with the next set of data that had come in as I was retiring.

756
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:51,040
We had reviewed all of those programs. Same thing. Nothing extraterrestrial there, but

757
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,840
fascinating nonetheless. Do you think the government sometimes shoots itself in the

758
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,720
foot, however, and creates mistrust? And we have to point out during the Cold War, all sorts of

759
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:06,800
weird things happened. Things like, for example, the church committee uncovering hidden documents

760
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,120
that were stuck in a warehouse when a bunch of them had been destroyed by, I believe, the CIA.

761
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,880
Or testing radiation patterns by dumping radioactive materials off buildings in St. Louis,

762
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:22,000
giving people syphilis, all of that. The government has a terrible track record from that period

763
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,200
for openness and transparency and not sticking to government, you know, stuff that, you know,

764
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,560
ethical stuff that it should. I'm not saying that this is going on now, but it did. It did happen.

765
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:38,320
Could it be that during that period, the US government was perpetuating an alien origin

766
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,440
hypothesis for UAP in order to hide the very programs that you looked into that people are

767
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:50,080
associating with UFOs? Yeah, that is a very plausible hypothesis. And yes, the government

768
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:58,000
tends to shoot itself in the foot often. I think one of my windmills that I tilt at is the lack of

769
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,840
really communication and transparent, not transparency, but a lack of communication

770
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:12,000
in what they're finding and how it was found to try to mitigate some of the narrative and get

771
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,720
control of the narrative that's out there. Certainly that is a possibility. What we found,

772
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:23,440
and I think, again, what is important to understand from a historical perspective,

773
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:34,080
is there was no organized Pentagon level concerted effort to perpetrate such a cover story,

774
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:44,880
if you will. There is some anecdotal evidence of local officers or local commands jumping on that

775
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:54,160
bandwagon in order to hide programs because that was an easy cover story and it was fun to do.

776
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:01,200
But it's come back, I think, to really bite them. And now that you've got to be able to

777
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:09,280
demonstrate that through data documents and people who can attest to it, and that's

778
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:14,160
going to take time and investigation. And a lot of it, I'm sure, is going to be protected under

779
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:21,360
the Whistleblower Protection Act that everybody pushed to get forward. And while it protects both

780
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:27,360
ways, so anybody that comes forward to talk about their knowledge of that kind of a cover up is

781
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:34,480
also protected. So it's going to be hard to untangle a lot of that. Do you think it's possible

782
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,680
in your position, which everybody knew what you were doing and you were appointed to it and

783
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:46,000
doing it, do you think it's possible that you were misled by anybody, in the contractor system,

784
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,640
particularly? Do you think that, you know, was there any indication that you thought,

785
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:56,080
well, maybe I could be misled here? No, I had no indication of that. A lot of these folks,

786
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:02,800
especially in the contractor communities, I've known for many, many, many years, had working

787
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:11,760
relationships with. They bent over backwards to try to not only help me find records or evidence,

788
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:18,960
but also people who had knowledge, you know, kind of firsthand knowledge of story origins and what

789
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,120
was actually happening at the time that this particular event was said to have occurred,

790
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:32,640
and got them to come in to talk to us so that we could document all of that and write it down and

791
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:41,120
investigate it and cross-reference it. So we actually untangled quite a bit of one of the

792
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:49,200
allegations for a contractor, you know, hiding in this technology and where that actually came

793
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:58,880
from and how it was linked to some of these other stories that don't have any validity either.

794
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:07,760
So it's an interesting way that the stories propagated, but from a misled perspective,

795
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:14,640
no, I had no indication I was being misled by anyone other than some of the whistleblowers

796
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:20,800
that were coming in. Now, there is something burning the internet down, and it's another

797
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:27,360
FOIA thing, talking about recovery and materials transfer in a document. What did that mean? What

798
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:36,880
is the story behind that document? Okay, so Arrow is congressionally directed to come up with

799
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:44,240
not just standard reporting or procedures, but also mitigation and response procedures for,

800
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:54,160
in the event of a shootdown or a collection of any sort of UAP, keeping in mind that UAP

801
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:04,960
involves everything from balloons to drones to alleged alien tech. And so to do that,

802
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:11,840
mitigation and response, as well as standardized reporting, will occur through all of the combatant

803
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:19,520
commands. And so that particular meeting was to go meet with the J3, who's in charge of operations,

804
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:26,880
to start the discussion on how we're going to define those procedures and whether or not

805
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:34,880
we have to provide a flyaway team in the event of any sort of shootdown to collect whatever is there,

806
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:42,400
because by law, Congress told Arrow it had to come up with mitigation and response procedures,

807
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:49,280
as well as develop flyaway teams or whatnot to go and collect anything that had to be done.

808
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:57,120
The problem is, those types of activities are already covered under foreign material

809
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:06,240
collection and analysis. So there's already a process and procedures in place for many of

810
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:13,520
these things. And so this conversation was really to start, how do we document that for UAP? And

811
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:18,560
what kind of procedures do we need to put in place? What kind of processes do we need to put in place?

812
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:24,960
And I started with space command, because that's where I came from. And that was a kind of an easy

813
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:35,360
way to get this started to address congressional concerns. So there wasn't an actual thing. It was

814
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:40,880
a, hey, we need to go have a conversation about how we're going to do this and get the teams

815
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:47,520
started in documenting that, that goes into the J3, which is the director of operations,

816
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:55,840
operational procedures and processes. So you literally created a UFO recovery team,

817
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:05,760
in short, in the event something like that were to happen? It's any UAP recovery. And it was really

818
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,240
more the process and procedure, because they already have people in place that would collect,

819
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:16,080
if we shot down another Chinese high-optitude balloon, it's that team that would go and collect

820
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:23,280
it. It's those procedures and processes on how it gets notified and how we go and get it.

821
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:28,720
And that would be now true for pretty much anything. Does the government have an Indiana Jones

822
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:34,000
warehouse where they have all of these foreign materials, Russian, Soviet, materials from the

823
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,720
Cold War planes and things like that, that they recovered parts of the missiles and everything

824
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:43,920
else that are archived somewhere and still kept secret because it's sensitive because of foreign

825
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,760
relations? I wish we had a big old warehouse like that, but that would be fun. But we do,

826
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:57,120
the IC and the DOD collects foreign material and they exploit it, just like foreign adversaries

827
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:03,200
collect on us and exploit it. And so some of that stuff is stored in places. I had to ask a question

828
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:08,960
because obviously it's burning the internet down. So, all right, aliens. I got two more questions

829
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:13,840
for you. And this one's just aliens in general. Is that treated as a national security concern?

830
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,560
In other words, say you had found something, wouldn't that be really scary to have an alien

831
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:25,120
civilization of presence here of very highly advanced nature, far beyond anything we can do?

832
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,520
Does the government say that's a national security threat? In other words,

833
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,120
would that have been a high priority? You know, we need to build some missiles or something like

834
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:39,840
that. Or do they just assume they'd have done something by now if they were here?

835
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:48,240
No, and this will be a wholly unsatisfying answer. But when we actually, again, when we had this

836
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:54,880
conversation about if we actually found anything, what would the classification be and how would we

837
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:01,280
handle it? Most of that apart from, you know, the part of, okay, we're going to get, you know,

838
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:07,040
NASA will take lead, but it's also going to be, it's got to go up to the president for a decision on,

839
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:13,120
you know, is it a national security issue or is it a, you know, human, you know, humanity,

840
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:20,480
civilization issue? And so that's, I think, what would actually happen is it would get briefed

841
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:30,160
over probably in partnership with the department by NASA up to the president for a decision.

842
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:34,560
Yeah, and I know certain presidents have thought about it because I believe Ronald Reagan asked

843
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:40,160
Gorbachev if the Soviets would help us if there was an alien threat and Gorbachev said yes. But

844
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:46,080
again, you know, that's presidential level. Now, my last question, and this is a fun one.

845
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:53,520
In looking into all of these programs and past programs and finding, not evidence of aliens,

846
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,080
but did you find weird historical stuff that's eventually going to come out about programs that

847
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:04,240
we did that's just really cool? In other words, we really did make this kind of a plane or something

848
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:08,400
like that and it's just not out there yet. Was there anything that you thought, wow, that's amazing?

849
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:21,440
Well, obviously, I would have to say I am very impressed and deeply proud of both the DOD and the

850
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:28,720
IC's capabilities that they are developing and building to protect this nation. And I think

851
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:34,880
everybody should take some solace in that. There are some really, really great technologies that

852
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:41,760
are coming. Really great. I'm hoping for fusion energy. Well, everybody's hoping.

853
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:48,240
Everybody's hoping. Well, imagine if you had, I remember Lockheed was developing a compact

854
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:52,560
or trying to develop a compact fusion reactor that could be launched into space that was the

855
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:58,240
size of a truck. And I'm like, man, if we had that and we had fusion energy in space, it's

856
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:05,120
Battlestar Galactica. Oh yeah, that'd be awesome. It would be. All right, Dr Kirkpatrick. Oh yeah,

857
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,120
go ahead. No, I was just going to say there's a fusion energy conference coming up here at the

858
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:16,640
end of next month. I think we'll talk about the state of the art of fusion community. I think that

859
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:22,160
would be a fascinating thing to listen to. Oh, absolutely. All right, Dr Kirkpatrick,

860
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:27,040
thank you for joining us. I've been giving me so much time and good luck in your endeavors from

861
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,920
now on and I will continue to watch Arrow under the new director and see what they find, or don't

862
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:37,280
find. All right. Now we're not fine. Yes. All right. Well, I appreciate it. Thanks very much.
