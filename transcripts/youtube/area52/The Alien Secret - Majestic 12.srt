1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
I was coming home on a country road over an abandoned farm area and upon turning the corner

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,920
I noticed a craft in the sky, rectangular craft, multi-tiered, hovering with lights

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,400
and I was just floored.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,320
But I noticed it spinning and then it kind of stopped for a fraction of a second as I

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,360
was coming around the corner.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:33,680
And I was just overcome with the most primal fear in my life and so I floored the car,

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,800
I gunned it, I drove like a hundred miles an hour all the way home with the feeling

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,040
that this was on my tail.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,240
I was terrified to sleep.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:52,360
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to another episode of Debriefed.

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,280
My name is Chris Ramsey and today folks we're going to be deep diving into one of the

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:05,200
documents contained within the MJ-12, Majestic 12 document leak, namely the Eisenhower briefing.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,720
Because you see folks, in July of 1947 the world would be forever changed with the alleged

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,320
crash of a UFO in Roswell, New Mexico.

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,520
And later that year in September of 1947, General Forrestal and Harry Truman, the president,

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,340
together formed and created MJ-12 to manage extraterrestrial affairs.

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,220
This of course was all according to a leaked document that was sent on a 35 millimeter

18
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,260
film to Jamie Shandera, a TV producer in the 1980s.

19
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:41,980
When developed Shandera quickly realized that these were top secret magic eyes only documents

20
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:48,260
revealing the names and the intentions of a potential UFO crash retrieval cover-up made

21
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,260
by the government and the formation of this group called MJ-12.

22
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,140
The leak includes memos, letters, briefings.

23
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,120
Now if true, this changes history.

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:07,300
Getting into the MJ-12 stuff is a deep, deep, deep rabbit hole my friends and I am absolutely

25
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,240
willing to do so with your help.

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,080
Now let's fast forward to 1952.

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,300
Now there's a lot that happened between 1947 and 52 which we'll eventually get into but

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,260
today we're going to focus on a briefing made by President Truman at the time to President

29
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,700
elect Dwight D. Eisenhower informing him of the creation of MJ-12 and the activities

30
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,660
of the extraterrestrials.

31
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,260
This is a big deal if true and we'll get into a lot of corroborating facts that actually

32
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,420
support that this document or these documents in MJ-12 have some validity and are authentic.

33
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,980
But right before we do that I would just like to take a second to say thank you so much

34
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,780
for the response on the latest videos.

35
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,900
You guys have been such an amazing, supportive community and I'm really, really grateful

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,900
for that.

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,900
And if you do like what you see here I'd highly encourage you guys to leave a like, subscribe

38
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,080
and hit the notification bell so you don't miss a video and if you're listening to this

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,340
on iTunes or Spotify, you know, leaving us a favorable review definitely helps propel

40
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,100
us into the algorithm on those channels.

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,500
Much appreciated.

42
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,340
Also for those of you who are interested we just launched these hats.

43
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,260
These are some cool Area 52 branded trucker hats that we've got on sale as well as some

44
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,060
patches and some other stuff available at area52.shop.

45
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,500
Alright we paid the bills folks.

46
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,300
Boy is there a lot to get into.

47
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,060
I'll be referencing my phone because I've got notes up the wazoo.

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,820
But again we're going to be focused on this one thing.

49
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:37,180
Now before I start reading I do think it's very interesting that Jamie Shandera was the

50
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,540
one who received this anonymous package.

51
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,980
Can you imagine opening a package, getting a roll of 35 millimeter film and in it containing

52
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,700
the words Eisenhower, alien or extraterrestrial, crash retrieval, UFO, like all of this stuff.

53
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,780
It must have been so mind blowing especially because Jamie at the time was friends with

54
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,220
Bill Moore and Stanton Friedman, two heavy hitters in the UFO landscape in the mid 80s.

55
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,340
Now although it was discovered in 1984 it was not made publicly available until Timothy

56
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,940
Good put out a book entitled Above Top Secret.

57
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,980
In this book was the first time he'd revealed some of the documents including the document

58
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,420
that we're going to be reading today, the Eisenhower briefing.

59
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,860
He then enlisted the help of UFO researcher and nuclear physicist Stanton Friedman in

60
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,220
order to decipher some of these documents together along with Bill Moore.

61
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,980
Bill Moore who is a bit of a shady character actually came out in the late 80s admitting

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,260
that he was part of a Psyop as well.

63
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,460
So all of this gets really tricky.

64
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,540
But Stanton continued his research and eventually put out a book called Top Secret slash Magic

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,940
defending the authenticity of the MJ-12 documents in 1996 and I'll leave the link to those

66
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,260
books below.

67
00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,140
And in 1988 the FBI actually called all of these documents bogus by writing bogus and

68
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,580
big fat bold friendly letters on every single page of the MJ-12 documents.

69
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,380
Now just because the FBI says it's bogus that doesn't make it so.

70
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,420
In fact, the FBI took these documents and basically knocked on every single door of

71
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,180
the intelligence departments in the United States and said, did you lose this?

72
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,320
And obviously every intelligence agency said that isn't ours.

73
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,340
At the end of which the FBI said, well, I guess this must be bogus.

74
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,820
And that was pretty much the extent of the investigation.

75
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,500
So before you go writing in the comments, FBI said it was bogus.

76
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,660
Do some research, you'll see that they did about as much research as you did writing

77
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,660
that comment.

78
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,660
So as much as I appreciate you guys watching, I would also like to ask you for a favor and

79
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,220
that is a very simple favor.

80
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,340
I would ask you to, for the period of the next hour or so, suspend your disbelief.

81
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,900
Check it at the door.

82
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:57,780
I'm not asking you to believe that these documents are real or that the government is hiding

83
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,900
aliens that it retrieved from a crash in New Mexico in 1947, multiple crashes.

84
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,580
No, I'm not asking you to believe that we are currently in possession of this alien

85
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,260
technology from another planet.

86
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:18,580
All I'm asking you to do is to check the disbelief at the door periodically, temporarily as an

87
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:24,420
exercise, as a creative thinking experiment, and allow yourself to be transported back

88
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:32,180
to 1952 when Dwight D. Eisenhower allegedly received a memo detailing the creation of

89
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:38,020
this top secret group handling the extraterrestrial agenda.

90
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:45,580
And very quickly, here is a short memo made from President Truman to Secretary of Defense

91
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,900
James Forrestal, informing him to go ahead with the creation of MJ-12.

92
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,900
This was sent September 24th, 1947.

93
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,500
Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, dear Secretary Forrestal, as per our recent

94
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,020
conversation on this matter, you are hereby authorized to proceed with all due speed and

95
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,100
caution upon your undertaking.

96
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:15,100
Hereafter, this matter shall be referred to only as Operation Majestic 12.

97
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,860
It continues to be my feeling that any future considerations relative to the ultimate

98
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:26,220
disposition of this matter should rest solely with the office of the president following

99
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,980
appropriate discussions with yourself, Dr. Bush and the director of Central Intelligence.

100
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,060
There were so many memos and conversations and communications that happened between the

101
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:45,460
mid 40s and the mid 50s, especially September 47 was a very busy time for the secret

102
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,500
government. And it's really easy to get scatterbrained with all this information.

103
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,500
So we're really going to just focus on the briefing that was made after the inception

104
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:03,900
of MJ-12 to President-elect Eisenhower to inform him that, hey, we got aliens, we got

105
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,460
stuff going on, and we want you to know all about it.

106
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,620
Taking a second to take this whole page in is so cool.

107
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,300
So at the top, it's top secret slash magic.

108
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,300
Now, MAJIC, there's been some speculation on what it could mean.

109
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,220
Some think it might be military and joint intelligence command or committee or majestic

110
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,780
intelligence control.

111
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,940
For more information on MJ-12 and a comprehensive review of all the documents, I would highly

112
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,260
also suggest that you guys go check out my friend UAP Gerb.

113
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,100
If you're into the military's involvement with UAP, this guy is the source.

114
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,300
That being said, MAJIC, it says top secret national security information, and then it

115
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,460
says eyes only, eyes only, just eyes, maybe eyes for Eisenhower.

116
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,220
Copy one of one.

117
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:07,340
That is a wild thing to read on a cover page, a one of one briefing document, Operation

118
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,660
Majestic 12, prepared for President-elect Dwight D.

119
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,740
Eisenhower, eyes only, 18th of November, 1952.

120
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:22,180
Warning, this is a top secret, eyes only document containing compartmentalized information

121
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,180
essential to the national security of the United States.

122
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:32,060
Eyes only access to the material herein is strictly limited to those possessing Majestic

123
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:38,140
12 clearance level reproduction in any form or the taking of written or mechanically

124
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,140
transcribed notes is strictly forbidden.

125
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,180
Subject Operation Majestic 12 preliminary briefing for President-elect Eisenhower

126
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,100
prepared 18th of November, 1952.

127
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,860
Briefing officer was Admiral Roscoe H.

128
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,100
Hillencoder, and Hillencoder actually made public statements about UFOs after retiring.

129
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,700
In 1960, he went on the record for the New York Times and said, quote, behind the scenes,

130
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:08,100
high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs, but through official

131
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,940
secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are

132
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,740
nonsense.

133
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,500
Official ridicule, by the way, official ridicule.

134
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,700
He then later also served for the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon,

135
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,940
which was a civilian UFO research organization.

136
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,660
And this apparently was the person who briefed Eisenhower or who delivered these documents

137
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,540
to him. The plot thickens.

138
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,340
This document has been prepared as a preliminary briefing, only it should be regarded as

139
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,020
introductory to a full operations briefing intended to follow.

140
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,740
That, my friends, would be a document I would love to read one day.

141
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,140
If you've got a 35 millimeter film out there and you're looking to send it somewhere, send

142
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,580
it my way.

143
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,860
Operation Majestic 12 is a top secret research and development intelligence operation

144
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,420
responsible directly and only to the president of the United States.

145
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,900
Operations of the project are carried out under control of the Majestic 12 or Magic

146
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,940
12 group, which was established by Special Classified Executive Order of President

147
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,740
Truman on 24th of September 1947, upon recommendation by Dr.

148
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,460
Vannevar Bush and Secretary James Forrestal.

149
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,100
See Attachment A.

150
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,460
Now, Attachment A would be the Special Classified Executive Order, which we do not have

151
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,580
access to. And here, folks, is a list of the Majestic 12 group that was designated.

152
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,180
Admiral Roscoe H.

153
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,100
Hillencoter, U.S.

154
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,500
Naval officer and intelligence official.

155
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,700
He was the first director of the CIA.

156
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,300
He served in both World Wars and attained the rank of vice admiral.

157
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,860
Hillencoder became a vocal advocate for UFO transparency and a member of the National

158
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,940
Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, NICAP.

159
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,060
Vannevar Bush, no relation to George Bush.

160
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,540
He was an engineer, inventor and science administrator, director of the Office of

161
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,140
Scientific Research and Development during World War II, key figure in the development

162
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,060
of the Manhattan Project and founder of the U.S.

163
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,620
Military Industrial Research Complex.

164
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,180
He's known for his work in analog computing, developing the differential analyzer and

165
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,460
pioneering ideas that led to the development of the Internet.

166
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,340
As a top advisor to Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, Bush had unparalleled access to

167
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,340
classified projects and was instrumental in organizing American scientific efforts

168
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,380
during World War II.

169
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,660
His involvement in MJ-12 was reverse engineering potential alien technology.

170
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,060
General Nathan F.

171
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,380
Twining, U.S.

172
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,420
Air Force General.

173
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,860
He was chief of staff of the United States Air Force from 53 to 57 and chairman of the

174
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,300
Joint Chiefs of Staff from 57 to 60.

175
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,820
He served in both World Wars and rose through the ranks to become one of the most

176
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,620
influential military leaders of the mid 20th century.

177
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,660
As head of the Air Material Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Twining had

178
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,900
oversight of military research and development, including projects rumored to involve

179
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,460
recovered UFO materials.

180
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,820
General Hoyt S.

181
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,100
Vandenberg, U.S.

182
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,060
Air Force General.

183
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,620
He was chief of staff of the United States Air Force from 48 to 53 and the second director

184
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,700
of Central Intelligence, or DCI.

185
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,540
He had a distinguished career in the U.S.

186
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,140
Army Air Corps, later transitioning to the U.S.

187
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,620
Air Force, rising to one of its highest positions.

188
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,300
He was allegedly involved in overseeing military responses to UFO sightings and ensuring

189
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,500
information security about extraterrestrial encounters.

190
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,220
If the name sounds familiar, it's because yes, the Vandenberg Space Launch Center is

191
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,780
named after this gentleman, Dr.

192
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,020
Detlef W.

193
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,780
Bronk, physiologist and biophysicist.

194
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,180
He was the president of National Academy of Sciences, president of John Hopkins

195
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,100
University and president of Rockefeller University.

196
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,060
Bronk was at the forefront of U.S.

197
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,140
scientific leadership, making him an ideal candidate for handling sensitive and

198
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,420
groundbreaking research.

199
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,340
His responsibilities, analysis of potential ET biological specimens for national

200
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,460
security purposes.

201
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,340
Dr.

202
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,300
Jerome Hunsaker, chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, NACA,

203
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,700
the precursor to NASA, and pioneer in modern aerodynamics and aircraft design.

204
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,700
He specialized in aerodynamics, naval aviation, and aircraft engineering.

205
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,500
Known for designing the first naval aircraft and was instrumental in developing the

206
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,780
airship Shenandoah.

207
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,660
He allegedly contributed to studying and understanding the flight characteristics of

208
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,980
UFOs, using his expertise to evaluate potential extraterrestrial technology.

209
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,500
Sidney W.

210
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,140
Sowers, businessman, intelligence officer and government official.

211
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,420
He was the first director of Central Intelligence, DCI, in 1946 and a special

212
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,260
consultant to President Harry S.

213
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,020
Truman on intelligence matters.

214
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,980
He served as a rear admiral in the U.S.

215
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,860
Navy Reserve.

216
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,180
Sowers was positioned to coordinate high level operations requiring executive

217
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,740
authorization, including those allegedly tied to UFO phenomena.

218
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,140
Gordon Gray, lawyer, politician and national security advisor.

219
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,220
He was a secretary of the army, special assistant to the president for national

220
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,860
security affairs and director of the psychological strategy board.

221
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,380
Gray had experience in managing information and propaganda during the Cold War,

222
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,020
aligning with MJ-12's need for controlling UFO related narratives.

223
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,140
He was allegedly involved in developing policies to manage public perception of

224
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,620
UFO phenomena and ensure the secrecy of extraterrestrial research.

225
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,180
Dr.

226
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,140
Donald H.

227
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,020
Menzel, astronomer and astrophysicist.

228
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,820
He was the director of Harvard College Observatory and renowned expert in solar

229
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,340
physics and author of numerous works on astronomy.

230
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,060
His field of expertise was solar research, radio wave propagation and astrophysics.

231
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,820
Menzel is the only member who seems out of place on this list.

232
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,540
He had written three anti-UFO books and many papers debunking flying saucers.

233
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,940
They're happy believing, let them go on believing, trying to prove whether or not

234
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,700
these things come from outer space or not.

235
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,860
It's clear that they don't.

236
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,780
And I'm quite sure that that will be the result of any investigation.

237
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,260
All but Menzel were known to have high level security clearance.

238
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,500
And because of this, many researchers inclined to think that the MJ-12 documents

239
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,780
were bogus. However, in April 1986, Stanton Friedman was allowed access to

240
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,340
Menzel's papers at the Harvard University Archives.

241
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,620
He learned that Menzel had a 30 year association with the NSA, the National

242
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,740
Security Agency, and that he also had top secret ultra clearance with the CIA.

243
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,980
It has also been proved that Menzel made numerous visits to New

244
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,940
Mexico in 1947 and 48 paid for by government expenses.

245
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,420
His alleged role in MJ-12 was public disinformation campaigns to maintain

246
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,100
secrecy surrounding UFO phenomena.

247
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,900
Lieutenant General Robert M.

248
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,380
Montague, U.S.

249
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,940
Army officer, commander of the Sandia base and top secret military installation

250
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,460
involved in nuclear weapons development and testing.

251
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,380
And he was also deputy commanding general of the fourth army.

252
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,940
He had a distinguished career in the U.S.

253
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,860
Army with key roles in overseeing nuclear weapons programs during the early cold

254
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,900
war as commander.

255
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,780
He had access to classified projects and advanced technology, making him a

256
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,740
plausible choice for MJ-12.

257
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,220
Dr.

258
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,820
Lloyd V.

259
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,860
Berkner, physicist and engineer.

260
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,060
He was a pioneer in geophysics and ionospheric research.

261
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,900
He served on numerous high level scientific advisory boards, including the

262
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,260
National Science Foundation.

263
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,260
He was allegedly brought into MJ-12 to investigate and analyze atmospheric

264
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,140
anomalies linked to UFO propulsion and sightings.

265
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,540
Dr.

266
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,380
Walter Bedell Smith, U.S.

267
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,820
Army general and diplomat.

268
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,300
He was director of central intelligence, U.S.

269
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,140
ambassador to the Soviet Union and chief of staff to general Dwight D.

270
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,820
Eisenhower during World War II.

271
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,340
He was allegedly responsible for ensuring international cooperation and

272
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,820
managing secrecy protocols related to extraterrestrial matters.

273
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,780
And those are the MJ-12.

274
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,220
And obviously also President Truman and now president-elect Eisenhower.

275
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,180
Now the death of Secretary Forrestal on May 22nd, 1949, created a vacancy, which

276
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:02,860
remained unfilled until the 1st of August, 1950, upon which general Walter B.

277
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,340
Smith was designated as a permanent replacement.

278
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,340
What's also really interesting here is that this particular briefing was made in

279
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:16,780
November of 1952 and in July of 1952 was the famous mass sighting over the

280
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,740
Capitol and the White House, where air traffic controllers at Washington

281
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:28,140
Airport detected multiple unidentified flying objects on radar and visual

282
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,700
confirmations were both reported on the ground and in the sky by commercial pilots.

283
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,140
Fighter jets were scrambled to intercept these objects and a week later, it

284
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,660
happened again, much like the drone incursions we're kind of seeing now.

285
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,340
It was like mass panic, but imagine back then when there were no drones, the

286
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,700
government then made public statements and already had project blue book on the

287
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,340
case, which obviously wasn't a thing back then and did not exist until much later

288
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,260
we found out it did.

289
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,420
I'm here to discuss the so-called flying saucers.

290
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,820
Obviously before president-elect Eisenhower would come into office, July

291
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,100
prior, they had this like incredible, you know, mass sighting happened over the

292
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,940
most sensitive area in the United States where the president lives.

293
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,460
So that might've led to this briefing being expedited and ultimately reaching

294
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,540
the eyes of Eisenhower.

295
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,540
I'd give anything to be in 1947 to 1955.

296
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,420
Like those, that pocket of like 10 years around there might, I mean, that must

297
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,700
have just been the wild west of UFOs.

298
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,140
We continue page three.

299
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,220
On 24th of June, 1947, a civilian pilot flying over the Cascade Mountains in the

300
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,700
state of Washington observed nine flying disc-shaped aircrafts, traveling

301
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,260
in formation at a high rate of speed.

302
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,820
Side note, this is now known as the Kenneth Arnold sighting.

303
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,020
Here we've seen something.

304
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,940
I've seen something.

305
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,620
Hundreds of pilots have seen something.

306
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,100
We have to have 15 million witnesses before anybody's going to look into the

307
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,380
problem seriously, but this is utterly fantastic.

308
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,540
This is more fantastic than, than flying saucers or people from Venus or anything,

309
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,660
as far as I'm concerned.

310
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,580
This made national headlines.

311
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,980
This guy was basically a local celebrity back then, and this is before the

312
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:23,340
Roswell crash, so this UFO zeitgeist is already starting to take place in America.

313
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,340
Although this was not the first known sighting of such objects, it was the first

314
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,820
to gain widespread attention in the public media.

315
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,300
Hundreds of reports of sightings of similar objects followed.

316
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,980
Many of these came from highly credible military and civilian sources.

317
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,220
These reports resulted in independent efforts by several different elements of

318
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,940
the military to ascertain the nature and purpose of the objects in the

319
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,660
interests of national defense.

320
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,580
A number of witnesses were interviewed and there were several unsuccessful attempts

321
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,860
to utilize aircraft and efforts to pursue reported discs in flight.

322
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,220
Public reaction bordered on near hysteria at times.

323
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,300
It's interesting because these people have no idea what they're about to read on

324
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,580
the front page of their newspaper in a little over one year.

325
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,300
In spite of these efforts, little of substance was learned about the objects

326
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,500
until a local rancher reported that one had crashed in a remote region of New

327
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,180
Mexico, located approximately 75 miles northwest of Roswell Army Air Base, now

328
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,140
Walker Airfield.

329
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,700
On the 7th of July, 1947, a secret operation was begun to ensure recovery of

330
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,180
the wreckage of this object for scientific study.

331
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,700
During the course of this operation, aerial reconnaissance discovered that four

332
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,020
small human-like beings had apparently ejected from the craft at some point

333
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,300
before it exploded.

334
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,940
These had fallen to earth about two miles east of the wreckage site.

335
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,980
All four were dead and badly decomposed due to action by predators and exposure to

336
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,020
the elements during approximately one week time period, which had elapsed before

337
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,820
their discovery.

338
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:05,860
So these things were lying in the desert and there were animals feeding off of

339
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,900
alien bodies.

340
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,260
I suppose to an animal, hey, meat is meat.

341
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,700
But man, that is a dark thought right there.

342
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:20,060
I received a telephone call from the mortuary officer out at the Walker Air

343
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,820
Force Base.

344
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,820
What would be the smallest possible casket that we could get that would be

345
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,460
dramatically sealed?

346
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:34,580
We need to know what the preparation, what your preparations are for the bodies

347
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,580
that had been laying out in the elements, you know, maybe that they might have been

348
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:48,740
a predatory animal or something might have been doing some damage on the bodies, too.

349
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,420
A special scientific team took charge of removing these bodies for study.

350
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,020
See attachment C.

351
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,460
I would love to, but attachment C is not here.

352
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,220
But Operation Majestic 12 status report number one, part B, is attachment C.

353
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,940
The wreckage of the craft was also removed to several different locations.

354
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,100
C attachment B, which is part A of the same status report.

355
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,540
And allegedly we've come to find out through Philip Corso, who put out the book

356
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,380
The Day After Roswell and many other people who were involved, including Jesse

357
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,980
Marcel, who is the gentleman pictured with the air balloon that they found, this

358
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:33,300
fabric that they concocted after they already released to the press that flying

359
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,660
saucers were recovered.

360
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,980
Whole flock of microphones there.

361
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,220
They wanted me to, they wanted to stop comments from me, but I was not

362
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,140
driven to do that.

363
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:48,580
Marcel was instead ordered to pose with wood, foil and rubber debris from a

364
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,140
conventional weather balloon.

365
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,340
All I could do is keep a mouth shut.

366
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,580
And General Ramey is the one who told the newspapers what it was and forget about

367
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,180
it. It was nothing more than a weather observation balloon.

368
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,140
Of course, which we both knew differently.

369
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,460
Yeah, they came out and saying that these were transported to Wright-Patterson

370
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,060
Air Force Base in Ohio.

371
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,100
Civilian and military witnesses in the area were debriefed and news reporters

372
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,900
were given the effective cover story that the object had been a misguided

373
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,620
weather research balloon.

374
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,580
Now they were debriefed, folks.

375
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,540
You know what that means?

376
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,300
If you haven't checked out the podcast with James Fox, we talk a lot about the

377
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,180
men in black or the men in dark suits, as he likes to call them, but they have a

378
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,620
really good knack for debriefing folks around the country and around the world.

379
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,300
Page four, a covert analytical effort organized by General Twining and Dr.

380
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,460
Bush acting on the direct orders of the president resulted in a preliminary

381
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,540
consensus on the 19th of September 47 that the disk was most likely a short

382
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,260
range reconnaissance craft.

383
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,020
This conclusion was based for the most part on the craft's size and apparent lack

384
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,300
of any identifiable provisioning.

385
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,860
See attachment D.

386
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,780
A similar analysis of the four dead occupants was arranged by Dr.

387
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,660
Bronk. It was the tentative conclusion of this group 30th of November 1947 that

388
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,020
although these creatures are human like in appearance, the biological and

389
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,620
evolutionary processes responsible for their development has apparently been

390
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,460
quite different from those observed or postulated in Homo sapiens.

391
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,340
Dr.

392
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:34,180
Bronk's team has suggested that the term extra terrestrial biological entities or

393
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,380
EBEs be adopted as the standard term for reference for these creatures until such

394
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,620
time as a more definitive designation can be agreed upon.

395
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,180
What an important job that Dr.

396
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,780
Bronk had during those times.

397
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:53,300
I mean, that must have been just absolutely just dreadful, so filled with dread.

398
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,380
Since it is virtually certain that these crafts do not originate in any country on

399
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,260
Earth, considerable speculation has centered around what their point of origin

400
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,300
might be and how they got here.

401
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,300
Mars was and remains a possibility, although some scientists, most notably Dr.

402
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,700
Menzel, consider it more likely that we are dealing with beings from another solar

403
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,140
system entirely.

404
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,740
Numerous examples of what appeared to be a form of writing were found in the

405
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,300
wreckage.

406
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,420
Efforts to decipher these have remained largely unsuccessful.

407
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,380
See attachment E, come on, stop teasing me.

408
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,540
That's the blue team report.

409
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,580
Blue team report.

410
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,820
Interesting is the blue team.

411
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,660
Who's the blue team?

412
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,260
Are they referring to blue book?

413
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:32,940
Interesting.

414
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,220
Equally unsuccessful have been the efforts to determine the method of propulsion or

415
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,620
the nature or method of transmission of the power source involved.

416
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,780
Research along these lines has been complicated by the complete absence of

417
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,780
identifiable wings, propellers, jets, or other conventional methods of propulsion

418
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:57,300
and guidance, as well as a total lack of metallic wiring, vacuum tubes, or similar

419
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,260
recognizable electronic components.

420
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:04,500
See attachment F, it is assumed that the propulsion unit was completely destroyed

421
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,020
by the explosion which caused the crash.

422
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,220
Okay, so they assume that the propulsion unit was destroyed.

423
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,540
This is also preliminary.

424
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,500
This is them before they even understand what this propulsion is.

425
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,060
Not saying that we understand what it is now, but I do feel like we probably have

426
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:26,860
a better grasp of this alleged gravitational propulsion that is proposed

427
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,580
by Bob Lazar and so many more.

428
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,580
But it must have been wild to open it up and not see any wiring or anything at all.

429
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,740
You're just like, how did this, was this a glider?

430
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,860
How did this get here?

431
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:44,140
And the fact that the bodies were ejected like miles away is so weird.

432
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,980
But there might be a possibility that there's still like remains out there

433
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,740
from a fifth body or something.

434
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,780
What's also really interesting to me, if we take a look at the, go back and have a

435
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:00,300
look, we did a three-part series on the alleged 4chan whistleblower, someone who

436
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,500
said that they worked on these crash retrieval programs for the government.

437
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,540
Well, they said that they were observing some type of mobile construction unit in

438
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:13,860
the Atlantic ocean that would create these UFOs to spec, populate them with

439
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:21,660
these EBEs, which seemed to be according to the EBO scientists, ephemeral or

440
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:27,460
disposable, all of which really coalesces with the theories that are proposed here

441
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,700
in that they think it was some short-term reconnaissance because there was no

442
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,860
provisions, there was no bed, there was no kitchen.

443
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,220
It was probably just seats, much like Bobobla's are described, just an empty

444
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,580
room with only the things you need built to spec.

445
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,900
I mean, everything so far is kind of aligning.

446
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,540
Now, are these later things that we looked at LARPs based on these documents?

447
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,300
That is very well possible as well.

448
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,540
But keeping an open mind here, I'm taking my sweet time with this cause

449
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,860
this is a lot of fun to me.

450
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,460
I love reading through this stuff.

451
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,060
And if you do enjoy this type of content, folks, I'm happy to report that

452
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,940
we also got a Patreon going on.

453
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,300
So you want to become an intern at Area 52.

454
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,020
I get it.

455
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,540
Access to future investigations.

456
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,060
All right.

457
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,980
So this is my last day in search of the Yeti.

458
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,660
Uncut interviews.

459
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,780
What about the Vatican?

460
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,460
Yeah, they've investigated.

461
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,860
They've investigated you?

462
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,460
Weekly video updates.

463
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,980
So I appreciate you guys getting in on the ground floor with me here.

464
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,940
Sounds pretty good.

465
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,140
But that's not why you're here, is it?

466
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:42,180
You're not here for top secret access to the Discord or the book clubs or movie

467
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,620
nights or Q and A's.

468
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,700
No, I didn't think so.

469
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:58,060
I don't even think you're here for the skiff or for the early access or the extra

470
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:03,060
episodes or even have your questions answered directly on the podcast.

471
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,620
I think you're here because you know there's more.

472
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,900
More than they've told us.

473
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,900
I need you to listen to my instructions and more than we're allowed to see.

474
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,180
And I think you want to be a part of it.

475
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,700
So what happens to your five dollars?

476
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,940
Only one way to find out.

477
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,900
Let's get on with it.

478
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,580
Page number five here, a need for as much additional information as possible about

479
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,020
these craft, their performance characteristics and their purpose led to the undertaking

480
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,220
known as U.S.

481
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,980
Air Force Project Sine in December 1947.

482
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:58,700
In order to preserve security liaison between Sine and Majestic 12 was limited to two

483
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,780
individuals within the intelligence division of Air Material Command, whose role was to

484
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,900
pass along certain types of information through channels.

485
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:12,540
Sine evolved into Project Grudge in December 1948.

486
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:19,580
The operation is currently being conducted under the code name Blue Book with liaison

487
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,460
maintained through the Air Force officer who is head of the project.

488
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,820
So Sine was created in 47 immediately.

489
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,820
Grudge took over in 48 probably because maybe some potential leak.

490
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,300
That's usually what happens with a lot of these projects.

491
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:42,140
You look at Stargate prior to that was like, what was it, Grill Flame and Center Lane had

492
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:47,500
all these different names. But every time somebody catches wind or they fear some type

493
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:54,020
of de facto or leak might happen, they completely shred all the documents, fire everybody

494
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,260
and open up a new program.

495
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,900
And that's how these secret agencies work, or these programs rather.

496
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,780
So even in 96 with Stargate when they're like, oh, no, we don't do that anymore.

497
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,940
We canceled it all.

498
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,220
Rest assured that they do.

499
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,300
And it has a different name.

500
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,700
And we'll probably find that out in the next decade.

501
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:15,260
Mark my words, bookmark this video on the 6th of December 1950, a second object,

502
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:21,020
probably of similar origin, impacted the earth at high speed in the El Indio-Guerrero area

503
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,460
of Texas Mexican border after following a long trajectory through the atmosphere.

504
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,740
By the time a search team arrived, what remained of the object had been almost totally

505
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:37,860
incinerated. Such material as could be recovered was transported to the AEC facility in

506
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,260
Sandia, New Mexico for study.

507
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,180
AEC, if that rings a bell, is the Atomic Energy Commission.

508
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:52,140
This was established in 1946, and the purpose was to manage the development and regulation

509
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,060
of nuclear energy and materials.

510
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,580
And they would also supervise nuclear weapons research and production.

511
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:04,900
And obviously, we all know the connection that these UFOs have to nuclear energy or

512
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,140
nuclear bombs going off.

513
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,980
So it is I don't think I don't think the Atomic Energy Commission is any stranger to

514
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,540
what is alleged by the MJ-12 documents.

515
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:20,700
Implications for the national security are of continuing importance in that the motives

516
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,340
and ultimate intentions of these visitors remained completely unknown.

517
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,220
In addition, a significant upsurge in the surveillance activity of these craft beginning

518
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,940
in May and continuing through the autumn of this year has caused considerable concern

519
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,140
that new developments may be imminent.

520
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:42,300
It is for these reasons, as well as the obvious international and technological considerations

521
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:47,780
and the ultimate need to avoid a public panic at all costs that the Majestic 12 Group

522
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:54,140
remains of the unanimous opinion that imposition of the strictest security precautions

523
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,940
should continue without interruption into the new administration.

524
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:09,580
At the time, Contingency Plan MJ-1949-04P-78, top secret, eyes only, should be held in

525
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:14,820
continued readiness should the need to make a public announcement present itself.

526
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
See Attachment G.

527
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,620
Now, Attachment G is really, really interesting.

528
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,420
It's the contingency plan.

529
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,420
We can only speculate what that contingency plan might be.

530
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:29,300
But something I came across recently, which was on the Night Shift podcast, which I'll

531
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,780
leave the link to below, Danny Sheehan, who's famously been a lawyer and, you know, for

532
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,060
a lot of these UAP whistleblowers, and he's been involved in the UAP subject for quite

533
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:46,940
some time. He said that the government had possession of an EBE on film.

534
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:53,260
There's going to be a video of an actual interview of an actual extraterrestrial being.

535
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,140
You know this?

536
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:02,460
Yes. You know, so, I mean, I know that that exists and that's part of the crown jewels

537
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,900
that they're not going to want to reveal.

538
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,780
What is that? That's on the table to come out.

539
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:14,260
Well, what I'm saying is that I talked to the person who was there and that they've

540
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:19,380
got this on film and so that if you're really going to get down, when you say we get to

541
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,860
the nut of the whole thing, that's the kind of thing that once it's shown to the American

542
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,140
public, there's, you know, Katie bar the door.

543
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,500
You know, there's nothing that can be denied anymore.

544
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,260
Maybe that's what they're referring to.

545
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,380
I would give my right leg to watch that video.

546
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,540
And folks, that is it.

547
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:46,900
Then we have just the enumeration of attachments on the final page, which, by the way,

548
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,700
these attachments never saw the light of day.

549
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:56,380
However, there are plenty more MJ-12 documents and memos.

550
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,420
There is one document that I would love to include in a future investigation.

551
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,420
You guys can let me know if you want to read through.

552
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,820
But apparently Oppenheimer knew about this stuff prior to the Roswell crash.

553
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:13,460
It was an Oppenheimer-Einstein conversation, I believe, and it was speculation about where

554
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,580
they're from, what their goal is at something I would love to get through.

555
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,700
So if you guys want to, you know, have a listen at that and maybe deep dive, we can do that

556
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,580
in one of the upcoming videos.

557
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,060
Let me know.

558
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:25,900
Shoo.

559
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,540
Okay.

560
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,140
So, I mean, that's a lot to digest.

561
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,500
So now the question is either, is this a hoax?

562
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,860
Is this the real deal?

563
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,220
Or is this some type of government Psyop?

564
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:46,780
You know, a lot of ufologists have done plenty of research on this matter.

565
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,460
So I left the links to those books below, but Stanton Friedman extensively looked at

566
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,580
the, not only the typewriter font, but the make and model of the typewriters that were

567
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:03,260
used to make this and everything aligns with what they were using in the government at

568
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:03,940
that time.

569
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:10,020
Not only that, but the verbiage and the structure of language, it all aligns with government

570
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,740
briefings.

571
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,140
And this is obviously prior to AI.

572
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:22,260
So whoever did make this, if it was hoaxed, certainly was privy to a lot of this governmental

573
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,380
jargon that we read through.

574
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,980
And you can analyze this along the Forrestal Truman memo.

575
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:34,460
There's also the Cutler Twining memo that we didn't get through, but it's clear that

576
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,340
this matches up with everything else.

577
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:43,620
And aside from all the documentation of which there is plenty, there are eyewitness

578
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:48,860
accounts to the crash at Roswell and many other crashes that have come forward over

579
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,300
the years.

580
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,220
There are many documentaries about this stuff.

581
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,580
You can check them all out.

582
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,500
The Day After Roswell by Philip Corso is great, but also, again, I would highly encourage

583
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,580
you to check out the deep dive UAP Gerb does.

584
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,100
He goes into Corso, his background, his history.

585
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,020
And, you know, this guy was directly involved with the program back then.

586
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,700
But this is all where it stemmed from.

587
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,780
This MJ-12 was where it all started.

588
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:23,820
And after having that amazing interview with James Fox on the last podcast, you know, I

589
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:29,220
can't help but think when he said there's only 20 people worldwide that know about this,

590
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,380
that that really know what's going on.

591
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,820
It just makes me think that that group of MJ-12 really didn't expand that much and they

592
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,020
kept it pretty tight.

593
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,540
Final thoughts on this particular document.

594
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,620
I know it's a lot to unpack.

595
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:49,180
I know it's a lot to assume that any of this is true, but you'll find with time as we

596
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:56,900
continue reading through a lot of these files that the provenance of a lot of these

597
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:03,620
papers do not stem from the same source, that multiple sources over the years revealed

598
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:10,220
the existence of this secret, top secret, MJ-12 group.

599
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,220
You'll also find that meetings were held officially on the record, meetings were held

600
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,100
at the same times that they were alluded to in a lot of these documents.

601
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,180
So there's a lot of corroborating evidence.

602
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,780
You know, is the Griotta Treaty real?

603
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,500
I don't know. That's really hard for me to confirm or deny.

604
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,740
But this seems legit.

605
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,100
You know, and I'm going to go out on a limb and say I do believe that Roswell crash

606
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:44,580
happened. There are way too many eyewitnesses or government officials who came forward

607
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:49,260
years later and everybody said that this happened and that there were bodies.

608
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,700
You know, there's so many stories.

609
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:59,780
Now, obviously, this probably sprung a slew of hoaxes and trickery and just an absolute

610
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:07,260
sheer wave of misinformation that came to life after this alleged crash.

611
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,220
You know, people looking for fame, people looking for money, but also people looking to

612
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,100
disinform your misinformation.

613
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:23,260
A lot of that happened as a result of Roswell and not to mention science fiction really

614
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,780
ramped up and the CIA was involved in that too.

615
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:34,020
So it does become very murky territory after 1947, which is why we have to proceed with

616
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,900
extreme caution when reading through these documents.

617
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,100
We have to be on guard.

618
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:46,060
We have to look at it in a manner that is removed from the content, suspending our disbelief,

619
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:51,540
but not entirely, you know, opening our minds so much that our brain falls out.

620
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:57,460
Or as the brilliant Art Bell put it, it should not be so closed that whatever gray matter

621
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,420
does reside may not be reached.

622
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,820
There is just so much to cover in this space.

623
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,980
It is almost impossible to get it all right.

624
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:13,900
And as someone who is learning, as someone who is open minded and willing to fail, I

625
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,060
take that challenge head on.

626
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,380
I'm here to learn and a lot of my failures will be caught on camera.

627
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,740
I am a one man team.

628
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,340
I'm the one filming, lighting, researching, editing everything.

629
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:34,140
So please forgive me if there's anything that I've missed or overlooked or took out of

630
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:41,220
context. I am human, but I am here to learn and I'm eager to learn with your help.

631
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:47,260
There are essentially three types of content that we'll be making here for the most part.

632
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:54,820
These read throughs are number one, having guests in the skiff is number two, which is

633
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,660
also a part of the debrief podcast.

634
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,540
And number three are the investigations.

635
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,260
The investigations take me the most amount of time.

636
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,940
These will be scarce and they'll be, you know, once every few months, but they will

637
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,380
legitimately be documentaries that I'm working on.

638
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,020
So that's what to be expected here in the next couple of months.

639
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:18,500
Thank you again for your support and head over to the memberships if you guys want more

640
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,540
content and we'll see you guys on the next video.

641
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,180
Peace and love.
