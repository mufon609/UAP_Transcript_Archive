1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
I heard about a real serious visitation of these so-called, you know, men in dark suits.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,080
And then I heard about it like a number of other times.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,200
I heard about it with the McMinnville, Oregon case.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,080
She got a visit.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,640
Then I heard about it with Rex Heflin.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,040
He had a visit with these guys in suits.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,520
With the 1966 UFO landing at Westall Primary School.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,080
Science teacher named Mr. Greenwood.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,320
And then we found out he had a visit from men in suits.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,760
A general, Parviz Jafari.

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,520
And he told me, he was like, yeah, the next morning,

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,600
like the encounter happened in the middle of the night.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,880
The next morning, a couple of men from the United States government.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,080
I don't know what agency they're from.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,880
They were there.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,400
Oh my God, here they are again.

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,480
Let's see.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,280
I cover a case in Australia, Africa, South America, Chile, England, Russia,

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,640
China, Canada, Alaska, across the United States.

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,240
This is a global phenomenon.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,280
Has there ever been a moment where it's just like slipped out of your hands?

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,560
The alien footage.

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,280
Of Virginia?

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,680
Yes.

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,400
You were that close?

26
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,240
We had a hard drive in our hands.

27
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,160
You had a hard drive in your hands.

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,360
Let's see how I can talk about this.

29
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,200
I want to talk about this without revealing the detail because we're going back.

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
When I walked up to him, I looked him in the eyes.

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,800
I looked into his soul.

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,880
I said, I promise you on my life, there's no camera, audio, nothing rolling.

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,520
This is between you and me right here, right now.

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,400
And he looks up at Marco and I and he goes, it happened.

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Closed the door and off he went.

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm 99.9% sure that I looked directly into the eyes

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
of a gentleman who drove an alien around.

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,080
I actually have a letter from Spielberg that was written to Larry King about me and my movie.

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,640
Whoa.

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,120
Yeah.

41
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,040
I don't talk about this that often.

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,080
You recently got invited into a skiff.

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
And I can say, is that the Pentagon?

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,280
This is as much as, because I've been asked not to reveal exactly why I went there

45
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,240
because it could interfere with the current investigations that are happening.

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,560
But we're both going after the same footage.

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,080
Oh, we got one more thing that's really cool.

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,720
Okay.

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,880
He said, you know, a little factoid, something you might want to, you know, know.

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,520
I was like, what's that?

51
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
He goes, get out of town.

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,360
Swear on my life is what he said.

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
And there's probably, I mean, some framework outside of the government

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
that really knows what's going on.

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,480
Like it's-

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm told 20 people.

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,160
20?

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,720
20.

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:20,960
Wow.

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,920
Globally.

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,440
Globally, 20 people.

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,160
20.

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,480
Wow.

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,880
And that came from someone I really trust.

65
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,080
Who's the first guest or witness you would get in front of the camera

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,760
if they were allowed to break their NDA?

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,400
Yeah, I would agree with that too.

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
I'd love to get him in the skiff.

69
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,760
I have to be careful what I say here, but for reasons that I won't discuss,

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,120
I believe he's a firsthand witness.

71
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,820
Wow.

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,700
Wow.

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Have you seen things that if you talk about you go to jail?

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,520
No, but I could talk about things other people might go to jail.

75
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,080
My name's James with my girlfriend.

76
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:17,440
I look up and there's a like a silver TikTok type shape.

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,920
Yeah, it's like there's no markings or windows on it.

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,520
I thought about pulling out my phone to take a picture or record

79
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,400
and I went to see where it went and it was gone.

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,440
Skiff a few weeks ago.

81
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,160
I know.

82
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,680
The day after we met.

83
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,080
I know.

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,440
We'll get into that.

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,940
Yeah.

86
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,360
It's pretty cool.

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,560
This is your second time in a skiff.

88
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
My second time in a skiff, yeah.

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
Which one was more stressful?

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,600
This one's more welcoming because it's got my name.

91
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,240
That's right.

92
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,800
Like that.

93
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,300
Yeah.

94
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,640
We like to take care of the guests that come in the skiff here,

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,160
not to scare them to death.

96
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
Caffefe, nice hats.

97
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,160
Nice merch.

98
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,000
Appreciate the shout out.

99
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,240
So there's two reasons why I'm wearing this hat.

100
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
One is I love it.

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Two is my hair is in second place today.

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,640
Yeah, same.

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,840
This hat's in first place.

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,680
So I figured, you know what?

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,640
Love the hat.

106
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,000
Nobody's paying me to wear this hat.

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,960
I actually really liked this hat and I'll be wearing it a lot more.

108
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,520
Great.

109
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,400
I appreciate that.

110
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,320
Welcome James Fox to the skiff.

111
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,840
Thanks for having me.

112
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,120
It's a great pleasure of mine to have you here and you're one of the first people

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,240
to grace this studio among only a few people that have ever been here.

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,360
So I'm really happy that we're actually kind of ringing in the new year now.

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,200
This is December 31st.

116
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,640
Last day of 2024.

117
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,160
What a way to kick off.

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,440
It's a few hours to go.

119
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,940
Yeah.

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,200
I'm extremely, extremely happy to have you here.

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,600
Um, you know, obviously you're coming off the amazing launch of the program

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,920
and you've been doing the rounds.

123
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,400
Yes.

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,000
You know, uh, you got, you got Rogan, you did Rogan, you know, and then did the skiff,

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
which the correct order.

126
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,200
I think Rogan was my last.

127
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,520
Was Rogan my last interview?

128
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,800
I think he did Duncan.

129
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,520
Oh, well, I did Duncan before you done before Rogan.

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,800
Yeah, I did Shane and then I did Duncan and then I did Rogan.

131
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,040
I was like, I really, I might've had a couple of things that maybe not actually,

132
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,200
maybe, maybe one or two things.

133
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,840
I can't remember.

134
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,520
But basically this is my first real sit down since Rogan.

135
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,080
Yeah.

136
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,840
And your first, um, like technical, we might get, we might get a little technical here

137
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,120
because, you know, the, the ears and eyes that are watching this podcast aren't

138
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
necessarily just newcomers.

139
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,360
These are a lot of people that are in the community that have been following

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,640
your work for a long time.

141
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,000
So you're a familiar face to them.

142
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,480
The program was incredible.

143
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,960
It was such a much needed.

144
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,480
How do you say?

145
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Like a, it was a culmination of so many different things.

146
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,480
I mean, coming off the phenomenon as well, and then moment of contact

147
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,040
and the program I felt like was we needed something to really encompass

148
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,240
the entirety of what's going on currently.

149
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,600
Like it is a time piece.

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,320
It is something that will be forever cemented in time as,

151
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,640
Hey, this is what's happening now.

152
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,840
This will be remembered.

153
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,400
And I thought that was such an important message that you conveyed through that

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,520
through the, through the editing, which we talked about yesterday.

155
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,960
I mean, you do that to yourself, which still blows my mind

156
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,160
that you even have time for that.

157
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,880
Oh my gosh.

158
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,720
But hats off to you as a creator.

159
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,120
Thank you.

160
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,160
Yeah.

161
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,120
Phenomenal job.

162
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,520
What are your feelings now that the program is out and it's being viewed?

163
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,160
How do you feel internally with that?

164
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,760
Thank you for that intro.

165
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,800
That was, that was lovely.

166
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,760
I never had such a deep sense of urgency with any film I've made in the past

167
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,600
as I've done with the program, because things are happening so quickly.

168
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,200
You know, we've had three congressional hearings in the last three years.

169
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,720
I mean, that's remarkable for people out there that think things aren't happening quick enough.

170
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,960
So I had this real sense of urgency to get the film out because

171
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,640
because, you know, it's going to be yesterday's news.

172
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,960
But also the mainstream media and people that have not been paying that much of attention

173
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,720
need to really know, like, I'm not trying to force anything down anyone's throats,

174
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,880
but it's like, Hey, there's something going on here.

175
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
I think people should be paying attention.

176
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,640
This is kind of a big deal.

177
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,200
Yep.

178
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,560
And it's lovely to see the bipartisan workmanship, right?

179
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,680
Both Democrats and Republicans working on this, on this issue together.

180
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,600
And quite honestly, we're living in a time which is unprecedented time

181
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,840
of a coordinated push for transparency on what, in my opinion,

182
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,800
will turn out to be the biggest story of modern history.

183
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,120
And you sure will be on the forefront of that, by the way, which I think is very awesome.

184
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
We're all in it together.

185
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,280
We are in it together.

186
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,840
That's for sure.

187
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,960
This, by the way, is funny.

188
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,880
I just pulled this out of my shelf yesterday.

189
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,160
I thought it was interesting.

190
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,200
You were born in 68?

191
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,520
Yes.

192
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,480
This was 67.

193
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Oh, wow.

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,800
This is a flying saucers and UFO report.

195
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,760
So you're saying that this right here is older than me.

196
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,400
That is correct.

197
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,120
That's impossible.

198
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,560
What's interesting in that.

199
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,840
That could be framed.

200
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,240
Yeah.

201
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,760
That is so cool.

202
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,720
And what's interesting is they even speculate about the moon landing

203
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
in that because it happens two years later.

204
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,080
So they're like, what are we going to find on the moon?

205
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
And it's a really interesting thing.

206
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,400
But that's a gift for you.

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,360
I wanted you to have that.

208
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,400
Oh my gosh.

209
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
Thank you.

210
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,560
There's some really interesting cases in there too that, as you know,

211
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,480
there's so many cases that, for lack of a better expression,

212
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
fly under the radar.

213
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,880
There are thousands of cases out there.

214
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,680
And if you go through, obviously, National Archive

215
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,040
and all these other old books like the Lorenzans,

216
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,400
we're finding out about cases.

217
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,680
You could read a new case every day for 10 years.

218
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,800
God, there's a young Heineck.

219
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,560
This is really cool.

220
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,960
You know, I got to interview Kenneth Arnold's daughter,

221
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,640
Kim Arnold.

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
She's in the phenomenon.

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,400
And I got to spend a couple of days with her and her daughter.

224
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,840
And it was amazing to get the backstory because, you know,

225
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,760
you have that phenomenal case in June of 1947,

226
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,600
which pretty much was the beginning of the modern UFO wave.

227
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,080
And that's where they coined the phrase flying saucer

228
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,960
because he described it as a saucer skipping over water.

229
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,040
And one of the reporters was like, flying saucer.

230
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,240
And he was catapulted into the headlines

231
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,800
all across the nation, all across the world.

232
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
I mean, the Kenneth Arnold thing was huge, right?

233
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,760
And she, a little backstory, she's like,

234
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,840
oh yeah, my father was really, really famous.

235
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,680
He was recognizable walking down the streets.

236
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,520
Like everybody knew Kenneth Arnold.

237
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,240
And he was going to go on a, just a little side story,

238
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,680
but he was going to go on like a tour.

239
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,600
He wrote a book and he was going to go like,

240
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,960
do all these conferences.

241
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,480
And he got a visit.

242
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,760
And I was like, he got a visit, really?

243
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,640
She goes, oh yeah, he got a visit from Men in Suits,

244
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,440
came in and they made it very clear.

245
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
He was not going to be doing that.

246
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,320
No way, he got spooked.

247
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,440
He got majorly spooked.

248
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
She said, he, yeah, that was my first experience

249
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
hearing about the so-called, you know, Men in Suits.

250
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,760
I hate to use the word men in black

251
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
because it's got so much baggage.

252
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,480
Disney.

253
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,120
You know what I mean?

254
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah.

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,840
So I call it Men in Dark Suits, you know.

256
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,120
Fair enough.

257
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,000
But it was like, that really kind of started in 1947.

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
And I report on it even recently in the program.

259
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,560
But in any case, as a side-

260
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,680
You think that was Blue Book?

261
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,800
No, that was before Blue Book.

262
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,080
That was way prior to Blue Book.

263
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,000
It was before I think anything really started

264
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,760
because you had Project Sign,

265
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,680
which started at some point in 47 or 48.

266
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,440
Then you had Project Grudge.

267
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,000
So what was that?

268
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,960
I don't know.

269
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know.

270
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,720
But he was going to go on tour

271
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,760
and they came and visited him

272
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
and they threatened him according to her.

273
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,320
And that's what she told me.

274
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,960
It was her dad.

275
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,280
They threatened him.

276
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,480
Like you, this is a big desert out here

277
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,600
or something like that.

278
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
You know, a big wilderness area.

279
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,360
That's what she said.

280
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,880
I believe she even said that on camera.

281
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
I should probably go digging for that

282
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,520
and release it out in the public.

283
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,240
But that's not the first time you've encountered

284
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
that type of spooky behavior.

285
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,400
No, but that was the earliest.

286
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,040
That was the earliest.

287
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,920
47.

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,040
Since then, you've encountered quite a few stories

289
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,000
of people being told to keep their mouth shut.

290
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,680
Has that ever come across your plate?

291
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,280
So I probably heard about these intimidators.

292
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,320
They obfuscate.

293
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
They intimidate.

294
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,560
They're intimidating.

295
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
And they come and if there's evidence,

296
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,120
they'll take the evidence.

297
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
They'll try to take the evidence.

298
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,880
They try to get the witnesses terrified and not talk.

299
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,840
And I'd heard about these since probably the first time

300
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,680
when I was investigating the Phoenix Lights case in the 90s.

301
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,120
And I did a couple of films,

302
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,680
covered a couple of films on that whole thing.

303
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,400
I heard about the first visitation,

304
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,040
real serious visitation of these so-called men in dark suits.

305
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,840
And then I'd heard about it like a number of other times.

306
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,760
I heard about it with 1950 with the McMinnville, Oregon case

307
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,760
that she got a visit.

308
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,680
It was Paul and Evelyn Trent.

309
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,880
And Evelyn had talked about her husband was out of the town

310
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,040
and this guy showed up and rummaged through her hole

311
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,960
from some unknown government agency.

312
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,080
And that was 1950.

313
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,480
Then I heard about it with Rex Heflin from I think Santa Ana, 65.

314
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,520
He had a visit with these guys in suits.

315
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,280
And I ignored that one.

316
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,160
Didn't report on it.

317
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,360
Didn't report on the 51.

318
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,520
Didn't report on the one from the Phoenix Lights case.

319
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,040
And then I heard a number of other cases in the United States

320
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,200
that I heard about some cases in Europe.

321
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,120
Didn't report on it.

322
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,840
Always American?

323
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,800
Yeah, there's an unknown government agency in the U.S.

324
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,720
that has the ability to reach anywhere.

325
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Like I even interviewed a general Parviz Jafari

326
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,520
from the 1970s UFO incident over Tehran, Iran.

327
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,800
It's a fascinating case.

328
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,600
And he told me, he was like, yeah, the next morning,

329
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
the encounter happened in the middle of the night.

330
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,640
The next morning, a couple of men from the United States government,

331
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,840
I don't know what agency they're from.

332
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,240
They were there poking around, asking questions.

333
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,440
I was like, really?

334
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,400
And I didn't report on that.

335
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:48,320
But then I was in Brazil, probably on and off for the last 12, 14 years.

336
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,400
But I was in Brazil, it was probably 2013, maybe 2014.

337
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,800
And I was interviewing the mother of two really important witnesses

338
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,720
that came, according to them, within 10 feet of a live creature in broad daylight.

339
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,400
And the mother talked about these men in suits that showed up her house,

340
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:15,600
very intimidating, very scary, and very just scary and intimidating.

341
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,080
And they tried to persuade her to get her daughters to lie,

342
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,200
and they didn't see what they said.

343
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,440
They saw all this stuff.

344
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,080
Money as well.

345
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,080
They offered a briefcase full of money.

346
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,440
That was it.

347
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,120
I was like, okay, these guys exist.

348
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,120
I've had enough hearing these stories.

349
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
I'm going all in, I'm going to report on it.

350
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,120
And I did.

351
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,160
That put you over the edge.

352
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,120
That put me over the edge.

353
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,600
Wow.

354
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,080
Yeah, finally, after all those years.

355
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,520
You're like enough of these guys.

356
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,960
Well, I knew it was a slippery slope.

357
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,920
But I knew like reporting, if you look at the history of my investigations and my filmmaking,

358
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,480
I had heard about Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

359
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,440
Of course, I mentioned the Rolls-Royce incident, one of my first films.

360
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
But in terms of an alleged Close Encounter of the Third Kind,

361
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,200
when you've got witnesses reporting entities, beings, creatures,

362
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,560
whatever connected to the craft, that to me was a slippery slope.

363
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,840
And I just avoided it for over 20 years, probably 25 years.

364
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,320
I don't know.

365
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
And it was the same with the MIB.

366
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
Because I just thought like, A, I can't prove it.

367
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,440
It just sounds so out there.

368
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,200
It just sounds kind of crazy.

369
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
It sounds cliche almost.

370
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,240
Sounds cliche, exactly.

371
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,280
And so I finally said, oh, the hell with it.

372
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:28,240
And then actually, I reported on a lesser version in the phenomenon

373
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,160
with the 1966 UFO landing at Westall Primary School.

374
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,920
Shane Ryan is very grateful for all the work he's done in that case.

375
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,920
But that's when we got a hold of this science teacher named Mr. Greenwood.

376
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,400
And he went silent for 50 years.

377
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,960
In fact, when I arrived in Australia, people,

378
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,160
even like the long-term UFO researchers, like don't even bother,

379
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,040
you'll never come forward.

380
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,760
And then we finally found out he had a visit from men in suits.

381
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,160
And they scared me.

382
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,520
Was it Air Force?

383
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,400
Yeah, I wasn't sure.

384
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,840
Like two were in uniform.

385
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,360
One was not in uniform.

386
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,000
But they basically intimidated him and scared the bejeeze out of him.

387
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
You silenced him for 50 years.

388
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:05,840
Imagine.

389
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,040
Yeah.

390
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,760
So anyway, but enough men in black.

391
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,400
But it is interesting that they have this sort of omnipresence globally.

392
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,680
That is very interesting in that it always seems to be American.

393
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,720
Because I had this discussion with some friends,

394
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
and we were actually on a Discord, and we were talking about,

395
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,400
is the men in black thing just solely a US thing?

396
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,680
Because you hear about a lot of these cases.

397
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,200
People are like, why is it always the US?

398
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,240
Why is it always the US?

399
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,560
Well, they kind of have agency over everything that revolves around crash.

400
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:38,960
Everything.

401
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,840
They show up everywhere.

402
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,040
They showed up in Virginia.

403
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,160
They're retrieving these crafts in Italy.

404
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
They're retrieving all this around the world.

405
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Why wouldn't they also have feet on the ground?

406
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,720
And then Calvine as well.

407
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,440
Yeah, it was amazing.

408
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,000
That was a last-minute development in the program.

409
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,320
Because quite honestly, I'd heard about the 1990 Calvine UFO case

410
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,600
from Nick Pope years ago, well over 20 years ago.

411
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,640
Because I was like, every time we'd be having a beer together,

412
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,680
I'd be like, Nick, come on, man, what was the best case here?

413
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,760
And hands down, he would just tell these two guys hiking in Scotland.

414
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,040
He never used the word Calvine.

415
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,640
I don't believe he did when he told me.

416
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,440
He said these guys were hiking in Calvine, broad daylight,

417
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,120
five or six prints of its diamond-shaped like disc,

418
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,440
diamond-shaped craft with military...

419
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,760
I was like, whoa, you saw that picture?

420
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,720
He goes, yeah, man, we added a poster on the wall.

421
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
So I mildly chased after that case because I kept saying to Nick,

422
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,320
who is your predecessor?

423
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,080
Like, what about people who are retired?

424
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,280
They wouldn't have thrown that picture away.

425
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,640
He goes, well, at some point, the poster was no longer on the wall at the M.O.D.

426
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,280
I'm not sure.

427
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,240
I said, well, they didn't throw it away.

428
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
I can assure you that did not get thrown away.

429
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,520
Somebody's got to have it.

430
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,120
And I was pestering him for a long time.

431
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,520
And then we cover that case, thank God, to David Clark.

432
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
Because David Clark was going through some redacted documents

433
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,840
that were released through FOIA.

434
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,560
I don't know what the British equivalent would be.

435
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:15,360
And he saw this thing that said, so-and-so, the former RAF press officer blacked out in 1990.

436
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,080
He's like, who was the press officer in 1990?

437
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,680
Craig Lindsay contacts him.

438
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,920
And he managed to keep one of those prints.

439
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,600
So thanks to David Clark, we had a print.

440
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,440
We had the only military, or yeah, I guess he would be military,

441
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,080
Royal Air Force press officer, Craig Lindsay,

442
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
who the only known person to have interviewed the witnesses.

443
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,640
So we had him come on camera.

444
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,840
We had the print.

445
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,600
We had Nick Pope at the former UFO desk at the M.O.D. talk about the case.

446
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,320
The only thing we were missing was like, what about the witnesses?

447
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,760
What about the people that took the photograph?

448
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,880
Where are they?

449
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,640
And at the last minute, this guy came forward, Richard Greaves,

450
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,160
who worked with them in the kitchen.

451
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
The chef, yeah, the kitchen guy.

452
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
And that's when it was like, that's when he was like,

453
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,800
he started talking about these men that showed up in suits.

454
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,640
I was like, oh my God, here they are again.

455
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,480
Start talking about that.

456
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,920
And I was like, and they had a chauffeur, which I thought was interesting.

457
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,000
The chauffeur never got out of the car.

458
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,760
He stayed in the car and the other guys stood in the rain as if it didn't bother them.

459
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,480
Hissing rain.

460
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,440
He said it was bizarre.

461
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,240
Hissing rain.

462
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,720
Stand up there.

463
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,960
But I said, oh, that's what they told you?

464
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,480
He goes, no, mate, I was there when they rolled up.

465
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,800
So you're a witness to that.

466
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,300
Yes.

467
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,240
And I love the way he describes it because he's like,

468
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,360
I swear to my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren.

469
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,160
Grandchildren?

470
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,660
Yes.

471
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,560
Grandchildren, yes.

472
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,520
So funny.

473
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:39,840
I know.

474
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,560
That was almost harder for me to decipher than the Portuguese in the other documentary.

475
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,160
Yeah, so funny.

476
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,360
Big Scottish accent.

477
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,360
So one little side note that I'll share here is that, am I allowed to use like...

478
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:53,920
Explodives?

479
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,160
Yes.

480
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,800
Yeah, go for it.

481
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,480
So Richard Greaves, you know, he'd never really given like a...

482
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,960
Like I would say on camera or like he'd done one written interview.

483
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,800
So written only, so no voice, you know, and they took one photograph of him.

484
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,600
But he'd never really given a real interview like what he did with us.

485
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,840
And he kept putting it off and I was approaching the end of production.

486
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,760
The film was a wrap and I was like just putting the finishing touches on and I kept

487
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,400
contacting him because he agreed to do it through Richard Clark.

488
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,440
Excuse me, David Clark.

489
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
And he kept putting it off and then he just vanished.

490
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,240
And I contacted David Clark and I was like, God, Richard Greaves' testimony is going to

491
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,120
be so important.

492
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,600
Like, you know, did I pester him?

493
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,400
Did I upset him?

494
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,840
Maybe I pushed him too much?

495
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,440
Like David's like, no, man, it took me two years to get a written out of him.

496
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,000
So that's kind of his nature, you know?

497
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,720
And so one night he finally calls and he'd had a couple of pints and he's like, I'm ready.

498
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,040
I think he was obviously clearly nervous from the whole experience.

499
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,440
I'm ready.

500
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,920
Well, he uses a lot of expletives.

501
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,560
And it was a brilliant interview.

502
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,320
I remember it was Lance Mungia.

503
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
It was Donnie in the room.

504
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,480
It was my sister, myself.

505
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
And I think we had one other person I'm trying to remember in the bedroom that night.

506
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,680
And he calls and we get the whole thing.

507
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,200
We just capture it on camera and we're going through the interview and he's like,

508
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,800
he's like, the fucking why is a fucking ghost?

509
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,000
And yeah, I made fucking poached eggs.

510
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,920
They made those, you know, and he's like, so at the end of the interview,

511
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,520
I called my buddy, Jim Martin, and who I'm working with on the film.

512
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,640
And I said, Jim, man, this guy is a really good interview, but he kind of says fuck a lot.

513
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
He goes, and Jim's like, okay, well, how many times does he say it?

514
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,360
I was like, a lot.

515
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,640
He's like, well, a couple of times.

516
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,200
I was like, no, more than a couple, a lot.

517
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,000
How many fucks can we include in the movie?

518
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,400
He goes, God, I would say a couple of fucks.

519
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,720
I would say two, maybe three.

520
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,760
I was like, in the whole movie, he goes, yeah, anything more than that.

521
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,280
So he ate up your entire fuck budget for the program.

522
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,360
It was so funny.

523
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,440
So I went into the sound engineer, this guy at Juniper Post.

524
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,960
He's great at Ben Zarai and Ben's like, what's going on?

525
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,520
I was like, well, you might have to beep, because I'm only really allowed just a couple of fucks.

526
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,040
And this guy is very passionate, and he's obviously been sitting on the story for a long time.

527
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,040
And Ben's like, well, how many fucks are okay?

528
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,920
It's like, well, I think three, maybe two, three, four at the most.

529
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,760
He's like, I'll write a number down and slide it towards you.

530
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,240
What do you think?

531
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
He's like, okay, well, I'll just beep them out.

532
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,960
And so he starts beeping them out.

533
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,760
And then we listen to it.

534
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,520
We're like, oh, man, that doesn't sound good.

535
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,640
He goes, you know what?

536
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,560
Let me get in there and do some microscopic surgery.

537
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,640
I think I can just get a couple of those fucks out.

538
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,920
So we'll only have a couple.

539
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,080
So I said it once during the interview, and then he said it a couple of times.

540
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,120
But it was really funny.

541
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,680
We're having this very serious conversation about how many fucks can we get away with in a movie?

542
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,000
I think three was the magic number.

543
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,040
Meanwhile, this guy's like, yeah, the men in black showed up.

544
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
Perfect situation to use the F word, by the way.

545
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,480
There were fucking smokes.

546
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,520
Yeah, yeah, he said that.

547
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,000
Very passionate.

548
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,880
I mean, I've got a few questions here, but it does bring me to one question is,

549
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,040
because you touched on it a little bit.

550
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,360
But let's say you're in a situation and a witness is sitting in front of you.

551
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,240
What do you do to gain their trust to make them open up?

552
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,680
Like, what is that like?

553
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,200
What is that exchange like?

554
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,520
Because I know a lot of times a lot of these people, as we mentioned, are scared, are threatened.

555
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,560
So what is your sort of go-to tactic to get them to open up?

556
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,280
Is it just time or is it something else?

557
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,880
Like, where do you go for that?

558
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,200
A lot of people think that, and I try not to read the comments.

559
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,360
George and Ab always tell me, don't read the comments.

560
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,880
And sometimes I do.

561
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,920
And it's very nice when you get people very supportive of what you do.

562
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,920
And some people are like, oh, you know, people are just coming forward

563
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,840
because they want to be in the limelight.

564
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,120
And I'm like, you know, the better the witness,

565
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,040
the more difficult it is to get these people to come forward.

566
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,760
Like, I cannot overstate that.

567
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,400
I remember this guy, James Rigney in Australia goes, he's like, how do you do it?

568
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,320
How do you get these guys to come forward?

569
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,160
I said, James, and I was serious.

570
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,200
I said, James, I look into their soul in their eyes.

571
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,080
I look into their soul.

572
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,440
He goes, you look into their soul?

573
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,880
I said, yeah, I do.

574
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,200
And I say, this story is so much more important than any one of us.

575
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,400
This is something that could affect the lives of every man, woman, and child on this planet.

576
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,320
And we have to remember that.

577
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,760
And I look into their soul, and that's what I do.

578
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
And I remind them of that.

579
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,480
Like, this is so much bigger.

580
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,040
And it's really hard.

581
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,520
And, you know, I've had people tell me, I don't care.

582
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,120
All the money in the world is never coming forward.

583
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,040
And then just spend a little time with them, and magic can happen.

584
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,400
Beautiful.

585
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,280
I'm glad you didn't.

586
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,240
I'm glad you weren't like, well, I don't have to pay him off.

587
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

588
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,480
No, James Rigney is the only other person that ever asked me that question.

589
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,360
It's a great question.

590
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,400
Yeah, I mean, it's just so fascinating because being someone who's getting into this

591
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,040
and investigating a lot of this stuff as well, I find that that is like the murkiest territory.

592
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,960
Because facts exist, data is out there, footage, photos.

593
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,880
But testimony is the rare stuff that we found.

594
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,680
Like, there are, I mean, obviously, you know, seeing an HD video is something else.

595
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,920
But the next best thing is a human interaction, in my opinion.

596
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,680
Because I think that conveys much more than what you can read on a transcript.

597
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,640
It conveys emotion.

598
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,440
It conveys real fear or real surprise.

599
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,280
And these are things that you can't fake.

600
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,920
And you can put someone on a lie detector all you want,

601
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,560
or you can do all the other extra things.

602
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,720
But this, for me, is the most convincing part of it.

603
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,560
Kurt McConnell stepped down from Senate Armed Service Committee.

604
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,760
He spent 37 years top secret clearance.

605
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:16,320
He talks about what he did from 2017 to 2024 in the program.

606
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,080
And there was one little clip that he gave that I actually, I like to take the credits,

607
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,520
and I like to spice the credits up.

608
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,240
And I always put these little Easter eggs in the credits.

609
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,080
Because when I'm editing, I like color-coat everything.

610
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,160
And I'll have like purple, pink, gold, blue.

611
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,320
And then once I color-coat everything and organize them,

612
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,680
then in the timeline, I'll put the video signal, I'll stack it.

613
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,960
And stuff that's right at the top is like, it's got to go in the movie.

614
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,160
It's purple, it's got to go to the top.

615
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,920
Or it's gold, it's golden.

616
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,880
If it's blue, it's generally B-roll, and then I stack it.

617
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,200
And sometimes I just don't find a place for it in the movie.

618
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
It just doesn't fit, right?

619
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,760
But I was like, this is so good.

620
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,080
So I always take all those little gems.

621
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,680
I call them GMs, golden moments.

622
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,320
And I put them off to the end of the timeline.

623
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,160
And then I stack them all up there.

624
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,880
And I see one, and I put them all in the same spot.

625
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,760
And then at the end of the movie, I go to those little GMs.

626
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,320
And I put them in, and I sprinkle with good music the credits.

627
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,680
And then I'll show another GM.

628
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,160
And Kirk McConnell makes a really good point.

629
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,720
He says, we sentence people to death based on eyewitness testimony.

630
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,120
But that same logic doesn't apply to the phenomenon, right?

631
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,880
And I thought, what a really good point.

632
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,240
He's totally right.

633
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,360
Eyewitness testimony is irrelevant when it comes to the phenomenon.

634
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,480
Just because we can't explain it doesn't mean it didn't happen.

635
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,040
That's right.

636
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,800
So yeah, it's a good point.

637
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,560
Was there ever a whistleblower you came across that you didn't believe?

638
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,920
Not a whistleblower per se, but maybe someone who came forward.

639
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,840
Yeah, I'd rather not use that individual's name.

640
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,600
But would you say yes, there was?

641
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,840
Yes.

642
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,320
How do you handle that situation, where you just let them speak

643
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,680
and then be like, I'm going to cut this?

644
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,200
What's that like for you?

645
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,960
Or is that heartbreaking?

646
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
I remember I got contacted.

647
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,080
There was this one individual.

648
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,640
This individual will remain nameless.

649
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,680
It was to do with the Bentwater's December 1980 UFO incursion

650
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,800
over the joint US-British airbase, the landing.

651
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,800
And there was one particular individual that I just found him sketchy.

652
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,600
And we'd already interviewed him for the movie Out of the Blue.

653
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,280
And I got into an argument with my co-producer,

654
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,640
but I was ultimately the director.

655
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,680
And I got to override, even though these guys were 10 years my senior,

656
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,120
I was like, no, no, no, no.

657
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
And I was like, why?

658
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,240
And because I just didn't get the vibe, man.

659
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,440
I just, I don't know.

660
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,840
And I struggled with that, too.

661
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,560
It was a gut thing.

662
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,720
Yeah, it was his mannerisms.

663
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,120
It was the way he conducted himself in the interview.

664
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,520
His eye contact just didn't quite align with me.

665
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,720
I really had an issue.

666
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,240
Some of the claims were inconsistent with the other witnesses.

667
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,360
And I just, I don't know, man.

668
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,480
It seemed like, I don't know.

669
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,240
I kind of got the impression that he believed what he was saying,

670
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,360
but I don't know.

671
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,640
You were lying.

672
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,520
I wasn't, yeah.

673
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,000
And so I remember I had this argument with my buddy Tim Coleman over it.

674
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,360
He forgave me in the end.

675
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,640
And then I had some people contact me later on and be like,

676
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,560
I can't believe you didn't include that.

677
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,040
And then 10 years after that, they were like,

678
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,640
ooh, good thing you didn't include that.

679
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,240
It turned out to be kind of right.

680
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,640
Sometimes people are maybe exposed to disinformation unknowingly.

681
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,600
One of the things that deputy base commander Colonel Charles Holt

682
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,960
had talked about with the Bentwaters case in 1980 was that this, again,

683
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
I think it was a plane that came in from Germany.

684
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,920
And it was some U.S. unknown government agency that stepped in

685
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
and kind of took over and sanitized the whole case

686
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,800
and subjected, according to the base commander,

687
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,480
deputy base commander Charles Holt,

688
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:06,080
a lot of the witnesses to sodium pentothal and like tweak them out.

689
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,080
And God knows whatever they else did in interrogation or-

690
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,760
Wow, some MK Ultra stuff.

691
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,320
Weird shit.

692
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,680
And so maybe other memories were implanted.

693
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,480
Who knows what kind of games they're playing.

694
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,920
And I think that could happen to witnesses that have a legitimate experience

695
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,360
and then get manipulated post experience.

696
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,840
And that kind of just throws everyone off because it's like,

697
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,280
everybody's talking about a landing.

698
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,880
And then all of a sudden, one individual is talking about contact

699
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,320
with all these other people who were there.

700
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,240
It doesn't align with everybody else's memory.

701
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,840
Something's off.

702
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,800
And sometimes I think it's a deliberate effort to obfuscate the whole thing.

703
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,840
It's like the Holloman landing case.

704
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,480
I'm convinced.

705
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,560
Well, I think it was like probably 1964 is my guess on the date.

706
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,200
I could be wrong, but I think it's 1964.

707
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,920
And I was investigating a case, a landing case in Socorro, New Mexico

708
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,080
that also occurred in 1964.

709
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,040
And Socorro is very close, very close to Holloman, White Sands.

710
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,480
And I'm investigating that case and I was reading some articles by Carl Lorenzen

711
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,600
and it led me to a documentary, UFO's Past, Present, and Future

712
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,080
with Alan Sandler and Bob Emanager.

713
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,520
And I was like, oh man, that case really happened.

714
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,200
And then I came across some information,

715
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,520
like there was a meeting with the president and all this other stuff.

716
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,800
And I was like, boy, that suddenly goes sideways.

717
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,400
Not to say that it did or didn't happen.

718
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,040
I don't know.

719
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,680
I certainly started to believe that the landing case happened.

720
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,520
And all of a sudden they're talking about meeting with presidents

721
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,320
and all this other stuff.

722
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,600
And I kind of threw me off the case and I was thinking to myself,

723
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,800
was that an intentional thing to throw people off?

724
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Like you take an incident that most likely happened

725
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,720
and then you'd throw a bunch of crazy unsubstantiated stuff in there

726
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,600
to throw people off.

727
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,080
Who knows?

728
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,920
But unfortunately, a guy named Paul Schartel

729
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,000
who worked at Norton Air Force Base.

730
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,880
Security.

731
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,920
Yeah, that was, excuse me, early 60s.

732
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,880
So what happened was they were doing that,

733
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,040
they were shooting that documentary, UFOs,

734
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,320
Past, Present, and Future,

735
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,800
and they were having an unprecedented level of access granted to them

736
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,840
by the government.

737
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,880
It was quite remarkable.

738
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,280
They were going on all these military bases and go watch the movie.

739
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,920
It's incredible.

740
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,720
Colonel Coleman at the time was either press liaison for the Pentagon

741
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,480
or press officer, but in any case,

742
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,400
and he basically called the various bases.

743
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,680
Hey, there's a film crew coming.

744
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,880
Alan Sanders, got Bob Edmonger, give them full access

745
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,760
and show them around the base doing an interview about UFOs.

746
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,760
And so Paul Schartel got that message like, hey, these guys are showing up.

747
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,240
And they did at Norton Air Force Base.

748
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,520
And Paul had just processed film footage of a landing of a disc

749
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,040
at Holman Air Force Base.

750
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,080
And Paul showed it.

751
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,000
Unfortunately, Emanager wasn't filming that day at the base,

752
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,440
but Alan was there.

753
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,920
So Paul pulls Alan into the screening room

754
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
and shows him this footage of a landing.

755
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,520
And Paul Schartel's convinced it's a legit landing.

756
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,400
And so I'm investigating this whole thing

757
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,040
and I'm just talking to Emanager about it.

758
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,600
And then it's revealed that Alan was shown this footage.

759
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,880
And I have this thing and I've talked about this before.

760
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,160
And I did this with firing this guy, Travis Walton.

761
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,520
I remember the first time I met him,

762
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,720
I will sometimes close my eyes

763
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,840
and I'll get their words to create the imagery in my head.

764
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,720
So it's like I'm almost experiencing it through their eyes.

765
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,320
So I'll close my eyes and let the words create the imagery.

766
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,840
So I'm watching like a film strip

767
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,400
as opposed to like listening to words.

768
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,880
So I did that with Alan and I said,

769
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,440
okay, Alan and I got some every possible detail

770
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,560
you could ever imagine

771
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,480
because I wanted to see that footage

772
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,680
as best I possibly could.

773
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,240
So I was like, let me get this straight.

774
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,800
Alan, you're telling me that you saw the footage

775
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,400
of the landing at Holman.

776
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,920
Yes. How did you see it?

777
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,240
He's like, well, Paul Schartel pulled it out and showed it to me.

778
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,520
I was like, why didn't Emanager see it?

779
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,480
He wasn't with me that day.

780
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,440
Okay. So then what happened?

781
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,000
He goes, well, he said it was like three discs

782
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,480
at a high altitude, maybe 9,000 feet.

783
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,600
And they were escorted by military jets.

784
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,600
I don't know if he said one jet or multiple jets.

785
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,680
I don't know, but the three discs, I know for sure.

786
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,640
I remember that for sure.

787
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,000
Three discs coming in and it's late afternoon.

788
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,840
This is the early morning, late afternoon.

789
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,200
I think it was late afternoon.

790
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,920
Three discs coming in at high altitude.

791
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,160
They get over the base, two of them peel away.

792
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,120
And then the third one in the middle oscillates down.

793
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,400
And Alan goes, yeah, it was like it was in trouble or something.

794
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,280
It wasn't flying that well.

795
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,040
And I'm thinking to myself, that's how they fly

796
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,840
when they're going slow.

797
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,480
They do this like a leaf kind of falling.

798
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,200
He said the disc came down wobbling like it was in trouble.

799
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,080
And he goes, James, it landed.

800
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,920
And I said, okay, was it a tripod?

801
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,280
Yes. He goes, I think the camera was on a tripod

802
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,400
because it wasn't handheld.

803
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
It looked like they were anticipating something going down.

804
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,560
Or maybe they were filming some other exercise.

805
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,520
They weren't ready.

806
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,600
But he goes, yeah, it was locked.

807
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,520
It seemed like they knew this was happening.

808
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,440
Or they were filming something else.

809
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,160
I can't remember.

810
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,280
I wish I could remember that detail.

811
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,880
And I should remember that detail, but I don't.

812
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,000
But any jets escorting and it would seem that way.

813
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,040
It seems a little too perfect.

814
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,080
That I don't know for sure.

815
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,440
Anyway, so the disc comes down and he goes, James.

816
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,600
And I said, well, did it have a tripod landing?

817
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,800
Did it have pods?

818
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,520
Like, what did it land?

819
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,880
He goes, James, I don't remember,

820
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,800
but it was firmly sitting on the ground.

821
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,200
And this is the part I remember really well.

822
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,320
He goes, James, like in a sci-fi movie, there were no seams.

823
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,840
Like this door just opens up and drops to the ground.

824
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,720
And there's stairs.

825
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:07,040
And two beams come out and they flank either side of the staircase.

826
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,120
And then a third one comes out and he said it had like...

827
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,640
And Alan was convinced that this was a real flying saucer with real technology,

828
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,560
not a special effect, but that they took a real flying saucer

829
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,680
and dressed people up like aliens as a staged event.

830
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,720
Which I don't believe that, but whatever.

831
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,520
That's a side note.

832
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,960
And Alan goes, yeah, just like in the sci-fi movie, this thing opens up.

833
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,720
There are no, like you couldn't see a door there.

834
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,440
And it just opens and drops staircase.

835
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,400
Two guys get out.

836
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,440
They flank the staircase.

837
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,520
And then a third gentleman gets out.

838
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,720
And he said he had like a tight fitting suit on.

839
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:51,440
He had a big nose, tiny mouth, not much of a chin, big eyes with vertical slits.

840
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,960
And then he had this like headgear, almost like Egyptian headgear.

841
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,880
And then he had a...

842
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,160
And this is what Alan told me.

843
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,560
He had like some kind of device that he assumed was supposed to be a translator device,

844
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,840
a communication device.

845
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,280
Didn't know for sure.

846
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,400
And he was met by people in uniform, dressed, you know, military officers in uniform.

847
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,080
I was like, what happened then?

848
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,320
He goes, well, they met this one individual and he went over to a Jeep,

849
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
got in the Jeep and off they drove.

850
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,240
And then the film footage ends.

851
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,440
I said the film footage ends with the disc just sitting there on the ground.

852
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,080
He's like, yeah.

853
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,040
So I find this out.

854
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,760
And I mean, quite honestly, I was like, holy shit.

855
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,000
Because I was starting to believe that that case had happened because I investigated the

856
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,160
Socorro landing case that happened in April 24, 1964.

857
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,840
And with a police officer named Lana Zamora.

858
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,520
And I was really sticking my teeth into that case over a five-year period.

859
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,400
Now, Hallam insists a stone's throw from Socorro, as the crow flies.

860
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Well, I believed, I absolutely believed in the landing and the close encounter of the

861
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,680
third kind in Socorro, which is one of the most well-documented close encounters of

862
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,880
the third kind in US history.

863
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,000
Why not have happened something similar at the base?

864
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,200
Why not?

865
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,640
I have to be open to that.

866
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,840
So I'm sitting there going, wow.

867
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,360
So then I'm talking to Emanager, but I was like, Emanager?

868
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,200
Well, so I said, well, Alan, why didn't you ever tell Emanager?

869
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,240
And I actually have video of a phone call that I made.

870
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,800
I have it somewhere else.

871
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,920
You dig it up where I called, I was with Alan and I called Emanager or I was with Emanager

872
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,920
and I called Alan because I was like, why is it that you didn't tell the partner that

873
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,120
you were doing the documentary with back in 1972 that you were showing the footage by

874
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,760
Paul Shartle?

875
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,920
He's like, well, some men in suits showed up either later that day or first thing the

876
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,960
next morning, took the footage from Paul Shartle, took it away, gone.

877
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,120
And like, don't ever talk about this kind of thing.

878
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,320
And so Alan didn't tell his own partner that he'd seen it until years later.

879
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,200
I have them on camera.

880
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,840
So then I was talking to Emanager about it.

881
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,520
And I said, well, Alan thinks it was a real flying saucer.

882
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,160
So you had that technology in 1972, but there was a staged event with people looking like

883
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,040
aliens and Emanager is like, bullshit, no.

884
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,760
I said, why do you feel so adamant about that?

885
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,520
He goes, because I knew Paul Shartle.

886
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,360
I actually talked to Paul Shartle about it.

887
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,560
I talked to the guy that processed the film budget in Northern Air Force Base.

888
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,800
And he goes, in fact, and he dug it up.

889
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,240
He did a search for Paul Shartle and Robert Emanager on some TV show in the either late

890
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,520
70s or early 80s.

891
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,080
And he died in a car crash, Paul Shartle with his wife.

892
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,160
A head-on car collision, they both died.

893
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,520
But before that happened, he gave an interview and he talked about why he believed that was

894
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,760
a legitimate UFO landing that was captured on film footage.

895
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,160
In fact, I've talked to people about it within the government recently.

896
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,440
Like, you should go after that footage.

897
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,080
I think it exists.

898
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,080
In fact, I can put you in a touch with the guy who's seen it.

899
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,840
That's the holy grail.

900
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,200
That's the holy grail.

901
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,080
That's the one.

902
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,720
That's the one.

903
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,920
That answers another question.

904
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,760
Like, what's the thing?

905
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,400
And that's it.

906
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,120
That's gotta be it.

907
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,400
Well, in terms of the multi-angles, like, I mean...

908
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,520
Yeah, in terms of a case that happened on a military base, boy, that's pretty damn good.

909
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,840
It's pretty damn good, especially considering that, you know, the cameras were in focus

910
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,360
enough and had the quality enough to notice that the seam appeared on the craft.

911
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,960
And that's a big detail for me because when filming something like that with these old

912
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,800
cameras, you'd expect fuzzy grainy.

913
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,680
But if you can tell from that footage that the seam opened, that means you can probably

914
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,760
see the expression on those beings' faces.

915
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,400
Like, that's a heck of a claim.

916
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,040
Yeah.

917
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,880
I know, so it's a remarkable case.

918
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,080
But, you know, Varginha is also, because it's more recent, in 96.

919
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,680
That does have something to do with people's ability to believe in the story as well, right?

920
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,880
That holds some importance.

921
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,440
Yeah, it's a preponderance of eyewitness testimony.

922
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,640
I mean, it pretty much...

923
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,160
I mean, if you go to the town of Varginha, Brazil, which is about four hours north of

924
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,920
Sao Paulo, chances are if you go down to the main square and you start talking about it,

925
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,760
they'll either have, you know, especially if they're older, a first-hand knowledge.

926
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,400
Or like, oh, my cousin, my brother, my mom, you know.

927
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,800
That was actually a question for later coming up in the Discord by Nelson.

928
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,600
He wanted to know.

929
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,080
He was like, he loved Moment of Contact.

930
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,000
And Nelson, he's a great friend.

931
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,480
He's the memory champion I told you about.

932
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,680
But he said, you know, would James be willing to elaborate a little bit on those

933
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,560
interactions? Because he found that, like many of us, so fascinating that at the very beginning,

934
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,720
it kind of caught you off guard how forthcoming just the local citizens were about this.

935
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,920
And you would just ask people and they had answers for you.

936
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,120
Can you elaborate on that?

937
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,240
Like, is there a lot that you left out of those interactions?

938
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,920
Yeah, I mean, yeah, unfortunately, you know, you shoot hundreds of hours of interviews

939
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,040
and you've got to whittle it down to an hour and 40 minutes, hour and 45 minutes, maybe.

940
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
That's a really tough decision, right?

941
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,200
I mean, I call it killing your darlings.

942
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,600
I mean, there's so many GMs in there that you just can't squeeze into a movie.

943
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,520
And it's heartbreaking.

944
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,520
In fact, at some point, I think I might be, I'm not trying to toot my own horn here,

945
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,440
but I think I might be probably sitting on the biggest archive of interviews

946
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,640
over the last 30 years because I've made so many documentaries and there's so many,

947
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,080
so much content.

948
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,160
I was actually talking to some people the other day.

949
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,520
I might have been talking to Jesse Michaels.

950
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,560
Hey, if I had some resources, resources, not financial resource, but manpower,

951
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,920
we can go through all my various tapes and interviews over the last three decades

952
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,680
and make it all available to people.

953
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,040
Put it out there for free.

954
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,080
That was my next question.

955
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,600
I was like, when are we going to see the YouTube mashup of all this?

956
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,720
Because as a content creator, you're sitting on a pile of gold.

957
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,920
I'm sitting on a pile of gold.

958
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,280
And a lot of people are, I got the only interviews with them before they died.

959
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,360
A lot of people, a lot of people.

960
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,880
That's like Roswell stuff.

961
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,160
I was there filming in 1997 in Roswell.

962
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,800
I was getting people talking about, I remember it because I was kind of new to it.

963
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,280
I was only in it for a few years at the time, but the one distinct advantage I had going

964
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,040
to Roswell for the 50th anniversary is A, was getting a lot of attention in the media and B,

965
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,760
if people were in their 20s during the experience or maybe their 30s,

966
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,200
they were in their 70s and 80s.

967
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,720
So they were still around.

968
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,280
I must have talked to at least 15 people, maybe 20.

969
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,160
My goodness.

970
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,360
And a lot of them on camera.

971
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,560
You know, I would just get them like, you know, just this guy was like,

972
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,920
you know, talked about the mayor.

973
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,120
I think it was the mayor of the time.

974
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,960
He said he was white as a ghost.

975
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,000
Saw some of the stuff and he said that they not only threatened them.

976
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,240
I heard this from at least 10, maybe 15 people that they were saying they're not only going

977
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,160
to be picking my bones out of the desert, but your family's bones.

978
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,920
That's what they told me.

979
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,920
Do you think there's any credence to, this is something I've been researching recently,

980
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,920
but you know, just on, on that, that you mentioned that you touched on there,

981
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,400
the threatening of the families and everything else and the people who work for these legacy

982
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:10,400
programs, do you think there's any validity to recruiting out of places like BYU and like Utah?

983
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,360
I gotta, I gotta say, I don't have much concrete information on that.

984
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,480
I don't, I don't know.

985
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,680
Yeah. It's something I've just been recently turned onto because of the nature of their faith.

986
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,600
They don't drink smoke.

987
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,800
They're straight arrows.

988
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,840
They have large families and there's an article put out, certainly makes sense.

989
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,800
A few years back about the FBI, there was actually, this went to court because there

990
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,040
was a case made against the FBI that they were basically recruiting.

991
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,280
There was discrimination for recruitment within these three letter agencies because

992
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,720
they were solely pretty much a recruiting Mormons.

993
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,440
Wow.

994
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:51,840
Yeah.

995
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,320
Wow.

996
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,760
Yeah, because they got large families.

997
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,800
They're never going to talk.

998
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,440
There's, they, they never drink, they never do drugs.

999
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,280
And, you know, they're all into like family and hiking and work and that's it.

1000
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,960
You know, so there's, there's something really, and, you know, when you look at

1001
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,720
Dugway, you look at all the interesting, you know, places in Utah, it kind of makes sense,

1002
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,240
you know, that, that BYU would be like this breeding ground for, for these,

1003
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,960
you know, straight arrow white male intelligent, you know what I mean?

1004
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,920
That's the whole profile of these agents, it seems like.

1005
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,560
People often mistake me for being like a Richard Dolan.

1006
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,440
You know, Richard Dolan has got a breadth of knowledge on cases, far expanding,

1007
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,960
way beyond anything that I'll ever have.

1008
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,360
The cases that I know, I know, because I put boots on the ground.

1009
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,880
I went to China, I went to Australia, I went to Africa, I went to South America,

1010
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,200
I went to Russia, I went to, do you know what I mean?

1011
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,680
And I know those cases really well because I met the witnesses.

1012
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,840
I went to the, you know, all those spots.

1013
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,480
I mean, case in point, Virginia, I mean, I went, I'm still going there.

1014
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,680
I'm going to go there probably next month.

1015
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,560
Let me, let me stop you there.

1016
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,160
So you said you're going to go there next month.

1017
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:00,560
Yes.

1018
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,840
Is that something, is this like a continuation or is this a personal project or is this like-

1019
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,960
Continuation.

1020
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,280
Really?

1021
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,480
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1022
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:08,960
Wow.

1023
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,680
Yeah, yeah.

1024
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,200
So you're saying there might be new developments.

1025
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,880
Oh, there's definitely new developments, yes.

1026
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,000
That you're aware of already.

1027
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,500
Yes.

1028
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,480
Yeah, that's where I'm going.

1029
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,120
Did it take-

1030
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:21,360
So some, I got half guaranteed, which is great.

1031
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,920
So if I come back with just that, it's going to be golden.

1032
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,360
Half the documentary project.

1033
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,720
Sorry, I got half of the security interviews that are, it's phenomenal.

1034
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,360
I understand.

1035
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,000
Yeah, that's like locked, okay?

1036
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,800
That's good.

1037
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,160
Now, the other half that-

1038
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,920
You got to go there.

1039
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,360
It'll either happen or it won't happen.

1040
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,960
If it happens, it'll make world news.

1041
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,840
But again, who knows?

1042
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,400
Who knows?

1043
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,760
This is a tough nut to crack.

1044
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,200
But it's like, I'm not going to, I don't just give up on things.

1045
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,560
Case in point, look at Calvine.

1046
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,880
I mean, I was chasing that down for 20 plus years.

1047
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,520
I didn't let it go.

1048
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,000
And it's great too, because other people like David Clark is amazing.

1049
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
We wouldn't be talking about Calvine if it wasn't for him.

1050
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,800
But I never took my eye off that case.

1051
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,960
And as soon as I read that first article, I was like, oh my gosh, I got to go to Scotland.

1052
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,800
I got to cover that because it's amazing.

1053
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,640
And new developments are constantly happening.

1054
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,800
We put in the movie, the program, if you have any information on this case,

1055
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,000
it's the same thing for Varginha.

1056
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,840
All these cases, I mean, people are starting to come out of the woodwork

1057
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,760
and people are starting to feel a little safer.

1058
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
We're living in an unprecedented time.

1059
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,760
Right now, witnesses are starting to feel a little more comfortable.

1060
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,840
It's more, I say mainstream, but it's more acceptable to be talking about these things.

1061
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,480
I'd like to find the pilot who was flying that Harrier jet, duh.

1062
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,040
You think he got film footage of it?

1063
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,360
Yeah, I'm sure he did.

1064
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,560
Yeah, he also got a visit.

1065
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,440
He probably got a visit too, but he flew all around.

1066
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,760
And I was told that because if you look at that photograph,

1067
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,880
you've got that perfect diamond or disc, right?

1068
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,840
And I was talking to Craig Lindsay, the RAF press officer.

1069
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,320
And I was like, what do those other five pictures look like?

1070
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,000
And he goes, James, he goes, they were so shocked.

1071
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,280
The witnesses were so scared when this thing was hovered in the air.

1072
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,440
They didn't know what the hell was going on.

1073
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,600
And they only got the courage up when the military jet came in.

1074
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,840
And what the military jet did, according to Craig Lindsay, who interviewed them

1075
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,320
and saw all the other prints, is that they took the camera up from one of the bushes

1076
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,960
and they snapped five or six pictures as the military jet did a complete pass

1077
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,760
all the way around this disc, right?

1078
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,800
So whoever was flying that Harrier jet got a really good view.

1079
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,600
Best view.

1080
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,800
Got the best view of it.

1081
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,920
Flew right towards it and then flew around it and then went back.

1082
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,040
So where's that radar data?

1083
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,520
Where's the visual, like, gun cam footage?

1084
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,400
Like, whoa, this case is just getting going here.

1085
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,320
That's some Independence Day stuff right there.

1086
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,080
Let's just say that he was in his 30s.

1087
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,400
Because most fighter pilots are pretty young, right?

1088
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,880
So let's just say he was in his, let's say he was 35.

1089
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,960
Okay, so what was it?

1090
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,920
How long ago was that case?

1091
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,200
34 years?

1092
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,840
He'd be 65?

1093
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,480
Yeah.

1094
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,400
So let's say he's probably between 65 and 75.

1095
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,600
That's pretty comfortable.

1096
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,960
So you know what?

1097
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,480
And they're usually pretty healthy.

1098
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,280
Still time.

1099
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,040
So he's probably, he's out there.

1100
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,200
And if you are out there and you're listening to this, please get in touch with us.

1101
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,800
It's something I'm learning from you as like a content creator,

1102
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,840
as like a pseudo-documentarian myself.

1103
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,360
I'm learning the tenacity that you have is just really important for this field.

1104
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,840
Because as someone who's used to, in the past, really churning out content,

1105
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,080
and sort of like the second I press upload is the second I need to forget about it

1106
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,600
and focus on the next thing, right?

1107
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,520
So I have to reprogram myself to stick with something

1108
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,720
and not just go with the immediate thing and post it.

1109
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,240
I got to sit on things.

1110
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,440
I got to do my homework and go there and take my time.

1111
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,120
And I want to thank you for teaching me that.

1112
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,600
That's a really, really valuable lesson for me.

1113
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,880
And sometimes it's okay.

1114
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,000
When I did Out of the Blue, and I don't know if I told you this,

1115
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,680
but I was like, you know, when is a project ever done, right?

1116
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,960
Usually you're out of money, you're out of steam, you're exhausted.

1117
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,920
Usually it's out of money.

1118
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,000
But I remember we were probably four years into Out of the Blue,

1119
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,480
maybe three, had a screening.

1120
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,840
I'm watching people fidget.

1121
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,400
That's bad.

1122
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,840
Look at their watches, checking out their phones, tying their shoelaces.

1123
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:32,880
Screening.

1124
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,920
Oh, yeah.

1125
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,560
Not good.

1126
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,560
And they all left and they kind of patted me on the shoulder.

1127
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,520
Hey, nice job, James.

1128
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,720
I knew what, yeah, the film was not ready for prime time.

1129
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,160
So I went back at it for like,

1130
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,560
and I remember I fell into this really dark place.

1131
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,280
Like, oh, like it's so depressing.

1132
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,520
It's like, oh, you feel like you're just climbing this mountain.

1133
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,560
It's never going to end.

1134
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,040
I'm in a ring with a monster and I'm trying to figure out

1135
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,400
how to win the next round, right?

1136
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,360
And I sank down to the couch after the screening

1137
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,320
and I got really depressed and I slept with my clothes on at my dad's house.

1138
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,720
Then I woke up the next morning and I was like,

1139
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,880
pick myself up at the bootstraps, I'm going back at it.

1140
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,040
So I spent two more years on Out of the Blue.

1141
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,880
It was a lot better.

1142
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,880
I got it to a much better place, but it still wasn't quite where I wanted it to be.

1143
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,600
But I remember my partner, Boris, and his wife is yelling at me that

1144
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,440
he was in a fetal position crying because we were pushing each other so hard and we were broke.

1145
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,920
And she's like, you're killing my husband.

1146
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,480
She was really angry with me, looking at me like I'm the devil.

1147
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,040
So I was like, okay, I better release this movie.

1148
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:31,760
But I released it.

1149
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,960
In the back of my mind, I was like, that movie's not done.

1150
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,160
And then I got a letter in the mail three years later.

1151
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,360
I sold it to NBC Universal and they were like, Mr. Fox just wanted to inform you.

1152
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,320
We decided not to renew our broadcast option.

1153
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,160
I was like, yes, I own it again.

1154
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,080
So I got it back and then I went back at it for two more years like that.

1155
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,400
Wow.

1156
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,000
And it still wasn't quite what I wanted it to be, but it was a lot better.

1157
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,320
And then I tried it again with I know what I saw,

1158
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,520
sold I know what I saw, it was a two-hour special to the History Channel.

1159
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:04,880
Again, broke, so broke, I could barely even afford to pay attention when I finished that movie.

1160
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:12,320
I was so broke and I remember I was, my credit card was maxed out and I had like a $70,000 credit

1161
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,800
card debt and I was so like barely making that monthly payment, right?

1162
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,800
And I mean, barely making it by the skin of my teeth and I was like two days late

1163
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,480
and they jacked up my interest rate to double or triple whatever it was.

1164
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:24,880
Yikes.

1165
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,840
And I called the company and I was like, you guys, what are you doing?

1166
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,440
Are you trying to force me to like go belly up on this?

1167
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,800
I was like default on my loan.

1168
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,200
I said, I was barely making the payment at that rate and now you just triple,

1169
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,720
you know, so this was all going on.

1170
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,600
Kicking you while you're down.

1171
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:42,880
Yeah.

1172
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,600
Anyway, so I got the, I got, yeah, kicking you while you're down.

1173
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,960
And like, so I got, I got the, I know what I saw sold in the back of my mind.

1174
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,960
I was like, it's not what I wanted it to be, you know?

1175
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,320
You've always had that.

1176
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,600
You've always had that, I'm not done with this.

1177
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,880
I was not satisfied.

1178
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,960
It just wasn't like, you know, you have a concept in your mind is something that you do,

1179
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:05,040
whether it's a painting or maybe a studio space or maybe just whatever project it is,

1180
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,320
you know, when you have that, you have the vision, you know,

1181
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,120
and you just let, you set out to make that happen to,

1182
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,000
and sometimes it aligns with the vision and sometimes it doesn't.

1183
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,760
And in my case, it kept not.

1184
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,920
And I was like, God, I went through my twenties and I went through my thirties

1185
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,200
and I hit 40 and I was like, oh my gosh.

1186
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,840
I took a couple of years off UFOs and I did a film on the BP oil spill.

1187
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,160
I just stepped, you just needed a break.

1188
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,280
And then when I hit 43, I was like, all right, I'm going at it one more time.

1189
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,560
And that's when I did the phenomenon.

1190
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,840
I did eight years.

1191
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,840
And that is like arguably.

1192
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,120
Eight years.

1193
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,600
Possibly the best documentary out there on the subject.

1194
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,760
So it's, I mean, that's, and you know,

1195
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,760
And that, that was the first time I went.

1196
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:46,880
Did it.

1197
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,560
This is it.

1198
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:49,760
Yes.

1199
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,800
You can feel it though.

1200
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,480
Watching that, like, I mean, it's, it's perfect.

1201
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,360
I didn't watch it for two years after I finished it.

1202
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,800
Because you were just sick of seeing the footage.

1203
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,560
Excuse me.

1204
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,360
It was so traumatic getting that film across the finishing line.

1205
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,720
And then right when I finished it, we were going to have for the first time

1206
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,680
in my whole career, we're going to have a theatrical release

1207
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,680
and the ink had barely dried on the contracts.

1208
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,760
And then COVID's coming, right?

1209
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,560
Right now.

1210
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,880
And I was like, no, like, no.

1211
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,480
And I remember my sister called me and she goes, she was kind of crying.

1212
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,600
We both were kind of crying.

1213
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,160
And she's like, it took a global pandemic to stop.

1214
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,560
Yeah.

1215
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,280
Anyway, sorry.

1216
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,840
I'm rambling.

1217
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:34,400
No, I mean, it's fascinating to hear because, you know, we don't get to hear this normally.

1218
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,600
We get to see the final product and as someone who's creative,

1219
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,280
my final product is constantly out there

1220
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,600
and people don't really understand the work that goes behind it.

1221
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:46,400
And not only the work, the emotional sort of ups and downs

1222
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,920
that you have to put aside to get the work done.

1223
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,800
And that weighs heavy when the project ends

1224
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,880
because now you have to deal with all that compartmentalized baggage

1225
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,800
that you've been putting away and it just hits you like a truck.

1226
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,280
And then you've got to somehow pick yourself up and do it again.

1227
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,800
And so it, you know, as a creator myself, it's commendable.

1228
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,560
I take my hat off to you.

1229
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,880
It's definitely something that isn't easy

1230
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,560
and, you know, on top of traveling and everything else.

1231
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,520
And, you know, there's just so many factors that go into making

1232
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,600
such a monumental project and it doesn't go unnoticed.

1233
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,320
I want you to know that.

1234
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,360
Oh, thank you.

1235
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,120
My son, who you've met.

1236
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,640
Because, you know, he was born, when all he was born,

1237
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,120
I didn't even have a bank account because I know what I saw.

1238
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,480
Some tax issues happened.

1239
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,400
It was horrible and I fought it.

1240
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,960
But long story short, I remember like,

1241
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,160
I got a check for like 1500 bucks and I was so stoked.

1242
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,160
I put it in my account and I went to go get the money the next day

1243
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,920
to pay off my phone bill and all this other stuff.

1244
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,600
And the woman, the teller was like, sir, you're zero balance.

1245
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,280
I said, zero balance.

1246
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,800
I said, I made a deposit last time.

1247
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,160
I got to be at zero balance.

1248
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,360
She's like, well, you made a withdrawal.

1249
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,200
I said, I didn't make a withdrawal.

1250
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,880
Anyway, so there's like three year period

1251
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,000
where I didn't have a bank account.

1252
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,480
I remember I was making the phenomenon and people were like,

1253
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,680
dude, you can't make a move.

1254
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,560
You don't have a bank account?

1255
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,360
What are you talking about?

1256
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,000
Bank account?

1257
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,560
That's insane.

1258
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,000
How do you not have a bank account?

1259
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,880
What is wrong with you?

1260
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,920
You know, I was like, look, man, it is what it is.

1261
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,520
I'm just getting through it.

1262
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,640
I'm doing the best I can.

1263
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,440
I'm relaxed.

1264
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,560
Yeah, I swear to God.

1265
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,080
There were people over where you were.

1266
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:22,960
That's 10 years ago?

1267
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,600
Like, what is that?

1268
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,800
A little over 10 years ago, yeah.

1269
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,440
Oh my gosh.

1270
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,640
Yeah, isn't that crazy?

1271
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,680
That is crazy.

1272
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,180
Yeah.

1273
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,760
All right, I got a few other questions here I want to get to

1274
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,240
before we get into some like-

1275
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,520
My favorite color is blue.

1276
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,020
Okay.

1277
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,760
Midnight blue.

1278
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,680
I wanted to talk about, a little bit about,

1279
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,960
we touched on this earlier and you touched on it with the men in black,

1280
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,920
how you were kind of uncomfortable with the term men in black because it's a little cliche.

1281
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,520
Aside from that, what is one sort of mischaracterization or one misconception

1282
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:03,360
within the public's view of the phenomenon or of UFOs that you would like to erase?

1283
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,120
That if you could think of it, like I just erase it from people's minds.

1284
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:07,840
Couple.

1285
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,960
What, one right off the top?

1286
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,800
Why does it always happen in the desert or in the United States?

1287
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,360
Yeah.

1288
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:22,560
Let's see, I cover a case in Australia, Africa, South America, Chile, like England.

1289
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,520
Russia?

1290
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:31,120
Russia, China, like, you know, Canada, Alaska, across the United States.

1291
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,280
This is a global phenomenon.

1292
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,560
That's one thing for sure.

1293
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:41,920
Second thing is, people think that the witnesses are just looking for a limelight.

1294
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:47,680
If people had a behind the scenes look at what it took for us to make a moment of contact and

1295
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:54,320
to get those people to come forward, we worked on them for years, years, just to find them.

1296
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,360
And then we'd meet with them and they're like, how did you find me?

1297
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,760
How did you know I was involved with that?

1298
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,600
I now don't care how much money you offer me.

1299
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,880
It's never going to happen.

1300
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,480
I'm never coming forward.

1301
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,200
And we'd work on them and work on them and work on them and work on them.

1302
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,600
And then some of them were like, you know, at the end of the day,

1303
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:14,640
it was like, we're going to get an anonymous, you know, get them to appear anonymously.

1304
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,680
It's the better the witness, the more compelling the case, the less likely

1305
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,600
the people are ever going to want to come forward.

1306
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,800
That's just a fact.

1307
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,640
And that's me in the field.

1308
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,440
Wow.

1309
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,120
Is there any, has there ever been a moment where it's just like slipped out of your hands?

1310
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,680
Or something that you, you were so close and it was like a big thing.

1311
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,320
Yeah.

1312
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,320
What's one of those things that like slipped out of your hands?

1313
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,160
The footage, the alien footage.

1314
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:36,880
Of Virginia?

1315
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,280
Yes.

1316
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,000
You were that close?

1317
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,840
We had a, we had a hard drive in our hands.

1318
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,840
You had a hard drive in your hands.

1319
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,720
Are you kidding me?

1320
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,280
Not kidding you.

1321
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,800
But you didn't see the footage.

1322
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,240
No, no.

1323
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,000
You had the footage in your hands.

1324
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,600
See how I can talk about this.

1325
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,080
Holy.

1326
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,680
Well, okay.

1327
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,520
So I just want to, I want to talk about this without revealing the detail because we're going back.

1328
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:07,680
We found, we talked to a number of doctors face-to-face that saw the footage, okay?

1329
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:13,840
And not only saw the footage, but knew, were friends with the individual who took the footage.

1330
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,440
And this is just one in particular.

1331
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,880
That was on the medical side.

1332
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,600
That was on the, on the, on the, on the doctor's side.

1333
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:26,080
And he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he,

1334
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,240
in the humanitarian hospital.

1335
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,520
So we located, we went, excuse me.

1336
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,160
We went after the individual.

1337
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,080
Unfortunately, the individual had died.

1338
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,120
A horseback riding or something.

1339
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:43,520
I don't know.

1340
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,640
Something happened.

1341
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,200
So we went to the, this was all spanning over probably a two year period, maybe a little longer.

1342
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,200
We went to the individual's house and talked to the wife.

1343
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,240
And the wife was somewhat dismissive initially.

1344
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:02,960
But then we went back with testimony from the other fellow doctors, talked about it.

1345
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:14,640
And the wife was talking to our, my partner, Marco Leal, like, like the room was bugged.

1346
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,240
And was like, I don't know.

1347
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1348
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,920
I don't know what you mean.

1349
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,840
Reaches down and grabs a hard drive.

1350
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,640
I don't know.

1351
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,840
I'm not sure why.

1352
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,000
No, there's nothing here.

1353
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,680
Gives the hard drive to Marco.

1354
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,640
Now he's got the hard drive.

1355
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,240
What shape was it?

1356
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:32,800
Is it a USB?

1357
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:38,320
Just an old, old, like, like probably a 20 year old hard drive, maybe 15, 20 year old hard drive.

1358
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,640
And, and, but so we're like, oh my God.

1359
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:49,040
So, you know, we're hours outside of Sao Paulo and he's driving around and I'm like, dude,

1360
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,360
you need to, you need to get to someplace secure and back that thing up immediately.

1361
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,240
And I was like, you're driving around for four days in the area.

1362
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,160
No, like this could be the biggest, so this is happening.

1363
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:05,440
And so it's encrypted and we're trying to get it like we, nobody could do it in that area.

1364
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,800
So we took the drive back to Sao Paulo and we're having like high level technicians

1365
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,480
costing a lot of money, like the salaries for, for a lot of people for a whole month

1366
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,920
just to get, do a deep dive in the drive and da, da, da, da, da.

1367
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,880
We were pretty convinced that we had it because we knew, we knew beyond a shadow of doubt that this

1368
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,200
guy is the one that shot it according to all the other doctors that we talked to and all the other

1369
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:32,880
doctors that knew him and all the other doctors that saw it, that saw the footage and described

1370
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:40,400
it. And so we were overwhelmed with excitement, as you can imagine, got the whole thing encrypted

1371
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:48,320
and it wasn't there. So, but that let, we thought we had it. We really did. We were, you know,

1372
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:56,960
so, but that led to other, there are other individuals that we need to go see that live

1373
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,000
a couple of hours away from where that happened. And so that we're quite convinced. So we know,

1374
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:08,720
we know according to all these doctors who shot it, who had it for sure. And then he had a heart

1375
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:13,760
attack and died suddenly. So that footage is somewhere. He didn't just throw that away. And

1376
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,440
we knew what format that footage, you know, anyway, so that was, then there was another

1377
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,400
individual, I can't release the name and the look, but it's an official individual who had a

1378
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,280
photograph and I had him describe to me what was seen in the photograph. And this is an official,

1379
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:34,320
this is not like a civilian. This is a, and we talked to this individual and it was like,

1380
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,960
one of the aliens was alive, one was dead and there were a number of

1381
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:45,120
firemen. And firemen as well as police officers are connected to the military in Brazil.

1382
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,240
So if you're working for the fire department, you're actually, you're actually a military

1383
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:54,160
personnel, right? You're the same thing for, for like radar control officers, you're still military.

1384
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:00,400
It's all firemen, military, police officer, military. And so we interviewed this individual

1385
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:09,200
and we talked to two people that he was friends with that he showed the photograph to. And then

1386
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:15,040
I spoke to the individual who allegedly has the photograph and got this individual to describe

1387
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:20,000
what the photograph showed. And we thought we were going to get it that day, but we didn't. But

1388
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,120
again, this is an ongoing thing, but who said there was one dead and one alive and that there

1389
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:30,320
were a number of firemen in the photograph posing with where they were in the background of the,

1390
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:35,600
yes. Yeah. Which, which aligns with some of the research that we'd done in terms of like

1391
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,560
how, cause there was, there were a couple of captures. There was, there was probably more

1392
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:46,720
than that. Maybe, maybe five or six, but we only really have two good solid leads on maybe two or

1393
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,840
three of the captures. One was with a military police officer, Marco Chirisi and the guy driving

1394
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:57,440
the car, Eric Lopes. And then there was another capture from the fire department with a net.

1395
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,840
With, with like the, like a noose almost. Like catching wild animals. Yeah, they did that.

1396
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:06,080
And we talked to one of the individuals that was involved with that operation. And then there was

1397
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:11,040
another one that might've, that the entity might've been shot. Cause we heard people in the town

1398
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:15,760
describe a gunshot go off and then something was carried out of the, of the forested area.

1399
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,880
So that was like three, I think we reported on two, maybe we reported on three in moment of contact,

1400
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,040
but there was some evidence from some of the research we talked to indirectly, this guy,

1401
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:31,200
Uberajan Rodriguez and Peccaccini, that there were up to five entities that were, that were captured.

1402
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,640
But again, I don't know. We only had to solve the lead on two or three of them.

1403
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,360
At what point- One of them was alive.

1404
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:44,560
Yeah. That's, I mean, that is, that is disturbing. At what point in the investigation or in your

1405
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:49,680
documentary, did you, were you close to this information? Was this towards the end or was

1406
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:56,080
this like in the heart of it? Closer to the end. So back in like 2013,

1407
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,680
and I can talk openly about this now, and I have talked about it in the past, but this is like,

1408
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:04,960
you know, a lot of people wonder like, what keeps you going on a 12, 13, 14 year investigation on

1409
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,520
something, right? Because let's just face it, whether you believe a UFO crash and live aliens

1410
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,960
were captured, I totally understand your ambivalence to believe that because it's,

1411
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:19,520
it's a big story. And, you know, but I ask your audience if you can suspend judgment,

1412
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,200
imagine for a moment that it did happen. You know, it's a very significant event, right?

1413
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,920
So, but sometimes you doubt yourself, like particularly early on, like when I first

1414
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,720
heard about the case, I was like, there's no way that happened. There's no way live aliens

1415
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,160
walked around the town of Virginia and the whole world not know. It's impossible.

1416
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:34,880
You dismissed it.

1417
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,720
I dismissed it for 10 years. Didn't even look into it.

1418
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,720
Being someone who, who, who has already done documentaries on UFOs, you dismissed it.

1419
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,280
Absolutely.

1420
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,200
Okay. So you can understand how a skeptic might.

1421
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:51,520
Absolutely. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. So I started looking into it maybe 2011. And in 2013,

1422
01:05:51,520 --> 01:06:01,120
I got an interview with Marco Leal with a Air Force general by the name of Jose Carlos Pereira.

1423
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:07,040
Yeah. Jose Carlos Pereira, Air Force Brazilian general. Excuse me. Sat down to interview,

1424
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:11,120
and there are a lot of cases, you know, Calaris that happened in the seventies.

1425
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:18,000
There's the nights of UFOs over Brazil in 1986, massive oversight, scrambled military jets and

1426
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,400
press conference. A lot of great cases. And he's like, I could talk about this case, that case.

1427
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,320
You talk about Virginia, this interview is terminated. Goodbye. And I was like, what,

1428
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:34,000
really? And he was very serious. Like, you know, and I, well, I had an Air Force, Brazilian Air

1429
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,520
Force guy sitting down with us. I wasn't going to like jeopardize. So we didn't talk about Virginia.

1430
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,280
And then we rolled camera forever. How long we interviewed, hour and a half, whatever it was.

1431
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,960
And at the end, shut all the equipment off, all the audio. And I walked up to him and I

1432
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,560
looked him in the eyes. I looked into his soul. And I was like, please. And Marco was sitting

1433
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:59,280
there right there with me. I said, I said, please. I said, I promise you on my life,

1434
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,160
there was no camera, audio, nothing rolling. This is between you and me right here, right now.

1435
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,920
Tell me about Virginia. And I'm looking in the eyes and he's like, preparing to leave. And he's

1436
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,680
got a driver waiting for him. And Marco's doing the same thing. I was practically like fucking

1437
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:19,040
licking the guy's boots. I mean, I'd never looked so deeply into someone's soul before. I wanted to

1438
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:24,480
know so badly. So he didn't say anything. He didn't respond. We followed him all the way back to the

1439
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:30,640
car. Marco was right there with me. He gets in the car, the door's still open in the back seat.

1440
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:35,520
The driver's sitting there waiting, the engine's running. And he looks up at Marco and he goes,

1441
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:43,520
it happened. Closed the door and off he went. I was like, fuck. Marco and I both were like,

1442
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:52,240
and I tell you like that kept us going. That was like that, that reignited our, our flame.

1443
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:58,720
You know what I mean? Yeah. Why would he say that to us? Yeah. No reason. No reason, man.

1444
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:04,400
And then he died a couple of years later. But that was like, you know, can I share that publicly?

1445
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:08,160
And people go, yeah, sure. Whatever. It's just a rumor. Yeah, I get it. I totally get it. And I

1446
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:13,680
don't expect anyone to even believe that that happened. But it happened to me and Marco.

1447
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:18,560
And that kept us going for another 10 years. That's one of my, one of my next questions,

1448
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,920
actually. Have you ever come close to abandoning something and then what kept you going?

1449
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:29,440
There you go. That is, that, I mean, that is like, you know, I have, I have this question I ask to

1450
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,240
people a lot. And I think this might be the answer to that, but I'm going to ask it anyways. But

1451
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:43,200
is there a moment or, and not, not the first moment, but a moment where you tell yourself,

1452
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:52,160
This changes everything. Yeah. I mean, so I did this thing on Reddit recently,

1453
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:56,880
and it was basically the first time this woman, Andrea, put it on. I met her at the Soul Foundation

1454
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:02,480
and she's like, Hey, I run this like community thing at Reddit and I want to do this thing. It's

1455
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:06,400
never been done before. I want to get all the various platforms and communities and Reddit to

1456
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:11,600
all coalesce and get together and put together as one event and be supportive. And she did.

1457
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,560
She goes, can you get a couple of people that were part of the task force, part of the

1458
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:22,720
government investigation? I was like, okay, my two primary targets was Lenval Logan and this guy,

1459
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:29,760
Kirk McConnell. And Kirk McConnell investigated, never really prior, he had 37 years experience

1460
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:33,600
center arm services, a number of other things. You can look them up, but he really put a laser

1461
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:43,520
like focus on UFOs from 2017 to 2024. And he, I'll get to the relevance in this a minute. He had

1462
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:49,040
the distinct opportunity to sit down with so-called firsthand witnesses. Now everyone's talking about

1463
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:53,760
the fact they want firsthand witnesses and I get it. After David Grush testified under oath that

1464
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:59,280
we have crash retrieval program, we got people working on technology, we got biologics, as he

1465
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:04,480
put it. Everybody wants those first-handers. Well, according to McConnell, I think it was like

1466
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:09,760
somewhere between eight and 12 firsthand people have testified, like had meetings in a skiff behind

1467
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,800
closed doors, right? First-handers, the ones that we all want to see in open congressional.

1468
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,080
The ones in the program.

1469
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:23,920
Yes. And so we had this Reddit thing and they were like, okay, so James, you're going to be on and

1470
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,200
you're going to have Lenval Logan. And then we have Kirk McConnell. Kirk was a very busy guy.

1471
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,560
We're probably going to just focus primarily on him for the first hour. And then we'll switch

1472
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,400
over to Lenval Logan of Lenwell. Logan wants to stick with you for the second hour. Great.

1473
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,680
But we're going to do like Kirk, then we're going to do Lenval Logan, and then we're going to do

1474
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,800
you. And I was like, I'm far less important. These guys should. So anyway, so we start talking

1475
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:51,040
and there were people asking him questions. And then I had this little chat where they said,

1476
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:56,640
if something pops up during this three-hour thing, you can message us. And so I said,

1477
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,320
I got a question because I hadn't thought about this one. And I said,

1478
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:12,240
you claim that you were sitting in a skiff with members of the Senate. I'm guessing Rubio and

1479
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:18,480
Rounds and Schumer. And that you guys met with first-hand witnesses, people that are directly

1480
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:24,560
involved with the program that are working on alien technology, shit like that. I said,

1481
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:33,600
can you describe what it was like to sit in that room and listen to someone that you believe was

1482
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,920
directly working on alien technology? Can you put me in that fucking room, please?

1483
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:46,160
Describe the atmosphere. What was it like? Did you look in the eyes of the senators? And he was like,

1484
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:51,920
wow. And then he put us in that room. It's all on tape. You can look it up on the Reddit. I've

1485
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:58,560
actually put it on my ex as well. I highly advise. I'll put a clip of it here, but go

1486
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:04,320
watch this in its entirety. At James C. Fox on ex, formerly known as Twitter, and go watch that

1487
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,800
damn thing. Because my God, that's one of those moments. Can you put us in the room and tell us

1488
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:16,880
what the atmosphere felt like? It's a tough thing to get your mind around. And to be confronted

1489
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:26,480
with it, you know, coming from another person whom you find credible based on their credentials

1490
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:36,320
and their clearances and their background and all that. You know, it certainly makes it hard to go

1491
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:43,120
to sleep at night, you know, for a good while. What did the senators, do they have a sort of

1492
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:52,240
slack jawed appearance as well? Or was it just? No, I mean, I don't think any of us fell on the

1493
01:12:52,240 --> 01:13:02,480
floor, you know, in anguish or anything. But it was very serious, very serious and very sobering.

1494
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,160
And there was, you know, just

1495
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:15,040
wrapped attention to what was being said and trying to absorb it. But,

1496
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:22,960
yeah, you know, they would take this information on board.

1497
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,320
Did you get the impression that these individuals were scared?

1498
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:41,440
Well, it varied. Certainly, some, in some instances, I mean, some people, there was

1499
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:53,120
real fear. Yes, there was real, real anxiety about speaking about what, you know, speaking out what

1500
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,560
they had to say. Yeah. For their careers. It was very disturbing to them. Yeah.

1501
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:04,560
Very disturbing to them. Yeah. And I asked him, what was it like afterwards? He was like,

1502
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:11,840
I had a hard time coming home and like processing, wrapping my mind around. Oh my God, this changes

1503
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:19,040
everything. And when I was investigating the Vargenia case, I swear to God, I looked,

1504
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:25,840
I'm 99.9% sure that I looked directly into the eyes of a gentleman who drove an alien around.

1505
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:32,560
I'm like, how do you process that? I was looking into his eyes for an hour and a half. Okay. I

1506
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:38,960
could see the intensity of it all. We tracked him down. And this individual had given an on-camera

1507
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,720
statement right after it happened with a number of firsthand people that were involved with the

1508
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:47,440
incident as an insurance policy that if anything happened to them, and all the researchers within

1509
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:53,600
the area knew there were 15, 20 copies of those tapes made back in 1996, that if anything happened

1510
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,880
to those witnesses, that was going to be released to the general public. That was their insurance

1511
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:03,920
policy. So we'd seen that footage. I couldn't use it, but I'd seen it. And it's wow. But my point

1512
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:10,400
is this, is that Kurt was describing the impact that that had on him. You know, that reality,

1513
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:15,760
it's like a distortion of reality. Like everything's not as it seems, right? This changes

1514
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:22,080
everything. And when I would come home from a month at a time investigating and I'm knocking

1515
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,920
on doors, meeting with witnesses, doctors, military guys, firemen, like people that drove the, I mean,

1516
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:33,840
we were digging into this damn case. I wanted to know so bad. And I'd come home

1517
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:41,120
and I couldn't really talk about it because I started, like, as soon as I started talking

1518
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:48,160
about it, people just look at me like I'd lost my mind. Right? And I remember the last time I went,

1519
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:53,680
I got back and I had CNN at my house with Leslie Kane. And I'd just gotten back from my last trip

1520
01:15:53,680 --> 01:16:00,160
and shot the whole movie. Excuse me. And they were like, Oh my God, you just got back from Brazil.

1521
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:06,000
It's incredible. Oh my gosh. Tell us about your trip. What happened? I love the smoothies and the

1522
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,600
coffees over there. It's an incredible place, isn't it? Did you go to Rio? What about that part

1523
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,920
of Chile, those islands off the coast? And I'm sitting there going, I think I looked into the

1524
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:21,040
face of a guy who drove an alien around and a UFO crashed and live aliens were walking through the

1525
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,920
town and they were captured. The Americans came in and got this stuff. And I was like,

1526
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,080
yeah, no, I'm not going to talk about any of it. They were like,

1527
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:36,240
you have the perfect opportunity. We're doing a profile on you. No, no, we'll wait till the movie

1528
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:41,520
comes out because you're going to look at me like I need to up the dosage of whatever medication

1529
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:47,520
I'm not on right now. That's seriously like, but I guess what I'm trying to get at is that you come

1530
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:54,160
back from these experiences and your reality is so distorted. You're like, it's a post-traumatic

1531
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:58,720
experience. It's a post-traumatic experience and Kirk had the same damn thing. Kirk and I had talked

1532
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:02,800
about that comparing notes. He would come back, he would try to tell certain things to his wife

1533
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,720
and his wife's looking at him like, honey, have you lost it? Are you okay? That's how profound

1534
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:14,720
experiences are because not only do they affect experiencers, they affect those

1535
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:21,920
who talk to experiencers. That's how profound that is. I mean, that's incredible that it had

1536
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:30,880
that effect on a secondhand witness. This is insane. I'm getting that feeling just talking

1537
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:39,760
to you. I'm three people removed from this guy now, but I'm still enthralled and I'm projecting

1538
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,400
my own self there and how would I feel and what would I do and how do I feel about this now?

1539
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,920
It's seismic.

1540
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:02,400
I remember talking to various composers. I go to great lengths to put, I don't do canned music

1541
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:10,720
for my films. I spent a lot on the score and I remember describing to a couple of different

1542
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:18,720
composers, Matteo and this guy, Chris Hoag, he's an amazing guy. I say, just imagine, you guys,

1543
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:28,880
imagine taking the cloth of reality and just tearing it right apart. I want the audience to

1544
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:34,800
be where that individual was when they made face-to-face contact allegedly with this alien

1545
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:43,120
creature. I want it to be the most unfamiliar feeling of intensity and mystery and intrigue.

1546
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:52,880
I say alien as outside of our world in the sense that it's so foreign you don't even know what

1547
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,880
you're looking at. You don't even know how to process what you're looking at.

1548
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:03,920
Put me there. Put me there with that score. In particular, I remember when the children had

1549
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:13,360
face-to-face contact in Rua Zimbabwe or when the children had face-to-face contact. When

1550
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:18,240
you made eye contact with that creature, god damn it, I want to be there. What did it feel like?

1551
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:22,320
What kind of communication took place? Did communication take place? Did time stop?

1552
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,800
Could you hear anything? And you want the audience to feel that. Did you feel? Yes,

1553
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:33,120
I want the audience to feel that. I want to feel that. I want to be there. That experience is so

1554
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:41,440
profound. So I always remember, take reality and just rip it all apart. And I want to feel so,

1555
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:50,560
just recreate that if you can. And it has to be with very unfamiliar sounds and things

1556
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:57,840
that just don't make any sense. Love that. Right? Yeah, it's unsettling.

1557
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:06,320
Yeah. It's unfamiliar. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And we talked about this a little bit, but

1558
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:14,000
there had to have been times where there was information that was just maybe too controversial

1559
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:22,080
or risky to include. Did you ever encounter any of those, any of such periods of conversation that

1560
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:29,120
you were just like, this is, I can't like, or? Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1561
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:36,320
How about in the program? Was there anything there that you had to leave out?

1562
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:42,560
Oh, lots of stuff I had to leave out. Like, I mean, for reasons of-

1563
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,880
Classifications, yeah. Yeah. Really?

1564
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,920
Oh yeah. Yeah. Everybody, like particularly the Intel folks had to approve everything.

1565
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:56,240
And some even had to get, I'm trying to remember the acronym, DOPSR. But it's basically a

1566
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:02,640
pre-publication approval. And I believe that everybody had to do that. A lot of the people

1567
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:07,440
that I interviewed had to do that. And in one instance, I had to end up at the last minute,

1568
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,200
I had to delete a certain word that was mentioned in the film. And then you'll see it

1569
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:18,880
beeped out. And there's also controversy. Yeah. I mean, we know what the word is though.

1570
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,960
Yeah. Yeah. It's Area 51. Yeah. But it had to be bleeped out. I had to do that.

1571
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,800
That's so strange. Yeah. Well, that's, I mean, that's a good compromise though.

1572
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,280
Yeah. Like where they're like, just bleep it out. You're like, but you don't even,

1573
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,440
but you can see him saying- Area 50.

1574
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:34,960
Yeah. Pretty much like, oh, I wonder what he's talking about.

1575
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,240
I don't even read lips. And I was like, I don't know. I know exactly what he-

1576
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:42,000
Oh my gosh. And then you just lay the image of the Google Maps right over it. And I'm like,

1577
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,800
oh, that's cute. That's cute that they asked him to-

1578
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,640
So funny. Yeah. Interesting. But there has been times where like,

1579
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,200
has it ever bummed you out? Where you're like, really?

1580
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,000
So I just got some information on crash retrieval stuff recently that was like,

1581
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:04,800
wow. And so I asked this individual that I trusted and I went after this individual. This individual

1582
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,280
did not come to me. I had known about this individual and I was for a long time. No, no,

1583
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:16,400
no, no, no, no. And then finally we got, and this individual shared some fucking wow stuff with me.

1584
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:23,120
So I said, hey, I'm about to do this whole circuit of interviews. Every time my films come out,

1585
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,800
I'll go the rounds and do the podcasts and the radio interviews. Obviously spread the

1586
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,280
word for my movie. Can I just say I heard it somewhere? No, no, no, no.

1587
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,280
Not even. Not even anecdotal.

1588
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,960
Nope. Very adamant about that. No, they'll know.

1589
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:37,920
They'll know it was him.

1590
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,360
Yes. Or her.

1591
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,040
Or her. I'm trying. I don't know it was them.

1592
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:49,840
Yeah, isn't that funny? And it's so funny too because like.

1593
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:56,240
That's specific. So that's a really, that's an unknown piece of information.

1594
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:59,040
Yeah, date, location, incident.

1595
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,640
It's not like a broad sort of like, oh, we put it up on this type of trailer.

1596
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:08,960
Very specific. Yeah, very specific with the evidence, with the bodies, the craft.

1597
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:21,520
Yes. And it really jarred me. And I'm very open and I do documentaries. I'm on this personal

1598
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:26,000
journey where I'm just really curious and I keep wanting to get to the bottom of it. The more I dig,

1599
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,680
the more crazy it all kind of gets. I feel like I've been at it for 30 years now and I feel like

1600
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:37,680
almost dumber than I was 30 years ago in the sense that I have more questions today than I've ever

1601
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:42,880
had, right? That makes you wise, I think. But I'm sitting there going, what the hell is going on?

1602
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,440
And the one thing that I've really learned,

1603
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:53,680
just because something sounds really outlandish and really unbelievable, don't have that knee-jerk

1604
01:23:53,680 --> 01:24:00,000
response of just quick dismissal because I've had it my whole career. Rua Zimbabwe. I heard about

1605
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:10,880
Rua Zimbabwe through Steven Spielberg because I was making my first doc in the 90s, UFOs,

1606
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:16,240
50 Years of Denial. And we had a mutual friend, this woman, Janet Yang. And I was just naive enough

1607
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:20,960
to think I was in my 20s, like, I'm making a documentary on UFOs? Of course Spielberg's

1608
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,440
going to give me an interview. So I went through Janet Yang and she goes back, she goes, well,

1609
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,760
yeah, no, he's not going to meet with you. But he said, since you're doing a doc on UFOs,

1610
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,320
you should really look into this landing that happened in Africa at the school.

1611
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:39,120
And I was like, a landing happened at a school in broad daylight, and the aliens got out of

1612
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:47,120
their little spaceships and talked to the kids. Sure. And I didn't spend one second looking into

1613
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:55,680
it. Can you believe that? And then same thing with Varginha. I'd heard about Varginha. Well,

1614
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:01,440
the first time I heard about Varginha, I was mapping out out of the blue. And I had this

1615
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:08,240
partner, Tim Coleman, British guy, very smart. And Tim's like, I was like, bent waters, let's

1616
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:15,840
look into the March 13th, Phoenix lights. Let's look into these other various cases.

1617
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:28,080
And then he goes, oh, mate, this is absolutely amazing crash case. It took place in Brazil. I

1618
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,840
don't think he used the word Virginia at the time. It was in Brazil. And these bloody aliens

1619
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:36,640
are walking around in the town. And I looked at them like, and I thought to myself, I picked the

1620
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:43,280
wrong partner. Like this guy, this guy's a freak. He's lost his marbles. Like what was I thinking?

1621
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:49,680
He came across as really grounded, pragmatic, intelligent. And yet, and I had a really hard

1622
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:54,800
time even keeping him as a partner because I was so concerned about his mental state of health,

1623
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,720
that he wanted me to actually go investigate a case where live aliens are walking around.

1624
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:04,640
This guy's clearly lost his marbles. He's gone out way on the deep end. Didn't look into that

1625
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:10,560
case for at least 10 years. And then I remember the next time I heard about Varginha was 2011.

1626
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:18,160
So that would have been at least 11 years later, probably 12. And it was a guy, Jeff Zaganski,

1627
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:23,280
and you look him up, very high up in the food chain, the entertainment industry, like former

1628
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:31,360
head of Sony. And he's always been extremely helpful to me over the years. And there's a funny

1629
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:35,760
connection about that, which I could talk about in a minute. But he's like, I was going to Brazil. I

1630
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:40,320
got invited to go speak in Brazil at a conference. And he goes, oh, James, you're going to Brazil,

1631
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:45,360
fantastic. You look into the Varginha case. I was like, the what? The what case? You know,

1632
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:50,640
with the UFO crash and the live aliens. I was like, oh, God, not this again. So I told Jeff,

1633
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:54,560
I said, I had a lot of respect for him. And he was very helpful for me. And I wasn't going to

1634
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,960
burn that bridge. But I was like, sure, Jeff, yeah, I'll definitely look into that while I'm

1635
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,960
over there. Yeah, sure, click. Yeah, that ain't going to happen. And then I got to Brazil. And

1636
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:08,480
then I ended up meeting some witnesses, whatever. What was the guy? So I asked Jeff one time,

1637
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:13,120
this is interesting. And you're going to have to help me get the name of this guy, because I'm

1638
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:19,120
trying to remember he was in Smoking the Bandit. He was the pool shark that played Paul Newman.

1639
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:19,620
Yeah.

1640
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:30,080
You know, the guy I'm talking about. Come on, I know, right? So famous. Very famous. Yeah,

1641
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:34,560
everyone knows. And he'll come to us in a second. But he worked on a movie with him way back in the

1642
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:41,280
day. And he apparently pulled Jeff aside and said, Jackie Gleason, Jackie Gleason. And Jackie

1643
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:46,080
Gleason said to Jeff, according to Jeff told me this, I don't care what anybody ever tells you.

1644
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:51,120
I know for a fact that UFOs are real. And the government has definitive proof of that.

1645
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,080
And he told him that, but he didn't give him specifics. Like I was taken out by the president

1646
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:01,200
or whatever. But he said that to Jeff way back. Well, it might've been the 70s. Yeah, off the

1647
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:08,160
record. Yeah, just off the record. So you know, no matter what anybody tells you, no, 100%. I'm

1648
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:15,600
telling you 100%. Have you ever looked at a case and just felt in your gut that it was real,

1649
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,960
despite the lack of evidence recently? Has there been anything, despite there's lack of evidence,

1650
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:25,920
but has anything told you, man, this feels like it might've happened? Is there anything like that

1651
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,640
recently that's come across? Recently, recently, recently. Like in the last maybe 10 years,

1652
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:35,520
has there ever been something that you're like, there's not a lot here, but something tells me?

1653
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:43,680
Oh, hair is pretty good. Yeah, the airport sighting. 2006, I think that was. Yeah. That's

1654
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:48,000
pretty compelling. We don't have a photograph. A photograph was taken. Yeah, apparently. And

1655
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
it's out there somewhere. It's got to be more than one too. Oh, yeah, I'm sure. I imagine

1656
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:56,480
cameras. I mean, there's cameras everywhere. Yeah. And I was actually going to go investigate

1657
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:01,520
that case. I was doing pickup interviews for the time. It might've been out of the blue,

1658
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:09,920
but I think it eventually transitioned into, I know what I saw. And I was in Phoenix and it was

1659
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:17,920
late 2008, late 2008. I was in Phoenix and I was doing pickup interviews of that massive flyover.

1660
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:23,680
New witnesses were coming forward, willing to go on camera. Families that were on their lawn,

1661
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,920
lying on their backs, watching this boomerang-shaped craft. They said it was so big,

1662
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:33,200
it took minutes to pass over them, moving super slowly, analyzing the compartments of the metal.

1663
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,600
And I was doing follow-up interviews for that for a film I did, I know what I saw. And then I was

1664
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:42,960
going to go to O'Hare. And I was in touch with a couple of people, United Airlines, and they were

1665
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:50,480
maybe going to consider going on camera if I disguised their... But that was all I could get

1666
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:54,000
on it. But I was like, wow, this is really compelling. And then I got a phone call about

1667
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,120
a mass sighting that took place in Stephenville, Texas, Dublin, Stephenville. And so I canceled my

1668
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:03,840
trip to O'Hare, which would have been really cool because it only happened two years prior.

1669
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:10,240
And who knows? FAA is like, whew, close one. Who knows what I would have come up with,

1670
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:14,480
because I know that photograph exists. Who took the photograph? Where did that photograph go?

1671
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,920
I bet there's an MIB story behind that photograph. You know what I'm saying?

1672
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,760
They probably got in there.

1673
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:25,920
So I had a whole camera crew ready to go. So we jumped on a plane and went to Stephenville,

1674
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:31,920
Texas. It was amazing. And that was like, I mean, the whole time they had a town hall meeting. The

1675
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:37,760
town was all there. It was a big deal. And the night before, so I flew my crew to Stephenville,

1676
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:45,280
Texas and I flew to New York and I went on Larry King Live. And so about that case, and of course,

1677
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,760
I hadn't had boots on the ground yet. So I didn't really know what I was talking about,

1678
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:54,400
but I was like, you know, did exhibit a technology to, you know, it was massive and no air disturbance,

1679
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:59,280
ability to hover, I decided like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so when I arrived and that aired

1680
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:04,320
live, when I arrived like the next day or the day, yeah, it was probably the next day, 24 hours later.

1681
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,400
Oh, there's a little funny side note to that. I can tell you or not. But

1682
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,320
the whole town knew who I was, because I was on Larry King the night before. So I suddenly like

1683
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:19,600
arrived and they were like, Oh my God, you know, James Fox, I had access to everybody. Everybody

1684
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,680
wanted to meet, you know, and that's, that's, that's when I got to meet probably one of my best,

1685
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:28,960
one of the best witnesses ever. And that's Ricky Sorrell. To this day is one of the most compelling.

1686
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,880
A, he didn't want to come forward. It took me eight months to get him to finally go on camera.

1687
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:38,320
And he was one of the gun. He was one of the gun. He stood under the craft and he examined the metal

1688
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:42,560
of the craft through his scope. And he almost pulled the trigger to see if the bullet was going

1689
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,240
to ricochet off it or something. But he said it was a metal worker. And he's like, it didn't have

1690
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:53,040
any rivets or welds or folds. Like it was just like a mold. And then he talked about these recessed

1691
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:59,760
cones. I mean, Ricky Sorrell is one of the top witnesses. I mean, how many people do you know

1692
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,240
that stood under a UFO that was so big, he couldn't see the edge of it in any direction.

1693
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:08,080
He goes, you could have landed an airplane on that damn thing. That's a ceiling outside.

1694
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:13,520
And yeah. And when it took off, he said, had I blinked, I would have missed it. And it said,

1695
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,840
it went from a hover right above his head. And it went off at an angle like this. He goes,

1696
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:22,720
it didn't go like this. It just went like this. And I said, well, describe the speed. He goes,

1697
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,920
had I blinked, I would have missed it. Went from here to the stars in the blink of an eye.

1698
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:37,040
You know, I've seen no nuts, bolts, rivets, seams, no welds. None of this. It looked like

1699
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:45,920
a piece of sheet metal. You know, it wasn't shiny. It was a dull, I don't know what you call it,

1700
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:53,920
matte finish maybe. And this is what I had a hard time with, was if something was to leave,

1701
01:32:53,920 --> 01:33:00,320
in my mind, it should pivot up and go like an airplane would. This did not do that.

1702
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:08,320
This stayed completely flat. And it went at a 45 degree angle away. And it took off at such

1703
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:13,440
a high rate of speed that no one can describe it as if I would have blinked. I would have thought

1704
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:20,960
it just disappeared. Whoa. Great case. He got spooked too. He got very spooked. Very, very

1705
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:26,240
spooked. This is a common thread here in this interview. Big, tough Texan, armed to the teeth,

1706
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:30,320
and he was spooked. How did that happen? Well, there were a number of things that were happening

1707
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:34,560
to him at the time. And that's probably one of the reasons why he wouldn't... He met with me

1708
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,680
and he would tell me what happened. He took me to the forest. He took me to the exact location

1709
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:43,360
where it happened. I was like, oh my God, this guy's testimony is golden. Like, this is so rare

1710
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:50,160
that you get to talk to somebody who stood under a UFO and examined it with a scope. Like, whoa.

1711
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:54,560
I mean, you don't get that many moments in your entire 30-year career. I was like, this guy's

1712
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:02,000
amazing. And the military was flying over his... They had helicopters flying over his house all

1713
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,760
hours of the morning. He said he was running out in his underwear and his shotgun. They'd light

1714
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:10,240
him up like daylight, spotlight. He called the local air force base. He said, you guys gotta stop

1715
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:16,560
flying your helicopters over my house. And they said, that's our airspace. We'll do what the

1716
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:21,200
hell we want. And we suggest you stop talking about what you saw. That's what they said to him.

1717
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,720
And I talked to the police. I mean, that's a whole nother story. I don't know if we're going

1718
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:28,960
to go down that hole, but you can check it out. I know what I saw is out there. You can watch it.

1719
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,560
It's an amazing case. Amazing case. That sounds incredible.

1720
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:38,240
Before we get into... First of all, thank you for sharing all this. This is amazing. I could

1721
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:44,640
do this all day. I do want to eventually get into some questions. So we have interns here. We call

1722
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:49,920
them interns at area 52 and they pay a monthly subscription. And we take some of their questions,

1723
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:54,240
which we're going to ask you in a second. But before we get into that, I got two questions

1724
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:57,520
to get through here and I really want to get through these. One is a little lighthearted

1725
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:04,080
and one is something we touched on the top of this episode. But first is what, just for anyone out

1726
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:13,120
there, what TV show or movie or fictional made thing do you think, in your opinion, is the most

1727
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,800
closely related to the phenomenon? Close encounters of the third kind.

1728
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:23,520
Yeah. And is that because of the tie in with Heineck and Valet and...

1729
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,200
Yeah. You look at even the description of the entities, those came directly out of Project

1730
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:36,320
Blue Files. And Spielberg's little way of saying that is having Heineck have a cameo appearance

1731
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:42,800
smoking a cigar or a pipe. I think he was smoking a pipe during the encounter. But even down to

1732
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:47,360
Richard Dreyfus' face being burned, those came right out of close encounter. So you had close

1733
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:51,600
encounter of the first kind, you see a UFO, close encounter of the second time, it interacts with

1734
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,600
the environment, burns someone's face, leaves imprints to the ground, affects plant-like,

1735
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,600
whatever, radar photographs. And then you've got close encounters of the third kind. Well,

1736
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:06,960
those came directly out of... He was a consultant, as was Jacques Valet. And Jacques Valet, his

1737
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,720
character was portrayed. And you'll talk to a lot of witnesses that go, that's what I saw.

1738
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:17,760
I saw that exact orb, or I saw that. So that was the most realistic, in my opinion, film

1739
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,520
ever made. And again, those came right out of... I don't know about the chandelier, but

1740
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:28,960
pretty cool stuff. Well, the chandelier I've heard of. I have someone who's had a picture

1741
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:33,440
of something similar, which is interesting when you say that. But it is interesting.

1742
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:40,640
How much do you think Spielberg knows? The guy's a fan, dude. He's been putting out consistent

1743
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:47,920
UFO ET docs. No question. I actually have a letter from Spielberg that was written to

1744
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:57,840
Larry King about me and my movie. Whoa. Yeah. I'll get you... I could probably... Yeah. Excuse me.

1745
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:07,600
Remind me. I can get you a copy of it. Great. So, Larry King... I don't talk about this that often.

1746
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:14,000
I'm not talking about it now, because I told Spielberg's publicist, I think it was named in

1747
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:19,200
a second, that I was planning on going public. And unless I heard from him, I'm going public

1748
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:25,520
with it because I sat on it for 10 years. Larry King had sent a copy, a rough cut of, I know what

1749
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,840
I saw, to Steven Spielberg and was like, hey, this is the real life Close Encounters. You should

1750
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:44,080
check it out. And then a couple of days later, I get a call from... I got a call from an agency

1751
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:51,440
informing me that Steven Spielberg was going to watch my movie. It was kind of weird. I just got

1752
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:58,320
this call from the agency. It wasn't from Larry King's office. It was actually from someone at

1753
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,560
the same agency. They were like, Mr. Fox, just wanted to inform you this is so-and-so over at

1754
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,720
the so-and-so agency that Steven Spielberg is about to watch your movie. And it was like 10 in the

1755
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:12,640
morning. I was like, really? Wow. God, that's cool. So I was like, well, let me know how it goes.

1756
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:17,280
And I called my dad. I was like, dad, you're not going to believe this. Steven Spielberg's watching.

1757
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:21,680
I know what I saw right now. This is amazing. And my dad's like, well, come on down. Let's have tea

1758
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:26,080
together. So I went down to my dad's house and we had tea and we're having tea. I'm like, Steven

1759
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:31,040
Spielberg's watching my movie right now. Like, whoa, you know? And then I get a phone call like

1760
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:38,640
two hours later, whatever. And Cesaria, I think her name was at the agency. And she's like,

1761
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:46,880
well, Steven watched the movie. Okay. Well, what happened? She said, well, he wrote a letter

1762
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:52,880
to Larry King. And that was it. I said, he watched the movie and then he wrote a letter

1763
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:58,000
to Larry King. She goes, yeah. I just wanted to let you know. I was like, okay, thanks.

1764
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,280
Then about a week later, I get a call, I think it was Avriel Gallagher, probably. She's like,

1765
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:11,520
we got something for you. It came from Steven Spielberg. I was like, oh my gosh,

1766
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:19,520
tell me what, you know, we're going to FedEx it to you. So I was like, cool. Yeah. I gave her the

1767
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:26,800
address. And like a day later, I lived in a small town at the time and the FedEx driver was like,

1768
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,760
James Fox, you're not going to believe this. She came running out to my door. He goes,

1769
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:34,240
you got a letter from Larry King. It's a FedEx from Larry King's office. I was like, yeah,

1770
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:38,560
guess what? It's a letter from Steven Spielberg about a UFO dock. He goes,

1771
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,520
can I watch you open it? I was like, yeah. You know, so we sat there and I ripped the thing open

1772
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,920
and there's a letter from Steven Spielberg talking about the movie, talking about, he goes,

1773
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:53,760
despite the fact that I've made so much attention to the phenomenon or, you know, UFOs,

1774
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,800
the subject matter, I unfortunately have never seen a UFO and that is so unfair.

1775
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,680
I hope that you will continue reporting, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1776
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:05,040
So I had a quote from Steven Spielberg about my movie in writing.

1777
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,160
His handwriting, the original letter.

1778
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,200
Yeah, I have the original letter.

1779
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:10,240
Wow, that's so cool.

1780
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:19,120
It was typed and signed. And so I contact his publicist. I can't believe I can't remember

1781
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:24,240
his name right now. I'm sorry. And I said, I could look it up. And I said, hey, I've got,

1782
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:29,200
I said, I want to use it. Oh, we don't endorse movies. I said, no, no, no, no,

1783
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:34,160
that's not what I'm saying. I said, he already gave me the, I have the quote. You have the quote?

1784
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:38,880
I said, yeah. He goes, well, how did you, what do you mean you have the quote? I said, well,

1785
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,360
Larry King sent me the letter. Larry King gave me the letter. And I was like, yeah. And I'd like

1786
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:48,720
to use it to, could you imagine having a quote from Steven Spielberg back in the day on a UFO

1787
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:52,880
dot? Insane. Like literally, like I remember this guy that I was working with, he goes, dude,

1788
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:57,360
that's the difference between here and the stars. Like that'll just catapult you into the,

1789
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:03,520
so, so my dad goes, well, you have the quote. I want you to just use it. I was like, ooh,

1790
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,520
dad, but I don't really. You want to burn a bridge?

1791
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:10,240
You know? And so he's like, well, we would appreciate it if you didn't use that.

1792
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:16,240
So I was thinking to myself, like all the attention here, we got this like fully independent

1793
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:22,320
in the trenches, documentary filmmaker, like, you know, doing the best he can and like your support

1794
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:26,960
would just beat me in the world to me. And you liked the movie and you said it, you found it

1795
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:33,440
really compelling, but you won't let me use it like publicly. So anyway, I was a little disappointed.

1796
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:38,080
And so, I don't know, maybe like 10 years went by or something like that. And I sent him a letter,

1797
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:41,680
I sent him an email and we'd been corresponding a little bit. And I was like, Hey, just so you

1798
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:46,480
know, I intend to go public with that letter. It's been 10 years. And unless I hear from you,

1799
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:50,480
I'll assume that that's okay. And I didn't hear from him. So I published it a lot. I mean,

1800
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:53,520
I put it out there. I should put it out there more recently, but I'll give it to you.

1801
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,960
That is so cool.

1802
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:55,600
Isn't that crazy?

1803
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:00,320
That is amazing. And good for you. I think you made the right call, not putting it out like

1804
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:06,720
ethically. I think he, to match your point, I think he knows how much that's worth.

1805
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:14,640
Putting his name on anything, you know what I mean? And had he wanted to put his name on it,

1806
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:21,040
I think he would let you know. But I think that's, it sounds to me like his way of sort of

1807
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:26,080
saying, Hey, this is a great movie without saying, Hey, this is a great movie.

1808
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:30,720
Yeah. The weight of his endorsement would have been game changing.

1809
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:35,040
Typed and signed, like that takes effort. That's not an email. It's not a text. It's not a DM.

1810
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:40,800
So that goes a long way as an aspiring filmmaker. I'm sure that inspired you to-

1811
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,000
Oh, I have it on my wall.

1812
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,520
Yeah. I have it framed on my wall.

1813
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:49,600
Yeah. Last question before we get into the intern inquiries. I just want to make sure

1814
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:55,760
we're rolling here. All right. At the beginning of this episode, I welcomed you into the skiff

1815
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:06,960
for the second time. Because you recently got invited into a skiff. And I could say,

1816
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:07,760
is that the Pentagon?

1817
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:11,280
So I went to the Pentagon initially. It was right across the street from the Pentagon.

1818
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:11,600
Okay.

1819
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:17,200
An extension on the other side. And I had to do a 48 hour background check. And so basically,

1820
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,880
let's just say this is as much as like, cause I've been asked to not to reveal

1821
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:26,240
exactly why I went there. Because it could interfere with the current investigations

1822
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:29,280
that are happening. But we're both going after the same footage.

1823
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:34,640
And I'm helping them acquire said footage. And I will be able to talk. I'm not trying to be

1824
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:40,080
sneaky or secretive. I can't jeopardize those contacts. And we're working together right now.

1825
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:43,840
And a lot of people think like, oh, well, now you're working with some people on the inside.

1826
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:47,760
Well, people are people and there's some good people and some bad people. And some people

1827
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:52,160
that actually legitimately want this information out. So I'm working with, and

1828
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:58,560
there was an individual that I'm working with who's now on the outside. He was on the inside

1829
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:03,920
and he pulled some strings and got me into a skiff. With the current head of Arrow,

1830
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:11,120
John Kozlowski, had to do a 48 hour background check on me. And it was like a scene out of a

1831
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:15,600
movie. I remember like meeting up with the gentleman of just like the kind of guy that

1832
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:20,240
I expected the suit, the haircut, the jawline, like, I mean, it was like quintessential.

1833
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:23,520
The guy could have been, you know, if he had a dark suit on, it could have been an M.I.B.

1834
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:27,840
That's what I was going to say. One day your friend, the next day a spook.

1835
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,920
I'm sitting there walking through the halls and we go to the security and they're coming through

1836
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,360
everything I had because I was going to get a flight right afterwards. So I had all my bags and

1837
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,480
oh my God, they were going through everything. And they did a background check.

1838
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,120
How are you feeling? I was feeling a little stressed.

1839
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,360
This is a big deal. Big deal for me.

1840
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,920
For someone who's been trying to get to the center of the maze.

1841
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,680
Yeah. But I was trying to like, so I went through the security. I was a little stressed. I was like,

1842
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:53,680
shit, I don't think I have anything in my bag. They're coming through the lint. I mean, my God,

1843
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:56,960
they were going through everything. I was like, I don't think I have anything in there. I was

1844
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:02,480
thinking to myself, like, you know. So anyway, so we go through that and then I get this badge.

1845
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:09,920
And I'll show you. Yeah. So I get this badge and then I have to go there. They have these like

1846
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:16,480
glass tubes, maybe about this big around and the door would open and only one person goes

1847
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:20,880
to the glass tubes and they had probably like maybe five or six all along this wall.

1848
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,080
And you'd walk up to it and this door would open like two door open. You step in with these two

1849
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:29,440
little feet mark and then the other one would open and then you go through that.

1850
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,400
And then I had to walk over to this. What is that?

1851
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,960
I don't know. They scanning you? Is that like an airport?

1852
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:38,080
I don't know. I don't know. I'd already gone through the metal detector. I'd already gone

1853
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:43,600
through that whole thing before I went through that. So I went through that and got to the other

1854
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:47,520
side of that. And then I was like, excuse me. I was like, well, can I take a picture of the two?

1855
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:54,160
No, no. It takes me over to a series of lockers where I'm supposed to get rid of all my

1856
01:45:54,720 --> 01:46:01,680
camera stuff and, you know, phone and electron, everything. And I was like, well, can I use the

1857
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:08,400
bathroom real quick? And I, you know, when you use the bathroom and, you know, I had a little

1858
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:12,240
special pass and I documented that special pass. In the last second?

1859
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:16,720
I had to. Then I came out and had to get rid of all my electronics. Then we came up just like,

1860
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:19,920
just like in the movies, that big door looked like a bank vault almost.

1861
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:28,800
And the door, he opens the door and we walk in and it was like, kind of like an office,

1862
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:35,120
like offices and cubicles and hallways. And I was like, wow, I was thinking like a skiff would be

1863
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:40,080
more like a secured like little room with a table. But the whole area was a skiff. Like all the people

1864
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:43,680
that are working at Arrow are just working in a skiff. Like it's one big skiff.

1865
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:49,280
Interesting. And for those who don't know, a security compartmentalized

1866
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:52,560
facility, information facility. Yeah. Yeah. There you go.

1867
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:58,080
Yep. Nothing works in there anyways, right? Like none of this, nothing, there's no signal.

1868
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,480
No entering or exiting. Yeah.

1869
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:05,120
So anyway, so this gentleman's walking in, he's Air Force Office of Special Investigations.

1870
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:14,080
So he walks me through this hallway and we get up to two doors in the hallway. There's a door on the

1871
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:17,920
left and a door on the right. The door on the right is closed, the door on the left is open

1872
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:23,760
and there's like an oblong shaped table and probably two women and three men in suits,

1873
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,920
nicely dressed, having a meeting. And I'm stopping and he says, wait right here,

1874
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:32,880
I'm going to get somebody else. So I'm standing there in the hallway and I couldn't help but

1875
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,200
to look over to my left and I'm looking over to my left and I'm fully eavesdropping in our

1876
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:42,640
conversations, right? And I'm looking at them and what else am I supposed to do, right? So I was

1877
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:47,760
like kind of eavesdropping and then they looked over at me and this guy got up quickly and abruptly

1878
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:52,720
and closed the door on my face. But I was like, well, how could I not look? I mean, you know,

1879
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:56,720
they're having a conversation to skip. I'm not going to ask you what they said,

1880
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:00,240
but was the conversation anything pertinent or was it just?

1881
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:05,680
No, I was just trying to, I was just tuning in. I was just really trying to listen and I was

1882
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:10,640
checking it out, you know? And the guy closed the door and then this other guy comes up,

1883
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:16,160
John Kosciuski and he's like, I got a few minutes and we went into the skip, we went into his office

1884
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:20,000
and this other guy from Air Force Office of Special Investigations, I guess he's part of

1885
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:25,120
the task force as well. And I start talking openly about-

1886
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:27,200
So this other guy was there the entire time as well?

1887
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:28,480
John Kosciuski was only there for-

1888
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:29,760
John Kosciuski, but the other guy was-

1889
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:30,880
The other guy was there the whole time.

1890
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,080
The whole time. So he was-

1891
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,960
John, the Air Force Office of Special Investigation guy was only there,

1892
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,560
was there the whole time. John was only there for maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

1893
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,120
Interesting.

1894
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:43,200
But, because he, you know, so I started talking about specific cases. I was like,

1895
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:46,960
where do these men in black come from? They're, they're, they have this omnipresence,

1896
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:50,640
they're global, like who are they? And they didn't make any comments. I was like,

1897
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:53,440
I was told they're Air Force Office of Special Investigation, but I don't know.

1898
01:48:55,120 --> 01:49:01,680
And then I said, I was like, well, you guys do know that, you know, obviously the vast majority

1899
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:07,600
of these cases, UFO reports and UAP reports can be explained in down to earth conventional terms.

1900
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:14,400
I mean, it's like, there's a residual 15 and 20% that clearly after exhaustive investigation,

1901
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:18,880
defy conventional explanation. And those probably originate from a non-human intelligence.

1902
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,280
I mean, you guys know that, right? Like, come on, you got to know that.

1903
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:29,680
And John looked at me and he goes, James, I can't part my own hair without approval from the DOD.

1904
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:33,840
And you can quote me on that. You can say we met and you can say that.

1905
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:34,880
Whoa.

1906
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,360
I was like, he was telling me my hands are tied.

1907
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:37,600
Yeah.

1908
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:41,360
Doesn't matter what conclusions I draw. It was amazing.

1909
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:43,760
So crazy. That's crazy that he allowed you to-

1910
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:47,040
And then he said to me, I didn't say, hey, can I quote you on that? He goes, you can,

1911
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:51,280
and you can quote, you can say we met and you can say I said that.

1912
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,480
That's his way of telling you.

1913
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:55,600
Yes. That was his way of getting the word across. My hands are tied.

1914
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:58,960
Doesn't matter what conclusions I draw. Isn't that crazy?

1915
01:49:58,960 --> 01:49:59,600
That is crazy.

1916
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:04,800
Then I was talking about all the different cases. I was like, this case, that case. And then he had

1917
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:09,840
to go and then they showed me some stuff that they were going after. They showed me some

1918
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:14,000
information. Yeah. I got to see some stuff and I was like, that's not,

1919
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:18,640
I was like, you need to contact this witness before you release that because that's not going

1920
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:23,200
to go down well. And I also said, you guys got to throw us a bone. You know, we're not going

1921
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:28,960
anywhere. This is coming out. It was amazing. I was still in touch with one of the individuals

1922
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:29,920
I texted this morning.

1923
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,760
Do you have a, thank you for sharing that by the way.

1924
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,640
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1925
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:35,680
I felt like I was there for a second.

1926
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:36,720
Isn't that cool?

1927
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:41,760
Yeah. So cool. You know, first of all, it's really nice to hear that, you know, part of

1928
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:47,520
John Kozlowski telling you that because Arrow's got a bad rap.

1929
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,200
Oh yeah. John Kirkpatrick was.

1930
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:55,040
Exactly. And, you know, we're all kind of, of the same mindset that are like, ah, this is just a

1931
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:59,280
big sign-up, big disinformation thing. They're just going to slow leak. They know the truth.

1932
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:02,800
They're not letting us know. Like this is the, this is the narrative when you

1933
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:09,840
hear about Arrow in the community. So to hear him sort of say, Hey, I get it,

1934
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:17,280
but I can't do anything. Just that I feel is such a strong message that needed to be said.

1935
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:17,760
Yeah.

1936
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,960
So that's really important.

1937
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,800
And, oh, we've got one more thing that's really cool.

1938
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,440
Okay.

1939
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:27,280
So John, sorry, the other gentleman, why am I? Anyway, doesn't matter.

1940
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:27,840
I wonder.

1941
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:35,680
I have it in my phone and he said, you know, a little factoid, something you might want to,

1942
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:40,960
you know, know. I was like, what's that? He goes, your film, the phenomenon is mandatory view.

1943
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:45,440
And if you want to work for the UAP task force or Arrow, you have to watch the phenomenon first.

1944
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,080
Get out of town.

1945
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:49,520
Swear on my life. That's what he said to me. Isn't that cool?

1946
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:50,880
Dude, that is the coolest.

1947
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:53,760
I was like, wow. Yeah, I know.

1948
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,680
That's better than a Spielberg endorsement buy book.

1949
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:01,760
Awesome. It was so funny too, because I was like, I'm in the belly of the beast right now.

1950
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,680
Yeah. And you're helping to shape the narrative.

1951
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:11,360
It felt so like, but then I realized like people are people. There are good people on the inside.

1952
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:14,640
People that really want to get, look, and there have been, because people go,

1953
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:18,880
oh, you know, they just think government, they think evil, they think politician,

1954
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,920
they think evil. Yeah, there's some really good people on the inside. There are, look,

1955
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:27,040
we have people dating back to the 1940s that wanted this stuff to come out, right?

1956
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,360
Yeah. Jesse Marcel.

1957
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:36,400
Yeah, the guy that ran Project Blue Book during the incursion over, during the invasion,

1958
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:42,560
but the two consecutive weekends in July of 1952, the guy that was head of Blue Book at the time

1959
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,800
wrote a book about it. I mean, there are people that have been, the former head of the CIA,

1960
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,720
Roscoe Hillencotter in the 60s.

1961
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:51,600
Major general blanking on his name.

1962
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:57,360
Well, John Stanford is the one that gave the press conference, but he gave a press conference

1963
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:00,720
in uniform about it. But there's another gentleman that wrote a book that was head of

1964
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:04,240
Project Blue Book in 1952. You can look him up and I'm just drawing a blank right now.

1965
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:11,840
But you've got the former head of the CIA, Roscoe Hillencotter, quote in the New York Times,

1966
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:17,600
who talked about, you know, there have been people over the decades that have made an effort to tell

1967
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:22,960
the people. It's not like they're all decided to have this excessive secrecy and, you know,

1968
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:28,560
people criticize Lou Elizondo, always a deep state. It's like, okay, so all, everything that

1969
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:35,120
I've heard Lou say for me aligns with my field research. Like even the fact that he testified

1970
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:39,120
under oath the other day about a crash retrieval program, people want to call that a big nothing

1971
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:44,800
burger. Actually, that's kind of a something burger. This guy worked at the UAP task force,

1972
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:50,560
ATIP, and probably OSAP prior to that. But in any case, and he's testifying under oath,

1973
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:55,200
there are consequences for lying under oath to, you know, bipartisan group of lawmakers.

1974
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:58,960
That was pretty phenomenal. You were there with me. It was pretty phenomenal to witness.

1975
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:05,520
But I say that like, people are people. And there are some reasons, you know, from the decades,

1976
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:11,280
justification or potentially for some secrecy. I disagree with it now entirely. But maybe they

1977
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:15,440
were legitimately trying to figure out what the hell was going on, you know, back in the 40s.

1978
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,440
There was a point where that was needed.

1979
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:21,280
Yeah, they might've just said, hey, let's just hold on a second. Let's not panic the public.

1980
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:29,840
And then the deeper they dug, the more they probably were like, what the hell's going on

1981
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:34,080
here, right? And even if you have definitive proof, bodies, crash materials, it still doesn't mean

1982
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:38,880
you have all the answers. And there's probably, I mean, maybe I'll pose this question to you,

1983
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:46,880
but for me, I do believe that there is probably some framework outside of the government that

1984
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:49,840
really knows what's going on. Like it's-

1985
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:50,960
I'm told 20 people.

1986
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,640
Yeah. Okay. 20.

1987
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,200
20.

1988
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:53,520
Wow.

1989
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,480
Globally.

1990
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,760
Globally, 20 people.

1991
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,520
Have the bigger picture.

1992
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:02,800
Have the bigger picture. Yeah. And they're running it.

1993
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:04,240
20.

1994
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,040
Wow.

1995
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:09,840
And that came from someone I really trust. Someone I really trust. Could that be wrong?

1996
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,960
Yeah, could be. But I think not.

1997
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:19,920
Yeah. And that's been, I think a lot of people's suspicions is that whatever's happening,

1998
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:24,720
you know, there's a very few amount of people at the center of this labyrinth.

1999
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:25,040
Yeah.

2000
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,360
A very few. There's a lot of people around the center.

2001
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,120
I heard it's a little scary too.

2002
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:31,520
I bet. Yeah. What'd you hear?

2003
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:33,600
That's all I heard.

2004
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:34,720
That it was a little scary?

2005
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:40,160
But I was like, hey, even if we're someone's P2 dish, whatever, reality is reality, right?

2006
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,640
Or, you know, is it a little scary that we don't have control over aerospace?

2007
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:47,520
Well, I've known that for a while. If they were here to do us harm,

2008
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:51,600
I mean, a lot of people could argue with me and say, abductions, okay, I get it.

2009
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:55,360
But for the most part, all the people that I've talked to that have had face-to-face

2010
01:55:55,360 --> 01:56:00,880
encounters or really dramatic UFO encounters, like close kinds of the second kind, third kind,

2011
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:09,440
first kind, if their intent was to harm us, it would have vaporized us decades ago.

2012
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:15,920
That's just, and again, people could contradict me and say that that's not what they-

2013
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,200
Yeah, there's different cases.

2014
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:19,680
Totally. I'm just saying my, you know, color is in one.

2015
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:19,920
Sure.

2016
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,960
But for the most part, it's fairly benign. In fact,

2017
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:27,680
it's really interesting. And I was like, in retrospect, I didn't,

2018
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:33,520
I looked back on it 10 years after the fact. I did an interview with Parviz Jafari. He was an

2019
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:38,720
Iranian general. And he had this dramatic UFO encounter over Tehran, Iran in like 19, I want

2020
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:47,520
to say 75, could have been 76, in a Phantom F4 jet. And he tried to shoot at it. Well,

2021
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:51,760
it's really dramatic. I feature it and I know what I saw. It was an incredible case.

2022
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:55,040
And the fact that we got him out of the States at the time when George Bush

2023
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:59,760
had called it the access of evil, the whole Iran. And I was like, oh God, no,

2024
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:04,800
no, he's not going to be able to get the visas to come, you know. And he was reflecting on the

2025
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:10,240
case years later on camera to me. And he goes, he tried to shoot it and it didn't end well when he

2026
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:18,400
tried to shoot it. Like it was, he thought he was dead. And he goes, my biggest regret was that I

2027
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:23,680
didn't try to make peaceful contact. I tried to shoot it. What would have happened had I tried

2028
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:28,800
to make peaceful contact. And he was really thinking hard about that one. And that's,

2029
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:34,560
you know, anything that we can't identify, we just immediately assume is a threat.

2030
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:42,880
And we take that position, you know, that position of aggression. And yeah, that doesn't

2031
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:49,120
generally end well. Yeah, yeah. That's, it's kind of like the, the witness in Texas where he had

2032
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:53,200
to been a scope and he's like, he said probably not a good idea. Finger was on the trigger and

2033
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:57,120
he was, yeah, I could start, I could start an intergalactic war right now. Like what's going

2034
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:02,160
on? Maybe I better not do that. All right. We're going to get into some questions here from,

2035
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:06,640
let me turn on this camera. Got it. You got it. All right. While I go set up the camera,

2036
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:12,320
if you've noticed these videos aren't sponsored. And so I'm going to take this opportunity to

2037
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:16,960
share with you some of the things that help support this channel, including new merch.

2038
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:21,600
We've got these amazing area 52 snap backs with the embroidered logo on the front,

2039
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:26,640
as well as some brand new patches that you can add to your favorite jacket or shirt or whatever.

2040
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:30,240
I left the link in the description where you can pick them up and thank you for the support.

2041
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:34,560
All right. Back to the video. This is so cool. Thank you so much for this. Yeah, absolutely. I

2042
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:39,440
mean, I've read through a bunch of it and there's a whole bunch of really interesting, just fringe

2043
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:43,200
cases that you would never otherwise hear about. Right. And I find that to be one of the most

2044
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:47,920
fascinating things. The phenomenon. All right. They're right there. The phenomenon.

2045
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:58,800
Wow. Right. Long time ago too. Yeah. What is this? 60 years ago. Wow. Anyway, as you were saying,

2046
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:04,240
yeah, we'll bring in some of the questions here. Let's do it. So one of which you answered already.

2047
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:13,840
Um, but here's one from our discord moderator, uh, held her house and pop up here. Cool.

2048
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:23,120
It says, if you could travel back to any UFO event in history to witness it firsthand,

2049
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:30,960
which one would you choose and why? So core New Mexico, 1964, April, because it involves,

2050
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:37,200
it involves a landing and two entities that got out of the spacecraft. And if I could,

2051
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:41,200
I've thought about that many times. If I could just put myself somewhere hidden,

2052
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:47,440
you know, and I have witnessed, have witnessed that up close, the aliens getting out of the,

2053
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:53,200
of the spacecraft and walking around. Oh my gosh, that'd be incredible. I mean, I thought about

2054
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:59,120
Virginia, Brazil, but that involved the military and the aggression and people's life threatened.

2055
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:04,080
People's life threatened, but that encounter was very benign. Right. It was, it was secluded.

2056
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:09,680
It was secluded. It was benign remote. And if you look at the topography of the, of the area,

2057
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:15,280
they actually picked a spot that like down in Arroyo to minimize any possibility of,

2058
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:21,840
of them being seen. They chose a really, a low point where they could land and just,

2059
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:25,840
you know what I mean? And just be kind of hidden. It's interesting. You look at what the phenomenon

2060
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:32,640
does, and then you look at what the phenomenon doesn't do. And that speaks volumes.

2061
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:37,680
That's a great point. Yeah. Yeah. They're not showing up on, you know, the White House lawn.

2062
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:43,360
Got close though. Yeah. But yeah, they did get close. 52. But they are showing up at schools.

2063
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:47,920
Yes. All right. We've got another one here. This is, oh no, this one we already,

2064
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:51,840
it's going to show up anyways, but we already got to, so we'll get to a different one.

2065
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:54,080
One second. I love the colors. That's so pretty.

2066
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:05,920
Got a few. Okay. This is a really, really good question. This is from Stan B.

2067
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:13,280
And Stan says, who's the first guest or witness you would get in front of the

2068
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:17,920
camera if they were allowed to break their NDA? Hal Putov.

2069
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:24,000
Yeah, I would agree with that too. I'd love to get him in the skiff.

2070
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:33,120
I have to be careful what I say here, but let's just say that I believe,

2071
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:38,000
and for reasons that I won't discuss, I believe he's a first-hand witness.

2072
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:42,400
Wow. Wow.

2073
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:45,120
Yeah. I believe that.

2074
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:52,560
I mean, from the interviews he even shared in the program, kind of caught me off guard,

2075
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:57,440
especially when he says like, I've seen things that if I talk about, I'll go to jail.

2076
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:00,320
Yeah. Have you seen things that if you talk about, you go to jail?

2077
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:05,520
No, but I could talk about things that other people might go to jail.

2078
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:07,120
Enough said. Yeah.

2079
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:09,360
Wow. That's a lot of weight.

2080
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:15,040
It is. Yeah. I remember asking myself at one point, is my life better knowing these things?

2081
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:18,720
And on the one hand, it's like, be careful what you ask for. You just might get it.

2082
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:24,320
30 years in the field, right? Traveling all over the damn place. I must be nuts.

2083
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,000
What's the hell? You know what I mean?

2084
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:26,640
Yeah.

2085
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:31,360
Especially I was telling you last night that I've been laughed at and ridiculed for most of my adult

2086
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:37,120
life. Can you imagine? That's why when I was watching David Grush testify, I'll never forget

2087
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:43,520
this. I'm an already emotional kind of guy, but I was staring at my screen and my son was trying to

2088
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:46,080
get my attention. He wanted to go play with me outside or something. It was in the middle of the

2089
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:52,640
day. I had my phone and I was sitting on this little leather sofa and I was staring at it and

2090
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:58,640
I had tears pouring down the sides of my face, just pouring down like a river for the whole time

2091
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:08,000
because I was like, I knew it. Damn it. I knew it. And I got laughed at and ridiculed and made fun of.

2092
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:14,320
I didn't believe David Grush because it was a high-level intelligence officer testifying

2093
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:20,000
under oath to a bipartisan group of lawmakers. I believed him because everything he said aligned

2094
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,560
with my 30 years of research in the field. That's why I believed him. You know what I mean?

2095
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:30,480
And that the level of... I can't even describe what it felt like. I just can't. It was just...

2096
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:32,320
That's amazing.

2097
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:37,120
Tears just pouring down my face of relief, like this weight off my shoulders.

2098
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:43,600
You can recognize the courage too of these men who've all come forward. Even in the recent one,

2099
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:48,800
it's like we're quick to dismiss a lot of the information as anecdotal or secondhand.

2100
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,480
With everything to lose and nothing to gain.

2101
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:55,280
Yeah. It's a lot. And their lives in jeopardy, their families...

2102
02:03:55,280 --> 02:04:03,120
And remind your audience, people out there, it's so easy to sit on the sidelines and criticize.

2103
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:08,000
And we're all human. We try to get it right. And we have people that are making some pretty

2104
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,600
crazy allegations. And I'll be the first one to tell you, I believe... You can't just believe

2105
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:19,120
something because a former military officer is saying it. However, it's really hard to make

2106
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:22,880
the decision. It's like, do I report on it? Do I not report on it? Well, if you don't report on it,

2107
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:27,680
then clearly no more information is going to come out on it. You got to at some point get out there

2108
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:35,440
and put the hook in the water and see if there's... And we don't always get it right. We try to,

2109
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:40,480
and I certainly try to, and I would never deliberately put out anything that was disinformation.

2110
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:45,760
Never. No amount of money in the world would get me to do that. But I believe sometimes I'll

2111
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:49,280
believe something just enough to put it out there and it's like, let's pray to God that other

2112
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:54,080
firsthand witnesses will come forward as a result of that. And that's a big part of what I reported.

2113
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:58,960
And now we're getting to the point where we're not just dealing with unidentified objects in the sky

2114
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:04,720
anymore. Now we're dealing with beings on the ground and possible hardware in a lab and biologics,

2115
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:09,200
as David Gross would put it. I don't like that term. I don't either. Can we just say aliens?

2116
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:13,520
Yes. I don't care if they're from here. I'm still calling them aliens. They're alien to me. We call

2117
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:17,920
them NHI. Yeah, NHI. Non-human intelligence works, but you know what? A dolphin is NHI too.

2118
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:24,800
Oh, okay. Good point. Do you know what I mean? Aliens is good. And let's make you a P UFO again.

2119
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:32,560
This is the last question here from the interns here. I can neither confirm nor deny.

2120
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:39,280
We'll have to see. Don't call me. In a secure environment only.

2121
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:43,200
We are in a secure environment. That's right. Anything goes here. This is from Disco. It says,

2122
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:49,120
James, straight up question about UAP UFO Leovni. Leovni. What do you think it is? What do you think

2123
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:57,600
it is? Good question. And I've given this a lot of thought. And I almost called the phenomenon

2124
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:03,040
all of the above. That was a name that I was entertaining. I wasn't quite latched onto it,

2125
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:07,440
but I was like, it's something I thought about for a couple of weeks. And the reason being is,

2126
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:12,480
I was like, God, maybe it's interdimensional, time traveler,

2127
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:21,520
periodic visitation, interplanetary. Maybe it's just all of that. It's a big universe.

2128
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:29,200
So I thought about that. But I would say that the most, as this is all speculation,

2129
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:35,360
but I would say informed speculation. The only conclusion that I've really drawn

2130
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:44,160
is that, and I've said this before, there's an omnipresent intelligence that has the ability

2131
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:49,040
to manifest itself in a multitude of ways. Like it's nuts and bolts, but it's also psychic.

2132
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:56,480
And they have a sense of humor at times. A lot of the people within the scientific community that

2133
02:06:56,480 --> 02:07:00,960
I've met with give me a number of instances where they, I was like, that's a bit of a relief. They

2134
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:05,440
have a sense of humor. That's kind of cool. But that it's an omnipresent, it's everywhere.

2135
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:10,240
And that it can just get some people described like it just appeared out of nowhere,

2136
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:16,000
or just disappeared, like it almost disappeared in place. Maybe they're operating in a slightly

2137
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:21,520
different dimension. And maybe you just like a radio, you adjust the frequency a little bit,

2138
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:26,960
and all of a sudden something appears. It's always there, but you have to adjust. Maybe it's that.

2139
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:30,720
Maybe it's time travelers. Maybe it's us coming back from the future, or maybe it's all the above.

2140
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:37,120
I honestly don't know. But whatever it is, it's far more complex than just interplanetary

2141
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:40,240
visitation. No question. Great answer.

2142
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:47,280
All right. That was an amazing two hours. Do you remember my favorite color?

2143
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:50,000
Blue. Yes, but it's dark blue. Dark blue, sorry.

2144
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,800
Yeah, I like dark blue. Midnight blue. Look at that. It's like kind of a grayish.

2145
02:07:56,480 --> 02:08:00,880
Do you mind if I keep you for an extra 20 after this, just for the extra little interview?

2146
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:07,200
But before we do that, if you guys want to check out anything at all, I highly encourage you to

2147
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:14,480
binge watch this man's just library. Go down the rabbit hole. One of my personal favorite

2148
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:18,080
documentaries of all time is Moment of Contact. We talked about our genius stuff. If you haven't

2149
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:23,520
seen that, please go watch that. Go watch the phenomenon. Go watch the program. Go watch

2150
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:27,920
everything under the sun that James Fox has ever put out. You will not be disappointed,

2151
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:35,120
and you will be more well-informed than anyone else. I highly encourage you guys to check that

2152
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:42,000
out. I'll leave James's links below, including his ex, his Instagram, all the above.

2153
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:47,200
When you say my ex, you mean literally? Twitter. Yeah, I hate saying it,

2154
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:53,040
but I also don't want to sound like I'm not hip. Yeah, I'll leave all the links below.

2155
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:59,440
If you guys want to tune in for an extra little discussion, we're going to go deep into the skiff,

2156
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:04,800
and this will not be public, but it'll be available to the interns for five bucks a month. You guys

2157
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:09,840
know the deal. You can do all that. Join the Discord, join the Patreon, join the memberships,

2158
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:14,640
join the conversation, and we'll see you guys on the next video. James, thank you so much.

2159
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:15,440
Thanks for having me on.

2160
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:19,040
All right, we take a little break. You want to take a little break? You want to keep

2161
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:22,560
steamrolling through? Let's roll. All right, we're right here.
