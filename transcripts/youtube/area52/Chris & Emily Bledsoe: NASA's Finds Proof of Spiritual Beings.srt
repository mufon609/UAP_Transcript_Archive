1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Thank you so much for coming down here and doing this.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,840
It's an honor and I'm very grateful for you guys spending the time and we timed it perfectly

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,640
with your birthday and we had quite an amazing experience last night on the beach.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,340
So what was it we were seeing last night on the beach?

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,840
That's the first time I've ever seen anything like that.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,400
It's also the first time I've ever stared at the sky for that long I think.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,400
There was a lot of air traffic, we could see a lot of planes flying around, we could tell

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
what they were.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,280
There was obviously a very dense highway of airplanes landing in Tampa that were coming

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,720
off the beach but there were some things that we saw that were definitely not airplanes

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,680
were moving in weird directions with the lights getting very bright and then going very dim

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,840
to where we couldn't see them anymore.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
What were those orbs?

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:15,560
Well they were the orbs and the question of what are they is an ongoing study that's research

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,760
that we're all trying to figure out.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,320
It would have been much closer but I think all the traffic and the population from the

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,040
beach kind of makes it more shy.

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,680
So to sort of give you an introduction Chris, out of all the people that I've talked to

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,120
involved in this phenomenon, I have a lot of people on the podcast before who have spoken

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:43,240
about it and studied it for years and it seems to be the consensus that you are one of the

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,640
most if not the most credible person that has ever experienced this phenomenon.

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,760
As I told you earlier, my friend Andy Bustamante who was here a couple weeks ago was telling

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,520
me that through all of his experience filming that show that he was doing for History Channel,

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:08,720
the Beyond Skinwalker show, the night that he spent with you witnessing those orbs in

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,560
the sky, out of everything else he said that was the one thing that stuck out to him the

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,680
most and it was the one thing that was truly unexplainable and real at the same time.

27
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,760
Hey guys, I want to ask you a quick favor.

28
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,480
Over the last few months, almost 70% of the viewers of this podcast are not subscribed

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,520
to the channel.

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,120
The most important common denominator that allows me to keep creating these podcasts

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,200
every single week is you hitting that subscribe button below the videos.

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,680
I want to thank every single one of you who watches and supports these podcasts.

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,520
I would not be able to do it without you.

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,640
Please hit that subscribe button if you enjoy it.

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,160
Now back to the show.

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,400
There's more people in the government and aerospace scientists that seem to be really

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,480
interested in you.

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:01,120
The CIA, DIA, FBI, NRO, and even the Vatican seem to be very interested in you and they

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,360
also seem to have their hands in this.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,080
So can you go ahead and explain how this whole thing started for you?

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,960
I mean, I know you've told a bunch of the stories before on other podcasts and your

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,440
book goes through it very well, UFO of God.

43
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
Incredible book.

44
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,960
Incredible book.

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Nearly 17 years ago, we were, let's say over 17 years ago, in 2006 we had sold a company

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:47,320
that was going down the tubes because of the desert, not the desert storm, but the 9-1-1

48
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,080
attack when they blew up the World Trade Center.

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,960
I got caught with too many houses for sale.

50
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,780
I was a builder, contractor, and had been successful for nearly 20 years and building

51
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,200
anywhere from 80 to 120 homes a year, my wife and I had a Remax Realty Company.

52
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
She sold them.

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
I built them.

54
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,720
But when they destroyed the tower, it locked the Fort Bragg, which is where we live, now

55
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,000
called Fort Liberty I think, but it will always be Bragg to me.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,040
The soldiers quit buying homes.

57
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Most everybody did.

58
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:34,640
It just threw the housing market and two, it was the start of the housing collapse.

59
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,800
It further collapsed in 2008 completely.

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
I was in a bad way.

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:50,320
I was dealing with Crohn's disease and had been since I was a young guy in my 20s.

62
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,720
At that point, it started getting worse and worse and worse because stress makes it worse.

63
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:03,720
I had to wear stress trying to hide the fact that I'm shelling out everything I ever owned,

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,720
many apartments, was going out the window to try to keep this company, at least to pay

65
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,320
the interest on the notes.

66
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:22,360
So we sold the company in 2005 and I'd had a near-death experience in 2004 from being

67
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
over-medicated.

68
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
It's in the book.

69
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,200
It's a very tragic thing that happened.

70
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:34,520
my daughter died from an overdose that he was on drugs himself, some kind of medication

71
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,760
he was taking and he put 113 people in the hospital and I was one of them.

72
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,880
So that was a severe setback going through that along with what I was already dealing

73
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,240
with and that was one reason the company had to be sold.

74
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,520
So let's fast forward to 2006.

75
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,080
Along about October, I accepted a job my dad arranged to go oversee a big house on the

76
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,600
ocean at Holden Beach, North Carolina.

77
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,100
Four month long job.

78
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:22,040
It was over by Christmas and we had to finish it up to get paid the last 10% after Christmas

79
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
on the New Year.

80
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,160
So I sent the guys back down to the coast to do their job and bring a check back for

81
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:36,360
the retainer and they did and this was January the 8th of 2007.

82
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,280
They called me and said, we have finished the job and we got you a check and we want

83
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
to celebrate.

84
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,520
Can you take us fishing today?

85
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,800
I said, well sure, I guess.

86
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,160
My wife was out of town with her or with the rest of the kids.

87
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,840
It was just Chris Jr. and I.

88
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:03,240
And so they came in, got their checks, broke mine, or my dad's actually, and they went

89
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,760
to the bank and came back about 2 o'clock and said, let's go.

90
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,440
And so I followed them to their house, picked them up at 2.30 and away we went to the river

91
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,400
fishing and this is how it all started.

92
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,040
The reason I went through this is because it's important, it's one of the most important

93
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:29,120
things in the world for anybody to know about this phenomena of 17 years nearly of research

94
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,160
that I've been doing.

95
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,760
It came because I was in the worst suffering way.

96
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,200
I was at the bottom, ready to give up on life and I was crying out to whoever's up there,

97
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
help me.

98
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Why?

99
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,520
I'm 45, 46 years old and I have to get free lunches at school now for my children.

100
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,520
And just moving out of a million dollar home with a pool in the back.

101
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,200
My kids have lived within that standard for most of their lives.

102
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,000
So it was a big thing and I was suffering bad from it, crying out to the skies.

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,240
I left these guys fishing, I left them fishing about 3 o'clock.

104
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:20,280
I walked away and I just never did pull out a pole, it was my son and three other guys

105
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,200
were sitting on the bank of the Cape Verde River, a little small river about 70 yards

106
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,840
wide and I said I'll see you later.

107
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:35,400
And I walked away up about a quarter mile to the field to where we came across this

108
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,160
corn field, it turned off the paved road, drove right through the middle of this field

109
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,440
on a little two road dirt road to the backside and to the tree line and when you get to the

110
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,480
trees you go downhill a hundred feet to the river and before you run into the river you

111
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,320
make a right and parallel to the river another eighth of a mile to a cul-de-sac.

112
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,000
So it's a quarter mile walk out of that cul-de-sac up to the hill.

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,160
When I got near the top of that hill I noticed what I thought was the sun setting, it's about

114
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,640
5, 10 after 5, 5.15 in the evening in January so it gets dark, you know about 5.30 the sun

115
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:28,600
sets and I'm probably 50 feet from the top of that hill so I'm looking up at the gate,

116
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,400
the gate is up at the top of the hill but you can't see the field because it's elevated

117
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:41,200
right and the higher I got up the wider my field of vision became so I'm looking down

118
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,640
a road that has trees straight up on either side of me really close so I had a narrow

119
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,840
field of vision.

120
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:59,200
So the closer I got to the top I saw what I thought was the setting sun and so I looked

121
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,960
down to take a few more steps because I'm walking through mud and bushes and it's dark,

122
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:14,120
almost dark where I'm at now and four or five more steps up that hill and that's when the

123
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,960
shock came, I began to see a second one instead of what I thought was the sun, the top edge

124
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,600
of it, when I made a few more steps up I could see the top edge of two suns and I knew right

125
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:35,960
then that this wasn't anything that we had and the reason I knew that instantly is because

126
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:43,120
I'm commercial rated pilot and I have studied it all my life and love it and I can name

127
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:53,200
every airplane from World War II to today pretty much and so shock came real quick.

128
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,120
I am, I'm afraid what I'm looking at so I dropped to my knees using the hill to hide

129
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:08,120
me from these objects, thought I was hiding and so I sat there and I kind of crawled out

130
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,160
of the road to the ditch because the weeds were real tall in the ditch and so I'm buried

131
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,960
myself in these weeds and I start crawling inching up the hill to where I could see and

132
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:26,680
I peek my head up and they're still there and I don't know how long I was there standing

133
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:34,320
or kneeling in these weeds on my knees you know using this waist high of grass and what

134
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:44,560
we call reeds or cane which is down near water wet areas right and I begin to ponder

135
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,000
everything I'm looking at and my son he's in these guys behind me fishing I thought

136
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,640
maybe I should get back down to where they are so I turned my body to point downhill

137
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,920
and I'm still hiding I thought you know I've got this hill up above me I could raise up

138
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,760
and I could see them I'd lower down and I couldn't see them so the minute I decided

139
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,160
to run when I made that decision I was thinking about it but when I turned my body to actually

140
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,000
run I looked back one more time when I stood up to see if they were there and when I did

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,400
that a third one same thing same size 40 foot 50 foot round blood red to orange balls of fire

142
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,520
just what we saw on the water last night that one of those looked like it come up out of the water

143
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:51,080
that she found yeah right and so the next thing I remember is walking up to the fire trotting

144
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,000
they couldn't see me because they're standing around the fire and it's burnt down to a little

145
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,400
campfire now and we had a big blazing fire there when I left and they were just standing there and

146
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,040
and I could see them from the fire glowing on I might have a flashlight so they didn't know I

147
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,080
was coming until I got right up on them and I said hey you won't believe what I just saw at the top

148
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,280
of the hill and they looked at me and said where have you been I said what do you mean where have

149
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,640
I been I was just up at the top of the hill just 20 minutes ago and they said no you've been going

150
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:32,080
all night and so I couldn't ponder I couldn't imagine what they were saying it just did not

151
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,320
connect with me I argued the fact no I've been going 20 minutes this no we've been looking you

152
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:45,800
all night and I realized Chris Jr. was missing and so I kind of freaked out worried about him

153
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:52,040
because I knew the direction they pointed he went in the back of the cul-de-sac along the bank of

154
00:13:52,040 --> 00:14:01,320
the Cape River which is real rugged and valleys and big trees and it's just a place you can get

155
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,720
lost real easy and he was in there looking for me so I took off immediately and ran to the back

156
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,120
of that cul-de-sac shouting for him still not understanding that I've been gone but 20 minutes

157
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:23,960
right I'm to me that's what had just passed and when I found him he was he was in shock he was

158
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,160
laying on his stomach and had backed up under the undergrowth in the back of that cul-de-sac

159
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,400
wouldn't answer me until I almost stepped on him I'm trying to get in the woods to to look for him

160
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:48,200
no flashlight and what had happened with Chris Jr. was when about an hour after I was gone he realized

161
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,840
that I should have been back by now it's dark so he started bugging the guys we need to find my dad

162
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:01,160
where's he at so they got in the truck and drove looking for me left one guy at the fire and two

163
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,800
guys in my truck drove up and down across the field out on the highway they went everywhere

164
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:12,360
looking for me Chris Jr. went on foot into the cul-de-sac because I had actually walked in there

165
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:21,880
for a little while before I went up to the field and he had what he saw what he said he saw

166
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,960
was um he could see all the way down the road the path from the back of that cul-de-sac to

167
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:37,080
where it turned and went up the hill so he had a good probably a quarter mile view

168
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,000
of that road and the trees grow over the road so it's like a tunnel you know you come through

169
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,400
real thick stuff and while he was looking at me he saw a red ball of light like an orb he described

170
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,640
two red balls of light across the road way up about a you know a little less than a quarter mile

171
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,520
and they went in on the river side so he ran back to the fire which is toward the orbs right

172
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,640
had to run back towards them and they were sitting on the bank so the road parallels the river

173
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,640
and they're part of the way ahead of him on the right right on the bank so he runs up there and

174
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,320
he tells them what he saw and they were like don't kid around you know you know don't what are you

175
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,280
doing junior they took it as a joke right he's grown man saying you're messing with us junior

176
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:37,000
don't mess with it so he runs back to the back of the cul-de-sac again looking for me and he sees

177
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,240
these same two balls of light come out of the river side now back out in the road and here they come

178
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:50,200
too and towards him so he began to back hide he tried to hide so he backs himself up under this

179
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:57,960
rub so around the field if you're familiar with in our area and even here the edges of any field

180
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:04,520
is really thick undergrowth you got all this thick stuff once you get in the forest it opens up right

181
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:12,120
so he's trying to hide under this thick stuff and what he described when i was walking him back to

182
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:18,920
the fire was that these two balls of light came all the way to one closer he got the more he got

183
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,560
afraid then he started hiding and they got about 15 20 feet from him and there were two little

184
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:32,360
beans about three feet tall they had red glowing eyes so they looked like individual orbs when you

185
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:40,120
saw them but when they were closer to two little eyes about this big and um he couldn't shout he

186
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:47,400
couldn't scream he was paralyzed the whole time he was laying there just afraid and so i took him

187
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,200
back to the fire and funny thing was these guys were freaked out now they were really

188
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,880
freaked because what i was talking about i'd seen up at the top of the hill what chris jr is talking

189
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:11,800
about now it got him even more distressed suddenly one of the guys shouts look and we all look up to

190
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,120
the heavens and it looked like eight or nine stars or orbs like you saw last night these big

191
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,440
they were white that they were growing huge and white and they just went around in circles and

192
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,680
like they were chasing one another and they'd go out and they'd come back together and then

193
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:35,480
three of them landed in front of us about 75 yards away across the river and that's when

194
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,600
pandemonium sat in and we ran left the poles in the water coolers everything they had we just left

195
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,600
it jumped in my truck and took off out of there and when we got back to the top of the hill where

196
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,600
i was looking you know i was hiding well those same three orbs are sitting there two of them

197
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:02,120
are in the same spot but the third one that appeared and came down is now on the road in

198
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:09,320
front of us just about 150 yards away between us and the highway and we couldn't drive forward

199
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:16,520
we didn't want to go back because we just left three on the riverbank and so you can imagine the

200
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:26,200
fear that was in in my truck my son he was in bad shape these three guys were freaked out bad but

201
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:34,920
the weird thing danny was i wasn't afraid anymore i'd lost all my fear somehow i was curious i

202
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:41,400
wanted to get out and walk up to it but they won't have any part of that and that was one weird thing

203
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,880
i couldn't figure out is is it took my fear away i was afraid when i first went up and saw it and

204
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:54,360
to run down the hill but as it appeared again i was mesmerized i wasn't afraid but they were

205
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:01,000
terrified there were there was everything happening from crying to this is the last

206
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,960
time i see my family please get me home they started fighting who was going to go home first

207
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:17,160
it's all in the book but that's how it all started in 2007 so after this experience and you guys

208
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,120
started driving the truck home there was there anything else that happened after you got home

209
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:30,120
how far away did you live from the river how long of a drive was it okay um that was only the

210
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:38,040
beginning when we got to the field now we're setting up in my truck five of us with this object

211
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:45,640
sitting in the road halfway to the road and two up over the road and suddenly we heard three gun

212
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,360
shots we don't know who was shooting move on and everybody investigated that they went around the

213
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,520
neighborhoods looking for witnesses and they found eight different witnesses halp obama from nassau

214
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,280
found and interviewed eight different people that saw it that night they were sitting on the porch

215
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:14,840
when they flew over or whatever so after the gunshots these this object in the road it just

216
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,640
it's not sitting on the road is hovering five feet off the road it's about 40 to 50 foot long

217
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:30,280
it looks like an egg or it looks like if you took a round ball or let's say a raindrop and you

218
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,080
set it on the ground and it just kind of flattens out kind of egg shake it's the

219
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,680
orbs around in the sky but when it's sitting on the ground it looked like a football

220
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:48,680
and it just pivots it don't turn it don't lean it just pivot straight at us and here it comes

221
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:56,120
down the road to us so it goes right over our truck about 50 feet above the truck i could have

222
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,040
shot it with a slingshot through the sunroof of my truck when it went over

223
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,080
and it pivots again to the north and it blasts off like a gunshot at poop

224
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:17,640
i took i took off couldn't go fast enough for these guys they were screaming yelling halfway

225
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,320
down that road to the to the first house we had to stop two and a half miles away

226
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,720
halfway in there is this curve this really sharp curve dead man's curve

227
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,680
i grew up that curve everybody in our community knew about that curve and it was so sharp if you

228
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,760
try to go around it more than 35 the car just bound up you could feel it on the edge of losing

229
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:54,120
control and the crazy thing is is

230
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:10,760
in 2000 shoot 1982 81 i was married to a different lady that died she died in that curve

231
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,520
and i found her of all the weird things i was i wasn't home i was at the coast and i came home

232
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,840
and drove up on her after she'd turned the car over and killed her right there

233
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:36,200
so this uh orb huge thing was hovering right over where she got killed and we had to drive up under

234
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,720
it and i tried to get out i wanted to get out and look at it and they won't have any part of it so

235
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,040
we had to move on but what it did the reason i brought this up is what it did it spoke to me

236
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:56,760
in a way that i understood and in these images it went right in my head and i relived the whole

237
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:05,960
thing that happened that night in 82 and it said don't worry anymore this is not your fault because

238
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,840
i had thought it was my fault and i should have been there but i was and i was out of town hunting

239
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:18,120
that day with my father and so i'd carried that for all those years this feeling of guilt

240
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:26,520
and it was removed that night right away and so i had to put that in there because it's really

241
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:32,600
important to understand the phenomenon you know i don't like to talk about this but if people are

242
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:42,840
going to understand it how it reacts it reacts based on emotion suffering thousands of people

243
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,360
reach out to me about this and they'll all say the same thing when they started seeing it they

244
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:56,360
lost a family member they lost their husband their wife a child pretty severe suffering brings them

245
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:07,400
and this is something everybody that studies this is aware of so um we left there never stopped

246
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,000
never stopped we were down to about 10 miles an hour i was trying to hit the brake they were

247
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,400
pounding on my seat go and so i hit the gas ended up having to go four miles further and take the

248
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,240
feathers got home first because they were fighting who got to go home first dropped him off came back

249
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:34,360
and dropped the other two guys off and then on our way home we went the long way because we didn't

250
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,480
want to go back under that same curve where that orb was setting my son didn't want any part of it

251
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,040
so anyhow we get to the house chris jr is running through the house locking every door

252
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,640
turning every light on inside outside and he would he would go in the bathroom even with

253
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,880
no windows he'd turn the light on and lock the door he was that afraid i was at my study trying

254
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,760
to find anything on tv we just knew we were being invaded the whole world you know that's what we

255
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:13,720
thought and i couldn't find anything it was just a normal night you know and it was the weirdest

256
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,040
thing we couldn't compute what had just happened and nothing's going on on television

257
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,480
and so when chris gets all his lights locked and doors locked and lights on the whole house

258
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:36,120
he runs back to where i'm at and suddenly the dogs start going crazy my dad lived next door

259
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:43,320
he had 15 hound dogs in a kennel he'd raised them all his life he'd up upwards of 100 dogs at one

260
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:53,880
time 104 so he's always raised dogs right so i know their sounds i know the different barks

261
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:04,200
and suddenly this whole pen full of dogs is barking in a in a fearful way they were scared

262
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,480
and i knew it the way they were sounding anybody would have detected they didn't know what they

263
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:16,360
were seeing but they were they were all going you know loud mouths hound dogs really are very loud

264
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:25,560
so imagine 15 of them all at one time just this terrible fearful sound about a year ago i started

265
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,560
working with this company called merrick health and i wanted to get a comprehensive breakdown of

266
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,200

269
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,520

284
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,600
off at checkout it's linked below now back to the show and so we had this chesapeake bay retriever

285
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:02,200
110 pound dog standing on the back doorsteps she's just sitting there and she was growling

286
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,120
and she was barking at the same time so i walked up to the back door and could see her through the

287
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,640
through the door and chris juniors got me by the shirt please dad don't go out there don't go

288
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:21,080
i'm like son somebody's breaking into dad's shop because his garage is next to the kennels plain

289
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,280
view of the kennel so all the dogs could see the garage and i had a lot of stuff in that garage i

290
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:35,320
still do my mom's house and all our tools and welders and boats and fishing gear we just i

291
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,880
just knew somebody was stealing something right and the dogs could see it and so i talked junior

292
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:51,800
into walking quietly with me with no flashlight using our chesapeake to stay in front of us and

293
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:58,680
keep us safe i just wanted to walk over and see if i could see who's getting in that shop try to

294
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:07,560
scare them away and when i opened that door rosie took off straight toward the kennel where the dogs

295
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:14,280
were and she ran out about 40 yards and looked back and then took on all so chris and i snuck

296
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:20,760
our way up to the dog kennel and when we got there the weird thing was all the dogs were looking

297
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:27,240
behind the pen in the woods not toward the garage and they were all barking every one of them it's

298
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,760
a pretty long kennel we put a whole lot of dogs in there and it was you know just imagine a 50

299
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:41,960
foot long kennel with dogs in each pen and they're all facing the back and rosie the chesapeake is

300
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:48,840
pointing she's she's froze and she's looking into the woods same direction as the other dogs

301
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,800
and chris and i stand in there and i said this is really weird maybe it's a bear or something

302
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,000
has snuck in here and dogs are usually afraid of a bear they'll make they'll sound different

303
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:10,680
and um so i said junior i'm going to send rosie in to whoever's in there she'll run them out

304
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:17,320
whatever it is deer or whatever i don't know but we made a plan we're going to send her in

305
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:23,080
then we were going to run back around to our property so it was two lots they were on my

306
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,840
dad's property or on his lot right so we were going to go back to ours and see if she pushes

307
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,480
something out across in front of us just to see what it was so i sent her in the woods she took

308
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:43,000
off wide open park and so junior and i ran hard as we could down this path back to the backyard

309
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,160
and i had to make a left and go to the back of the property another 60 yards i guess run so i

310
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:57,080
had to run fast to stay in front of whatever's coming out of there and what i didn't know was

311
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,240
this chris had me by the back of the shirt the whole time he didn't want to turn me loose

312
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:08,520
when i made that left turn to go to the back he pulled away from me i thought he just turned

313
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:15,240
to lose i actually slipped a little bit it was frost on the ground and i didn't know it but he

314
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,440
had all he could stand he ran back to the house opened the back door and went in and locked the

315
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,800
door i didn't know that i thought he was still behind me running so i ran all the way to the

316
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,360
back and i knew where there was a big oak tree back there i could run up to and stop myself

317
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,600
because you had to do this quick because dogs usually something in front of a dog will be way

318
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:44,200
ahead of them so i knew i had minutes to to see what was in there so i run up to this stop in a

319
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:51,240
to this tree in a full run stop myself and i'm trying to catch my breath i'm panting i'm panting

320
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,040
but i'm trying to be quiet right because i didn't want to scare whatever's coming toward me i could

321
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,600
hear the dog coming it wasn't far it's probably 20 yards in the woods come in my direction

322
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,240
so the minute i hit that tree i turned around to see if junior is coming behind me and junior

323
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:15,400
wasn't there but what was there from me to you away probably four foot i could have leaned over

324
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:23,160
and touched it with my hand a good thing i didn't somebody from nasa told me it would have killed

325
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,640
it did could have the energy from it so

326
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:36,840
there was a being standing there just like junia described it was that he saw on the river it was

327
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:44,760
three three and a half feet tall it looked like a child not like a gray alien you would think about

328
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:51,560
people talk about it was a little glowing the color of the moon soft glow

329
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:59,560
three and a half foot four-year-old looked like a four-year-old child head and face was a little

330
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:06,360
different definitely want human eyes were glowing red they look mechanical when you look at them

331
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,040
they look like the little markers on a transfer truck the side marker you see these little round

332
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:19,960
lights along the side they were about that size inch and a half it had this triangle on its chest

333
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,840
glowing this thing was glowing but it had a dark section that won't glow it was in shape of a

334
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:36,360
triangle and i knew i was in trouble the minute i saw it now this all happened so quick i ran

335
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,400
against that tree and i stopped myself and i looked back and i'm like oh my god what do i do

336
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:48,840
so i got closer to the tree i didn't want to get closer that way to turn around so i backed my back

337
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:56,680
against a tree and i'm facing this thing and i said i surrender i mean you no harm i'm sorry

338
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:05,880
you know i'm not here i was just i surrendered to it i just knew i was dead and i heard this voice say

339
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,520
you don't understand we're not here to hurt you we're here to help you

340
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,760
about that time rosie comes out of the woods she's still coming she's still tracking whatever

341
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,560
it is and it just vanished right in front of me just disappeared instead of telling

342
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,800
chris jr what had just happened i walked back up at the house and he's standing in the back door

343
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:37,800
looking for me and i was scared to tell him anymore because he was in shock right and um

344
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,280
i went in the end i was a smoker back then i had to have a cigarette i just had to have one i was

345
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:55,640
just basically hyperventilating i had smoke so i walked into my study i have a couch was a sunroom

346
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,520
had windows all the way around and my couch was backed up to these windows so i put my knees on

347
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:07,000
the couch and i reach over the back i raise i start to raise the blind and jr is freaking out

348
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,400
don't open the blind don't don't please don't and when i raised it up about halfway i was

349
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,160
going to open the window and smoke and blow it out the window right but he had all the lights on

350
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:29,880
around the house and there was this thing this being a tall one i don't um i drew it i painted

351
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,800
but it's not my wife thinks it's too scary so she hid my painting away

352
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,000
all right did she really yeah yeah so it's a four foot tall painting and she saw the same thing

353
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,200
is it scary emily it's a conversation piece in our house back in the day for sure she turned it

354
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,920
around and hid it somewhere i don't know where it is now it's in her in the pod somewhere in storage

355
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,720
she won't let me bring it out but anyhow that's what i saw coming about 20 yards outside

356
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:05,400
and remember all the all the flood lights were on so i could see it perfectly and how tall would

357
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:12,840
you say it was seven foot it freaked me out so bad that i shut the shutter down without telling

358
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:19,000
chris jr anything i'm trying to protect him as a dad right so i pulled the blind down grabbed him

359
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,160
by the hand ran out the front door jumped in my truck and we drove about five miles away to a big

360
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,200
hayfield set in the very middle of the hayfield until daylight the next morning

361
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,240
fray that's that was the beginning and the end of january the eighth of 07

362
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:44,680
and believe it or not he didn't leave out details it's a big story but they're all in the book yeah

363
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,880
so that seven foot being what would you like how did that thing look was there any details you could

364
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:59,960
see was it what did it look like it was a real biological thing you could touch it was a tall

365
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:12,600
two-legged two-armed humanoid figure that looked more tan looking than gray but it's similar to

366
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:19,400
these gray aliens that you hear people talk about you always said it had human eyes yeah it's huge

367
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:27,240
it had human eyes sort of yeah bigger but it looked more human looking

368
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:35,000
but it was was alien though with the pupil and like an iris or was it just all one it wasn't

369
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,560
all all one color okay but the way it looked at me and yeah it was it was a scary thing

370
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:52,840
so i haven't seen those since but it was there it was on my property and usually i've heard stories

371
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:59,240
that they kind of run together these taller guys and these small ones but i don't know i have no

372
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:05,400
clue so out of all the people that were there with you lot that night other than your son

373
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:13,880
has anyone else corroborated any of that yeah they do they told their story with the guys that were

374
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,960
there with you yeah they went on the discovery channel and told the story just like we did and

375
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,280
they reported to move on i have all their interviews from move on and they all corroborated

376
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:34,280
every bit of it and what happened with them was the same thing with me they had children my

377
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:43,240
children's age or older and or younger all three of them married with children and they were just

378
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:49,000
good old country boys that worked for my dad as subcontractors with families and they all went to

379
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,200
school with my kids the most of them either elementary or middle school or high school

380
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:03,960
and so when the discovery channel made their show in 2008 they made a circus out of us

381
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,600
they made me look like a like i was crazy and a liar and they tried to discredit all of us when

382
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:16,120
they told us different they were going to they were going to vindicate us that's why we all

383
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:22,920
agreed because we were catching so much slack from the community it became worse because of

384
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,320
that documentary my children were at school and they would get made fun of and she'd come home

385
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,920
crying from teachers and their kids in school making fun of their what was going on right

386
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,000
so that was uh that shut them up to never want to talk about it ever again

387
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:49,320
that's why you don't hear much from them so after after this happened did you tell anybody else

388
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:55,960
did you tell your family immediately or did you keep it to yourself yeah i told everybody i thought

389
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,760
it was the most wonderful thing on planet earth you know this we're not alone you know we've

390
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:10,280
always been told that there nothing exists even people say god doesn't exist so it's all faith

391
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:19,240
you know you there's only us and we were created by evolution this time you know enough time

392
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:27,320
anything can create itself that's what they say so i just experienced something that uh

393
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:35,240
what i didn't say was the next day when we left the hayfield and came home i came home and was

394
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,760
worried about my medication because i'd take medicine every day and if i missed it i would

395
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:49,880
get worse couldn't miss one day it just had to stay regular and i didn't feel sick the next morning

396
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:59,560
and i didn't take any medication just for the crones for the crones and i haven't had a symptom

397
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:09,960
since then period went away that night and i was so sick that she can tell you i was uh i was in

398
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,920
the bathroom 20 times a day 25 at the worst when it was at the worst point that's what crones does

399
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:28,600
to you very painful you know it's an intestinal disease right right right so so i told the world

400
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:39,160
you know this is what happened suddenly i became um a laughing stock and i was playing with demons

401
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:46,840
you're playing with the devil himself and for long the churches were coming uh sprinkling

402
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:54,600
holy water on my kids on my house on my property on me really yeah like when you would go to church

403
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,920
well i wasn't going to church then because i was told if you you can't come if you ever talk about

404
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:09,960
this again so i'm like i'm gonna talk about it and so i never went back and how did word get

405
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,520
spread like throughout like emily you said you saw the people at school were like cracking jokes how

406
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,960
did how did everyone find out about it was well it's a small community and you know dad was born

407
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,760
and raised our generations of our family are from that area and so the people that are from there

408
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:31,080
know each other very well and dad and my mom also were prominent business people in town so

409
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:38,680
everyone knew who we were anyway and so when one person found out about this oh chris bloodsoe is

410
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,720
crazy the whole community finds out and then you go to the grocery store and people you know

411
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:49,480
recognize you and know things and people at school and then the documentary came out a year later

412
00:43:49,480 --> 00:44:00,520
and it was impossible to keep it hidden from everybody it it it sent um the first five years

413
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:07,320
i called five years of darkness and that was uh that was the first year it happened

414
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:14,600
uh the second year after the discovery channel did their thing from the second year on it just

415
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:21,000
got worse i mean it got so bad that i didn't want to ever talk about it again and i actually

416
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,920
went outside and shouted to the heavens i'm done with you you know why do you do this to me

417
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:33,400
why is my children affected now you came in and you healed me and now i've got this problem

418
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,960
right and it's important to note that through these five years of you know we call darkness

419
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,320
not because of the phenomenon because in those five years we were having continued experiences

420
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:50,520
together and separately like i was 10 years old when this happened in 2007 and throughout all of

421
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:56,600
those years we were seeing things and then going and being ridiculed publicly and you know in

422
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,080
different circles while we were still having the experiences so there was a lot of like

423
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,760
cognitive dissonance there with like oh we're actually seeing it but nobody believes us and

424
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,720
it's still happening so this first experience sort of unlocked a whole

425
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:18,280
bag of other experiences on everybody absolutely on all of us yeah even you last night

426
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:29,160
so what other types of experiences are we talking about well go ahead you can talk i mean anything

427
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,240
you can think of really i've seen things we've seen things like jump off of the table without

428
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,520
being touched like moving things moving on their own seeing shadow figures being touched

429
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,120
anything like you would think it was a haunted house growing up but that's you know part of how

430
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:54,040
we explain that this is all spiritual in nature is because it can really manifest in any way that

431
00:45:54,040 --> 00:46:01,400
it wants to and so the phenomenon is not limited to what people think of as aliens or ufos where

432
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,840
we were obviously seeing orbs every night as well we were seeing things in the home

433
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:13,080
that you would think of as like ghostly maybe yeah but it was all the same stuff when did the

434
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:20,440
orbs the orb sighting start immediately after never quit from 2007 that night it just continued

435
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:26,840
to the so from then on you just started noticing things in the sky it was in my face it was uh

436
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,640
yeah i mean i write about it in the book so many stories that we didn't write about

437
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:41,080
the i wrote 140 000 words for this book and we published 85 or 90 000 that's including

438
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:48,280
introduction so there's a lot that we didn't include but um daddy would wake us kids up

439
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,160
because mom didn't really like you know the the conflict with the phenomenon so she didn't

440
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,320
really encourage the experiences but dad would secretly wake me and my two other brothers

441
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:05,560
uh ryan and jeremy up at like whatever time of night and we would go out on school nights at

442
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:11,880
2 a.m 3 a.m and just look at orbs in the yard right in our face and then we would go to bed

443
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,400
and go to school the next morning like nothing happened some of these orbs would be 50 feet

444
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:24,520
around and a hundred yards away yeah huge bigger and biggest trees and flying some of them through

445
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,120
the trees and sitting out there for hours we had one blue orb that just stayed there for

446
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,320
everybody walked by the door and we looked through the wind and see it going through the trees and

447
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:43,800
stuff this now do these orbs make any sounds sometimes they do sometimes they do not all of

448
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:49,160
them but if they're close enough you can hear them what what how would you describe the sound

449
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:59,400
like a ringing like a buzzing kind of energetic electrical electrical sizzling if you heard it

450
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,400
you ever took a taking a light switch and when you go to turn it on an old switch especially you

451
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:11,880
hear a crackle sometimes when you go from yeah on to off that's a lot of what it sounds like a

452
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:20,760
crackling sizzling sound any there is there any other is there a smell no smell no smell

453
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,840
and what about the colors the color what is the color spectrum of them what is the range of colors

454
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:34,920
that you see nearly all of them all of them can change colors there i don't think there's a you

455
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,240
hear people say oh there's a red one and it's mean and there's a yellow one and there's an orange one

456
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:44,920
and there's these green ones will kill you i've heard so many people talk about that but it's

457
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:53,720
from my experience they're all the same they're just how they decide to appear in color but they

458
00:48:53,720 --> 00:49:01,800
usually will start out white and shift from white to red so everything in between yellow orange

459
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:07,560
blood red back to white yellow orange and that spectrum but occasionally they're blue

460
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:14,040
they'll they'll they'll go from red to white to blue this bluish white light

461
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,920
not like an american flag thing but you know they're pulsed they're shifting red you'll see

462
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,720
you'll see the red end with the blue several videos of blue ones what is this photo right

463
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:34,600
here we're looking at that far if you look at christopher that's chris jr if you look

464
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:40,200
at his left shoulder behind him where the woods are that's where i had the encounter with the

465
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:47,320
three-foot being oh really yep and that's where they landed the orbs landed in my yard you can see

466
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:55,400
this circle here is two years old the grass still not growing it killed the grass except for a little

467
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:01,800
donut in the middle and those streaks you see behind him or where two other orbs came from

468
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,800
different directions and scooted along the ground burning the grass until they sat down

469
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,440
and created their circles so there were three of those circles in the yard and move on tested

470
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,640
that as well what can you explain what move on is move on is the mutual ufo network

471
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:25,320
that's who you call if you have a sighting and you want to report it you call those guys and

472
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,880
or go on their website and you can put your sighting in and that's what what so it's basically

473
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,320
it's just people scattered around the country that are interested in the topic and they just

474
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:38,360
donate their time to right research it and collaborate it's a pretty big outfit and they

475
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,560
have you know they have board members full-time people there but it's basically a

476
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:54,360
volunteer the investigators are mostly volunteers there so but yeah they they they tested that soil

477
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,640
and the funny thing is the tree back in that back corner there's a big oak tree

478
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:06,040
in the woods where i run up to it and stood there with this being from me

479
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:13,720
and it the tree just died limbs fell big huge tree it's just crumbled down just like the top

480
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:20,600
of that burning tree remember that orb that orbs where that orb landed there is 12 feet from the

481
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:28,360
tree i'll show you right here this is the well here's a better photo so when it come over the

482
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:33,960
tree one of those orbs the one that had the full circle the other two had tracks leading up to

483
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:40,200
where they landed right but the other one chris jr was standing at actually we believe came over

484
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:46,040
the top of that tree and he radiated it because you can see 40 feet of the tree is missing

485
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,520
broke right off it looks like it's burnt off at the top it wasn't burnt it just broke and

486
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:59,880
fell it died really tree died and then um caught fire so the so the first time you noticed this

487
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:07,320
you just saw the tree in your yard burning yeah we have a video of it it was uh oh there's a video

488
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:14,360
yeah do we have that yeah we can find it okay yeah but mom tried to put the fire out three times and

489
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:20,600
it came back there you go top one here we go it lit itself on fire three times that night at nine

490
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:27,080

493
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,120
here we go you see the grass is wet where the headlights

494
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,800

496
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,160

501
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:39,960
the patio lit up a cigarette and i could see this tree is 75 yards from the house back in the back

502
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:48,120
of the property in the middle of nowhere and um i saw sparks come from the ground and go up it

503
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,560
looked like the little bottle rocket she'd shoot off the little tiny ones that red sparkles that's

504
00:53:53,560 --> 00:54:00,600
what it looked like they came out and they went weird looking so my wife is coming back down the

505

hall and she could see through the back door see me um on the patio but she could see all the way

506
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:11,400
to that tree she opened the door and said what's going on with that tree i said i don't know i see

507
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:18,440

508
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:25,000
flames and it was dead now look this is after the fire it came back how long after the fire is this

511
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:46,920
um april of 2012 and we'll talk about the lady here it's in my book prominently about the lady

512
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:56,520
and um easter saturday night easter the night before easter of 2012

513
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:05,320
i was so distraught because of the way my kids were being traded i'm a big guy you know i got

514
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:10,760
to the point where i didn't care you can laugh at me you can call me crazy you can do what you want

515
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,880
i don't care you just won't be my friend anymore i don't need need you in my life that's kind of

516
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:24,440
what i thought about everybody that i grew up with cousins just family and friends so i'd wash my

517
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:33,000
hands with them but now it's affecting my children extremely bad it made fun of and and all so

518
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:43,320
i was desperate to prove to the world that i had actually experienced something that i won't crazy

519
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:48,520
because they'd labeled me that the whole community or you're playing with the devil one of the two

520
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:56,040
and i knew different i knew i was praying to god and these balls of fire came i knew they took my

521
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:02,040
crowns away i knew it wasn't the devil if it was what a big trick why does the devil answer prayer

522
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:13,560
if it does i don't want to be praying right so um i had uh given up that night and i walked outside

523
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:19,960
and i said look i've been trying to film you you're in my house you're around my family

524
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:28,120
everybody here sees your presence these orbs this is an intelligent they're intelligent beings

525
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:37,560
these orbs are beans they're individual beings sometimes more than one and so i shouted to the

526
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:43,240
heavens i'm done you won't let me film you you won't let me share you with my mom and dad lives

528
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:56,360
back in our family's face so it was like it was it was so real to us as a group of six people

i'm done with you you have ruined my life thank you for healing me i'm not sick anymore but my

548
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:59,400
home crying and and three boys 15 16 eight 17 years old trying to date girls and now they're

549
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:07,240

550
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:14,200
with you i'll never speak of you again don't come around me don't come in my house i'm done with you

551
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:21,560
and that's what i did and i walked in i went to bed my kids were there because of easter they

552
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:27,080
always had friends come over so the house was full of children and they were in the front part of the

553
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:34,120
house playing video games and i'm in the back alone my wife's sleeping with her because the

554
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:41,640
boys had all these boys over and mom's standing guard right so so she's she i'm totally by myself

555
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:48,440
so i'm i'm asleep three o'clock in the morning three o'clock on the dot i heard this voice say

556
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:55,160
arise in a manly voice i mean it sounded like thunder it was so loud and it woke me up from a

557
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:01,720
dead sleep till i jumped up out of bed and to a sitting position and i looked around the room

558
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:07,400
panicked i said i heard that who's in here if it had been my wife it wouldn't have startled me but

559
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,920
because it was a deep thunderous manly voice it scared me to death

560
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,400
and i looked straight at my clock had old desktop clock back then everybody had alarm clock right

561
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:27,000
i don't use one so now we use the cell phones yeah i looked and it said 3 a.m and i could see

562
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,280
movement in my room it looked like these shadowy figures that we've been used to seeing they were

563
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:39,240
at the bed foot of my bed these shadowy figures and what they did i don't know they put me in

564
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:46,840
some sort of trance like thing to where i stood i got out of bed i was in just my underwear

565
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:53,480
i put on full jeans pants shirt shoes and i walked right out the back door following them

566
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:01,480
and we went back out to the dog kennel to where everything had happened before right just right

567
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:09,480
up to the dog kennel and just before we got to the kennel one of these beings stopped and turned

568
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:16,600
and handed me this object with two hands just like this handed it to me and i reached out and

569
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:23,800
i took it said this is yours you must keep so when i grabbed it it felt like a hedgehog

570
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:29,400
it's prickly it wasn't hurting but it was prickly and it felt like it was a living

571
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,680
like a dog but it had no head or no legs i could see it but it scared me really bad the way it

572
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:43,560
hit my hands i dropped it on the ground this boy said no you must keep that this is yours you must

573
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:50,200
keep so i reached down to pick it up and when i did when i stood up they were gone there was no more

574
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:56,760
beans in front of me and i thought what am i going to do with this thing and i'm juggling it and i

575
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,640
thinking quick and so i opened the dog kennel and i set it in the kennel and closed the door

576
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,920
thinking you'll be safe there i don't know what it is this has all happened so quick

577
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:14,280
and the minute i closed that door i stood up and this blast of wind

578
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:22,760
it was so strong this wind it was a mighty wind but it was localized it wasn't the trees around

579
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:31,160
me it wasn't the forest it was a blast of air in a circle in front of me that the tree this

580
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:38,920
oak tree in front of me just disappeared into a black hole and out of that hole came this wind

581
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:45,880
which pushed me backwards really quick it was like so fast it caught me off balance and i fell all

582
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:52,840
the way to my back flattened the leaves and as i'm falling i could see what looked like a

583
01:02:54,200 --> 01:03:00,200
a 1500 pound bull a cowl come out of that hole ran right over top of me

584
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:06,120
and i could see through it i could see the stars right up through it but i could see this bull

585
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:14,280
and so i land on my back and i roll to my stomach and when i roll and i'm trying to get up right

586
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:20,280
i'm going to run it happens within seconds i hit my back i roll to my stomach i'm facing the other

587
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:25,080
way so i'm trying to get to my knees and to my feet to run to know where this thing went

588
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:36,840
and immediately the cowl wasn't there it was a woman beautiful beyond measure she was glowing

589
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:47,320
this bluish white color and she had this um white dress on that sparkled when it was flowing dress

590
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:53,800
just moved and it looked like an old roman dress it went all the way to her feet and and sleeves out

591
01:03:53,800 --> 01:04:01,480
to her hands here and a collar there's a painting of her right there that was done you painted this

592
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:09,320
no the man standing to me is a famous artist from new york doug ald and doug painted that

593
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:14,040
just out of you know what i described to him you can see the bull to the right there

594
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:22,360
and there's actually a triangle on her chest he put it on there and

595
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:31,960
and pretty crazy that painting's big but her face is different but that's similar to what was in

596
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:38,520
front of me so three foot floating in front of you yeah three foot off the ground but six foot away

597
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:44,600
from six foot away and the size of her was it like the normal size of a human she was smaller

598
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:50,200
smaller see-through could you not see no she was solid as you are yeah but her mouth wasn't moving

599
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:57,000
but i could hear her planet's day talking to me but she was hovering barefooted just like that

600
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:04,840
three feet off the ground and she looks at me i'm just in this biggest shock words can't describe

601
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:14,120
how the power i felt from this wind and this bull run me over and the fear that set in flight

602
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:22,840
i had to run you know i had this instant fear hit me but now i'm looking at this woman so the whole

603
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:29,560
fear thing turned into oh my god what is this is an angel what am i looking at

604
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:38,360
she leans over and she looks at me and she says this is your burden she said first she said you

605
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:45,720
know why i'm here and i knew why she was there because i had struggled internally for five

606
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:51,480
years these orbs come and it talks telepathically i hear them and we proved this on the history

607
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:58,600
channel live with andy right they knew that my brain was communicating with the orbs even though

608
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:07,160
i wasn't moving we did this on camera and neuroscientists measuring my brainwaves they could

609
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:14,600
tell so i'd had for all these years this overwhelming desire to tell the world

610
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:21,880
the more i told it the worse it got the worst ridicule and it spilled over to my children

611
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:31,480
so that's why i was ready to quit but she said this is your burden you got to bear and she said

612
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:36,280
um several things and this is

613
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,840
i've been telling this for a long time about the times we're in now

614
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:49,240
you know we're in some pretty weird times right but she told me about that and i put it out there

615
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:57,720
2012 this happened easter of 2012 she said um there's going to be trouble coming

616
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:03,960
in and we're going to wake the people up and we're going to let you do it we're going to use you

617
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:11,640
we want to help you introduce us to the world that's what she said and um

618
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:21,400
she told me about an alignment she said there's going to be uh she said when the red

619
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:28,280
she said when the star of regulus when the star of regulus arises on the horizon

620
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:34,280
in the gaze of the sphinx at that time there will be a shift in the knowledge of humanity

621
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:39,160
that's what she said i didn't know what it meant i had no clue if this star would align on

622
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:46,680
star of a regulus regulus a star called regulus when it aligns on the gaze of the sphinx

623
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:53,080
before daylight when that star comes up and it's right just above the horizon like the orbs last

624
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:59,640
night right on the ground in view of the sphinx there'll be a shift in in the knowledge there'll

625
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:09,000
be a new knowledge for humanity so i told that also saw visions of trouble that would happen

626
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,320
beforehand which is we've been having weird troubles right so i'm not a prophet and i don't

627
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:21,400
want to claim to be but i did say this in 2012 and i've said it for the last what 11 years

628
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:31,400
and it's all happening so the amazing thing is danny is um i went from totally

629
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:39,560
quitting and announcing it to the heavens i'm never going to do this again to a new renewed

630
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:46,120
energy of now what am i going to do if i tell this about the lady they're going to come lock

631
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:50,600
me up they're going to think i'm crazy for sure so i didn't say anything for a while

632
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:59,560
and two weeks later a week later i had vowed not to ever speak about it again one week later

633
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:05,880
i get a call from the move line saying we want you to talk in ashville ashville north carolina

634
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:14,920
which is six hours away and i readily accepted yeah i want to talk so i was a different attitude

635
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:22,040
towards it and that's where i met diana posolka two weeks after the lady came and i started

636
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:28,920
talking about the lady in that conference and the audience began to heckle me they made fun

637
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:35,240
they didn't want to hear about the lady they wanted to hear about the the river event so it

638
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:42,920
was a very traumatic thing and none of that bonded diana and i for all these years to where

639
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:50,840
that's how we became to know one another but the crazy thing is is immediately when she left

640
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:58,760
that's when i began to document everything i could get pictures i could take you out and share it with

641
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:09,480
you only after she came only after the lady came yep what do you think the bull symbolized

642
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:18,920
i don't know but i know this it got the attention of diana and the vatican

643
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:31,080
and cia nasa and everybody dod even the ministry of defense in britain australia

644
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:38,440
all these people they wanted to know about the lady immediately let me tell you in fact i put it

645
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:45,880
in writing to two generals at the pentagon what she told me i was asked to do that i have there

646
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,440
i mean i there's i have a whole bunch of questions in my head right now but i want

647
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:55,400
to try to figure out how to pick this apart a little bit first of all steve do you remember

648
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:00,760
when we were talking to randall the other day we were going through the different ages in the great

649
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:10,280
year yeah um what what age are we in now as far as like the constellations that's the first thing

650
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:15,720
i thought about is like the age of the bull and the lion it wasn't an aquarius we're an

651
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:20,360
aquarius right now like that song age of aquarius right right oh yeah we were singing the age of

652
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:27,480
aquarius and what's the next one is there a way you can pull up like a diagram uh that circular

653
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:34,520
diagram he was showing us well let me tell you what she told me she said that there was a shift

654
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:43,320
in the powers of the heavens and that she had been away the feminine energy was about to come

655
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:49,960
back and they won't know stopping it and that there would be a shift and that that shift would

656
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:57,800
be into aquarius and that the divine feminine would come back as the energy that would create

657
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:04,280
a thousand years of peace that's what she told me it'd be trouble first but in time that peace

658
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:13,400
would come to this world all right so it goes aries torus gemini cancer leo virgo libra

659
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:19,960
scorpio sagittarius okay aquarius followed by pisces okay so we get a long way to go before

660
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:26,680
we're in torus again interesting but you know the lady in in egypt

661
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:35,400
is depicted hathor with bull horns or a bull next to her many countries the lady is always

662
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:43,400
depicted as with a bull or either have bull horns with a solar disc or beside the bull

663
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:49,720
so it goes hand in hand with her throughout many countries what did diana say about the lady

664
01:12:50,280 --> 01:13:00,040
did she have any speculation about who she was yeah they quickly referred me to the fadima lady

665
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:08,040
and the lady of guadalupe the lady of lord's france and fadima and there's several others

666
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:13,240
there's one in egypt that i don't know the name can you pull up the lady of guadalupe

667
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:23,000
yep um now the sphinx there's been people that have speculated the sphinx was originally a lion

668
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:29,160
yeah what's weird is regulus is in the leo constellation

669
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:34,040
regulus is in the leo constellation so when the leo constellation comes up

670
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:41,480
in a lens with that brightest star called regulus is there images i think it's leo

671
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:47,560
pretty sure it's leo okay this is the lady of guadalupe yeah so the yeah that was the

672
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:57,640
first time you saw the lady and when did she did she give you a specific time when things

673
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:05,400
were going to change with humanity she's you know i've seen her more than one time and um yes

674
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:14,120
yes i didn't hear from her except at easter of 2013 she came back

675
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:22,840
okay yeah regulus it is a constant star it's the star of leo the lion heart yep and when she told

676
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:30,840
me when that star aligns on the horizon before daylight and in the gaze of the sphinx it would

677
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,320
be a shift in the knowledge of humanity a new knowledge and that's what she told me

678
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,280
but there would be trouble along the way first and they gave me the images of war

679
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:50,680
i even wrote that i saw israel bomb iran and syria and we're looking at it right now i put

680
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:55,960
that in writing for years i'm not talking today i did it i've said this for a long time

681
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,880
yeah and it's it's coming it's happening

682
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:08,440
let's hope it don't but it's looking that way at what point did you start getting visited by

683
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:20,040
people in government and people in nasa or cia 2007 2008 so right after yeah well i didn't report

684
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:28,600
the incident until october so it happened in january of 2007 i come home telling this and my

685
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:36,840
wife was so afraid the kids were scared they didn't know what was happening the church um being in a

686
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:42,440
pentecostal holiness church i was a deacon in the pentecostal church so you can imagine pentecostal

687
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:46,600
church is way different that's dr povenmeyer how povenmeyer

688
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:55,720
so they immediately related it to the demons so my wife is trying to keep the family

689
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:04,280
under control and hush me up about it so i didn't talk about it for 10 months other than my kids

690
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:09,080
orbs would be in the yard at night two in the morning i'd wake them up and bring them outside

691
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:16,760
and say look your daddy's not crazy there they are right so um my wife began to experience it

692
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:24,760
i think in the well what time was it in 07 when she got shoved in the kitchen it must have been

693
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:31,880
in the fall it was a few months later she got shoved in the kitchen yeah yeah twice dad had

694
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:37,240
been praying you know that mom would have an experience so she would believe him and she was

695
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:44,600
doing the dishes and no one was awake or around and some something shoved her into the sink

696
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:48,680
and it scared her so bad she said don't ever pray for me again

697
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,880
shoved her twice but i don't blame her yeah so i didn't speak about it for the first 10 months

698
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:05,240
and it was october um that i had cable finally we didn't even have cable i couldn't afford it

699
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:11,000
had no tv other than local you know you get a few channels with a rabbit ear

700
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:19,560
and so we got cable and i started researching ufos how do i tell somebody who do i talk to

701
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:25,960
i've got to get this out of my head or i'm going to go crazy because my heads hurt really bad

702
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:32,840
every time i tried to think about the subject i would go into almost uh pass i did pass out

703
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:37,400
very often it would it would hurt so bad i would pass out in front of everybody

704
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:46,280
it was it my brain had a lock on it and um so it was october i saw it a move on ad on the

705
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:53,800
history channel about uh stanton friedman this nuclear physicist was talking and the first time

706
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:59,240
i'd seen a show like that i thought he's pretty cool if this guy would tell it i'm going to tell

707
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:07,080
so i googled them and found their application to submit a report and i wrote it out

708
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:14,520
two weeks went by i attempted to push that button and i knew if i pushed that button i'm gonna lose

709
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:20,840
my wife that's what i thought i was under that much stress so after two weeks i agonized

710
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:28,040
finally i hit send and i felt this relief but i didn't expect to hear anything back right so

711
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:33,080
within a week i get this call within days a couple of days i get a call from move on out

712
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:38,680
of california saying we want to come see you like right away and i'm like oh no you can't do that

713
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:46,120
i just wanted to say it right so i told them no and they kept calling me and talk and calling

714
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:57,400
and calling and come january of 08 or right around the first of january um they wrote me again and i

715
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:02,840
finally said i've got to tell this i can't hold it no longer so i said yeah you can come

716
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:13,000
and it was february of 08 when the first person showed and that's when i told my wife was sitting

717
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,480
there on the couch while the investigator was there and she looked over at him and she and i

718
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:23,960
hadn't talked about this period only me and the kids she was always busting at me don't get them

719
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:29,880
out of bed you know they gotta go to school and that's when she asked uh steve the investigator

720
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:37,400
if you ever seen any shadowy beings and i've been seeing them and i got shoved in the kitchen

721
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:42,520
and i said my prayer is working i've been praying you would experience this and she looked at me

722
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:48,040
and pointed her finger said don't you ever pray for me again like that we all thought it was funny

723
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:53,720
but that was the first time you ever heard her talk about shadowy figures yeah

724
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,320
she wouldn't talk around me she would around them but she wouldn't me and she was trying to hide it

725
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:09,560
you know but um it just became uh within two weeks um within two weeks of the move on coming to my

726
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:16,200
house in february they had already talked me into doing a documentary with the discovery channel

727
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:21,720
this will vindicate you the whole neighborhood and know you're you're not lying about it so they

728
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:29,080
talked me into it and that was a bad mistake bad because it turned the opposite way i don't think

729
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:35,800
they ever believed it would happen again i didn't think that because it don't normally happen somebody

730
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:43,640
see something that's it but it didn't stop it came back and did you ever see any of those

731
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:50,040
three-foot childlike beings again yeah yeah i sure did in fact there's a picture of them

732
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:57,000
i'm trying to find it i can't it's there seem to find the photo but and you you mentioned the first

733
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,960
time during the river experience when that first being explained to you he wasn't there to harm

734
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:07,560
you he was only there to help you right was there any other communication any other times that you

735
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:14,520
saw them or experienced them yep two nights later this was on uh it was a monday night when

736
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:20,520
we had the experience on the river chris jr and the group wednesday night my wife wasn't coming

737
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,880
home to friday right so we're staying the rest of the week there just jr and i and wednesday night

738
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:34,440
um i'm struggling with chris jr because he's in shock and he's had a really scary experience

739
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:44,040
right um he was in a bad way and so um wednesday night it was about nine o'clock eight thirty or

740
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:52,040
nine at night suddenly we're at home he and i watching television just dad and son and these

741
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:59,480
same dogs start barking again same way scary part so i ran to the back door and could look out over

742
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:05,480
the whole property out through the back full glass back door and there was a christmas tree farm

743
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:11,880
beside us a big one they had new trees where people would they would send them out you know

744
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:17,960
cut all these trees down but it was a section of that christmas tree farm that was overgrown you

745
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:26,600
see the far back right corner on the woodlands our property line but on the other side of that

746
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:32,200
excuse me was this huge christmas tree farm i can see it looks like a wall of trees yeah so um

747
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:38,440
the trees were so big that they grew together so there was no walking through the place there

748
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:44,840
were 40 foot tall spruce pine trees but underneath you could get down on your knees and there was no

749
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:51,480
weeds at all it was just these short little pine needles and there was a section three feet of

750
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:58,600
height underneath all them trees you could see for a long ways and so i just crossed the fence

751
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:04,360
the lights were flashing pulsating in the christmas trees the whole tree was lit up treat the farm

752
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:10,840
and i knew what it was because we'd seen it monday night on the river these white big white orbs

753
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:20,040
flashing and um i don't know what got into me but it was a change in my life at that moment

754
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:26,760
because i had been a hunter i was raised with a rifle and a shotgun i shot my first deer at

755
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:32,840
five years old i was shot in the back at 10 years old had a near-death experience nearly

756
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:37,640
you know i was the luckiest guy in the world and when i was 10 years old blew a hole in me

757
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:42,040
but it's big big as an orange shot in the back with a shotgun yes from me to you

758
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:48,440
that's a whole nother story the scar is still the size of like a big orange or a grapefruit

759
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:54,360
yeah right straight in line with my heart right there if i pull up my shirt you can see lead

760
01:23:54,360 --> 01:24:01,960
right here through the skin yeah that was the first near death and so i don't know why

761
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:12,040
but i was angry i just seeing my son get upset again all over because now we got two nights later

762
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:17,720
these lights in the backyard again and it's taken me two days to kind of calm him down and now he's

763
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:25,240
freaked out bad oh my god he's just really freaked and so i just had this bit of rage

764
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:32,280
come in me and i walked over to the gun cabinet and i grabbed a little holster 44 magnum rifle

765
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:37,800
a little short saddle gun i used to bear hunt with i'm on record boone and crocket record book

766
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:44,200
for shooting 660 pound black bear wow north carolina so big it was a record at that time

767
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:48,600
uh still in the probability top five but um

768
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:56,360
i took that gun and i said you come with me general he said no i'm not i'm not going out

769
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:01,320
that door he said please don't leave me dad i said son i'm going to end this tonight that's what i

770
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:07,880
taught him i was just being a father i guess so i walked back to that back far back right corner

771
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:14,280
and i went through that little opening you see walked another 50 yards to the along that side

772
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:21,160
and there was a fence there old hog fence that the trees had fallen over in one spot so it

773
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:26,040
wasn't used anymore but it was crunched down and i knew it there i didn't want to cross that fence

774
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:33,800
until i got back there so i could step over it so i stepped over that fence and the first 10 yards

775
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:42,040
of that tree farm was nothing but pine so there was a buffer area of pines and then there's the

776
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:47,480
wall of christmas trees sure wall i mean there's no going through it you couldn't drive a car

777
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:54,200
through a bulldozer so i got on my knees and i started under and i could see this orb is about

778
01:25:54,200 --> 01:26:01,640
50 yards away we're not even that far 50 60 feet 70 feet maybe and it was pulsating i could see the

779
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:09,160
bottom three feet of it that's all the view i had three feet of view under there so i crawled

780
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:16,360
dragon neck guns under these trees until i got about 20 feet from that orb 20 maybe 30 feet

781
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:24,440
and the electricity from it the buzz the static my whole body felt like needles the hair was

782
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:31,080
standing up and every bump goose bump on me was just tingling and the energy was so strong i

783
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:37,880
couldn't go any closer i just turned around and i backed away walked back out of the forest

784
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:45,800
crawled out and i got to the pine trees where the fence was crunched i stood up and i went to step

785
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:50,280
over that fence and the minute i went to step over that fence there were two of these beings

786
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:56,040
disappeared right in front of me one on i mean they're standing like three feet from me

787
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:03,000
and just enough gap i could walk between them and immediately i felt this

788
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:12,040
shame come over me shame that i had this rifle why i brought this to fight something that

789
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:18,040
there ain't no fighting right so i took the gun and i tried to hide it behind me

790
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:26,360
me and what they put in my head was what changed me from that point on i never

791
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:35,320
hunted again i don't harm bugs i have uh away with animals now nobody understands

792
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:42,920
i have 50 100 ducks wild ducks will fly in and fly right up to me if you come out there they're

793
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:50,680
gone but they'll fly right up and eat from me feed them wild mallards and if anybody knows

794
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:56,920
about mallard ducks they're one of the most skittish creatures in the world they fly it

795
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:03,720
you know thousands of feet high at 80 miles an hour and you need duck calls and blinds and

796
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:09,400
decoys in the water to get one to land well i have whole flocks of them fly right in and eat

797
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:16,120
i can feed them but that wasn't like that before but these beings told me that

798
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:25,720
they changed me they told me that um the way they put it in my head when i say told me they

799
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:31,320
don't really talk they put images that you know it's just telepathic i guess you could say

800
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:43,240
but it made me understand that the whole world is um is a living is alive everything from the grass

801
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:53,400
to every single animal bird tree all had a consciousness they even put images and to me

802
01:28:53,400 --> 01:29:01,240
to me of the cells in the body like and within the human body there there you don't tell

803
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:12,200
your body what to do something outside of us is telling our body how to function the molecules

804
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:22,280
the the um each cell that divides from one cell to the other has a conscience so um i'm just a

805
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:29,880
part of that i can't get the words out i want to say but it just changed me in such a way

806
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:37,080
that i began to cry about everything i've cried for the last seven eight ten years i guess

807
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:41,640
about everything when i see something get hurt it just kills me

808
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,200
but it came from that experience with these beings on how they told me how everything's a living

809
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:57,560
consciousness and i don't have the right to take its life that um we live in a mutual

810
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:06,440
holistic way like the your stomach for example you have bacteria in your stomach that digest

811
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:15,160
chlorophyll plant material the human can't do it but this bacteria does and it secretes the nutrients

812
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:22,760
that you get from that plant and it survives because you're feeding it the plant material

813
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:29,800
right so it's a mutualistic way we live and it's like a tree gives you wood for a house it gives

814
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:40,040
you shade for the sun a nest for a bird oxygen debris and the list goes on so everything has

815
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:46,520
a part of life on this planet and it's not up to us to destroy it and abuse it

816
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:55,240
and it's i could talk about this for days wow yeah it changed me and um this was in the very

817
01:30:55,240 --> 01:31:01,240
beginning how long did it take before you though were obviously the word had to get out but like

818
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:09,480
how long did it take before one of these guys like hal pavenmeyer from nasa to show up and and was

819
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:16,600
he the first one to show up and why why did he show up um remember the we got past this i guess

820
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:25,240
but february they came and did the report by june they were doing the documentary by late july august

821
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:33,560
i think it was how shows up at our house knocking on the door and i was away in town and my youngest

822
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:40,040
boy ryan answers the door there's a six foot four guy giant man standing at the door

823
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:47,560
yeah it was just ryan and i and he came and he was like is chris blood so here we're like uh no who

824
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:53,480
are you no calls no no no letters just showed up unannounced drove all the way from florida

825
01:31:53,480 --> 01:32:01,080
cape canaveral just on a wind and knocked on the door that's two and a half hours from here

826
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:08,360
yeah it was 13 hours to our house and so he drove and ryan calls me and he flashed some badges so

827
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:13,160
we let him in and we just like sat at the dinner table with him until dad came home

828
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:18,360
what was he talking what was he saying to you what was he asking you i don't remember everything

829
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:24,600
i was pretty young but he was just i mean mom came so we were talking and she was just asking

830
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:32,920
him questions and ryan was probably taking the lead i don't remember i was pretty shy what he did

831
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:42,760
was is um well to begin with this is in the book for the first five years we had been involved

832
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:47,960
with the ufo world on a limited scale you know they everybody heard about us they wanted us to

833
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:55,000
come speak they wanted to come visit and i let a few people come and the men in black was a big

834
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:05,560
thing back then that was about the year it all came out and so everybody was saying the government

835
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:12,280
will kill you don't speak to this one don't if you see somebody from the government that don't speak

836
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:18,760
i mean they put the fear of the government in my whole family and so who was they the well the

837
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:25,080
people associated with with the move on the people associated with move on which is the ufo world

838
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:31,560
basically you know so once that show came out it brought everybody that's involved in the ufo world

839
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:38,840
knocking on my door bringing groups of 10 15 20 people sometimes and they would come i'm not

840
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:45,400
saying it was move on as people associated with them the ufo world so they were all about the men

841
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:50,120
in black they're going to kill you they're going to kill you so when the government guy house shows

842
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:57,720
up at the house automatically it was fear we were all afraid and i didn't want to talk to him i

843
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:03,480
didn't want to have anything to do with him and for the first few months i would never give him

844
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:11,320
any information but yet he took to my children and he loved this one more than anything i mean

845
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:18,280
he came to my college graduation birthday parties recitals like wow he would drive all the way to be

846
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:25,400
a part of our family yeah he was always there and you know what he told me he said chris now he was

847
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:32,040
that when he died he had been at nasa still holding security clearances for 60 years that's how long

848
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:40,680
he's been there he worked with warner bum brown before it was nasa he took his astrophysics

849
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:49,640
degree in astronomy and astrophysics from jail and heineck at ohio state university he was like 15

850
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:59,320
when he graduated college how's a genius yeah freaking genius he was and so um why was he

851
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:05,560
interested in this why was he interested in you because they knew what i was saying that the word

852
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:10,520
the triangle the triangle in the chest of the being that was a big thing a little child with

853
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:19,720
a triangle the lady was 2012 that that happened later but that even brought more people but it was

854
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:25,080
they'd known they knew the phenomenon was real they've known it don't listen to them on tv i

855
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:30,840
mean they say we don't know we don't have anything yes they do they all know was this personal for

856
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:39,480
him or was this business this was part of a nasa sent him this wasn't just him like a side hobby

857
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:46,840
well no i wouldn't say nasa sent him because he would always tell us not to say that oh okay

858
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:53,080
because he wasn't supposed to be very selective with what he would say yeah what kind of questions

859
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:58,840
was he asking you everything you can imagine he would ask each member of the family the same

860
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:03,480
question separately to see if they would line up and he did this for years and years and one day

861
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:10,680
decided he couldn't debunk it and just decided he loved us and that's when we started you know

862
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:14,760
gaining like a friendly relationship with him and he like integrated into our family

863
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:20,920
that was after years of him trying to debunk us pretty much so he was coming there to cross

864
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:26,120
examine you guys to find holes in your story to see if basically he was sent he told us he was

865
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:32,520
sent to debunk this story that's what he told us he worked with j allen heinick he was the debunker

866
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:38,920
and we heard many stories how he would find a hole this person you know son of a sheriff fake

867
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:49,240
something he called him that's what he did and um but he also would come and stay days while we

868
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:56,440
weren't there didn't know he's in town he would be at the newspaper he'd be on every house on the

869
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:04,280
street where this phenomenon first appeared to us in 2007 he investigated every house within a

870
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:12,440
mile or two of that place and that's who found the eight other witnesses that testified to him

871
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:17,240
on his when he was getting the information that they had seen something that night and

872
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:24,600
and so that's what he did when he filled a real finally realized it was he couldn't blow a hole in

873
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:32,840
the story that too many knew it was real and he became a part of the family and he began to see

874
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:40,440

892
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:59,640
um it was 2015 i think this lady by the name of pam nance

893
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:07,160
uh she's a research scientist for the government and her home base is

894
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:15,640
uh wake forest university so pam calls me i was introduced to her by somebody uh and then i've

895
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:23,960
called her back long story short she says chris um i'm researching the paranormal

896
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:28,520
me and my assistant ashley she said we're researching the paranormal

897
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:35,240
and i just got to tell you she said i've been on pilot mountain in north carolina she lived from

898
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:41,560
winston-salem works at white forest right there in winston-salem right so she said i was on pilot

899
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:47,880
mountain or mount pilot like the andy griffin show mount right she has a cabin near there of

900
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:53,800
her home place from way back and she said that she and ashley would hike up on pilot mountain

901
01:40:53,800 --> 01:41:00,200
and sit under the stars and turn on this voice box they call it a spirit box i've never heard

902
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:05,640
of such but it's a little device about like the size of a cell phone that has this awful

903
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:11,320
noise that comes out of it it sounds like uh like static static yeah white noise

904
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:17,640
but it's it's ticking tick tick tick tick like so and what it's doing is scanning millions of

905
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:26,760
frequencies and they these investigators believe that and i know now that disembodied spirits

906
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:32,600
or voices can come through that thing so she said she was on pilot mountain and she would

907
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:41,960
ask it questions and it kept saying chris ufo chris ufo and it said it over and over over

908
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:49,800
several days she would hear the same thing chris ufo even said hope mills which is where we live

909
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:57,720
so she gets on the phone with uh mufon and finds out who is chris and the ufo well they gave her

910
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:04,280
my number right away so she comes to the house and we're out at the burning tree first we did

911
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:10,280
um about an hour and a half interview in my study and she had all her equipment running

912
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:18,760
and then we went um and not to get ahead of myself but while they did the hour and a half

913
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:26,200
study inside they got like 60 or 70 voice communications audible that was recorded on

914
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:33,640
a recorder just coming out of thin air so we go out to the tree and we do this investigation

915
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:42,040
and i'm just holding this box in one hand spirit box with a cord hooked to a digital recorder

916
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:49,480
so this is recording what this is saying and you can hear this thing so she talks me into standing

917
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:59,080
at the burning tree while my wife her assistant pam and ashley my wife and stephanie my niece

918
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:05,480
there were four ladies standing you know 10 feet from me looking at me i'm leaning against that

919
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:12,840
burning tree and i'm holding this thing and we start asking questions crazy thing this thing

920
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:18,680
started talking and it would answer my question it would say my name and four or five voices would

921
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:24,680
come through it they recorded 350 audio clips and she said i've never seen anything like it

922
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:31,480
she said if i went to the charleston jail to do a ghost hunt she could take six of these recorders

923
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:39,720
and let them run for hours each one and they might get one voice out of you know 40 hours of recording

924
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:51,400
where we got over 350 recorded clips but one thing it said it said chris the pope is in danger

925
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:59,560
help him you must help the pope it was saying this we got it on recording and she even made

926
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:06,840
a powerpoint with this with all these clips you can listen to them are they online no okay i've

927
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:15,640
got them okay but um with all this happening um i knew that the putt was going to philadelphia

928
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:21,960
he was already had been into washington and was making his trip to new york city and he was going

929
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:27,320
to go to philadelphia was this pope francis i think it was francis right when they were going

930
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:34,120
he was going to make a speech at the congress owed of the original congress hall in in philadelphia

931
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:43,480
so i call a friend that called me last night the guy you asked about who it was they called

932
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:51,160
yeah i said i called this guy i said hey larry you won't believe this i said uh this thing

933
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:58,200
this lady has and i'm i'm talking to him right after all this investigation i said this thing

934
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:04,520
keeps saying that the pope's in trouble he's coming to philadelphia but he said you must help

935
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:12,040
him it was saying this not you can hear it you must help him so immediately my friend

936
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:20,040
says well maybe you should come to to philadelphia and uh let's see what we can do about it

937
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:26,200
so a couple three days later i'm in philadelphia and when i walk in his house there stands john

938
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:33,400
alexander first time i ever met him and that's when we started remote viewing the whole pope

939
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:38,840
first chapter of this book and they actually arrested a guy for trying to blow him up i even

940
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:47,480
told him he was going to use a bomb i saw where the boat ramp beside ben franklin bridge i drew

941
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:54,040
it all out and they verified it and so they got secret service involved then john calls joe

942
01:45:54,040 --> 01:46:01,080
mcmonagall and joe says the same exact thing that i say and so from that point they shut down

943
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:08,680
philadelphia closed every access into it and made people walk from the jersey side across the

944
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:13,960
ben franklin bridge you had to walk in you couldn't drive and they arrested a guy for that so that's

945
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:20,840
how i met john and it was a real thing what happened there and that got the attention of

946
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:28,440
a lot of people did you ever speak with the pope i never have personally i had words i had messages

947
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:39,480
relayed to me from the vatican through diana and my friend from nasa jim taylor and uh he sent me

948
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:48,760
pictures of orbs and of saint francis with these orbs appearing and he had these hands were zapped

949
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:53,480
and at that time i couldn't use my hands i could barely button my pants i didn't get my kids to

950
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:59,000
button my pants and i couldn't tie my shoes couldn't hardly pull my pants up my hands were

951
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,920
just in plain this is the arthritis this is rheumatoid which is an autoimmune disease um

952
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:15,080
so yeah the other nasa individual you met after how how long was where on the timeline did you

953
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:26,360
meet him i met him in 20 it was either late 2012 or early 2013 and um what happened there i was at

954
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:35,960
a a gathering in an old lock cabin in upstate pennsylvania on the delaware river on a lake

955
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:41,240
we crossed the river and to this beautiful historic cabin they had thomas hiddinson's

956
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:51,000
bedroom suit there right so big money and taylor had heard i was there and he was out in la

957
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:58,680
california and so he heard i was at that meeting and he wanted to meet me and he called and said

958
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:06,200
i'm coming from la i'm heading to huntsville but i'm gonna swing by pennsylvania first to meet you

959
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:13,480
i want to i want to talk and so he showed up that afternoon i'd been there one day we got there

960
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:20,680
friday saturday evening he shows up and we became very close friends from that point on and

961
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:27,560
after he left from there he flew out the next morning back to huntsville so he come in one

962
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:34,920
evening met me made arrangements to come to my house and to meet my family and a week or so later

963
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:45,720
he was in fadville at my house and the rest is history from there so tim he was what was

964
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:52,680
his background where did he work what was his what was he studying and what was his interest in you

965
01:48:55,160 --> 01:49:03,640
tim is uh he's an amazing guy he's a genius and he's a very kind-hearted person

966
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:15,160
um he is an engineer for nasa that he's probably been at nasa now 40 some years over 40 years

967
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:22,760
and he runs all the launches he's the man he's an nr o guy national reconnaissance office

968
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:27,960
and and sorry to interrupt but let's just clarify for people what that means national

969
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:32,360
reconnaissance office national what do they do national reconnaissance was a very secretive

970
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:38,600
organization until a few years ago when they were discovered and it went public but he

971
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:48,920
he was a part of the air force a part of nasa and the cia all three so he holds the credentials for

972
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:55,080
all three and what they do these guys they're the top ranks they have the highest security

973
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:59,720
clearance is they're so high they can't even travel they can't go in the hospital and have

974
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:05,800
surgery unless somebody's escorting him because he might talk so they're the eyes on the sky

975
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:13,640
nr o guys see it all they have if there's anything flying in our space there's a select

976
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:20,600
few of those guys that get to see it i mean it's compartmentalized down to just a handful so they

977
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:27,480
they own all the satellites all the spy planes they run the launches because this every time

978
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:32,840
they launch something something from up there come check it out swim right up to it or

979
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:40,360
fly up to it and make sure it's not something that's sitting shouldn't be and i'll stop with

980
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:45,400
that so let's just say okay well that's something we're gonna have to talk about a little bit later

981
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:53,160
swim right up to it okay yeah all right anyways we defined nr o so he was a

982
01:50:53,960 --> 01:51:00,680
an aerospace engineer working for nasa for 40 years and 40 years now probably he was there

983
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:07,080
30 years when i met him and what did he say to you what kind of things was he was he asking you

984
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:16,280
when he when you guys first met um he was the kindest person understanding somebody i liked

985
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:22,760
he never doubted me one of the worst things to do with this subject and everybody feels that you're

986
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:28,440
you know a new person on the block is so afraid to tell anybody because of the way you're going

987
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:36,280
to be perceived you're crazy right right he was never like that he was and what really was the

988
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:42,920
difference and i'm sitting here with a lead scientist from nasa the one of the top guys

989
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:50,440
from nasa he runs the launches he is he runs the launch he runs them all this guy he's in charge

990
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:57,240
he's the dragon he has a dragon tattoo on his arm his console is called dragon console i had the

991
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:05,800
number to his dragon console yeah his his console is named the dragon which is his space in mission

992
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:12,760
control where he stands and runs the launch he's the dragon oh wow yeah and so to have that kind

993
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:21,720
of person questioning me about what they look like not are you sure you saw this

994
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:27,640
not i don't believe you it was none of that it was what what did they look like describe them to me

995
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:34,440
were they this way were they that way did they walk this way they knew they knew all this stuff

996
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:44,760
uh and so for right away i found somebody that um that i appreciated that could help me understand

997
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:55,880
and he he felt so sorry for chris jr that his mission was to meet him he wanted to meet jr

998
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:00,840
he came and he spent a lot of time with him

999
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:11,080
and changed his life because jr had the worst problem being 17 years old with people telling

1000
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:17,000
him he's a liar you know that's the worst thing you can do grandmas and grandpas even saying i

1001
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:24,840
don't believe you you know were you on drugs or something and it wasn't the case and so this guy

1002
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:34,360
comes and he knew it was real and he went right straight to my house and he met everybody briefed

1003
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:42,920
us with an official briefing on a laptop with our name our eyes only the bledsoe family he tested

1004
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:51,080
each one of us with metamaterial and to see if we'd have a reaction to it and he he counseled

1005
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:57,480
jr for a long time and changed his life because now he had some pride he had somebody to believe

1006
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:06,920
him and if nasa people would do that then that's a really big deal so that's how that he briefed you

1007
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:13,960
specifically what do you mean by that you can tell them well you can see in this photo it was the

1008
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:24,120
day of my homecoming game i had i was running for homecoming and so we were all called into my

1009
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:30,360
brother's room one by one to watch this briefing video he had this powerpoint that said for the

1010
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:35,880
blood so eyes only and it had different photos and things that he would explain to us that i

1011
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:43,400
probably am not going to say or share and then he would hand us all a piece of metal and we would

1012
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:49,800
you know hold another piece and see if there was any sort of reaction and he would test this all

1013
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:55,320
privately and separately so we wouldn't know what was happening so he could get more of like a

1014
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:01,080
i don't know like a real reaction so we didn't like pretend or something and we all felt

1015
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:06,600
something but when dad held the material even though we all felt like electricity he was like

1016
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:14,600
seizing from it because his experiences had been so intense the photos he was showing you or the

1017
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:19,000
stuff that he was showing you was it like trying to cross-reference things that you guys had seen

1018
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:25,240
with things that he had documented or you know some some of it was area 51 which i can't say

1019
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:32,600
nothing about but he would show us things and then ask questions why do you think that's like that

1020
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:35,320
why you think that door is nine foot tall

1021
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:40,760
and i won't say any more there but let's just say

1022
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:48,520
because it was official briefing i probably shouldn't go very deep and why do you think

1023
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:55,240
it's so classified well it's always been the most classified subject higher than the atomic bomb

1024
01:55:55,240 --> 01:56:00,280
and it's been that way forever do you think it's a good thing that's so secret

1025
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:05,960
well i think it's the cat's out of the bag now and they can't hold on to the secret they're going to

1026
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:13,800
try it because they have no choice there's nobody at nasa qualified to walk up in front of the

1027
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:20,040
television and say this is this and that because it takes an act of congress to change their whole

1028
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:26,760
mechanics before they can do that so then these organizations can't tell it and they're not going

1029
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:33,480
to congress is up there wanting them to trying to demand them but their protocol says no so it

1030
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:40,040
takes a whole lot of politics to to maneuver around to get the air force to ever open up

1031
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:52,840
about anything it's its own entity basically and for technology and for state security

1032
01:56:53,800 --> 01:57:00,520
national security that's why the government's not open about it they don't want to talk about

1033
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:06,760
it because it's technology involved with this stuff is incredible and they're not about to

1034
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:13,400
give it away to just anybody so explain what happened again when he handed you this piece of

1035
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:24,040
material well he handed me i was the last person in the room so imagine my five my wife and four

1036
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:29,880
children and jenny i wasn't in the room when you held it but go ahead but most everybody was in

1037
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:36,680
there they were sitting on a bed or on the round out of couch in his room but um when i walked in

1038
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:42,840
the room everybody was watching me and quiet i couldn't say a word and up on top of the dresser

1039
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:49,880
and you know the dresser is tall not the the nightstand not nightstand but the dresser he

1040
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:57,000
had the laptop set up there suppose i'm looking up at it and he goes through the whole briefing

1041
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:04,600
watching his powerpoint and asking questions and then he goes over to the chair and picks up a

1042
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:12,040
backpack reaches in it he pulls out this little piece of metal it's about a half inch square

1043
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:19,800
size of a poster stamp thin i mean thin and he put it in my hand and it just looked a square of

1044
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:26,760
gray metal he said what do you think of that i said looks like aluminum i don't know i didn't

1045
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:32,760
know what it was so he reaches in his backpack and he pulls out another piece and he puts it in this

1046
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:39,160
hand and it's like aluminum foil it looked like aluminum foil you could crinkle it up but it

1047
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:45,800
wouldn't crinkle it would stay wavy but it wouldn't crease so i messed with it and it just

1048
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:52,280
sit there but the minute he put it in that hand as thin as aluminum foil yeah this one was thicker

1049
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:57,960
it was a piece of metal this was aluminum foil and he described this as the insulation he said

1050
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:04,600
this is the insulation like i already knew what he was talking about right but when he put that

1051
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:11,560
in his hand it made a connection through my body to this hand and my arms began to thump like that

1052
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:16,600
and suddenly my eyes just started to black out and he reached in my hand and took it out

1053
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:23,880
and i got my vision good and he said he was this close to my face he said why you

1054
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:32,440
i said do what what just happened he said why you i said what do you mean why me he said

1055
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:37,800
i would have known you were lying if you hadn't had a reaction he said i've never seen a reaction

1056
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:43,800
like this he said i've only ever seen two but yours was by and far different than anybody's

1057
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:49,800
why you i never understood what he meant by why you but he said it three or four times

1058
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:59,720
and from that point on we become friends and done some traveling together and i ended up with him

1059
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:08,040
where is this it's at cape canaveral that building right there that door

1060
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:16,440
is it's very famous at nasa that is the astronaut crew quarter and that building

1061
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:23,960
was built in i think in the 50s so when they were 60s when they put the first rocket in space

1062
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:30,680
when an astronaut rides that rocket they can't they have to be in quarantine for like six weeks

1063
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:36,760
i think so they don't get a cold and the doctors so they have a crew quarters that have bedrooms in

1064
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:43,160
there and a conference room and bathrooms and a doctor's office and when they go in there they

1065
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:51,640
live for weeks with their wife and children and the same house den mother that arranges food and

1066
02:00:51,640 --> 02:01:00,520
so there's a lot more pictures of inside that place but he told me that in fact when when we

1067
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:08,040
walked in the front door of it the den mother come up and said how who are you i said i'm his friend

1068
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:15,320
he said how'd he get in here who'd you point to your whose friend tim oh it was me and tim

1069
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:20,520
walked in there and she said who are you i said i'm his friend she said well you know there's only

1070
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:27,080
300 people ever been in this building that's only one u.s president no congress nobody just

1071
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:33,240
300 since its existence that's including all the astronauts and the family members in other words

1072
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:41,000
she was asking why i was going into a place with such security and i couldn't answer it but i

1073
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:49,240
enjoyed the tour i got to sit where john glenn said or uh all of them got to hang out in the

1074
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:54,760
whole place and got to sit where they put their suits on and and then they filmed me coming out

1075
02:01:54,760 --> 02:02:02,040
the door that door is where all the astronauts would walk out holding their gear with the suits

1076
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:10,040
on they would walk out that door and get in a an airstream camper van a gas-powered one and they

1077
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:18,200
would be transported from that door to the rocket before they took off so that's a really famous

1078
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:26,680
photo out there so they treated me like royal and i'll give you a secret he told me

1079
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:35,800
he said um he said your life will never be the same when you leave from this place it'll change

1080
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:45,160
you i said what do you mean by that he said well every time these astronauts went to space something

1081
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:51,960
come back with them and it's here it's still here something comes back with them yeah

1082
02:02:54,360 --> 02:03:00,440
it's it's invisible but it becomes visible every now and then they see orbs all over the place there

1083
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:09,640
sure do near the at the launch site they see orbs i have pictures of what comes back with them

1084
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:16,600
i don't know i know it it it heightened everything happening with me

1085
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:25,480
i experienced with the phenomenon grew greater understanding of it grew it's the spirit

1086
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:37,080
there's a lot of misunderstanding about these orbs and aliens they um maybe it's technology maybe

1087
02:03:37,720 --> 02:03:44,920
but to me it's more like a spirit they're like spirits like ghosts but they can come

1088
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:53,560
full physical did he ever clarify what he meant by why you no he never did he's a secretive guy

1089
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:59,880
man he's he's like a ghost to him that's that's why diana wrote his book wrote her book she didn't

1090
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:08,280
put his name in there oh yeah he was tyler d in american cosmic but you know that's

1091
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,040
that was then now the subject is he probably don't like me talking about him but that's okay

1092
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:22,120
it's part of my life and i'm sorry you a good friend of mine tim he never so he never clarified

1093
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:27,560
anything about like them trying to learn more about it and like them being interested and like

1094
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:32,520
why were they interested or why did they make themselves so visible to you and not other people

1095
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:38,680
yeah we went over that a lot you know and and you said there was two other people that experienced

1096
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:43,400
the same thing you experienced with the medals he didn't tell me who he just said i've seen two

1097
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:49,720
other uh in my life i'd seen two other reactions but nothing like yours i remember something from

1098
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:54,280
your book i don't remember in what what it was a reference to but i remember there were you

1099
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:58,520
mentioned a conversation that you had with him when you were at cape canaveral and he

1100
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:03,880
said something like they weren't interested in anyone else like they're we know about them

1101
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:12,040
they're not interested they don't care about us right okay so when he first came remember we were

1102
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:18,200
afraid of government people we were still had how there and i was still petrified about this guy

1103
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:24,200
so i asked him remember we were afraid of the government so i was being tight-lipped and i said

1104
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:30,840
why are you here you know thank you for helping my children thank you for helping junior but why

1105
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:37,240
are you here why do you need me why does the government need me because i was still worried

1106
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:43,000
about the government right everybody's talking that they're going to kill you people have died

1107
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:47,480
and i heard all this but that hadn't been my feeling everybody i'd met had been really nice

1108
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:58,040
people he said because we see them he said we see them but they don't nothing to do with us

1109
02:05:58,040 --> 02:06:05,160
zero and we want to study them we want to know more and we would like to study you

1110
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:13,480
and we would suggest you don't go to any ufo events don't go to any conferences don't get

1111
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:19,240
involved because people that go to those tend to take on each other's stories you get somebody

1112
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:27,720
that sees a light fly by during the car and the orb goes over suddenly they involved with names

1113
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:34,840
they're from the galactic federation they were the pleiadians they were the octurians they did

1114
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:40,760
this they did that they know everything about when they only saw a light this happens in the ufo world

1115
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:50,360
and a lot of those things people tend to know more than the experts do you know what i'm saying

1116
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:56,920
yeah so he said we see them but they have nothing to do with us and we'd like to know why they want

1117
02:06:56,920 --> 02:07:04,440
you we know they like you we know that and we just want to investigate something so that's

1118
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:11,480
how that happened do you do you have any idea the answer to that question why do they like you

1119
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:18,120
why do they want to communicate with you and not with anybody else i have no idea i've asked that

1120
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:26,920
to a hundred times and how palvin meyer told me one day and he was always very tight-lipped

1121
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:32,040
to how was he would ask a million questions and tell you one answer right that's the way

1122
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:40,040
always was and i'm like how why are they here why did they want me why are they around me like this

1123
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:47,160
all the time uh he said because of your family that's what he told me he said they're probably

1124
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:55,720
your family what that means i don't know and i'll tell you something else how told me serious is

1125
02:07:55,720 --> 02:08:05,720
all get out was how mapped the moon he wrote the book on occultation occultation grazing i don't

1126
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:11,720
know how you say that word occultation grazing in other words he wrote many books on the moon

1127
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:18,360
okay so he mapped the moon he mapped the landing spot for the apollo mission

1128
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:25,000
he said you got to land here and he drew out the coordinates that's what how did he studied the

1129
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:31,080
moon more than anybody in the world he's the expert on the moon so we were talking one night

1130
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:37,720
out watching the stars and i'm like hell i said is there really something on the backside the moon

1131
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:45,880
he looked at me and he said they're buildings up there big ones and we didn't build them

1132
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:54,200
and they're ancient ancient ancient so help me that's what he told me and i didn't ask

1133
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:59,800
any more questions but he wouldn't answer he told me that he said there are structures up there

1134
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:07,960
that we did not build and they're very old this coming from the world's expert on the moon

1135
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:16,680
did you ask him if the moon landing was real i never did i never did but he says it was yeah

1136
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:23,080
so i believed him wow wow he had his technology is still on the moon

1137
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:30,040
that he put up there something for lasers to shoot off of and there's stuff up there

1138
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:35,720
scientific equipment that he was responsible for putting up there didn't he say the buildings

1139
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:41,960
look like mushrooms some of them i thought that was really weird some very ancient buildings

1140
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:45,080
that look like mushrooms on the dark side of the moon that's what he said

1141
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:53,240
i said tim um what do you think about the moon is there there's something going on

1142
02:09:53,240 --> 02:10:00,120
up there is there structures up there he said he said do you think that it

1143
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:10,120
landed by chance in the perfect spot where it eclipses the sun and it doesn't

1144
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:15,800
ever change its face to the earth it stays locked in a position he said none of that was

1145
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:21,800
by accident he wouldn't elaborate anymore he said but there's something going on up there i can't

1146
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:34,440
say but it's not by accident i knew the moon was a spaceship damn it so wow yeah that's what he

1147
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:43,880
told me so what is it how is it all i don't know we're at the beginning of studying this thing and

1148
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:51,800
what is it we're dealing with who is it how all i can tell you is how it reacts to me

1149
02:10:52,760 --> 02:11:01,640
and um wow demonstrate that part so okay getting back to what he told you about music

1150
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:11,080
and keeping music in your head right when why did he tell you to do that because uh along about

1151
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:20,520
2015 i think 2014 or 2015 somewhere in there i get a call from a lady i showed you a picture

1162
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:48,680
uh chase calls me and says chris you ever heard of saint paul's i said yeah

1163
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:57,000
before you tell me let me tell you something i said chase i said last night saturday night

1164
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:03,000
i was uh sitting on my back patio had a fire going just me laying back looking straight up at

1165
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:08,760
the sky and two orange orbs appeared red ones just like you saw last night those same color

1166
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:15,080
they just appeared just appeared sitting stationary above me up way up and they came on

1167
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:20,600
down and when they got to the top of the trees they stopped now there's these two orange balls

1168
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:29,000
suddenly they flared off straight towards saint paul's just above the trees she said oh my god

1169
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:36,760
i can't believe this i should have known she said um saturday night this was monday night she called

1170
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:46,840
me she said saturday night um i got a call yesterday about a ghost hunter group from

1171
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:51,240
willmont in north carolina willmont and ghost hunters willmont and paranormal i think the name

1172
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:59,160
of the group was they were in saint paul's at an old plantation house investigating ghost

1173
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:06,360
and they walked outside into the woods and there's this old rickety a house that the farm tenants

1174
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:12,600
used to live in it's old i mean it was fallen in but they were in there in the edge of the woods

1175
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:19,240
and these two orange balls of light flew right over their head right over the trees

1176
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:28,200
and it freaked them out when they saw it and suddenly one of them said that this tall being

1177
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:34,600
peeped around the tree at them and they pulled out their guns one of them was a police detective

1178
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:41,400
one was a prison guard but they started shooting at it they were shooting at this

1179
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:46,360
they didn't just had a glimpse of it so they were shooting in the woods you know at this thing

1180
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:54,040
first ask questions later right and so i said uh i said oh my lord she said would you go with me

1181
02:14:54,040 --> 02:15:01,560
over there i'm coming next saturday to investigate i said yeah i'd be glad to go with you so saturday

1182
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:09,000
comes friday i'd already called tim i said tim i've got something and i told him the whole story

1183
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:13,000
about seeing the orders at my house and then over saint they went to saint paul's and this

1184
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:19,800
happened to these people he said pick me up saturday morning from the airport so i went to fable

1185
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:25,640
and picked him up saturday morning and we rode over that's the picture you saw them walking

1186
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:32,600
across the field tim chase and chris jr okay so we walked across that field went into these woods and

1187
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:40,040
what i noticed immediately was that the whole place had been timbered except that where the

1188
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:45,640
house sat it was a grove of trees but behind it on behind it had been timbered out and

1189
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:51,480
they went in through the swamps and the cypress pond and destroyed it and it was just a mess in

1190
02:15:51,480 --> 02:16:00,360
there and i got the impression that it was because of the destruction of that environment

1191
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:06,280
is the reason they were there who knows why but that's what i told jen he said you think they're

1192
02:16:06,280 --> 02:16:13,240
still here i said yeah i think they're still here they haven't gone anywhere he said

1193
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:20,760
what they decided to do was to recreate the ghost hunt that night they wanted us to go

1194
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:26,520
with them and do a ghost hunt so james like i'm going back to alabama so i took him three o'clock

1195
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:33,160
to the airport and he flew back to alabama come in just for the day and that night i went back over

1196
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:39,640
there at six in the evening to do a ghost hunt with them and so that evening i show up and i'm

1197
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:45,160
with the ghost hunting group there are eight of us i'm the eighth person so you got chase and pete

1198
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:52,200
and myself and then five members from womanton the ghost hunter crew came so we were going to

1199
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:58,600
create the whole thing so eight of us they finished the house thing and then we walked

1200
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:07,240
across the field to the the old farm tenant house and here if i can explain it to you

1201
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:16,760
yeah because it's i wrote about this in the book when you walk in the cabin is old and dilapidated

1202
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:27,240
just a one room basically one room cabin it is um 10 feet into the forest in a real thick forest

1203
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:32,280
so you can't see it unless you get right up to it but once you get into the forest there um there's

1204
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:37,800
this old cabin when you walk out the back door couldn't even go in the front you had to go in

1205
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:44,680
and out the back door the front was boarded up but when you step off the steps of the back door that

1206
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:51,800
cabin you walk about six or eight feet is all and then there's a ditch a real big ditch is six

1207
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:59,560
six foot deep and it's dry trees growing up in the ditch it's old but the ditch goes all the way

1208
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:06,680
down the property right behind the cabin less than 10 feet from the back door so they were telling

1209
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:12,200
us after we were recreating everything we went through the the little house and they had all

1210
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:16,520
their ghost hunting equipment inside and they said now we're going to go out the back take you the

1211
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:25,400
same way we went before and tim and i discussed the possibility that these beings were still there

1212
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:32,040
i assumed i told him i thought they were and why they came and uh he said well tonight

1213
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:37,240
to get in a little more depth

1214
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:45,160
um he explained to me that they uh that these beings

1215
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:56,440
uh can hear your thoughts and they can stay hidden from you by knowing what you're thinking

1216
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:10,440
so if you happen to see one by accident they can rewind your memory basically by a device that they

1217
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:20,040
have that i've seen the patents on it patents yep but if you were to sing this song

1218
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:27,960
not let them know what you're thinking might get a chance to see one that's what he told me i've

1219
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:36,680
held this i'm telling you this first time publicly about these little details so that night we walk

1220
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:43,000
out the back door with the ghost hunting crew and i'm in the back i'm in the eighth guy in the rear

1221
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:49,720
chase is imprinting me so she's seven i'm eight but pete he navigates under the world with

1222
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:58,200
submarines right he's got a compass on his arm and so pete's got us in tow and we got to go out of

1223
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:05,640
the back of that cabin and walk across the hundred yards is all of woods that's really thick in that

1224
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:10,760
spot the rest of the forest to the right and left has been timber but we got to walk through that

1225
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:17,560
clump of trees to get to a power line when these big high tension power lines you can see for a

1226
02:20:17,560 --> 02:20:25,000
mile the other direction right so it runs parallel with the the cabin field only 100 yards you walk

1227
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:31,480
through it takes 15 minutes to walk that section from the back of the cabin to the power line

1228
02:20:31,480 --> 02:20:37,560
it's important i say that because when we started through the woods everything was fine

1229
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:45,640
we're all perfect talking carrying on excited made our way to the power line so when we get

1230
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:51,720
to it we walk up and down the power line for an hour knew we were testing all these equipment

1231
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:56,920
they had these ghost hunters just recreating the whole thing so when it was time to go back

1232
02:20:56,920 --> 02:21:04,520
to the cabin we had to go straight east 15 minutes and we would end up at the cabin

1233
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:10,840
we went right back to the spot we went come out at right where we exited onto the power line

1234
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:19,160
we started back in right there pete's in tow with his watch navigating so i'm behind them i'm singing

1235
02:21:19,160 --> 02:21:27,240
my song singing singing singing and i noticed everybody got out louder in your head in my head

1236
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:35,640
i noticed everybody got nervous kind of weirded out and they're you know i saw what looked like

1237
02:21:35,640 --> 02:21:42,680
they were drawing their guns again getting ready to and what i've learned about this that they can

1238
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:49,320
put fear in you these beings can control what you think so they can make you afraid make you

1239
02:21:49,320 --> 02:21:56,200
go a different direction if they don't want you here right they can put fear into you i'm just

1240
02:21:56,200 --> 02:22:03,400
repeating what i was told we're starting in 15 minutes across pete's leading the way

1241
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:09,080
i saw him get nervous and that's when i started singing

1242
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:17,480
suddenly i saw this green orb look like eyes peep around the tree i tap chase on the back and pointed

1243
02:22:17,480 --> 02:22:26,840
at it she saw it immediately with me next thing i know pete is right at the ditch so when we walked

1244
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:33,080
through that ditch nobody else saw this just chasing us all right she remembers it but when

1245
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:39,400
we crossed that ditch we had 10 feet to walk i mean you could see it was from here to that wall

1246
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:45,960
it's the cabin right but when we got to the ditch and we walked in that ditch when we come out the

1247
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:53,480
other side of the ditch we step back out on the power line and that freaked everyone out it freaked

1248
02:22:53,480 --> 02:23:00,920
pete out he's like what just happened he's a he's a submarine commander navigates under the ocean

1249
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:06,920
it blew him away what had just happened i knew what had happened so you basically stepped out

1250
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:14,040
exactly where you started yep yep we pulled it east heading for 15 minutes we got to the ditch

1251
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:19,400
we walked in the ditch and out onto the power line and there's no ditch on the power line side

1252
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:26,120
so what happened they couldn't figure it out but i saw the being and i knew right then we were

1253
02:23:26,120 --> 02:23:37,000
missing time what they did is they wiped our mind on the trip across so i didn't tell them that

1254
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:43,800
because once we got to the cabin again we went back across went in the ditch and come back out

1255
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:49,000
the cabin so we made two trips across that power line from the power line to that building

1256
02:23:49,880 --> 02:23:55,560
so monday comes along chase calls me chris you'll never believe this i said yeah i will

1257
02:23:56,360 --> 02:24:04,360
chase we lost 15 minutes didn't we she said no we lost 12 minutes and they recorded it they had

1258
02:24:04,360 --> 02:24:10,280
helmet cans on they had all these stopwatches and they know that we lost 12 minutes of time

1259
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:17,640
with that group of people that night and tim was there tim was there that day oh the day that was

1260
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:25,080
the night after he left yeah and they'll tell the story the same group of people chase tells it

1261
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:30,520
tells about missing time with me that's not the only group that's done that this happened with

1262
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:38,360
several okay so fast forward to when you were going through the security doors at

1263
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:46,520
cape canaveral at nasa there was a black a black glass building that you go that you pass

1264
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:53,320
it was like a hut like a guard shack a guard shack right beside this fence you know you got

1265
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:59,800
mission control and a fence around it we got fences within fences but when you get to the

1266
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:05,480
main building where the launch is going on right they had razor wire and a barbed wire fence

1267
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:11,800
about 10 foot high all the way around that thing with guards standing there with machine guns

1268
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:18,280
and to go through that gate you got to walk by this guard shack and it's about eight by eight

1269
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:25,480
black the middle is black and the windows are black you can't see in it at all but it was like

1270
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:33,400
it was like when you walk by that building they can read your thoughts never told me who they

1271
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:38,760
or what they or how they he just said they can read your thoughts so just sing a song

1272
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:45,800
and that's why i first heard about it this was before the ghost hunting trip so i already knew

1273
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:51,800
about it he just told me to do it again when i was on this was before the ghost hunting trip yeah

1274
02:25:54,840 --> 02:26:01,400
what was in the building that could read your thoughts i've had that question ever since i

1275
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:05,960
have no clue this is the kind of way these guys will communicate they give you a little bit is

1276
02:26:05,960 --> 02:26:15,400
it a lie or are they throwing me off on a wrong course but they didn't you know it seemed pretty

1277
02:26:15,400 --> 02:26:27,160
real what he was telling me so once you were once you got into the building the launch control

1278
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:33,640
center where where tim goes right what what did he show you in there the specific room was there

1279
02:26:33,640 --> 02:26:39,000
did he show you specifically where he is and and what he does and what he works on when he's there

1280
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:45,560
yeah so if you can imagine mission control is basically a square it looks like a square

1281
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:52,520
it looks like one of those construction site trailers you would bring on a job but bigger

1282
02:26:52,520 --> 02:27:01,320
in a square and there's a hallway right down the middle and glass on either side you got this

1283
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:09,000
hallway with glass big long hallway with glass and if you look to the right is nasa scientist

1284
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:14,920
controlling the launch so you got all these 50 people or however many is in there standing

1285
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:21,960
or sitting at each console like you see on tv same thing on the left side is an exact duplicate

1286
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:29,080
of the right but the left side is all air force so the air force is involved big time with nasa

1287
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:34,200
that's part of the nr o thing i think right so there are all these cadets all these young

1288
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:43,400
soldiers are there learning to to control launches and i got to meet the general there she came out

1289
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:49,720
in the hallway and spoke to me and i was even told how to address her before i got to meet her

1290
02:27:50,360 --> 02:28:00,200
and uh which i did and that was pretty cool but there's a room that's a closed off room only

1291
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:08,440
tim goes into how big is the room i don't i didn't get to go into it but i saw it where it was and he

1292
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:13,720
explained to me that was his office and in that office once the launch goes off he has to stand

1293
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:19,880
in his control when that rocket leaves and everything looks good he goes into that room

1294
02:28:21,480 --> 02:28:30,200
and it's for his eyes only and the other guys in the nr o that are involved in other ways in other

1295
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:37,960
words when that rocket leaves the ground they have ground-based cameras that looks like giant

1296
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:43,960
binoculars that you sit in and they can sort of swivel and film this rocket right but once it gets

1297
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:51,160
up so high it gets gaseous and they can't see the detail and they want to know every angle of that

1298
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:56,760
thing they want to see every bit they can see in case something goes wrong they know how to fix it

1299
02:28:56,760 --> 02:29:04,520
right and um it's how they found that o-ring that leaked and caused the explosion with the shuttle

1300
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:11,560
remember when it blew up they could see challenger yeah they could see the the fuel coming out where

1301
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:22,520
the o-ring stretched but when that rocket gets to 50 000 feet they have um what's called a wb-57

1302
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:30,360
which is a really big it's like an old u-2 spy plane um the huge wings and it just hovers up

1303
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:38,840
there about 50 000 feet a group of guys in ro and they intercept the rocket so when it's going up

1304
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:45,560
and starts going over that rock that wb-57 is right behind it filming it because the ground-based

1305
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:51,880
cameras don't have clear now this airplane has it when it gets on up there about 100 000 feet

1306
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:59,480
they have uh you could see the picture of the 104 starfighter that's it right there

1307
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:08,520
that thing can fly right on up to about 100 000 feet following that rocket that can't

1308
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:15,000
and they chase it keeping a film on it a camera on it the whole time and the rocket's going so fast

1309
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:20,920
it'll outrun it right and it loses sight and then comes the satellite cameras pick it up

1310
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:31,000
and when tim goes into that door his eyes are on every stage of that camera as it's going up and

1311
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:41,400
so he sees if anything from somewhere else up gets nosy and goes up and takes a look or even

1312
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:47,960
shoots it down because it's happened before it's got they've gotten shot down i've seen one

1313
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:52,600
and you saw one get shot down i saw the video

1314
02:30:54,440 --> 02:31:01,080
or did is this one that we all know about some people do you won't find it it's been

1315
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:09,080
scrubbed but and what was it shot down by the video i saw was um you see i get a little nervous

1316
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:18,200
here was a rocket this thing was going 15 000 miles an hour and when it arcs over you know

1317
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:23,400
they don't go straight off they go up a ways and then they go over and they fly out gradually

1318
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:30,840
climbing up as they go around the world they don't leave it what i saw was when this rocket

1319
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:36,760
left over the pacific coast i think it was launched out of vandenberg when it went up out of

1320
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:43,000
started over all of a sudden this little flying saucer appears

1321
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:51,320
flies right up to it intercepts it as it's going 15 000 miles an hour flies around it

1322
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:58,520
and a little white lizard beam comes out and shoots it from every side as it's going around

1323
02:31:58,520 --> 02:32:05,880
it at 15 000 miles an hour suddenly the whole rocket malfunctions doesn't blow up just quits

1324
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:09,400
and tumbles out to the sea i saw that

1325
02:32:12,200 --> 02:32:16,440
what was on this rocket that's what i asked him he said why do you think they did that

1326
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:24,680
i said you have weapons on there and he wouldn't answer that he said well it might

1327
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:29,480
have been a mock warhead but it wasn't live on man yeah

1328
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:38,840
so i saw it with my own eye so that rocket that one out of vandenberg is known it's known there's

1329
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:46,200
people that have seen it before i think i've heard vague vague stories told about that before

1330
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:56,440
it's real i've seen it did you ever have you ever heard or spoke to gary about uh this the research

1331
02:32:56,440 --> 02:33:00,840
he's been doing on and the brain scans he's been doing with people that have experienced the

1332
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:06,280
phenomenon where he's noticed a certain part of the human brain i think it's the caudate

1333
02:33:06,280 --> 02:33:12,360
potamon or the in the basal ganglia that is uh it's extremely dense with neurons it's different

1334
02:33:13,480 --> 02:33:19,080
yeah i'm surprised he spoke about that because that's been kind of secret for a long time

1335
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:22,360
because that's been kind of secret for a long time

1336
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:29,560
yeah well you know they study my brain they're going to start studying hers this year

1337
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:36,600
emily's oh really yeah well i can't say no more but we're just going to say yeah

1338
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:43,640
yeah so so what do they do what's going on here in this photo that i write about in the last

1339
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:50,680
chapter of the book that's uh that's at the monroe institute that whole deal

1340
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:59,960
was um created basically around me that whole week we were there yeah they wanted to

1341
02:33:59,960 --> 02:34:06,680
get me up there and see if we could film the phenomenon it's never been done right nobody's

1342
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:12,360
never walked out and had it come and and they film it like that so if they get a video it's by

1343
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:21,720
accident but we were going to do it intentionally and so they invited emily and i and uh some other

1344
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:30,280
people friends of ours that um that came and the rest of the group was while they were dining or

1345
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:38,040
having fun i'm in the lab being wired up right the lab wrap yeah and so when we go out at night we

1346
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:43,960
had orbs appear and they had never seen anything like it they filmed they got sensors sitting on

1347
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:48,200
tops of the mountains random generators and all and they were going off the orbs were up here

1348
02:34:49,560 --> 02:34:59,320
and um there is an orb that we filmed a friend of ours named rob freeman he came from canada

1349
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:04,680
he brought a two hundred fifty thousand dollar camera that he bought just to film the phenomenon

1350
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:10,520
so it's all this was a big apparatus of cameras and spectrum all kind of stuff i couldn't even

1351
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:19,800
tell you it was a big setup so um he walks up to me and he says chris he said you know what you've

1352
02:35:19,800 --> 02:35:28,280
changed my life he said i want to apologize so i stood up and i said thank you rob uh don't worry

1353
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:35,160
i know but i don't i forgive you i reached out and i hugged him and as soon as i hugged him flash

1354
02:35:36,680 --> 02:35:44,840
somebody said look flash so rob runs back to his camera locks it in on this object turns it on and

1355
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:53,720
for 45 minutes that object never moved it said flash flash the star field moved across the sky

1356
02:35:53,720 --> 02:36:01,800
but the object never wiggled so you can find that called the monroe flasher on youtube and

1357
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:08,200
that was from that night when rob and i uh and we made a great bond i mean i'm gonna be with rob

1358
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:14,520
again this november yeah the monroe flasher on youtube can you you got you got safari maybe

1359
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:21,240
we should look at it oh wow this is like uh some sort of like analysis video somebody made talking

1360
02:36:21,240 --> 02:36:26,680
about it okay now these are so this is that 250 thousand dollar camera that this guy brought out

1361
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:34,760
here yep see if it flashes there it is you see it in one spot you can enlarge the screen you can

1362
02:36:34,760 --> 02:36:44,520
see it better it varied in intensity to how bright it flashed yeah wow it's so tiny well it was way

1363
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:49,480
up there right but it got bigger and brighter at times a lot brighter about the same distance

1364
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:53,800
is the one we saw last night no these are further up further this is way up there

1365
02:36:54,600 --> 02:37:00,840
but the thing is that there was 45 minutes of it and there's parts of that is a whole lot brighter

1366
02:37:00,840 --> 02:37:07,480
and bigger but mufon canada which is where he's from certified it true and all and so

1367
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:16,040
but that was a story there that what we were doing was filming with scientists government

1368
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:21,720
scientists a whole lot of them using sensors and all to record this for the first time now were

1369
02:37:21,720 --> 02:37:26,040
they using some of the same technology that andy was using during the filming of that show where

1370
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:31,720
they were kind of tracking it against the faa and against satellites to make sure it wasn't planes

1371
02:37:31,720 --> 02:37:36,440
or satellites i didn't see one of those they may have had it because they had sensors on the

1372
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:44,200
mountains and so on right but yeah can you play that video from last night it's on there it's in

1373
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:49,160
there it's uh there's like i think there's three videos but there's two of them is it in here

1374
02:37:49,160 --> 02:37:53,320
yeah it's in there it's the 50 oh no never mind steven has them okay steve i do

1375
02:37:54,920 --> 02:38:00,280
steven's got him he'll get him queued up so yeah so we sat out there for maybe

1376
02:38:01,400 --> 02:38:06,520
30 minutes before before we saw anything and then all of a sudden these things started appearing

1377
02:38:06,520 --> 02:38:10,520
on the horizon and there was a couple a couple things that happened over our head looked like

1378
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:15,880
shooting stars yeah that's as orbs a lot of times because they'll they'll go straight up

1379
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:19,080
see if we got audio going on here

1380
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:30,120
what's cool is this uh this there's the surf you can see yeah oh it's uh the contrast is like crazy

1381
02:38:30,120 --> 02:38:35,000
it's like darkened on the screen yeah you see the horizon okay there you go

1382
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:41,480
so so the planes were far above this this was very very low on the horizon and you can see

1383
02:38:41,480 --> 02:38:48,920
the planes that are there were airplanes above it uh find the one that's the longest one the 52nd

1384
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:55,000
one that one has it a two in it there are two orbs in that right right and the first one's

1385
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:58,920
right on the water in fact i don't doubt that it didn't come from the water

1386
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:00,520
it didn't come from the water

1387
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:05,560
as you know what's weird is you just had asked me about that

1388
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:11,160
right before right about the water what do i think about the water and then we get one

1389
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:16,360
right on top of the water so that thing was right above the horizon and it was

1390
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:22,440
getting really bright and then getting going invisible going dim yep and airplanes don't do

1391
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:28,360
that nope nope and and you could we could we know that because there was literally airplanes

1392
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:33,320
coming in for landing that would turn on their their bright headlights for that their landing

1393
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:38,520
approach or whatever it's called in that 52nd video you can actually see planes all around it

1394
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:43,080
flying up above it there was one there top right you see that little flash that's your that one

1395
02:39:43,080 --> 02:39:50,440
was flashing yeah let me see if i can get the the the older one the the the bigger one yeah

1396
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:56,600
working because that doesn't make sense why it wouldn't so what what is the connection

1397
02:39:57,400 --> 02:40:01,560
do you think you talk a lot about in your book this sort of which which it got me

1398
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:10,040
wrapped up in this edward this ed casey thing um with the healing power what is the connection

1399
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:16,840
with this ability to heal how real is that and and and was tim involved in any of that with

1400
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:20,040
some of the stuff that he was doing with the medical research and the medical patents

1401
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:30,600
well yeah in a way um how that came about was in 2013 easter again one year later remember 2012

1402
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:36,760
on easter i had the lady experience right she came and told me about the red star or the star of

1403
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:48,760
regulus and um um granted me the ability to record this stuff she did it it came straight

1404
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:58,200
from her 2012 well 2013 she comes back this time she takes me these beings take me

1405
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:06,440
somehow i'm transported from my home up through the top of my house i saw the rafters i went

1406
02:41:06,680 --> 02:41:12,680
was pulled up into a ball of light next thing i know we're um

1407
02:41:14,680 --> 02:41:22,280
touching down from this orb and walk out of it into this desert environment looked like utah

1408
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:27,560
i have been obsessed for five years with utah more than that now my kids know this

1409
02:41:28,520 --> 02:41:33,080
okay so here's the video you got it pulled up steve yeah it doesn't play on the computer but

1410
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:35,960
it does plan dropbox so here okay here we go

1411
02:41:38,360 --> 02:41:42,760
okay so you see a is that a that's a plane that's an airplane two planes now that thing comes right

1412
02:41:42,760 --> 02:41:48,120
out of the water yeah right up out of the ocean there's a planes around it

1413
02:41:51,560 --> 02:41:56,520
now it's going to disappear but if you'll look to the right of it here in a second there's a

1414
02:41:56,520 --> 02:42:02,600
second one right close to it that appears there it comes now it's going to appear down disappears

1415
02:42:02,600 --> 02:42:07,400
than that one yeah what that like it gets real bright

1416
02:42:11,320 --> 02:42:17,080
yeah those are your orbs and see these planes right above it they can see that that's why

1417
02:42:17,080 --> 02:42:22,280
they're so elusive i mean we there's three planes four planes in the picture and then you got this

1418
02:42:22,280 --> 02:42:26,440
one or and then i think it goes out again right yeah yeah just disappeared

1419
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:34,520
there but i don't know how you can explain that away with logic you can't you can't and if you

1420
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:41,560
maybe tonight we go out sky watching again maybe i'm hoping something comes much closer like

1421
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:47,640
real close well we were we were right on indian rocks beach in front of a lot of really bright

1422
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:53,400
buildings and condos and there was lots of airplanes so yeah we were on the main flight path

1423
02:42:53,400 --> 02:42:58,920
right right but um it's pretty amazing for that to show up with all of that around

1424
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:04,920
yeah i knew it was a hamper though because all these planes around now what do

1425
02:43:06,200 --> 02:43:12,920
them like the most hardcore skeptics say about these things do they what do they try how do

1426
02:43:12,920 --> 02:43:20,440
they try to explain these things well you know there are hardly no skeptics anymore

1427
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:30,520
i don't really have that issue um okay um the main thing i hear now is this demon you're dealing

1428
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:35,560
with demons because they've already accepted the fact that there is something there happening

1429
02:43:35,560 --> 02:43:42,120
it was like satellites or at one point someone said swamp gas ball lightning yeah all this

1430
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:48,040
ball lightning yeah but now it's like oh there maybe is something happening but it's evil

1431
02:43:48,040 --> 02:43:52,760
yeah it's got to be evil it's got to be a demon there are videos on youtube you can watch about

1432
02:43:52,760 --> 02:43:57,160
ball lightning where people show these balls in their house these light that explode they show

1433
02:43:57,160 --> 02:44:03,720
up and they float around and they explode away but in your situations there was no thunderstorms

1434
02:44:03,720 --> 02:44:12,360
there was no lightning no and and this is every day i mean yes i've recorded this stuff every

1435
02:44:12,360 --> 02:44:18,520
single day i showed you my sonics happen there are 2700 videos in less than 24 months

1436
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:26,600
that's a lot and i could have taken twice that because half the time i don't even record we see

1437
02:44:27,400 --> 02:44:33,000
we'll see 10 times more than i ever record because a lot of times it's so fast you can't get it on

1438
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:37,880
camera it'll come by you it'll appear 10 feet away and zoom right by your face that quick

1439
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:47,400
happens with crowds of 20 30 70 70 people i've had it appear around and 20 feet away and it happens

1440
02:44:47,400 --> 02:44:53,320
at significant moments so it's like why would ball lightning respond to specific questions thoughts

1441
02:44:53,320 --> 02:45:04,280
emotions right and and yeah so this is a new day the people now are knowing there's something there

1442
02:45:04,280 --> 02:45:11,640
and so the skeptics have mainly gone bye-bye most of them and the ones that are skeptical more

1443
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:18,920
would be the scientist because they just the paradigm don't allow anything there right in

1444
02:45:18,920 --> 02:45:26,760
fact i think between you and i one reason they don't that they've hid this so long and don't

1445
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:32,920
want to tell it because it's not the people that would melt down it's not me and you it's not

1446
02:45:33,480 --> 02:45:38,920
alice in the mobile home park down the street or the average person they would say oh boy

1447
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:44,680
wonderful and then tomorrow they're back grocery shopping yeah but it's the scientific community

1448
02:45:44,680 --> 02:45:50,920
it's the academic world that has spent their life in college and teaching people about evolution

1449
02:45:51,560 --> 02:45:59,320
and all these far old things that they're still teaching that so far they got to change everything

1450
02:45:59,320 --> 02:46:04,120
so half the community that's teaching this would be lost where do we go from here

1451
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:11,320
you know so i think the meltdown would be there more than the average people another and another

1452
02:46:11,320 --> 02:46:20,760
thing people say about this is that if this was to become accepted in within humanity it would

1453
02:46:20,840 --> 02:46:29,080
destroy all religion but what you see now with like going back to even the vatican is that

1454
02:46:29,640 --> 02:46:34,680
they are looking into astronomy i mean there's a there's an observatory at the vatican and

1455
02:46:34,680 --> 02:46:39,720
they're looking at the stars and they're talking about the idea of extraterrestrial life and you

1456
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:46,760
know they even say like if god could have created us and it could create ants and caterpillars why

1457
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:51,960
couldn't create other beings that are somewhere else in the galaxy that are even intelligent

1458
02:46:51,960 --> 02:46:59,960
right you can't limit god's creative freedom and and you know the vatican is kind of becoming

1459
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:07,000
you know the religion it it is not counterintuitive it is not counter to the idea of

1460
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:15,800
extraterrestrial life or another sort of multi-dimensional life form or being or entity

1461
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:24,280
that lives parallel to us so when you think about that i don't necessarily believe that

1462
02:47:25,320 --> 02:47:34,680
it would have a negative effect on established religions today i think it will for the the

1463
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:42,440
strictness of people you got religions that are pure cults that um you know only we're going to

1464
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:48,120
go to heaven you know these baptists over there they can't make it or these these are them you

1465
02:47:48,120 --> 02:47:53,800
know they're you know you believe like us or you're going to burn in hell they don't even

1466
02:47:53,800 --> 02:48:00,040
rationalize when it comes to this stuff it's just straight by that book and they'll be the ones that

1467
02:48:01,080 --> 02:48:05,560
would have the most to deal with i think because they don't have room for any deviation

1468
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:15,880
of possibilities other than what that book says example in our area north carolina in the mountains

1469
02:48:17,160 --> 02:48:24,280
you have these snake charmers snake handlers churches that get together and they pull out

1470
02:48:24,280 --> 02:48:29,240
rattlesnakes and they're sitting there dancing with rattlesnakes and about every year two or three of

1471
02:48:29,560 --> 02:48:37,880
them fall over dead but they still believe because the book says if you believe in Jesus

1472
02:48:37,880 --> 02:48:42,360
you can drink poison and you won't die or you can take up a serpent and he'll bite you and you won't

1473
02:48:42,360 --> 02:48:48,840
die but yet they get several a year fall out dead because of it but they still go right back and do

1474
02:48:48,840 --> 02:48:53,880
the same thing and if you brought anything else into their belief spectrum you're probably going

1475
02:48:53,880 --> 02:49:01,800
to melt their their brain didn't you also say that some like sometimes beings come out of the

1476
02:49:01,800 --> 02:49:07,960
orbs yeah i have a video one coming out of an award do we have that i have it on my phone right

1477
02:49:07,960 --> 02:49:15,640
here um i don't know how you're gonna i can download is this the same video dad this photo

1478
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:20,280
no that's not it now that's a pretty interesting photo though if you want to show that well i'll

1479
02:49:20,280 --> 02:49:27,800
find this well i have this one that we showed them yesterday oh is this the one of the person

1480
02:49:27,800 --> 02:49:34,360
walking through the woods it was very dark but yeah this person right here you can see is our

1481
02:49:34,360 --> 02:49:40,840
friend lori yeah and um we're uh i wasn't there but this was in a wooded area behind our old home

1482
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:46,760
so it's a little shady here but you can see the light daylight outside beyond the trees but this

1483
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:53,800
figure here was not anyone in our party um so whenever they looked at the photo later there

1484
02:49:53,800 --> 02:50:01,560
was just this fully fledged figure standing in front of lori and also this peculiar flash of light

1485
02:50:01,560 --> 02:50:07,320
appeared um right behind her right turn your airdrop on if you know how they're

1486
02:50:07,640 --> 02:50:15,160
it's on and i'm gonna send you what you're gonna see here this video she's getting now

1487
02:50:18,040 --> 02:50:23,880
okay is this the video thing coming out of the orb no she's should be getting it now okay this

1488
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:29,560
video then that one okay now let me tell you before you start this what you're gonna see

1489
02:50:29,560 --> 02:50:37,160
okay i write about this in my book there was a lady by the name of sharon very close to

1490
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:46,280
me in this family we met her i met her in a chapter in the book about how this bible college

1491
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:52,760
tried to set me up and it backfired on them the whole audience left with me and left them sitting

1492
02:50:54,040 --> 02:51:00,040
but one of the ladies there was sick had kidney cancer and her cancer her she had one kidney

1493
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:06,840
already removed and her second kidney was already massive size with cancer and her

1494
02:51:06,840 --> 02:51:15,960
chemo wasn't working so she was looking at death and i met her on saturday night it's in the book

1495
02:51:15,960 --> 02:51:26,600
there's a lot about it but um sunday morning or monday morning she went in for a scan and it was

1496
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:34,840
gone her kidney cancer was gone and um she was healed from it so a couple years later she calls

1497
02:51:34,840 --> 02:51:42,040
me and we stayed in touch but she had cancer had come back in her lungs and she had stage four

1498
02:51:42,040 --> 02:51:50,360
lung cancer and um she called me worried she had to go in for a scan on monday this next monday

1499
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:57,160
and said can i come to your house can i come for prayer i want you to help me because word had

1500
02:51:57,160 --> 02:52:03,080
gotten around about this healing thing which we bypassed earlier oh yeah we need to go back

1501
02:52:03,080 --> 02:52:09,800
yeah so she shows up from two hours away on friday evening with or saturday evening with her

1502
02:52:10,520 --> 02:52:13,960
half a dozen friends it was about five or six of them in total all ladies

1503
02:52:14,600 --> 02:52:20,600
i had three native american friends we were born in i was born in robinson county which is

1504
02:52:20,600 --> 02:52:27,480
uh where the tuscaroras are from north carolina's tribe is there so wonderful people i was raised

1505
02:52:27,480 --> 02:52:32,120
with them all my life and three of them actually called me and said can we come by we want to see

1506
02:52:32,120 --> 02:52:38,520
the burning tree i said absolutely perfect time to come because i have a lady that's sick and we

1507
02:52:39,480 --> 02:52:46,120
all said prayer for so they show up at my house and uh sharon is standing on my left

1508
02:52:47,080 --> 02:52:51,800
and her friend one of them standing on my right where i'm right between these two ladies

1509
02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:57,080
and everybody else is meandering around it's about eight or ten people there more

1510
02:52:58,760 --> 02:53:03,720
and you'll hear the natives standing at the burning tree singing singing there whatever

1511
02:53:03,720 --> 02:53:09,960
they're singing so chant and at 31 seconds in the video you'll see an orb appear

1512
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:16,120
six foot away right in front of us and it's rotating they're always spinning

1513
02:53:16,760 --> 02:53:23,800
and it comes right up to me five or six foot from me and then flashes when they flash like

1514
02:53:23,800 --> 02:53:29,160
that is when these beings step out of these orbs so the being comes out of the orb and now the

1515
02:53:29,160 --> 02:53:34,040
orb is inside the being so you can see this translucent figure with the orb inside

1516
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:41,320
and so that's how they come i've seen them many times do this and it moves to my left out of

1517
02:53:41,320 --> 02:53:47,560
screen right in front of sharon and on monday morning all her cancer was gone but one tiny

1518
02:53:47,560 --> 02:53:54,120
little speck and she's cancer-free today how long after again how long after was it all gone

1519
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:59,400
it was it was gone all these masses in her lungs were gone but one tiny little speck

1520
02:53:59,400 --> 02:54:06,280
how many days later the weekend that monday morning wow okay so you'll hear them singing

1521
02:54:06,280 --> 02:54:13,320
here and then watch at 31 seconds it'll flash but there's you have to stop it and play with it to

1522
02:54:13,320 --> 02:54:19,560
see the six foot tall seven foot tall light being that comes out of that orb okay i'll try my best

1523
02:54:20,440 --> 02:54:23,000
so

1524
02:54:23,480 --> 02:54:37,000
can't hear it

1525
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:59,320
right about here oh i got one finally now slow it down everyone don't you see the orb that's the orb

1526
02:55:00,520 --> 02:55:09,240
all right there's the being during the flash and they don't show it as good on this screen

1527
02:55:09,240 --> 02:55:14,280
for some reason yeah the screen is very bright on here but yeah if you can look at that you can see

1528
02:55:14,760 --> 02:55:21,880
um the full-blown being legs arms and all really yeah i don't know if i can turn it to you

1529
02:55:24,920 --> 02:55:31,720
see how bright that orb is yeah so wait where's the beam there's the beam to the left of the screen

1530
02:55:32,520 --> 02:55:38,840
this is inside the being now this or can you go frame by frame if you hit the side arrows on the

1531
02:55:38,840 --> 02:55:44,200
keyboard see on the on the bottom left of the keyboard itself yeah go yeah you can go frame

1532
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:51,320
by frame there go back the other way to what appears come on back you'll see the orb appear

1533
02:55:51,320 --> 02:56:03,800
and approach us all right now right here the orb appears i've already backed up so i'll back up again

1534
02:56:03,800 --> 02:56:13,160
and then to before and it flashes and then we're before now okay this is headed forward okay now

1535
02:56:13,160 --> 02:56:21,080
we're going forwards orb appears flash there's one flash yeah it's like one frame yeah now it's

1536
02:56:21,080 --> 02:56:25,720
gonna go away so go back to that one that so during that one frame is when you're saying you see the

1537
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:34,200
being yeah yeah but that frame right there is the being and now the orb stays inside of the being

1538
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:41,000
and you can see if you look at it on a good shot a good camera or a computer you can see

1539
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:49,080
a translucent figure move and the orb is with it yeah right there we can only see like a sliver of

1540
02:56:49,080 --> 02:56:57,800
something right but you can see the difference on this computer right yeah you can huh but that

1541
02:57:01,080 --> 02:57:07,880
that was right that was in 2014 i think remember i couldn't share anything before 2012 right after

1542
02:57:07,880 --> 02:57:14,680
2012 i began to share it with everybody but when 2013 comes along the lady comes again

1543
02:57:15,640 --> 02:57:21,240
and she takes me to some desert place which i perceive as utah i'm pretty sure it is i've been

1544
02:57:21,240 --> 02:57:25,720
obsessed with it and i think she's going to come back and i'll be able to film her there

1545
02:57:28,680 --> 02:57:36,760
that's bizarre yeah it's pretty crazy so sharon um what did you make of her being healed of the

1546
02:57:36,920 --> 02:57:43,080
cancer of literally two days later um that's why she came that's why she came yeah and

1547
02:57:44,280 --> 02:57:53,080
see let me say this in 2013 when the lady came back and i went about this take me to utah

1548
02:57:53,080 --> 02:57:59,800
when i saw her she imparted another thing on me that i didn't may have had it before but i

1549
02:57:59,800 --> 02:58:06,920
didn't realize it until two weeks later this is how it arose and this is what got nasa tim involved

1550
02:58:07,640 --> 02:58:19,240
with the health thing um easter 2013 i had the experience with her again may the fifth i think

1551
02:58:19,240 --> 02:58:24,360
it was just a few days later less than two weeks later this investigator from canada calls me and

1552
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:29,080
wants to come by and visit he's on the way to miami and we live right along 95 so it was five

1553
02:58:29,080 --> 02:58:36,200
minutes off 95 for him he said can i stop i'm leaving washington going to miami i'm just sure

1554
02:58:36,200 --> 02:58:48,600
stay a night if you want so he did and my labrador nelly was um this is nelly she was walking along

1555
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:55,640
beside us we went out to the tree and he must have took 20 pictures of the tree and we talked for 15

1556
02:58:55,640 --> 02:59:03,720
20 minutes standing there nelly was laying on the ground beside me we get back to the edge of the

1557
02:59:03,720 --> 02:59:09,720
patio we walked all the way back about 75 yards out there so when we would get back to the patio

1558
02:59:09,720 --> 02:59:14,600
my kids are on the patio hanging out sitting around grant and i stopped right at the edge of

1559
02:59:14,600 --> 02:59:20,680
the cement nelly stops and she's laying there beside me she walked everywhere we went she'd

1560
02:59:20,760 --> 02:59:29,400
walk and stop and lay down so i looked at grant i said grant kids are here you want us to help

1561
02:59:29,400 --> 02:59:33,640
you get your bags you can go ahead and put them in the house and use the bathroom whatever he's

1562
02:59:33,640 --> 02:59:39,080
like yeah why not so he's between me in the house i'm looking at him at the back door so he turns

1563
02:59:39,080 --> 02:59:44,920
his back and he starts towards the door nelly stands up off the ground and when she walked by

1564
02:59:45,560 --> 02:59:52,920
i saw blood shoot out of her neck in a long stream and it wet the whole side of his pants

1565
02:59:53,480 --> 02:59:58,280
went right by grant and wet his pants and i had pictures of it and she left the trail of blood

1566
02:59:58,280 --> 03:00:03,480
going in and ran in the back door now dogs will get in front of you and try to go in before you

1567
03:00:03,480 --> 03:00:09,560
do well that's what she did door was wide open blood spraying everywhere and i freaked out oh my

1568
03:00:09,560 --> 03:00:14,760
god what's happening to my dog and i ran in and i tackled her she got five or six feet in the back

1569
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:21,160
door when i grabbed her blood all over the floor and it a laminate floor it's like slipping on

1570
03:00:21,160 --> 03:00:26,920
grease and i picked her up it was all i could do to get her up because i was dealing with rheumatoid

1571
03:00:26,920 --> 03:00:32,920
then and it was just a struggle i made it to the patio and i laid her down and i looked at her

1572
03:00:32,920 --> 03:00:39,880
neck and she had a hole maybe inch and a half two inches long a gash across her vein right there

1573
03:00:39,880 --> 03:00:45,320
and blood is just pouring out so i laid my hand on her neck and blood pouring up through my

1574
03:00:45,320 --> 03:00:51,320
fingers like this and feel her heartbeat and she wanted she was just kind of squirming but

1575
03:00:51,320 --> 03:00:59,800
she won't fighting too hard i look up at them and i realized that she was going to die i knew it

1576
03:00:59,800 --> 03:01:06,040
because they wouldn't call a no ambulance there wasn't no time to get her to the doctor we lived

1577
03:01:06,040 --> 03:01:13,960
20 miles or 20 minutes from anywhere and everybody's freaked out grant sitting there taking pictures

1578
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:19,400
he's recording this whole thing and i said what am i going to do and i looked up at the sky and

1579
03:01:19,400 --> 03:01:24,680
i said lord what am i going to do she's going to die right here and as soon as i said that i felt

1580
03:01:24,680 --> 03:01:33,080
this energy come through my hand and i felt her go completely limp and when i raised my hand there

1581
03:01:33,080 --> 03:01:40,920
was no more hole in her neck nothing it was gone everybody witnessed it and it freaky there i was

1582
03:01:40,920 --> 03:01:46,840
not there no but all her brothers was a weird story to come home to though yeah i will say but

1583
03:01:48,040 --> 03:01:53,640
there was a lot of witnesses to it grant and a ufo investigator from canada is one of the most

1584
03:01:53,640 --> 03:02:01,480
famous out there he's the one that saw it all he took that picture i didn't and there are more

1585
03:02:01,480 --> 03:02:08,280
pictures of it of the blood going in the house and all and um but we couldn't figure out what happened

1586
03:02:08,280 --> 03:02:16,760
at all how did she get the hole in her neck what did that uh what i didn't know who to call so i

1587
03:02:16,760 --> 03:02:20,760
called tim i said tim the craziest thing that's happened today you won't believe this

1588
03:02:21,720 --> 03:02:30,040
that's uh this is the same dog it's so pixelated on that screen but anyhow he told me he said chris

1589
03:02:30,760 --> 03:02:38,680
he said maybe the phenomenon was showing you you have a gift that you need to try to do something

1590
03:02:38,760 --> 03:02:51,320
with and so that changed my life that year to um this was 2014 to uh where it is today that's what

1591
03:02:51,320 --> 03:03:01,240
i do i've done more um i'm trying to help people who are sick than i ever reveal or talk about it's

1592
03:03:01,240 --> 03:03:07,240
every day of my life i have people write me people who are sick people i go and visit and

1593
03:03:07,240 --> 03:03:14,200

1594
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:21,880
but it is and it happened and immediately tim's like you need to follow this and that's what got

1595
03:03:21,880 --> 03:03:30,120
me involved with him with um his encouragement to help get me to help others and to working on his

1596
03:03:30,120 --> 03:03:38,520
project he was working on for stem cells and it just led from a two three weeks later a month later

1597
03:03:38,520 --> 03:03:45,080
i get a call from the guy in that great big house you were wearing it wondering about and said we

1598
03:03:45,080 --> 03:03:52,840

1602
03:04:12,280 --> 03:04:19,960

1603
03:04:19,960 --> 03:04:25,400
or helping some child that is it's got to make a wish he's going to die he's not going to live

1604
03:04:25,480 --> 03:04:33,160
past 12 13 years old i said well you got me there so next day i was on an airplane to washington

1605
03:04:33,160 --> 03:04:40,120
and i was sitting at that young boy in the bottom right there to his left is jim semivan

1606
03:04:42,040 --> 03:04:51,320
this whole party is uh that was his bar mitzvah was the heads of the cia the director my brother

1607
03:04:51,880 --> 03:05:00,600
ryan and this is mike morel the deputy director this little boy is right in there group of people

1608
03:05:01,640 --> 03:05:08,440
and so when i got to his house i was terrified i don't know what to do i know where to start

1609
03:05:08,440 --> 03:05:13,480
you know i've been asked to do this what the heck do i do i don't even know how i help the dog

1610
03:05:13,480 --> 03:05:22,680
much less to help a child or somebody sick and so i've sat there with him and his mom and dad

1611
03:05:24,520 --> 03:05:32,600
for several hours just talking and feeling out the situation and silently praying lord help me

1612
03:05:32,600 --> 03:05:40,440
um you got me into this how do i deal with this what do i do and this voice said not an audible

1613
03:05:40,440 --> 03:05:45,480
voice but just something spoke to me and said just hug him just reach out and hug him

1614
03:05:46,840 --> 03:05:55,080
and so i waited till the perfect time to do so and i reached out and i hugged him real good

1615
03:05:56,600 --> 03:06:02,040
and he couldn't eat couldn't eat hadn't been able to eat most of his life at all if he eat

1616
03:06:02,040 --> 03:06:09,320
he would throw up he had this mitochondrial dna disease which was your body just doesn't

1617
03:06:09,320 --> 03:06:15,000
digest food and get the nourishments from it so usually they don't live past 12 13 years old

1618
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:22,440
they're dead and so he had to make a wish and this group of people pulled around him

1619
03:06:25,720 --> 03:06:31,080
and he's in college now he's completely healed he's fine wow yep

1620
03:06:31,400 --> 03:06:31,900
mm-hmm

1621
03:06:34,280 --> 03:06:41,320
and it is a lot more to it in that party right there you see all these people there are hundreds

1622
03:06:41,320 --> 03:06:52,520
in there people hundreds of washington washington dc the most prominent intel folks um judges doctors

1623
03:06:52,520 --> 03:06:58,520
cardiologists his grandpa was their cardiologist and i'm sitting at a table

1624
03:06:59,400 --> 03:07:06,440
um next to jim's table there's just these big round white tables with cloths with jewish flags

1625
03:07:06,440 --> 03:07:18,920
and it was just i never been to a bar mitzvah but um the table behind me i heard this ruckus

1626
03:07:18,920 --> 03:07:23,160
and the band they were dancing just like that whole crowd you know they knew how to party and

1627
03:07:23,560 --> 03:07:28,680
they were having the best time i'm sitting watching my children have fun and

1628
03:07:30,680 --> 03:07:40,920
i heard this ruckus next thing i know um jim's wife debbie grabs me said picks me up basically

1629
03:07:40,920 --> 03:07:46,520
and pulls me to this other table and said you got to help this guy and he was slumped over face down

1630
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:54,040
i mean alcohol completely uh turned white and they were trying to revive him couldn't get him away

1631
03:07:55,080 --> 03:08:02,520
and uh they drug me through the crowd and i put my hands on his shoulders very inside did he

1632
03:08:02,520 --> 03:08:10,360
he set up and took a big breath and they looked at me and said my god you you saved him that

1633
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:12,520
that happened in that party

1634
03:08:16,920 --> 03:08:17,960
wow yep

1635
03:08:20,440 --> 03:08:23,880
we're dead that's heavy in front of these people imagine

1636
03:08:28,120 --> 03:08:34,440
that's washington how do you how do you even deal with that like being you

1637
03:08:35,400 --> 03:08:42,680
and that happening like how how do you even comprehend that i don't

1638
03:08:45,480 --> 03:08:46,120
i don't

1639
03:08:51,240 --> 03:08:51,640
yeah

1640
03:08:56,760 --> 03:08:57,800
that's amazing man

1641
03:08:57,800 --> 03:09:05,240
man that's helped a lot of people and he he doesn't always talk about it because

1642
03:09:05,960 --> 03:09:12,440
he's afraid of sounding like you know that he does special things he doesn't want the credit for it

1643
03:09:12,440 --> 03:09:19,400
but he really has put a lot of energy and a lot of effort into helping people um not always in

1644
03:09:19,400 --> 03:09:24,600
front of people either you know behind closed doors right most of it's private he's very

1645
03:09:24,600 --> 03:09:29,560
very emotional when it comes to that understandably

1646
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:39,720
this little boy he's in his 20s now he's a junior in college wow yep

1647
03:09:45,880 --> 03:09:53,400
but now i don't know i don't know dan i have no clue sorry dad it's always interesting when

1648
03:09:53,400 --> 03:09:58,920
when people ask us what our experience is you know they expect us to say we see ufos and aliens

1649
03:09:59,720 --> 03:10:05,320
but it's so much more complicated than that and it comes down to this sort of thing as well how do

1650
03:10:05,320 --> 03:10:11,720
you explain that to someone in a 10-minute you know conversation that it also is so spiritual

1651
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:17,080
and there's like a healing aspect to it it's so multifaceted that i don't think people can really

1652
03:10:17,080 --> 03:10:23,560
wrap their heads around it but if like anyone could try to understand from a base perspective

1653
03:10:23,560 --> 03:10:30,520
it's just like that this is a benevolent spiritual experience that is open to everybody

1654
03:10:31,080 --> 03:10:37,880
that for some reason we are you know i guess semi-responsible for sharing and promoting to people

1655
03:10:40,280 --> 03:10:45,080
is there if it were evil why would we be why would he be able to heal people you know yeah

1656
03:10:45,080 --> 03:10:51,320
yeah well i don't see it as me doing it it's this phenomenon maybe whether you're a vessel

1657
03:10:51,320 --> 03:10:58,040
or whether you're doing it it's like happening around us and so i'm not saying necessarily you

1658
03:10:58,040 --> 03:11:04,760
have powers or anything but there is evidence and facts that you for some reason are surrounded by

1659
03:11:04,760 --> 03:11:12,520
healing and if this were an evil sort of phenomenon why would this happen yeah be happening

1660
03:11:15,080 --> 03:11:22,200
it's it's really hard to comprehend all of this i mean it's it's so mind-blowing

1661
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:30,920
yeah it's it's incredible it's incredible um and there's there i know like we talk about this a

1662
03:11:30,920 --> 03:11:40,680
little bit last night but um there's people who try to gain this or or tap into this phenomenon

1663
03:11:40,680 --> 03:11:46,840
the same way you do right like i know tim there's diana talked about in her new book how tim

1664
03:11:47,400 --> 03:11:54,200
he has like a protocol that he tries to follow to try to like cleanse his spirit and and meditate

1665
03:11:54,200 --> 03:11:59,720
and be in the sunlight to where he can sort of people can can learn or train themselves to tap

1666
03:11:59,720 --> 03:12:05,400
into into something else that you are just intuitively you're already hardwired into it

1667
03:12:05,400 --> 03:12:11,080
yeah and in one way or another well that's what this they're studying my brain for right they know

1668
03:12:11,080 --> 03:12:20,440
it's connected um on the history channel thing the scientist said he's can just you know buddhist

1669
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:26,280
monk studies 30 years of his life to get to this enlightened state and they said well he just goes

1670
03:12:26,280 --> 03:12:32,760
in it instantly just at my fingers and i'm there and i don't understand it i don't know that i'm

1671
03:12:32,760 --> 03:12:41,160
even doing that i just i don't i don't understand but that's questions i don't know and right i try

1672
03:12:41,160 --> 03:12:51,000
to stay away from that i just had the i have a mission to share this and the way it comes
