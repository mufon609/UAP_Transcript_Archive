00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
On December 12th, 2024, around 6.05 p.m. Eastern, I walked right past my balcony window.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:17,600
I lived right across the river from the Newark FBI office, and I saw a massive 50-foot, approximately

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,240
vaunt the black boomerang go right past my window.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,760
Thailand floated right across the river, right through the buildings downtown Newark.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,760
Three white lights, two red, in a line on the back, made no noise.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,480
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to another episode of Debriefed.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,600
My name is Chris Ramsey, and today we're going to take a good, hard look at a document submitted

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:53,920
to the Paranet website in 1987 by none other than the godfather of conspiracy, John Lear.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,160
Before we do that, I would highly encourage you guys to leave a like, subscribe, maybe

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,640
hit the notification bell if you do enjoy these uploads.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,600
And if you're listening on audio, one thing that you could do that costs absolutely nothing

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,240
is leave us a five-star review on whatever platform it is you're listening to this episode

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,920
on, and maybe a comment on why it is you like these deep dives.

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,840
It goes a very long way, actually, in helping us propel into a favorable algorithm on Spotify

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,480
and iTunes, et cetera.

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,920

It is a vastly growing community where we continuously, every day, have deep discussions

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,980
on the Discord, which, by the way, you can also join, and I'll leave all the links to

22
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,980
that below.

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,980
Folks, we've paid the bills.

24
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,700
I think it's time to get into it.

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,060
OK, before I read these out, I will give you a brief history on Mr. Lear himself.

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,340
So John Lear is a former aviation captain, a commercial pilot, but also happens to be

27
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,540
the son of Learjet inventor Bill Lear.

28
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,780
John Lear, until he passed away a few years ago, was one of the most prominent figures

29
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,580
in the UFO landscape.

30
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,700
He not only had multiple FAA certifications, but also flew on several missions for the

31
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,420
CIA, which inevitably made him a little bit more credible.

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,240
When he came out with the information that someone he knew worked for a secret facility

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:40,060
within the United States government at Area 51 called Section 4, otherwise known as S4.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,220
Yes, folks, he introduced the world to Bob Lazar.

35
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,500
He met with George Knapp and set up the most famous interview in ufology, I believe, to

36
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
date.

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:56,580
Well, there's several, actually nine, flying saucers, flying disks that are out there of

38
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,180
extraterrestrial origin.

39
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,440
However, over time, Lear's assertions became increasingly outlandish.

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,640
He would go on rants about lunar bases, the moon being a hologram and mind control projects.

41
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,800
And while some admired him as a whistleblower, others felt his credibility waned as he got

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,200
into more and more extreme conspiracies.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,460
Say what you want about the guy, but this guy was talking about mind control things

44
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,640
before MKUltra went public.

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,980
He was also talking about underground military bases where they were reverse engineering

46
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,160
alien craft before we even heard of Area 51.

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,840
Now, there is an entire other side to this is that he potentially could be a CIA, meaning

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,080
that the government used him in an active disinformation campaign, which would not be

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
unheard of.

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,560
And in fact, John Lear admits to this.

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,640
He says that there is a potential that they fed him false information and that would muddy

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,720
up the actual correct information that he was able to leak out.

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,100
And that's the way a lot of these disinformation campaigns function, is that they will put

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,700
out a vast majority of truth and insert only one or two fibs.

55
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,380
But these fibs sounding so extreme and bizarre in nature that it makes you literally throw

56
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,420
the baby out with the bathwater and say, well, I guess they're lying about everything.

57
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,120
Now, what those lies are, I guess is up to the public to decide.

58
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,360
And that's something we're going to try to get to the bottom of today, as we're going

59
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,660
to read through a statement that he put out so many years ago in 1987 detailing the government's

60
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:37,300
involvement with EBEs or extra terrestrial biological entities, UFOs, the reverse engineering

61
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,780
and the government's role in future disclosure.

62
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,780
This all begins with a nice cover letter.

63
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,860
This is from John W. White.

64
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,900
If I'm not mistaken, John White is also a UFO researcher and he is just forwarding this

65
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,620
document that was put up on their version of Reddit, essentially.

66
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,460
And he's saying, he's saying the following, dear somebody, I don't know who that is, but

67
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,700
it says, I'm sending this astounding document about UFOs to you because I feel you will

68
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,380
be interested and or have a need to know.

69
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,220
I obtained it by downloading it from an electronic bulletin board called Paranet, which is headquartered

70
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,140
in Arizona and has regional nodes.

71
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,180
Paranet is dedicated to disseminating information about paranormal phenomena and acting as a

72
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,180
forum for discussion.

73
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,460
Memberships and Paranet is free and open to the public.

74
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,300
All it takes is a computer and a modem.

75
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,580
You can dial in at 603-837-0062.

76
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:38,260
Then find the original node nearest you so your phone charges will be minimized.

77
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,060
Sincerely, John White.

78
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,900
And whoever this was directed to wrote underneath a few questions that my guess is he faxed

79
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:52,740
back to this person back then and underlining Paranet and saying, who set this up?

80
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,900
Who sustains it financially and why?

81
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,460
Who benefits from those who really know things identifying themselves and their views via

82
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,060
this bulletin board?

83
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,020
I smell federal deceit, so even the person that this was sent to back in 1987 thought

84
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,260
that this also was a PSYOP.

85
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:19,020
Folks, we stand on the very shaky shoulders of a lot of conspiracy theorists before us.

86
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,220
Let's get into his document.

87
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,620
It starts by saying, John Lear has requested that the following file be published on Paranet

88
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,660
It is our philosophy to encourage debate on paranormal issues, no matter how controversial,

89
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,300
and we welcome his input.

90
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,460
The information contained in this file has not been verified by Paranet, nor do the opinions

91
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,260
expressed herein necessarily reflect those of the administrator or other Paranet staff

92
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
members.

93
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,500
We can state, however, that John is who he says he is and has numerous contacts and sensitive

94
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,660
positions that could conceivably allow him to access information of this type.

95
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,980
And that, folks, has been known for a very long time is that John was working in the

96
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,500
CIA and did say on numerous occasions that he was being fed information by people who

97
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,820
were on the inside or otherwise known as people in the program.

98
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,020
So here is the statement.

99
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,020
We begin.

100
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:17,060
This is December 29th, 1987, folks, almost, almost 40 years to the day.

101
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,060
That is insane.

102
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,140
John Lear, a captain for a major U.S. airline, has flown over 160 different types of aircraft

103
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,480
in over 50 different countries.

104
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:33,020
He holds 17 world speed record in the Lear jet and is the only pilot ever to hold every

105
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,020
airline certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.

106
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,080
Lear has flown missions worldwide for the CIA and other government agencies.

107
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,840
A former Nevada state senator candidate, he is the son of William P. Lear, designer of

108
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:57,200
the Lear Jet Executive Airplane, the 8-Track Stereo and founder of Lear Siegler Corporation.

109
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,960
Lear became interested in the subject of UFOs 13 months ago after talking with United States

110
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Air Force personnel who had witnessed a UFO landing at Bentwater's Air Force Base near

111
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:16,760
London, England, and three small aliens walking up to the wing commander.

112
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,680
So the Lackenheath-Bentwater's incident, now I'm saying is it Lackenheath, Lakenheath,

113
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,240
I'm not sure, but that does sound familiar.

114
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,560
Isn't that the current Air Force base that is being incurred by a lot of these unexplainable

115
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,280
drone activities?

116
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,640
So the Lackenheath-Bentwater's incident was a series of radar and visual contacts with

117
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:44,920
UFOs over air bases in eastern England on the night of August 13th and 14th in 1956.

118
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,840
So it involved a personnel from the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force.

119
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,340
I mean, some of these targets were detected approaching Bentwater's from the east at a

120
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,200
speed estimated from 2 to 4,000 miles an hour.

121
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,320
It passed overhead a rapidly moving white light was observed from the ground while the

122
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,880
pilot of a C-47 at 4,000 feet over Bentwater's reported a similar light had passed beneath

123
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,960
his craft.

124
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:15,880
At this point, Bentwater's alerted the US tenanted RAF Lakenheath base 40 miles to the

125
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,160
northwest to look out for targets.

126
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,120
And then ground personnel at Lakenheath made visual sightings of several luminous objects,

127
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,000
including two which arrived, made a sharp changing course and appeared to merge before

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
moving off.

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,360
And so what Mr. Lear is getting to here that it didn't stop with radar and visual sightings

130
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,160
of a UFO, but that it continued with three small aliens walking up to the wing commander.

131
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,560
All right, we carry on here.

132
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,760
Note to the press, the government of the United States continues to rely on your personal

133
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,960
and professional gullibility to suppress the information contained herein.

134
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,120
Your cooperation over the past 40 years has exceeded our wildest expectations and we salute

135
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
you.

136
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,720
To not revolve around the earth, the United States government has been in business with

137
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,520
little gray extraterrestrials for about 20 years.

138
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:12,560
The first truth stated here got Giordano Bruno burned at the stake in 1600 AD for daring to

139
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,280
propose that this was real.

140
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,240
The second truth has gotten far more people killed trying to state it publicly than will

141
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,400
ever be known.

142
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,880
That was a dark fact right there.

143
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,160
Wow.

144
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,860
But the truth must be told.

145
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,780
The fact that the earth revolves around the sun was successfully suppressed by the church

146
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,100
for over 200 years.

147
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,260
It eventually caused a major upheaval in the church government and thought a realignment

148
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,980
of social and traditional values that was in the 1800s.

149
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,260
Now about 400 years after the first truth was pronounced, we must again face the shocking

150
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
facts.

151
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,540
The horrible truth, the government has been hiding from us for over 40 years.

152
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:01,860
Unfortunately, the horrible truth is far more horrible than the government had ever imagined.

153
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,500
In its effort to protect democracy, our government sold us to the aliens.

154
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,700
And here's how it happened.

155
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:13,500
But before I begin, I'd like to offer a word in the defense of those who bargained us away.

156
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,380
They had the best of intentions.

157
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,040
Well, you know that saying, the road to hell was paved with good intentions.

158
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,260
Germany may have recovered a flying saucer as early as 1939.

159
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:31,120
General James H. Doolittle went to Sweden in 1946 to inspect a flying saucer that had

160
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,060
crashed there in Spitsbergen.

161
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,580
In 1947, President Truman established a group of 12 of the top military scientific personnel

162
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,060
of their time.

163
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,180
They were known as MJ-12, or Majestic 12.

164
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:53,140
The people that control this information is an organization that we know of as MJ-12.

165
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,320
Although the group exists today, none of the original members are still alive.

166
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,740
The last one to die was Gordon Gray, former Secretary of the Army in 1984.

167
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,300
As each member passed away, the group itself appointed a new member to fill the position.

168
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,740
There is some speculation that the group known as MJ-12 expanded to at least several more

169
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,340
members.

170
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,380
There were several more saucer crashes in the late 1940s.

171
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:26,540
One in Roswell, New Mexico, one in Aztec, New Mexico, and one near Laredo, Texas, about

172
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,060
30 miles inside the Mexican border.

173
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,860
Consider, if you will, the position of the United States government at the time.

174
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,300
There are several crashes reported here, one of which is mentioned as Aztec, New Mexico,

175
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,820
and this is one I'm currently looking into as I'm reading a book on it, and there seems

176
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:51,260
to be a substantial and overwhelming amount of evidence of documentation of this retrieval

177
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:59,380
to have happened and that this craft was eventually, potentially brought into Los Alamos.

178
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,020
By looking at the 4chan whistleblower, if you haven't checked that video out yet, I

179
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,460
highly recommend, but we did a deep dive on this person who said he basically worked for

180
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,740
branch of the government that did these crash retrievals, but he would say that, yeah, near

181
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,580
Mexico and New Mexico, that's where they would go down.

182
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,180
They avoid that spot like the plague currently, but back then they would find quite a bit

183
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,060
of them go down in that vicinity.

184
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,900
It really, really makes you ponder that during that time, obviously there was the Manhattan

185
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,680
Project that came from this and Oppenheimer and all of that where the Germans were racing

186
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,660
against the Russians and the Americans to try and build a nuke, and during that time

187
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:44,540
there was a ton of nuclear work being done and thus UFO incursions were happening at

188
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,400
all these bases, and namely, if you want to check it out, there's an amazingly brilliant

189
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,940
video by YouTuber Jesse Michael's American Alchemy who put that out.

190
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,360
Go check that out.

191
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,940
What a fun rabbit hole to jump down.

192
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,700
He did a brilliant job on that.

193
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,140
So think about this, the government, we know that during the Cold War when they even heard

194
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:07,940
about psychics or Russia's sort of psychic activity into mind reading and mind control

195
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,200
and all of that, they started their own branches of the very same work because they said, hey,

196
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,980
if this stuff is real, we can't take a chance and not look into it.

197
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,740
We have to at least pour some resources into it and look at it ourselves.

198
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,660
The same has to be said about the UFO thing.

199
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,220
I mean, Foo fighters in the war were avoiding these things because they were almost colliding

200
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,820
with them during their missions.

201
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,840
There had to be an extreme amount of research into this topic by both the Axis and the Allies

202
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
back then.

203
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,980
You'd be a fool to think they weren't at least trying to uncover what was going on and militarizing

204
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,980
it somehow.

205
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,340
I digress.

206
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,420
Consider if you will, the position of the United States government at that time.

207
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,680
They proudly thought of themselves as the most powerful nation on earth.

208
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,900
Having recently produced the atomic bomb, an achievement so stupendous, it would take

209
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,740
Russia four years to catch up and only with the help of traitors to democracy.

210
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,260
They had built a jet aircraft that had exceeded the speed of sound in flight.

211
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,380
They had built jet bombers with intercontinental range that could carry weapons of enormous

212
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,380
destruction.

213
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,940
The post-war era and the future seemed bright.

214
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Now imagine what it was like for those same leaders, all of whom had witnessed the panic

215
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,380
of Orson Welles radio broadcast, The War of the Worlds in 1938.

216
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,460
We are bringing you an eyewitness account of what's happening on the Wilmeth farm, Grovers Mill, New Jersey.

217
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,460
Lords are turning in a plane.

218
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,460
On the whole field, caught up by the woods and fires, there's gas tank tanks in the automobiles.

219
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,660
Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue

220
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,780
the broadcast from Grovers Mill.

221
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,900
Thousands of Americans panicked at a realistically presented invasion of earth by beings from

222
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,220
another planet.

223
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,260
Imagine their horror as they actually viewed the dead bodies of these frightening looking

224
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,420
little creatures with enormous eyes, reptilian skin and claw-like fingers.

225
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,100
Imagine their shock as they attempted to determine how these strange saucers were powered and

226
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,220
could discover no part even remotely similar to components they were familiar with.

227
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:15,260
No cylinders or pistons, no vacuum tubes or turbines or hydraulic actuators.

228
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,860
It is only when you fully understand the overwhelming helplessness the government was faced with

229
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,940
in the late 1940s that you can comprehend their perceived need for a total, thorough

230
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,340
and sweeping cover-up to include the use of deadly force.

231
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:42,300
When something this paradigm shifting on the military battlefield is encountered, you have

232
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:48,900
to acknowledge that putting this in the wrong hands can lead to devastating and obviously

233
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,820
world-changing consequences.

234
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,780
So their use of deadly force to protect this secret, according to them, was justified.

235
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:02,960
The cover-up was so successful that as late as 1985, a senior scientist with the Jet Propulsion

236
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:09,060
Laboratory in Pasadena, California, Dr. Al Hibbs, would look at a videotape of an enormous

237
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:15,420
flying saucer and state the record, I'm not going to assign anything to that UFO phenomena

238
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,740
without a lot more data.

239
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,140
Dr. Hibbs was looking at the naked emperor and saying he certainly looks naked, but that

240
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,100
doesn't prove he's naked.

241
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,500
Sounds a lot like Arrow.

242
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,060
In July of 1952, a panicked government watched helplessly as a squadron of flying saucers

243
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:37,000
flew over Washington D.C. and buzzed the White House, the Capitol building and the Pentagon.

244
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,100
It took all the imagination and intimidation the government could muster to force that

245
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,780
incident out of the memory of the public.

246
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,780
I am here to discuss the so-called flying saucers.

247
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,820
We can say that the recent sightings are in no way connected with any secret development

248
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,100
by any department of the United States.

249
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
A pretty incredible incident.

250
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,980
Had that happened today, it kind of is happening today, if you think about it.

251
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,360
Thousands of sightings occurred during the Korean War and several more saucers were retrieved

252
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,700
by the Air Force.

253
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,380
Some were stored at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

254
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,860
Some were stored at Air Force bases near the location of the crash site.

255
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,740
What I'm going to read to you next is interesting because this was actually echoed by Ross Coulthard

256
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
recently.

257
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:27,280
As recent as last year, Ross had said that there was a giant UFO somewhere that was too

258
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,860
big to move, so they built the base around it.

259
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,820
That really made headlines in the UFO community.

260
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,940
People are going to question what I'm about to say.

261
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,700
What if some of that shit is so big it can't be moved?

262
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,500
So big they built a building over it in a country outside of the United States of America.

263
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,760
But in fact, John Lear, I mean, he's got it right here.

264
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,940
One saucer was so enormous and the logistic problems of transportation so enormous that

265
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,000
it was buried at the crash site and remains there today.

266
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,340
The stories are legendary on transporting crashed saucers over long distances, moving

267
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:09,580
only at night, purchasing complete farms, slashing through forests, blocking major highways,

268
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:16,860
sometimes driving two and three low boys in tandem with an extraterrestrial load 100 feet

269
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,240
in diameter.

270
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,180
On April 30th, 1964, the first communication between these aliens and the U.S. government

271
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,140
took place at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.

272
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:32,060
Three saucers had landed at a pre-arranged area and a meeting was held between the aliens

273
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,620
and intelligence officers of the U.S. government.

274
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:41,980
All right, folks, the Holloman Air Force incident is pretty infamous in UFO lore.

275
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,980
And one of the reasons why is because there was a documentary actually put out by the

276
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,360
CIA back in the day.

277
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,860
And at the very end of this documentary is about an eight second clip.

278
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:01,780
This eight second clip is what seems to be has a flying saucer coming down on sort of

279
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,980
desert terrain and about to land and the video feed cuts.

280
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:13,180
Turns out the, I believe, director of that very documentary says that that video exists

281
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,960
uncut.

282
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,900
And that as the video goes on, this craft comes to the ground, lands, and exiting from

283
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,820
it are multiple alien beings.

284
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,500
And that's where a meeting happened.

285
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,820
But hidden in plain sight, they decided to keep in footage in this documentary.

286
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,820
And here's a clip.

287
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,360
And in 1973, they go to Bob Emenegger and Alan Sadler, two producers in Los Angeles,

288
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,580
and they ask them to do UFO documentary.

289
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,180
And Bob Emenegger is a total UFO skeptic said, well, you mean this is for real?

290
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,740
And at that point, the security manager, Paul Schardl at Norton Air Force Base said, what

291
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,820
would you, what would you say if I told you?

292
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,820
And he said, well, there's a million ship landed at Holman Air Force Base, six o'clock

293
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,100
in the morning in May of 1971.

294
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,540
And we filmed it from three different vantage points, two on the ground, one in a helicopter.

295
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,620
And we will allow you to use the film for your documentary.

296
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:13,620
So he puts his documentary and then what happens at the end of documentary is they say, we

297
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,380
can't use the film, we can't allow, it's the Watergate, it's bad timing.

298
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,860
We can't allow you to use the film and they pull the film.

299
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:27,620
So Bob's my friend, I phoned him up, Bob, there's eight seconds of film in there.

300
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,860
And he goes, well, yeah.

301
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,940
And I said, you told me they told the film.

302
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,540
Oh no, he said, it's background.

303
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,300
And I said, background, what do you mean it's background?

304
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,540
And he said, it didn't show anything.

305
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,540
And what it is, is you see the hills of Holman and you see this object, this brilliantly

306
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,860
lit object at six o'clock in the morning coming over the hills, but it's in a distance.

307
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,260
So you don't see it close up and you don't see the alien when the alien gets out.

308
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,540
That's the classified part.

309
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,820
So they want you to know the Holman happened and they allowed them to use this, the eight

310
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,260
seconds of the film, but the rest of the film, the classified part was pulled.

311
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,380
Make of that what you will, but that is one compelling story.

312
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:12,060
So during the period of 1969 to 1971, MJ-12 representing the US government made a deal

313
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:18,780
with these creatures called EBEs or Extraterrestrial Biological Entities named by Detlev Brank.

314
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,260
He was an original MJ-12 member and sixth president of Johns Hopkins University.

315
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:33,500
The deal was that in exchange for technology they would provide to us, we agreed to ignore

316
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:40,460
the abductions that were going on and suppress information on the cattle mutilations.

317
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,860
And to further illustrate this point, here's a 1988 episode of Gumby.

318
00:22:48,780 --> 00:23:01,580
Hey, what's going on here?

319
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:08,860
We need samples of genes and chromosomes from your kind to develop a stronger breed of people

320
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:15,660
because on our planet radiation damages our DNA so that we are dying off to extinction.

321
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,100
We'll help you, but you know we need help too.

322
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,580
What do you need?

323
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,980
The people on earth are suffering from many kinds of pollution.

324
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,020
We need your advanced technology to help us develop a clean source of energy.

325
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,860
The EBEs assured MJ-12 that the abductions, usually lasting about two hours, were merely

326
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,020
the ongoing monitoring of developing civilizations.

327
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:47,500
And here John lists out the purposes for the abductions and what they turned out to be.

328
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,700
Number one, the insertion of a three millimeter spherical device through the nasal cavity of

329
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,380
the abductee into the brain.

330
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,940
The device is used for the biological monitoring, tracking, and control of the abductee.

331
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,620
This is something touched on in several books by thousands of abductees actually,

332
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,740
which is interesting.

333
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:13,740
Looking at the work of John Mack, David Jacobs, Bud Hopkins, this would come up quite frequently

334
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,340
that this rod, which had a very tiny ball on the end of it, was inserted into the nasal cavity

335
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,820
way far up and then when extracted that ball was gone.

336
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,500
What's also interesting to me is that it says to control the abductee, which makes me think

337
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:35,180
that these gray beings, maybe perhaps not the other beings, but the gray ones specifically,

338
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,900
couldn't mind control you maybe without it?

339
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,580
Number two, implementation of post-hypnotic suggestion to carry out a specific activity

340
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,780
during a specific time period, the actuation of which will occur within the next two to

341
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,420
five years.

342
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,300
Well, there's that.

343
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,940
I mean, this was 1987.

344
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,340
That would make it 1992.

345
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:03,180
At the latest, maybe they did, I don't know, carry out some specific activity that is unbeknownst

346
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,900
to us that has perhaps little or no consequence to our daily lives.

347
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,620
I don't know, but that seems speculatory at best.

348
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,340
Number three, termination of some people so that they could function as living sources

349
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,500
for biological material and substances.

350
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,560
Okay.

351
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,820
Number four, termination of individuals who represent a threat to the continuation of

352
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,940
their activity.

353
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,980
In the last couple of years, have you had incidences that have caused you to be in

354
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,540
fear for your life for addressing these issues?

355
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,220
Yes, personally.

356
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:40,620
I just want everyone to note that he's coming forward in fear of his life to put in perspective

357
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,900
if they were really not scared about this information coming out, why would someone

358
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,180
be intimidated like that?

359
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,540
Number five, affect genetic engineering experiments.

360
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,620
Number six, impregnation of human females and early termination of pregnancies to secure

361
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,300
the crossbreed infant.

362
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:03,100
It seems like the craziest, but honestly, this is the most widely reported among abductees.

363
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:09,420
Is the genetic engineering that has taken place on board and most of the time has to

364
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,220
do with what seems to be some type of hybridization program.

365
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,540
Again, this isn't stuff that I'm making up.

366
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:24,220
It's stuff that I've read and that's quite expansive in terms of the literature that's

367
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,700
out there and the documentation of this.

368
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,420
Like this has been documented extensively.

369
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,500
Mainly through post-hypnotic regression, because for some reason, apparently the people who've

370
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:44,060
been abducted, their memories are wiped, but for some reason, I guess these EBEs don't

371
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,820
have access to the subconscious.

372
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,980
The impregnation thing, again, that comes up quite a bit.

373
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,700
Does this mean all extraterrestrials are doing this?

374
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,100
No.

375
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,180
Does this mean any of them are doing this?

376
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,700
No, but it does suggest it.

377
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,060
With extraordinary claims, you require extraordinary evidence.

378
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:07,100
The only evidence that exists that's out there today currently is for the most part, at best,

379
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,660
anecdotal.

380
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,620
Let's be clear, that doesn't imply that I'm invalidating this anecdotal evidence,

381
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,900
but it is someone's word against another.

382
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,620
What is interesting is that there are thousands of these someone who are saying,

383
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,060
essentially, the same things.

384
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,300
I think when that happens and you gain enough human intelligence testimony, I think you

385
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,820
have to start looking at it more seriously, and I think that's what some of the work of

386
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,620
a lot of these researchers did, including, you know, potentially here at John Lear.

387
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,140
Believe it, don't believe it.

388
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,180
We're going to keep reading.

389
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,540
I think this is really interesting.

390
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,420
I'm not saying that this is what's going on, by the way, folks, all right?

391
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,660
So don't work yourselves up for this.

392
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,940
I would love to hear your opinion on this, whether you think it's true or not,

393
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,140
but I would encourage you to at least do some research on it, because you'll find that

394
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:59,900
the research that I've done with multiple people who have, you know, great educational

395
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,180
backgrounds and varying degrees of credibility have talked about this very thing for a very

396
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,660
long time.

397
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,980
It's kind of like the dark side, like ufology and the UFO stuff.

398
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,060
You know, there's the UAP, the drone, all this, but then there's like a deeper,

399
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,820
more nefarious section to ufology that he's touching on.

400
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,500
And that's, it can be disturbing for some to look down that road

401
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,740
and others choose just to ignore it completely.

402
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,860
And that's totally fine.

403
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:32,860
So the US government was not initially aware of their far-reaching consequences of their deal.

404
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,020
They were led to believe that the abductions were essentially benign.

405
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,700
And since they figured the abductions would probably go on anyway, whether they agreed to

406
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,260
or not, they merely insisted that a current list of abductees be submitted.

407
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,340
On a periodic basis to MJ-12 and the National Security Council.

408
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,540
Does this sound incredible?

409
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,940
An actual list of abductees sent to the National Security Council?

410
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,420
Read on, because I have news for you.

411
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:07,740
All right, here we go into what I assume is some speculation.

412
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,580
I mean, this whole document might just be speculatory, but regardless,

413
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,780
the EBEs have a genetic disorder in that their digestive system is atrophied

414
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,060
and non-functional.

415
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,300
Some speculate that they were involved in some type of accident or nuclear war,

416
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,180
or possibly on the backside of an evolutionary genetic curve, meaning they're like devolving.

417
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,980
In order to sustain themselves, they used an enzyme or hormonal secretion

418
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,500
obtained from the tissue that they extract from humans and animals.

419
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,100
Note that cows and humans are genetically similar.

420
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,420
In the event of a national disaster, cow's blood can be used by humans.

421
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,460
We've talked about this before with the EBO document.

422
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,380
The secretions obtained are then mixed with hydrogen peroxide,

423
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,060
applied on the skin by spreading or dipping parts of their bodies in the solution.

424
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:02,380
The body absorbs the solution, then secretes the waste back out through the skin.

425
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,260
This sounds familiar.

426
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:09,740
Obviously, this document came out way before the EBO document came out,

427
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:16,220
suggesting that the pores on the skin were made to sort of secrete whatever it was.

428
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:24,220
But what he says here is the secretions are mixed with hydrogen peroxide to disinfect.

429
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,740
Why would that be necessary?

430
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,740
The EBO document said that they assumed that they drank liquids.

431
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,020
What John Lear is alluding to here is that instead,

432
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,660
they dipped parts of their body or spread this solution.

433
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,060
Now, how can you tell the difference between what you're consuming

434
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,420
and what you're excreting, like your body, for instance?

435
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,380
It doesn't make sense.

436
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,580
That's like feeding ourselves through our own anuses.

437
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:54,700
It just doesn't seem, obviously it doesn't seem delectable,

438
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,460
but it also doesn't seem very logical.

439
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,420
Yeah, who knows?

440
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,700
So the cattle mutilations that were prevalent throughout the period from 1973 to 1983,

441
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,500
and publicly noted through newspaper and magazine stories,

442
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:14,700
and included a documentary produced by Linda Howe for the Denver CBS affiliate KMGH-TV,

443
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,380
were for the collection of these tissues by the aliens.

444
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,100
The mutilations included genitals taken,

445
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,420
rectums cored out to the colon,

446
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,820
eyes, tongue, and throat all surgically removed with extreme precision.

447
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,980
In some cases, the incisions were made by cutting between the cells,

448
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,300
a process that we are not yet capable of performing in the field.

449
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,580
That's really interesting.

450
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,340
Wow. How is that even...

451
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,580
How can you even verify that?

452
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,740
In many of the mutilations, there was no blood found at all in the carcass,

453
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,820
yet there was no vascular collapse of the internal organs.

454
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,100
This has been also noted in the human mutilations.

455
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,660
One of the first of which was Sergeant Jonathan P. Luet

456
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:02,140
at the White Sands Missile Test Range in 1956,

457
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,780
who was found three days after an Air Force major had witnessed his abduction

458
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:11,500
by a disc-shaped object at 0300 hours

459
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,700
while on a search for missile debris downrange.

460
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,700
The following is a little explicit, folks.

461
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,620
Forewarned.

462
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,020
His genitals had been removed,

463
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,060
rectum cored out in a surgically precise plug up to the colon,

464
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:31,580
eyes removed, and all blood removed with, again, no vascular collapse.

465
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,860
From some of the evidence, it is apparent that this surgery

466
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:39,820
is accomplished in most cases while the victim, animal or human,

467
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,780
is still alive.

468
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,700
The various parts of the body are taken to various underground laboratories,

469
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,380
one of which is known to be near the small New Mexico town of Dulce.

470
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,460
This jointly occupied CIA-Alien facility

471
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,260
has been described as enormous with huge tiled walls that go on forever.

472
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,380
Witnesses have reported huge vats filled with amber liquid

473
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,660
with parts of human bodies being stirred inside.

474
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,660
Now this, folks, sounds like a hellish nightmare.

475
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,420
Let's just stop here for a second,

476
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,860
because I do want to acknowledge something,

477
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,740
that John Lear has never seen any of this stuff.

478
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,740
This is absolute speculatory information at best,

479
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,460
but he's given zero sources.

480
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,660
Know that I don't assume that this is the truth.

481
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,900
I do find it interesting that there are connections to cattle mutilation,

482
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,460
that there are military sites here that are named,

483
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:50,540
military personnel as well as, I mean, many factors that would indicate

484
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,980
that something is going on, but none of which proves anything.

485
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,660
Before some of you log off being scared of this and like,

486
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,980
this is frightening you, know that this might not be the situation.

487
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,900
And when disinformation happens, which I've mentioned before,

488
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,540
a lot of times the truth is told.

489
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:17,340
And a few little lies are sprinkled throughout,

490
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,380
of which are probably the most unbelievable things.

491
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:29,020
And so, you know, with this stuff, I look for the things that stand out.

492
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,820
And I say to myself, it's either an exaggeration,

493
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,180
a misinterpretation, or disinformation, I think.

494
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,140
Like a vat mixing it with human body parts.

495
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,580
To me, that sounds completely ludicrous, I'll be honest.

496
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,340
Is it real? You know, maybe, who knows.

497
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:49,020
But to me, that sounds like you would add something into a story

498
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,340
to try and incite fear, instill fear in someone.

499
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,940
And so maybe that's him regurgitating information that he was given

500
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,340
to make him fearful of, you know, whatever's going on.

501
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,700
I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine.

502
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,660
We're guessing here.

503
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,980
After the initial agreement, Groom Lake,

504
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,660
one of this nation's most secret test centers,

505
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,420
was closed for a period of about a year, sometime between 1972 and 1974.

506
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,460
And a huge underground facility was constructed

507
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,260
for and with the help of the EBEs.

508
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,860
The bargain for technology was set in place,

509
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,220
but could only be operated by the EBEs themselves.

510
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,740
Needless to say, the advanced technology could not be used

511
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,660
against the EBEs themselves, even if needed.

512
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,420
Now, that is very interesting.

513
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,420
This part I find extremely interesting.

514
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,220
Because if you were an advanced civilization,

515
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,500
the last thing you would want to do is give your most advanced technology

516
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,860
to the most primitive life forms that you've ever encountered.

517
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,260
Instead, you're going to bargain some deal

518
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,220
where they can play with your toys as long as you can supervise it.

519
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,620
And in exchange, yeah, you'll get access to whatever

520
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,300
you were going to get access to anyways.

521
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,820
But it seems like you're playing fair.

522
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,020
You know, this even kind of corresponds to some of the claims

523
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,380
that Bob Lazar made, whereas when he went to S4,

524
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,620
especially on one occasion when he was giving a tour,

525
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,940
he had a look down sort of this hangar hallway

526
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,060
and saw one of these, what he refers to as children,

527
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,860
having a conversation with Air Force staff or the staff that was present.

528
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,180
And, you know, this thing was very, very short and seemed like a child.

529
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,780
And so it would be interesting to find out that they are indeed working with them.

530
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,780
But I suppose if you were working with them,

531
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,700
it wouldn't be under our set of rules.

532
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,220
It would be under theirs.

533
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,900
During the period between 1979 and 1983,

534
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:56,060
it became increasingly obvious to MJ-12 that things were not going as planned.

535
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,260
It became known that many more people in the thousands

536
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,100
were being abducted than were listed on the official abduction lists.

537
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,540
In addition, it became obvious that some, not all,

538
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,860
but some of the nation's missing children had been used for secretions

539
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,220
and other parts required by the aliens.

540
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:21,260
In 1979, there was an altercation of sorts at the Dolce Laboratory.

541
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,620
A special armed forces unit was called in to try and free

542
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,340
a number of our people trapped in the facility

543
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,300
who had become aware of what was really going on.

544
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,780
According to one source, 66 of the soldiers were killed

545
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,140
and our people were not freed.

546
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,300
Okay, what source?

547
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,060
You know, according to a source, anyone can say that.

548
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,540
By 1984, MJ-12 must have been in stark terror

549
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,660
at the mistake they had made in dealing with the EBEs.

550
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,540
They had subtly promoted Close Encounters of the Third Kind and ET

551
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,820
to get the public used to odd-looking aliens

552
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:05,260
that were compassionate, benevolent, and very much our space brothers.

553
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,620
So again, he's stating here that, you know,

554
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,660
Close Encounters and ET, both Spielberg movies, by the way,

555
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,380
were PsyOps to prepare the public, the general public,

556
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:22,060
to sort of become aware of these benevolent, weird, strange-looking creatures.

557
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,620
It is interesting. It is interesting as well that

558
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,020
in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, J. Allen Hynek has a cameo

559
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:35,100
and I think was probably used as a consultant during that movie.

560
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,740
And I mean, Spielberg's fascination with UFOs goes on to today.

561
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,100
He's currently, I think, working on another UFO movie

562
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,140
or alien or UFO related movie that is slated for, I think, 2026.

563
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:53,340
MJ-12 sold the EBEs to the public and we're now faced with the fact

564
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,260
that quite the opposite was true.

565
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,500
In addition, a plan was formulated in 1968 to make the public aware

566
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,780
of the existence of aliens on Earth over the next 20 years

567
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,060
to be culminated with several documentaries to be released

568
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,820
during the 1985 to 1987 period of time.

569
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,580
These documentaries would explain the history and intentions of the EBEs.

570
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,780
The discovery of the grand deception put the entire plan's hopes and dreams

571
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,580
of MJ-12 into utter confusion and panic.

572
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,740
Well, these documentaries are still coming out.

573
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,100
You know, there was the recent one, which was, I believe, was it called Encounters?

574
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,140
Or it was on Netflix and it was Spielberg once again.

575
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,420
So very interesting.

576
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,700
So meeting at the Country Club, a remote lodge with a private golf course,

577
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,180
comfortable sleeping and working quarters, and its own private airship built by

578
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:49,340
and exclusively for members of MJ-12, it was a factional fight of what to do now.

579
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:55,180
Part of MJ-12 wanted to confess the whole scheme and shambles it had become to the public.

580
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,780
Beg their forgiveness and ask for their support.

581
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:03,260
The other part and majority of MJ-12 argued that there was no way they could do that.

582
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,540
That the situation was untenable.

583
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,860
And there was no use in exciting the public with the horrible truth.

584
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,940
And that the best plan was to continue the development of a weapon

585
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:22,940
so that it could be used against the EBEs under the guise of strategic defense initiative,

586
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,740
which had nothing whatsoever to do with the defense for inbound Russian nuclear missiles.

587
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,900
As these words are being written, Dr. Edward Teller, father of the H-bomb,

588
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:37,420
is personally in the test tunnels of the Nevada test site, driving his workers and associates

589
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,540
in the words of one, like a man possessed.

590
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:47,500
And well, he should, for Dr. Teller is a member of MJ-12, along with Dr. Kissinger,

591
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:54,060
Admiral Bobby Inman, and possibly Admiral Poindexter to name a few of the current MJ-12

592
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,860
members.

593
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:00,780
Now before the grand deception was discovered and according to a meticulous plan of metered

594
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,580
release of information to the public, several documentaries and UFO tapes were made.

595
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:12,060
William Moore, a Burbank, California-based UFO researcher who wrote The Roswell Incident,

596
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:18,380
a book published in 1980 that detailed the crash, recovery, and subsequent cover-up of a UFO with

597
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:24,620
four alien bodies, has made a videotape of two newsmen interviewing a military officer associated

598
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,580
with MJ-12.

599
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:32,540
And the cover-up, the recovery of a number of flying saucers and the existence of a live alien,

600
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:39,340
one of three aliens captured and designated or named EBE-1, EBE-2, and EBE-3,

601
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,580
being held in a facility designated as YY-2 at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

602
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:50,140
The only other facility of this type which is electromagnetically secure is at Edwards

603
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,860
Air Force Base in Mojave, California.

604
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,340
The officer names, as previously mentioned, plus a few others, Harold Brown, Richard Helms,

605
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:03,820
General Vernon Walters, JPL's Dr. Lou Allen, and Dr. Theodore Von Karman, to name a few of the

606
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,460
current and past members of MJ-12.

607
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,780
The officer also relates the fact that EBEs claimed to have created Christ.

608
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:20,540
Now, this did come up as well in the blue documents that were read, allegedly, by Bob Lazar

609
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,700
during his briefing at S4.

610
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,220
Him and Gene Huff had made a project about this.

611
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,180
And this was really, really fascinating to a lot of people.

612
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,660
Extremely classified document dealing with religion, and it's about that thick.

613
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,700
That were containers.

614
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,380
That's how, supposedly, the aliens look at us.

615
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:43,100
That religion was specifically created so we had some rules and regulations for the

616
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,900
soul purpose of not damaging the containers.

617
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,140
Meaning, well, the souls are the bodies, whatever.

618
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,500
Meaning, like, were containers for souls that they're going to use at some point?

619
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,140
Right.

620
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,260
And that they had something to do with different prophets and biblical figures?

621
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,700
Yes.

622
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:08,460
Supposedly, Jesus and two other beings were genetically engineered.

623
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,740
They were implanted in people on Earth in biblical times, and their births were closely

624
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,220
monitored.

625
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,500
Now, just some little connections to that that my wife had brought up were in the Bible,

626
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:25,500
they said that the star had followed Mary wherever she went.

627
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,500
And, you know, that all UFO sightings always start out as people, well, gee, that looks

628
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,460
like a bright star.

629
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,300
And, well, in fact, they said in the Bible, the brightest star in the sky followed her

630
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,940
where she went.

631
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,420
And just make little connections like that.

632
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,140
The EBEs have a type of recording device that has recorded all of Earth's history,

633
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,860
and can display it in a form of a hologram.

634
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,420
This hologram can be filmed, but because of the way holograms work does not come out very

635
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,100
clear on movie or film.

636
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,900
The crucifixion of Christ on the Mount of Olives has allegedly been put on film to show

637
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,460
the public.

638
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:03,260
The EBEs claim to have created Christ, which, in view of the grand deception, could be an

639
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,180
effort to disrupt traditional values for undetermined reasons.

640
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,260
So that's a big one to swallow there.

641
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:16,380
I'm not going to go down this hole because I know I do respect people's right to, you

642
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,260
know, belief.

643
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:22,940
I do understand that some might take offense even at the speculatory nature of this being

644
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,580
true.

645
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:28,300
And I do understand that this can be blasphemous to those who do believe.

646
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,860
But for the sake of research, you know, we are going to entertain these ideas throughout

647
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,820
this podcast.

648
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,620
Another videotape allegedly in existence is an interview with an EBE.

649
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:45,260
Since EBEs communicate telepathically, an Air Force colonel serves as an interpreter.

650
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,220
Just before the recent stock market correction in October 1987, several newsmen, including

651
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:55,660
Bill Moore, had been invited to Washington D.C. to personally film the EBE in a similar

652
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,380
type interview and distribute the film to the public.

653
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,740
Apparently, because of the correction in the market, it was felt the timing was not propitious.

654
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:10,060
In any case, it certainly seems like an odd method to inform the public of extraterrestrials.

655
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,220
But it would be in keeping with the actions of a panicked organization who at this point

656
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,620
in time doesn't know which way to turn.

657
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:21,900
I mean, you want to talk about a panic organization, you know, just look at the people in charge

658
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,860
right now of telling us what the hell is going on with these drone incursions.

659
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:30,060
Moore is also in possession of Moore Aquarius documents, a few pages of which leaked out

660
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,180
several years ago, and detailed the super secret NSA project had been denied by them

661
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,700
until just recently.

662
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:42,060
In a letter to Senator John Glenn, NSA's Director of Policy Julia B. Wetzel wrote,

663
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:47,820
Apparently there is or was an Air Force project with that name, Aquarius, which dealt with UFOs.

664
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,060
Coincidentally, there is also an NSA project by that name.

665
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:57,660
NSA's project Aquarius deals specifically with the communications with aliens, the EBEs.

666
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:04,380
Within the Aquarius program was project Snowbird, a project to test fly a recovered

667
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,420
alien aircraft at Groom Lake, Nevada.

668
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,060
This project continues today at the location.

669
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,540
In the words of an individual who works at Groom Lake,

670
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,500
our people are much better at taking things apart than they are at putting them back together.

671
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,740
So wait, this is 1987.

672
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,820
This is before the world was introduced to Bob Azar.

673
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,620
So that person he's referring to might very well be Bob.

674
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,500
Moore claims he has a contact with MJ-12, feels that they have been stringing him along,

675
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,740
slipping him documents and providing him leads, promising to go public with some of the information

676
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:37,100
on extraterrestrials by the end of 1987.

677
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:42,540
Certain of Moore's statements led one to believe that Moore himself is a government agent working

678
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:48,540
for MJ-12, not to be strung along but string along ever hopeful ufologists that the truth

679
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,820
is just around the corner.

680
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:56,620
He has done nothing but collect the most outrageous rumor mill stories that are floating

681
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,900
around on the grapevine.

682
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:03,980
But, says Lear, Moore may be working with the government and only exposing parts of the truth,

683
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,700
parts aimed to mislead the truth seekers.

684
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,620
Well, consider this.

685
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:13,500
Number one, Moore states emphatically that he is not a government agent, although when

686
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,980
Lee Graham, a Southern California based ufologist, was investigated by DIS,

687
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:23,100
the Defense Investigative Service, for possession of classified documents received from Moore,

688
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,020
Moore himself was not.

689
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:32,700
Moore states emphatically that the cattle mutilations of 73-83 were a hoax by Linda

690
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:38,220
Moulton Howe, producer of Strange Harvest, to create a publicity for herself.

691
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,140
He cites the book Mute Evidence as the bottom line of the hoax.

692
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:47,100
Mute Evidence was a government-sponsored book to explain the mutilations in conventional terms.

693
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,380
Moore does seem like a disinfo guy.

694
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,260
Seeming spooky.

695
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,580
Little spooky vibes coming off Moore.

696
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:00,540
Number three, Moore states that the USAF Academy physics book Introductory Space Science,

697
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:05,180
volume 2, chapter 13, entitled Unidentified Flying Objects, which describes four of the

698
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:11,020
most commonly seen aliens, one of which is the EBE, was written by Lieutenant Colonel Edward R.

699
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:17,100
Thurkelson and Major Donald B. Carpenter, Air Force personnel, who did not know what they were

700
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,940
talking about and were merely citing crackpot references.

701
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:26,300
He, Moore, states that the book was withdrawn to excise the chapter.

702
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,620
If the government felt they were being forced to acknowledge the existence of aliens on Earth

703
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,860
because of the overwhelming evidence such as the October-November sightings in

704
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:42,220
Whiteville, Virginia, and recently released books such as Night Siege by Heineck,

705
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:48,220
and taking into consideration the grand deception and obviously hostile intentions of the EBEs,

706
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:54,060
it might be expedient for MJ-12 to admit the EBEs, but conceal the information on the mutilations

707
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:59,020
and abductions. If MJ-12 and Moore were in some kind of agreement, then it would be beneficial

708
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,420
to Moore to toe the party line. For example, MJ-12 would say,

709
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:08,620
Here are some more genuine documents, but remember, no talking about the mutilations or abductions.

710
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:13,100
This would be beneficial to Moore as it would supply the evidence to support his theory that

711
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:19,020
ETs exist, but deny the truths about ETs. However, if Moore was indeed working for MJ-12,

712
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:24,060
he would follow the party line anyway, admitting the ETs, but poo-pooing the mutilations and

713
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:29,420
abductions. If working alone, Moore might not even be aware of the grand deception.

714
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,980
That's something that I've pondered myself recently.

715
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:38,380
Looking into the abduction phenomenon, it is terrifying. It is scary. Some people

716
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:46,860
would say that it isn't even happening. To them, I would say the people who I've spoken to

717
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:55,100
seem to be legitimately, psychologically affected by whatever it is they believe

718
00:49:55,100 --> 00:50:01,660
had happened to them. There are thousands of people like this that have come forward over the years,

719
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:12,300
denying that what they said happened actually happened is, I think, just plain mean. I think

720
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,540
you have to look into it more than that. I don't want to be this type of person that says,

721
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:22,700
I believe that this person believes that they were abducted. Even though that is the case,

722
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:27,500
I do believe that they believe they were abducted. Looking at all the evidence and all the testimony

723
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:35,100
leads me to believe that they were, but that is, as mentioned here, I think,

724
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:40,940
not a conversation a lot of people are ready to have, especially in a time where we're still

725
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:46,700
debating whether or not UFOs are real. It's very hard to bring up the topic that, oh, they are real

726
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,540
and they have pilots and the pilots have a deal with the government and the government

727
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,940
knows about these abductions and the abductions are still taking place. That is a big pill to

728
00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:01,900
swallow. Although Lear here says that they don't want anybody knowing about the abductions,

729
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:09,660
which is true, I also think, what benefit does it provide anyone if you were to go public with

730
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:14,700
these abductions? It would just cause mass panic. I'm looking at this from a devil's advocate point

731
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,580
of view, by the way. If you were the US government, you would probably find a way to disseminate this

732
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:26,540
information in the most subtle manner in a way that doesn't completely upend the entire economy

733
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:32,780
and religious beliefs of its citizens. It's such a touchy subject that the last thing you want to

734
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:39,660
do is say, oh, and they also take you apart and study you and inject you. I understand their

735
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:46,460
reluctance to do that. I do understand that, but I also understand people's

736
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:51,820
willingness to come forward and say that these things are happening. Time will tell. It is

737
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,740
possible that Moore will go ahead and release the video interview with the military officer

738
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:00,860
around the first of the year, as he promised. People in the UFO community promising information

739
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:08,940
and not delivering? No. That can't be true. Who would do such a thing? Who would say that something's

740
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:17,100
going to happen and then it doesn't? No. I don't believe any prominent figure in the UFO community

741
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:23,980
would ever do or say such a thing and not deliver. From MJ-12's point of view, the public would be

742
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:28,460
exposed to the information without really having to believe it because Moore is essentially not as

743
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:33,180
credible as a source, say the president of the United States. After a few months of digestion

744
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:37,180
and discussion, a more credible source could emerge with a statement that yes, in fact,

745
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:43,020
the interview was essentially factual. The scenario would cushion somewhat the blow to the public.

746
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:48,700
If however, Moore does not release the tape by, say, February 1, 1988, but comes instead with a

747
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:55,180
story similar to the following. Okay. First of all, strategically speaking, that would make sense

748
00:52:55,180 --> 00:53:02,780
that if you put out something, let's say today, let's take this example and apply it to today's

749
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:09,260
landscape of social media. If you were to put out a video of a craft that is so freaking clear

750
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:16,300
or an alien talking or whatever it is, so clear, most of the internet would deny that it's true.

751
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:22,140
They would blame AI, CGI, actors, whatever, whatever, whatever. Maybe half, but probably

752
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:27,180
less than half of the people would believe that this is true in the UFO community, by the way.

753
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:32,860
In general, most people would just dismiss it. If the president came out later and said,

754
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:38,300
oh, that video is real, it would lessen the blow because everybody's seen it and digested it already

755
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,940
and toyed with the idea, oh, what if this was real, you know, and just like kind of sat with that,

756
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:49,020
it would lessen the effect that this would have, you know, in terms of an ontological shock. That's

757
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:55,260
a valid strat right there. Release the information by an uncredible source and then confirm it by a

758
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:03,100
credible source later. Wow. You know, if I look at what one of those things might be today, maybe

759
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:09,740
Bob, maybe what Bob Lazar is saying, maybe the Immaculate Constellation sort of documents that

760
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:13,500
came out recently, those photos that everybody says were fake, what if those, you know, oh no,

761
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:20,220
those were true. I don't know. That's a cool way to put out information and cushion the blow.

762
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,940
So now he's saying if he didn't do that, he would have a story similar to the following.

763
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:29,500
MJ12 has informed me that they are definitely planning a release of all information by October

764
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:35,340
of 88. I've seen the plan and have seen the guarantee that this will happen. So I've decided

765
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:41,260
to withhold the release of my videotape at this time, as it may cause some problems with MJ12's

766
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:47,260
plans. This would in effect buy more time for MJ12 and time is what they desperately need. Okay.

767
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:55,340
Now you ask, why haven't I heard of any of this? Well, who do you think you would hear it from?

768
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:02,700
Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, Sam Donaldson? Wrong. These people just read the news. They don't find it.

769
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:07,420
They have ladies who call and interview witnesses and verify statements on stories coming over the

770
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:13,340
wire. It's not like Dan Rather would go down to Wytheville, Virginia and dig into why there were

771
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:21,660
4,000 reported sightings in October and November of 1987. No one, but no one is going to risk their

772
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:27,980
neck on such outlandish ideas, regardless of how many people report sightings of 900-foot objects

773
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,460
running them off the road. They had a report the sheriff's department did of a car being run off

774
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:38,620
the road by a round circular aircraft just north of Wytheville in Graham's Forge. The sheriff himself

775
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:43,500
confirmed that it was credible people and they were unfamiliar with the previous sighting. So

776
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,740
therefore, there was no reason for a copycat sighting. Other sightings would follow, one by

777
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:53,980
a state police dispatcher. So two weeks after the first UFO report, a skeptical Gordon and his old

778
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:59,180
friend Roger Hall decided to check things out for themselves. It was about 600 to 900 feet long

779
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:04,060
beliefs. We're talking humongous crap. And we based that on, he and I watched it go over a couple

780
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:08,860
houses, rain-style houses, and if it had failed, it would have obliterated them as how big it was.

781
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:15,740
There was absolutely no sound to it. It was flying probably under a thousand feet and less than a

782
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:21,580
thousand feet away. The craft as it went away from us, we noticed the dome shape in the back had three

783
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:28,940
picture-winded lights in the back. In the case of the Wytheville sightings, dozens of vans with

784
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:34,460
NASA lettered on the side failed to interest newsmen. And those that asked questions were

785
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,620
informed that NASA was doing a weather survey. Well, I'll tell you one person who would do these

786
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:44,380
interviews and doesn't mind a potential blemish on his career. And that person is George Knapp,

787
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:50,460
because George Knapp is in fact the person who John Lear went to and broke the story of Bob Lazar.

788
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:58,300
And if it wasn't for that collaborative event that took place in 1989, I think the UFO landscape,

789
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:03,740
as we know it, wouldn't be as far along as we've come. Well then, you ask, what about our

790
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:09,020
scientists? What about Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke? Wouldn't they have known? If

791
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:13,660
Carl Sagan knows, then he's committing a great fraud through the solicitation of memberships

792
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:18,860
in the Planetary Society to search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Another charade

793
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:24,300
into which the U.S. government dumps millions of dollars every year is the radio telescope of

794
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:30,140
Arecibo, Puerto Rico, operated by Cornell University with, guess who, Carl Sagan.

795
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:35,420
Cornell is ostensibly searching for signals from outer space, a sign, maybe, that someone is out

796
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:39,980
there. It's hard to believe that relatively intelligent astronomers like Sagan could be

797
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:47,580
so ignorant. Okay. Shots fired. What about Isaac Asimov? Surely the most prolific science fiction

798
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:53,020
writer of all time would have guessed by now that there must be an enormous cover-up. Maybe. But if

799
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:58,620
he knows, he's not saying. Perhaps he's afraid that foundation and empire will turn out to be

800
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:03,580
inaccurate. What about Arthur C. Clarke? Surely the most technically accurate of science fiction

801
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:09,420
writers with very close ties to NASA would have at least a hint of what's really going on. Again,

802
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:16,140
if so, he's not talking. In a recent science fiction survey, Clarke estimates that contact

803
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:21,420
with extraterrestrial life will not occur before the 21st century. If the government won't tell us

804
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:26,540
the truth and the major networks won't even give us serious consideration, then what is the big

805
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:31,580
picture anyway? Are the EBEs, having done a hundred thousand or more abductions, possibly millions

806
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:37,100
worldwide, built an untold number of secret underground bases, Groom Lake, Nevada, Sunspot,

807
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:43,420
Datel, Roswell, and Pinetown, New Mexico, just to name a few, getting ready to return to wherever

808
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:48,780
they came from? Or, from the obvious preparations, are we to assume that they are getting ready

809
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:54,300
for a big move? Or is the more sinister and more probable solution that the invasion is

810
00:58:54,300 --> 00:59:01,020
essentially complete, and it's all over but the screaming? A well-planned invasion of Earth for

811
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:06,700
its resources and benefits would not begin with mass landings of ray gun-equipped aliens.

812
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,740
A properly planned and executed invasion by a civilization thousands and probably hundreds

813
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:17,900
of thousands of years in advance of us would most likely be complete before even a handful of people,

814
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:25,100
say 12, realized it was happening. No fuss, no muss. The best advice I can give you is this.

815
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:31,340
Next time you see a flying saucer and are awed by its obvious display of technology and gorgeous

816
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:42,060
lights and pure colors, run like hell. Wow, what a read-through, dude. For those of you interested in

817
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:50,460
the Majestic 12 documentations and the alleged proof thereof, by the way, which the FBI completely

818
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:56,780
said was bogus. Numerous times they doubled down, they're like, this is not real, this is not real,

819
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:04,140
but, you know, MJ-12 has come up quite a lot. Like, it was all the craze in the 80s and 90s.

820
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:11,580
I will probably eventually do a deep dive on Majestic 12, looking into its members, looking into

821
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:17,660
when it was formed, how it was denied, the FOIA requests, etc. If that's something you want to see,

822
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:22,380
just let me know in the comments. I might get started on that. I think the 4chan whistleblower

823
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:27,020
was asked about MJ-12 and he said, oh, that's old news, but he didn't deny its existence. He just

824
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:34,300
said that that was not something that they were currently, like that was old news. It was just

825
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,540
not something that they dealt with, which, you know, in this landscape could just be another

826
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:43,340
SIOP. Who knows? I think it takes, you know, in my closing statements here,

827
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,820
I'm going to digest a lot of this information. It's hard for me to

828
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:55,340
really comment on the exact thoughts that I formed, but I will say it takes a brave person to

829
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:03,500
publicly confront, you know, such an establishment. That bravery can be confused for insanity if this

830
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:09,660
establishment is non-existent, but it only takes a person with an open mind to listen.

831
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:15,180
And that's exactly what we've been doing here. You know, from the beginning I've stated this

832
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:20,140
channel isn't about doubling down on an opinion that I have.

833
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:31,420
And just received a text from Chris Bledsoe, by the way. Very fitting. Yeah, this channel isn't

834
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:37,020
about doubling down on an opinion that I might have formed or that I may be forming. This channel

835
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:45,500
is about telling story and letting those stories fill in some of these potential

836
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:49,420
gaps that we've inherited, you know, through listening to other stories.

837
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:55,020
And those connections will be made by you. They'll be made by me. And this discussion continues

838
01:01:55,020 --> 01:02:02,300
in the comments on Discord. And together, hopefully, we'll form a more clear picture.

839
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:11,420
But I will never assume that the picture will be complete. There are things that I'm just unaware of

840
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:17,980
that I will potentially never be aware of. But I am in favor of the sharing of information.

841
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:25,340
And that is why we read through documents like these. They are not to propagate some

842
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:33,100
fantasy propaganda. And they are certainly not to instill fear within my audience. I enjoy this

843
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:40,460
because this brings me some weird type of sustenance in creative thinking.

844
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:47,740
All right, I'll leave it at that. I've got nothing left to offer you today. 2024, especially the

845
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:54,140
last six months of 2024, is really where I applied myself to this channel. And in those six months,

846
01:02:54,140 --> 01:03:00,940
we've gained about half the subscribers that we have already. It has been an absolute honor

847
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:09,260
to be able to host these videos for you, for you to listen to them and comment on them and

848
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:14,140
for you to even join, you know, the communities that I've set up and to be a part of them

849
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:22,700
is such a great feeling. I will not express my gratitude enough. And so, pardon me for being

850
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:28,860
redundant, but thank you again for everything you do. And I wish you all the best in 2025.

851
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:34,780
Let's just keep this conversation going well and alive, regardless of what you believe, and

852
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:41,260
encourage that curiosity among one another as we move forward into the new year. Guys,

853
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:44,620
thank you so much. Peace and love. We'll see you on the next one.
