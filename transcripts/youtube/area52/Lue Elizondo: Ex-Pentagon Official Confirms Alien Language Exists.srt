1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
When you calculate the speed that this thing goes by, by the way, it was bigger than the offshore

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,280
oil derrick it was passing by. This has to be moving between 450 and 550 knots underwater.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,320
He reported that they have specific psionic teams taking these things, at least bringing

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,280
them into range to where they can take them down. Is that something that you've been read into in

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,880
the past? What would be another reason other than national security for it to be classified?

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,840
We were going to set a trap for these things. We knew that having a huge nuclear footprint

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,240
in the middle of the ocean would be irresistible. Have you seen, heard, or know of any other egg

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:49,520
type crafts at ATIP? Yes. More than one? Oh boy. Have you ever noticed, seen, heard of,

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,120
or heard whispers of any type of language or symbols apparent on these craft? Yes.

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,600
If I show you a picture, can you confirm or deny? This is an image, this is zoomed in.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,120
This is really interesting. When I was at the Pentagon, I spent considerable time

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,960
researching ancient script. You were aware of craft that had script on it at ATIP? Yeah,

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,520
it's pretty undeniable at this point. Was it written or engraved in these crafts?

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,040
No, it wasn't engraved, it wasn't written. If you're holding on to that type of clear imagery,

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,920
it really cements the idea that it's a planned dissemination to the public. You got to peek

16
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,360
behind the curtain, we did not. It involves our own potential religion, it involves life and death,

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,080
it involves why we're here, it involves the questions of the universe, it involves the most

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:48,080
important things that humanity has ever asked for, and you potentially had one of the closest

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,560
encounters with the answer. This is important. That's what I'm trying to tell people. Don't put

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,120
that responsibility on my shoulder. I'm just like you. I'm not a messiah, man. My job is simply as

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,400
a purveyor of the information. How you interpret that and what you think about that, brother,

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,920
that's on you, not me. Some people's frustration, my guess, is that you have that luxury of

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,560
formulating some type of answer that they would love to formulate themselves. Makes sense? Yeah,

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
good point. And there's also a lot of trust me, bro. You're going to get hate, by the way,

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,280
as I promise you, just for having me in your studio and having this conversation.

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,280
For me, this is not only a pursuit for them, this is a pursuit for myself as well. I want to know.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,720
There have been some people who have made suggestions to conduct illegal activities to

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,360
cover this topic up, and it's going to come out in a few months. I do a lot of work behind the

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,760
shadows, behind the scenes, whether it's a new whistleblower that maybe I've been aware of for

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,120
the last few years or a secret project that will hopefully blow the lid on a lot of this,

31
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,840
whether through a documentary, getting the right people to have the conversation.

32
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,800
Can you shed any light on what's to be expected in this documentary?

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,000
There's people that are being interviewed that have never come out publicly on this topic.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
That we've not seen on the trailer?

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,880
We've not seen on the trailer.

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,240
Jay Stratton does say.

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,080
I have seen with my own eyes, non-human craft and non-human beings.

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,960
Do you know what he's referring to? Have you yourself seen NHI? Why doesn't the government

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,240
talk about Balbazar? 2027 has been thrown around. Can you shed a little bit of light on this

40
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,240
just so we can stop being paranoid or we can start being paranoid?

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,920
Let me see if I can thread the needle on this.

42
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,520
Sure. How can I phrase this in a way that you can answer this?

43
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
Are you aware of more than one type of NHI?

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,600
Okay. Let me see how I can answer this.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,800
Wow. Accuracy is very important.

46
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,520
What I'm gathering from this is

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,600
there are potential that some of these NHI might look a lot like us.

48
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,920
What else you want to know?

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
You know what this reminds me of? Reminds me a bit of like an interrogation.

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,960
That's kind of what I wanted it to be. I call it the skiff.

51
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,480
I love it. Obviously, not a skiff.

52
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,240
Too many recording devices here for it to be a skiff. We know that.

53
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,800
But it wouldn't be the first time you, sir, have ventured a skiff, would it?

54
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,520
No, unfortunately. This is a lot nicer than a skiff.

55
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,080
Is it?

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,520
People are like, oh, you've been in skiffs and SAPF facilities. I'm like, look,

57
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,520
actually, they're really boring. Most of them don't have windows. They don't have any electronics.

58
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,240
You can't bring anything in there. So yeah, I mean, you can't even play like Solitaire on

59
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,760
your computer, right? Because all that stuff has been removed out of it. So I was like, oh, shit.

60
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,440
How's the coffee compared to the skiffs?

61
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,800
So I think you probably already know this. Being Latino, genetically, there's three things we do

62
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,880
very well coming out of the womb. One is drinking strong coffee. The other one is being able to dance

63
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,200
salsa and merengue. It's genetic for us.

64
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,200
You dance salsa and merengue?

65
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,560
Yeah. And then the third thing, I look more like a weevil wobble out there on the dance floor.

66
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,200
And then the third thing I probably can't talk about because it's not appropriate.

67
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,760
Those are the three things that Latinos can do very well usually.

68
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,320
I'll take your word for the last two.

69
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,280
Yeah. My days of dancing, unfortunately, once you get older and your knees start to fail,

70
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,680
you gain a little bit of weight in the places that really aren't very conducive for dancing.

71
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,920
I hear it. I hear it. I'm definitely also absent on the dance floor.

72
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,960
All right. Let's get this started. I'm here with Lou Elizondo. Is it Luis Elizondo?

73
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,640
You know, Chris, you can call me Bob, Bill, Joe. I don't care. My real name is Luis. I hear that

74
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,120
usually when I'm in trouble with my wife. Okay, gotcha.

75
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,240
Most people call me Lou because I look like I'm from Iowa. People realize my family's Cuban.

76
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,080
They're like, what? You don't look like a Luis. I know, I know.

77
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,920
Lou's got a nice ring to it. I'll call you Lou so that people who are listening know who I'm

78
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,760
talking to. Thank you so much for being here, first of all. For those of you who aren't aware

79
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,960
of Lou and what he's done, I highly recommend you check out his book, which we got here.

80
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,200
We'll be signing a few copies as well, and I'll let you know later in the episode how you guys can

81
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,840
grab them. But if you want to pick one up, there's a link below. Lou, bestselling author,

82
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,800
Eminent was amazing. I read through it, and I also listened to the audio version.

83
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,880
I'm sorry, you had to deal with that. I tell people I have the silky smooth voice of a

84
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,040
cement truck hurtling down a country road with no brakes.

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:16,640
I think you did a great job. I think it also helps sort of personify your story and humanize

86
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,440
it in a certain way that we get to hear it authentically. I always prefer that. I remember

87
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,880
listening to Communion by Whitley Strieber, and it was him reading his book too. It just conveys,

88
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,360
I think, a little bit more of the gravitas of the story when it's the person themselves narrating.

89
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,920
I appreciate that, but I also want to say thank you for taking the opportunity to speak with me,

90
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,360
and I also want to thank, even more importantly than you and me, is your audience.

91
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,600
You know, I think these types of interviews are very important because it allows all of

92
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,400
us to connect. I mean, obviously, not everybody listening is right here with us, but I hope they

93
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,120
get the sensation that they really are part of this conversation. We're only having this

94
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,840
conversation really because of them, and I think it's really important that we recognize

95
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,920
the value of, you know, we live in amazing times right now. You have the ability now,

96
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,200
whereas even just 10 years ago, mainstream media, right, major, major networks like where I live

97
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,400
down ABC and CBS and NBC, you have more people tuning into you than most of these mainstream

98
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,120
outlets. So you have a very important voice, and the audience is arguably the most important

99
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,800
aspect of this, right? These are people that want to hear what you have to say week after week and

100
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,240
whatnot. And really, that is why we are where we are today in the conversation, because this has

101
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,400
been a, whatever this conversation is, it's really been a, it's been a grassroots movement.

102
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,600
And ultimately, it is because of your audience and people like that, we are where we are today

103
00:08:51,600 --> 00:09:00,240
in the conversation about UAPs. Yeah, well said, and thank you. Thank you for saying that. And I

104
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,520
think, you know, part of the reason people are listening, you know, if not to tune into me, is

105
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,040
definitely to hear from you. And I think right now, especially, you know, we've been faced with

106
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:22,400
a lot of news recently in the UAP space specifically. And, you know, it's been,

107
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:28,880
it's been snowballing ever since the latest congressional hearing, which obviously you were

108
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,760
a big part of. And you attended, if I'm not mistaken. I did attend. Yeah, it was kind of

109
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,640
surreal for myself. I did have, you know, an immense amount of imposter syndrome, being

110
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,880
a Canadian magician, content creator, sitting in the front row, you know,

111
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,120
course side seats to something so monumental was, I mean, humbling. Of the 366 sightings

112
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,040
included in the report, 171 remain uncharacterized. And many high ranking individuals in the military

113
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,760
and intelligence communities believe UAPs demand greater attention.

114
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,520
Are contractors, are they pulling technology from this? Are they reverse engineering this?

115
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,520
But more importantly, after that, you know, it's these congressional hearings are very important,

116
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:21,360
but arguably what's more important, it's what they do with that information. And where that sort of,

117
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,840
you know, I'm sure you're sick of hearing this, but where that moves the needle.

118
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,880
And I think recently, you know, we've had a lot of people come forward, numerous people have come

119
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:39,920
forward to share their stories as well, in hopes to move the needle. And so today, I've got a lot

120
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,720
of questions that I'm hoping that we can get through. Sure. And you've been, and I got to say

121
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,760
for the audience listening, and by the way, if I'm ever looking over here, it's just to make sure

122
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,200
everything's recording because I'm a one man team here. So if ever, if you ever see me looking like

123
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,560
this is because I'm looking over my shoulder, I'm looking over my back, it's paranoia.

124
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:02,080
Yeah, sounds good. We're safe here. But one thing I did want to mention was that Lou, prior to the

125
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,200
interview, said something very important. I think a lot of people should know, and this is not

126
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,880
something that's usually recorded, but Lou said, I don't want to read your questions before.

127
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,320
You don't have to cut anything out. Ask me anything you want. And if I don't answer something,

128
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,880
I'll tell you why it is I can't answer it. And I think that's just so important that you respect

129
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,960
the journalistic integrity to that extent, especially after being put through ringer

130
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,240
after ringer podcast after podcast and being grilled on things that you legally can't talk

131
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,960
about. I think it just goes to show some level of character there. And I think a lot of people

132
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,000
would omit that in an interview, they wouldn't, they wouldn't allow that they would want to have

133
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,960
final say they would want, you know, certain boundaries to be put on, especially in the

134
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,600
position that you're in. Well, that's because they're trying to protect themselves. And in reality,

135
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
this conversation is much bigger than any one person. And this is what I've said over and

136
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,720
over again to people, I could get hit by a bus tomorrow. And disclosure, this transparency

137
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,680
effort that we're all a part of must go on the show must go on. And so my part of this

138
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,040
is very simple. Speak the truth, whatever that truth is, speak the truth, and let the

139
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,840
chips fall where they fall. And I think it's important from a journalistic integrity perspective,

140
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,240
that that be maintained and preserved at all costs. And this is why I've always made it a rule.

141
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,800
Say, look, you're not going to pay me to do anything like this. You know, great, if you

142
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,640
pay my hotel, that's great, you know, but other than that, I'm, I don't get payment for this.

143
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,520
People are like, Oh, you're making all these monies doing this. No, I'm not. I'm actually

144
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,520
doing it for free. I'm actually leaving work aside to come out and have these types of

145
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:53,600
conversations where I don't get paid. And then also having questions that are a lot of people

146
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,000
want to know ahead of him. What are you going to ask me? Are you going to ask me any trick questions?

147
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,040
You know what? To hell with that. I don't care. Ask me whatever you want. And if I don't know,

148
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,920
I don't know. And I'll tell you that honestly, or if I can't tell you, I'll tell you that too.

149
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:11,200
And I think that this topic demands that type of, I cannot in good faith demand transparency from

150
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,000
the United States government. If I myself am not willing to be transparent, right? It's hypocritical.

151
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,240
You can't, it doesn't work that way. So I appreciate that. And I'm sure my audience

152
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,960
is going to appreciate that as well. So for the next few hours, folks, strap yourselves in.

153
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,560
We're going to try to get through these questions and hopefully, you know, get some answers for

154
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,600
those of you, you know, seeking some answers. Let me start off. Let me just start off by asking a

155
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,640
question a little bit off target here, but are you familiar or have you been familiar in the past

156
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:53,040
with any 4chan or Reddit leaks, quote unquote? I am, I am familiar tangentially with the forms

157
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,040
of 4chan and also Reddit. I am not a subscriber and that's not a good or bad thing. I'm not

158
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,480
necessarily, you know, poo pooing it or promoting it. I just, I, my bandwidth is very limited. Also,

159
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm an older guy. This is gray, not blonde. So I'm a little dude. I'm not overly technically

160
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,360
proficient as most people will tell you, especially my wife. You know, when people are using

161
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,600
scientific calculators, I'm still using an abacus, right? I'm an older generation. So

162
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,920
more than the typical social media engagement now, if it involves Reddit or 4chan, it's beyond me,

163
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,560
but I am aware that sometimes information comes out that can be very interesting.

164
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,400
And you say that can be very interesting. Has there been a time where you're like, oh damn,

165
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,280
that guy slipped up. He shouldn't have said that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But you know what? At the end

166
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:52,000
of the day, look, I think, I think sunlight is, is the best antiseptic sometimes. I think it's

167
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,520
the best way to get rid of an infection. Sure. And so I've never proposed or never supported

168
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:06,160
the idea of leaking anything, anything classified. I am a patriot. I still have my security clearance

169
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,360
and I will never support the leaking of classified information, but there's a difference between

170
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,680
information that is classified for righteous and legal purposes, right? To protect sources

171
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,160
and methods and whatnot. And then there is the abuse of that system where people will classify

172
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,240
things simply because they're trying to hide or cover malfeasance or embarrassment, right?

173
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,160
And that's a problem because that, that information shouldn't be classified and it's

174
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,160
being classified in an illegal manner. There are very specific prohibitions because in the past,

175
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,920
my country has abused the classification system to hide the truth from the American people,

176
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,520
whether it's Iran Contra and Oliver North or even recently my, some of my work in Guantanamo Bay

177
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,880
and maybe some of the methods used to get information from, from individuals.

178
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,560
And there was no reason that should have been classified. The only reason why they classified

179
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,520
some of that was because we're embarrassed. We didn't, we didn't want to admit what we were doing

180
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,480
and how we were doing it. And so in those cases, when that information comes to the public's

181
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,760
attention, I'm okay with that provided they're not violating any laws of real classification,

182
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,000
right? If information is classified illegally, then that really isn't classified.

183
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,880
So when it comes to the UAP subject, what would be another reason other than national security for

184
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,200
it to be classified? Wow. So, okay. Great question. But it's not a simple question. It's not a simple

185
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,080
answer either. It's multifaceted, a bit like a diamond really. And so you have to, in order

186
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,120
to understand this topic, you need to understand a little bit about the history and where our

187
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,960
country was in the state of the world at the time, right? So really the UAP topic for the

188
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,440
United States government really started to kick into high gear right around the end of World War II

189
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,040
and the development of the atomic bomb for our country. That's when we really started noticing

190
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,520
an increased frequency of UAP interest in our capabilities. Now, where were we at the end of

191
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,680
World War II? Well, the U.S. had just become really a global superpower and had the opportunity to

192
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,040
dominate a lot of the world politics for about 10 years. That was until the Russians very quickly

193
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:13,360
afterwards developed the atomic bomb too, right? So now it's no longer U.S. preeminence. Now there's

194
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,240
this competition and what begins the Cold War, which by the way, most people don't realize,

195
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,680
wasn't really a Cold War at all. It's pretty hot. We had proxy wars going all over the place,

196
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,440
whether it's Korean War and Vietnam and things like that. And it was kind of this winner takes

197
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,840
all chess game. Now you have a beautiful chess set here. Your audience can't see it, but

198
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,400
you can imagine this Cold War as being an invisible chess match with the Russians. And you

199
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,680
had the United States on one side and NATO, and you had the Warsaw Pact and then Soviet Union on

200
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,560
the other side. And it was kind of this winner takes all mentality. And so what we didn't want

201
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,320
to do was broadcast to our enemies, our adversaries at the time, that we were dealing

202
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,120
with this UAP topic. We didn't want to let them know what we knew about it and more importantly,

203
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,880
what we didn't know, where those intelligence gaps lay. And furthermore, the Soviet Union felt the

204
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,400
same way, but we both understood each other enough to realize that in the 60s, when we started to

205
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,120
develop really the Northern tier radar systems, early warning systems for nuclear attack,

206
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,520
both the Soviet Union and the United States realized that, hey, we better come to the table

207
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,520
at least a little bit on this, because what we don't want to do is set up these radar systems,

208
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,160
very sophisticated radar systems. And then all of a sudden a UAP is picked up by one of these

209
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,040
radar systems, either ours or the Russians. And all of a sudden we could get confused for some

210
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,480
sort of nuclear strike or nuclear attack. So there was enough, I think, wisdom there where

211
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,240
the United States and Russia, in a secret memo, in one of the paragraphs, they actually say,

212
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,560
look, if you happen to see something before you press that nuke button, do us a favor,

213
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,520
give us a call, because it might be a UFO and we don't want to start World War III,

214
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,560
because either one of us confuses us some sort of provocation. And then you have the other issue

215
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,640
during the 50s and the 60s and the nuclear age, nuclear family in the United States.

216
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Our government was dealing with a lot of things. We were dealing with civil rights. We were dealing

217
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,480
with equity issues between genders. We were dealing with anti-war movements with Vietnam

218
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,640
and even before that. And you had also had the hippie movement, which was really kind of this

219
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,080
anti-establishment effort, just kind of, can't we all love each other, anti-war.

220
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,400
And so the government was dealing with a lot of stuff. And they were concerned that this topic,

221
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,800
the UAP topic, was a destabilizing conversation, meaning all it's going to do is add fuel to the

222
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,240
fire and add mistrust to the American public. Especially once you start lying for decades,

223
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,840
you have to double down on that. Because if you don't, what happens is you tell the American

224
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,200
people, we're just fooling you guys. Yeah, we've been actually monitoring these things. We just

225
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,760
didn't want to tell you. That doesn't hold very much water, especially if you're a government

226
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,840
bureaucrat or a leader. So what do you do? You say, well, shelve this. We'll have this conversation

227
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,520
later. Meanwhile, let's see if we can deal with this topic in a secret manner.

228
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:15,440
Okay. So sorry to interrupt. Are you saying that the subject is being classified under the disguise

229
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,520
of national security? Well, it was. That's part of the problem. And we had backed ourselves in a

230
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,400
corner for decades. Now came a point where, okay, these things, everybody's beginning to see them.

231
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,200
How do we deal with this? Do we come out and let the cat out of the bag or do we simply try to

232
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,200
suppress this information and maybe deal with it down the road? And so you had the US government

233
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,280
involved in the collection of UAP data, but lying to the American people. And look, there's maybe

234
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,120
some valid reasons there. I don't agree with them, but I can understand them. Some of them was like,

235
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,360
look, we need more time to understand and figure this out. Also, there were some studies done

236
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,840
commissioned by the US government that the results were very simple. Look, this is a

237
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,440
destabilizing conversation. If you tell the truth to the American people, you risk

238
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,560
literally potentially the collapse of civil society. People are going to do runs on banks,

239
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,040
they're going to panic, they're going to lose their faith in their religions. Why do the normal stuff

240
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,320
that they normally do and pay your mortgages and whatnot when there's this other topic out here that

241
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,920
is potentially existential? That's really the only word I know how to use really, because it's

242
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:27,920
something beyond. And when people put their faith and confidence in a government, the biggest

243
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,880
vulnerability to any government institution organization is when the people, the masses,

244
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,680
lose faith and confidence. So this is true with any government, not just the United States,

245
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,720
any government. This is how they survive and religions as well. So you can't afford to lose

246
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,000
that. If people turn around and they realize you've been lying to me for all these years,

247
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,480
you know, we already don't trust the government. Now, we're really not going to trust the

248
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
government. Oh, by the way, you want us to fight these wars, and you want us to do this and do

249
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,280
that and this and pay taxes and whatnot. So I think the mindset at the time was much different.

250
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,360
We had this Cold War with then Soviet Union, and we weren't prepared as a nation to have the

251
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,560
conversation at the time. Do you think that then that's part of the problem is them,

252
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,600
you know, admitting that this is real is also them admitting to the cover-up?

253
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,080
Yeah, well, you have to, right? You have to say, well, yeah, actually, we admit that this is real

254
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,840
and it's been going on for decades. And then what happens? People say, well, why did you lie about

255
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,840
it? What about those people who told the truth? And now all of a sudden they lost their jobs,

256
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,280
they lost their security clearances, maybe they got a divorce, maybe now they're homeless living

257
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,360
on the street because of all that. But isn't the worst outcome of the two that we discover it's

258
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,680
real and call them liars than to them fess up? I think the time has come. We have to have this

259
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,520
conversation. I've always said that that secrets, a lot of people think secrets are like fine wine

260
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,680
where the longer you keep a cork on it, the better it gets. I disagree with that. I've always said

261
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,600
that secrets are perishable. They have a shelf life. They're like vegetables in your refrigerator.

262
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,720
They'll stay good for a while, but if they stay, if they outlive their shelf life,

263
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,080
they begin to rot and they begin to stink. And now you've got a bigger problem on your hand

264
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,880
because now you got to clean up the mess. And so I think that therein lies part of the conundrum

265
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,160
that we've been keeping this information suppressed for way too long.

266
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,320
My government at least now realizes that it's probably time to have the conversation because

267
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,840
it's only going to get worse. The longer we can look at the JFK files, right? Right now in the

268
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,080
United States, the amount of faith and confidence we have in our government is at an all time low.

269
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,800
That's a fact. They don't trust their government and that's a problem. And the longer you hold

270
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,560
on to the ghost, the worse it's going to be. You're going to have to pay that piper,

271
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:44,640
that compounding interest will eventually be more than the loan itself. And so I think the time has

272
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,080
come and I think some people now, there's a critical mass within my government that recognizes that

273
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,000
we now really, really, really have to be open and honest with the American people.

274
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:04,560
We're at an apotheosis of the UAP subject. Very interesting. I'm going to jump all over the place

275
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,080
a little bit here with these questions, so be prepared from hitting different angles.

276
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Got it. Going back to the 4chan stuff, I myself had a deep dive into a lot of this stuff because

277
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,560
I thought it was really interesting and I read through a lot of those back and forth AMAs or

278
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:25,040
Q&As that they had on those different platforms with my audience. And there was one that stood

279
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,480
out to me in particular because it related to something that you had touched on previously

280
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:38,240
in a podcast in the past. And we're talking about a giant submerged UFO.

281
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:50,800
This particular 4chan leaker said that he worked on a team that was looking into what he called

282
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,800
an MCU, a mobile construction unit that was in the ocean, in the Atlantic Ocean,

283
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:03,840
that builds these UAPs and sends them out, and that they come in and out of this mobile construction

284
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:12,560
unit that's massive, that's in the ocean, and that moves very rapidly. He goes on to say the

285
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,480
downed crafts were recovered and that these crafts were built to spec, in his opinion,

286
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,280
they were built exactly for the things that they had to do, the jobs that they had to do,

287
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:30,800
and it would seem so did the beings inhabiting or maneuvering these crafts. My question is,

288
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,920
you've talked about this video that exists of this giant craft moving very rapidly underwater.

289
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,640
Is there a possible connection to this 4chan leak?

290
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,000
I mean, we can't say there's not. All I can tell you is what we know. I can't tell you what we

291
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,560
don't know. That old saying, we don't know what we don't know. What I can say is that without

292
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,240
getting in trouble myself, that it wasn't just me. There are a lot of people in the U.S. government

293
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:05,200
that have seen this video, so it is real. Let me set the stage for you if I can. In the late 1990s,

294
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,600
there was this effort by the U.S. government. We would test our cruise missiles technology,

295
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,240
and particularly in the Caribbean when I was there at Puerto Rico. Every so often,

296
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,720
we would launch these cruise missiles over the ocean in an area that was predetermined,

297
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,080
no boats or air traffic. Then when they would run out of fuel, they'd hit the water splash down,

298
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,760
and then they would sink. Then at a predetermined time, they would blow their ballast,

299
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,280
they would rise to the top of the surface, and then a helicopter crew would be dispatched to

300
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,520
go recover them, bring them back to the Navy base, and they would be cracked open and exploited,

301
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,000
meaning they would test for the telemetry and the fuel consumption and did the missile operate the

302
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,560
way it was supposed to operate. Now, most people know that Tomahawk cruise missiles,

303
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,720
some can be modified to carry a nuclear payload. That's one of the advantages of these cruise

304
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,560
missiles. There's a helicopter crew. I won't say the person's name because they haven't given me

305
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,720
permission to say their name, but they're legit. They're real helicopter pilot. Imagine a helicopter

306
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,200
crew. You've got the pilot, the co-pilot, the crew chief in the back, and you've got a Navy

307
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:19,920
frogman dangling from a line. As he's going down the line, he's going to put a hook on the missile

308
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,200
because it's blown its ballast and fly back. As this frogman is dangling down the line,

309
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,920
the helo crew notices, and the frogman, something black. The water begins to churn,

310
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,240
and something black and round, as described to me, something black as a devil and the size

311
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,240
of a small island. Submarines are linear. They look like your pen there. They're kind of long

312
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,080
and skinny and look like a tube, almost like a toilet paper tube. This was still in round

313
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,320
disc shape. Begins to come to the surface. Now, you understand that the trench of Puerto Rico

314
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,800
is the second deepest part of our ocean. It's only second to Challenger Deep,

315
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,840
which is part of the Marianas Trench. I think it's like 22,000 feet deep. The height that

316
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,360
some commercial aircraft fly, this is how deep that water is. There's nothing really out there.

317
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,720
This thing begins to rise to the surface of the water. The water's churning. The helo crew goes

318
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,080
into a panic. The frogman is literally trying to climb the line back up because he's scared like

319
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,040
hell, and I get it. Right as this thing is about to break the surface, the missile gets sucked

320
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,120
underwater and then the whole thing disappears. The helo crew goes back and that missile to this

321
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,880
day remains unaccounted for, this cruise missile. Very shocking to the air crew. Try explaining

322
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,600
that to your leadership of what happened. Is it some sort of Soviet technology? Is it something

323
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,200
else? Is it our technology? What the hell took our missile? Where did it go? How did it get there?

324
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,920
How did it is able to come up and steal our cruise missile? Several years ago,

325
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,560
I have to be careful of the capacity I say this in, but there was a very, very, very classified

326
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,920
video. Now, the fact that the video exists isn't classified. Where it was taken, how it was taken,

327
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,600
the methods, very sensitive, so I won't go into that. But it's very clear we had a capability

328
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:18,640
where we're looking down into the water and there were these offshore oil rigs. These are

329
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,440
huge platforms. Think of British Petroleum and some of these other folks had these huge massive

330
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,560
structures out in the middle of the water or the ocean. They're just like the size of a small city.

331
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,400
If you've ever seen one of these, they have helicopter pads and buildings and hospitals

332
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,720
and they're on the middle of the ocean. They're huge. In this video, very, very clear,

333
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:44,640
there's a still of the water churning and then there is the video of this perfectly round disc

334
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,880
shape object, black, whizzing past one of these things underwater. Now, there's no waves. There's

335
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,160
no disturbance on the top of the water other than the still of this water kind of looks kind of

336
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,880
roiling, if you will, in the very beginning. But when you calculate the speed that this thing

337
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,480
goes by, by the way, it was bigger than the offshore oil derrick. It was passing by.

338
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,240
It was bigger than that. Its diameter of the circle was bigger and it was assessed to be

339
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,680
moving between 450 and 550 knots underwater. Now, imagine that for a minute. Are there technologies

340
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,240
out there that move very fast? Yeah, we know the Russians have the super cavitational torpedo and

341
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,000
they have got capability, but to have an object that big, where you're talking tremendous forces.

342
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,440
No friction. Right. Huge, whizzing by one of these offshore oil derricks at phenomenal speed,

343
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,520
that's a technology that we don't have. And that is extremely, extremely compelling. When you see

344
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:53,200
it, you realize, whoa, what the heck is that? This first encounter I think was voiced by Graves in

345
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,800
the past. Was it Ryan Graves or Fravor? One of the two had talked about this encounter where they

346
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:05,200
went to go get Fravor. One of his buddies that we know. Is there footage of that encounter?

347
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,400
I haven't seen it. But there has to be, because if it's a helicopter, it probably has some type of

348
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,600
weapons radar footage. Back in the 90s, not necessarily. You would want to document your

349
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,200
recovery missions, but if it's something really routine, you're not always going to have a camera

350
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,760
on there simply because it's routine. You've done this a hundred times. It's just the hundred

351
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,280
and first time you're doing it. But it's possible. Oh, it's possible. Sure. Absolutely. But I can

352
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:34,560
certainly ask the pilot. I know the pilot. I can certainly ask him. Secondly, the other object,

353
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,520
have you seen this video? Which one? The one whizzing past. Yeah. I saw myself. By the way,

354
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,560
my colleagues did too. What was your reaction in the room? What was the reaction like watching that

355
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,800
video for the first time? Not what you might think, because we have seen so many videos of UAP that at

356
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,680
this point it was just added to- Yeah, but this one's in the water. That is what made it, for me,

357
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:00,960
that is what probably put this up a little bit in the, wow, what the heck is that? We had heard

358
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,160
about USOs before. We never really had any direct evidence other than sonar pings from submarines

359
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:11,120
and Navy captains and anecdotal information like that. This was the first time that we saw one on

360
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,760
camera. So it was kind of like, wow. But also keep in mind, we've been so saturated for so long on

361
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,360
this topic when I was working in the Pentagon and my colleagues, that you almost kind of become

362
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,120
desensitized. I know it sounds weird. No, I understand that. As someone who knows how magic

363
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,120
tricks work, I get to see methods all the time. I've seen things that other- Which by the way,

364
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,400
you are one hell of a magician. I never really appreciated the trade until I saw you do some

365
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,560
of the stuff you do. That's pretty incredible. Thank you. I appreciate that. I'll show you some

366
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:50,960
more stuff a little later. Secondly, you said this object was round. How did you have that

367
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,200
perspective? Was this a satellite footage? I can't say the source. Remember, sources and

368
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,960
methods are very sensitive, but let's just say we had the fidelity enough where it was very,

369
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,840
very clear what was going on. But I mean, if it's round-

370
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,320
Yeah, it's round. Okay. So you had a top-down view of it?

371
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,720
It was a top-down view. Anything more than that, I probably can't talk about. Now, my hope is at

372
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,880
some point it might become public. They'll have to strip out metadata and maybe some other things

373
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,880
there because people on the internet get very clever and they can figure things out.

374
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,920
Absolutely. Leave it to them to figure out the puzzle. It's crazy.

375
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,680
And you know what? I think that's great. There's several times that have actually been corrected

376
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,400
for the record by a bunch of internet sleuths. So I think it's fantastic. I actually welcome that.

377
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,120
We need more of that if you ask me. Oh, that's the whole point of the internet.

378
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:41,760
Last thing I want to touch on on this particular thing is, is footage the only intel you have here

379
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,120
or do you have corroborating data with this specific siting? You have sonar, you have radar,

380
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,200
you have ... Do you have other corroborating intel or is it simply just this footage?

381
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Unfortunately, I can't go into detail because that shows the type of capability we have

382
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,680
in certain areas. Can you say, yes, we have other intel?

383
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,680
We have other intel. I can't say the type of intel.

384
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,400
Sure. But you could say there is other corroborating information.

385
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,760
Yeah. No, we had teams of very, very specialized analysts with TS Clearance. This is not private.

386
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,560
This is by the way government. This is still in the possession of the government with government

387
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,160
people analyzing this. More than two points of data?

388
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,680
I probably can't talk about that right now. Okay.

389
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,560
I know it's frustrating, believe me. I know your audience is like, what the hell? Why can't you

390
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,000
just say that? No, but I mean, just saying that gives us some type of idea.

391
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,120
Because people can extrapolate. The more sensor data you have in a place, the more of an interest

392
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,040
it is for us, chances are it's more of a hostile environment. Human intel?

393
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,440
Again, I really can't go down that path. I had to ask.

394
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:49,760
Okay. So we're talking about this underwater stuff. First of all, to me, this is really

395
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,760
interesting because if we're talking about the type of propulsion or the type of capability

396
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,520
that these crafts are using, technically from what we're seeing in the skies, it wouldn't

397
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,040
matter whether they're in the water or not. Right. That's what some of the scientists

398
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,440
have speculated. Look, the medium in which it's traveling is irrelevant. If you understand

399
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,920
physics, you understand technology, then you understand that sometimes the medium you're

400
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,640
maneuvering in is rather irrelevant. Including physical?

401
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,080
Potentially. Potentially. So potentially these crafts can go through

402
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,000
mountains? Potentially. Again, I'm not a trained physicist.

403
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,160
I took physics in college. You'd have to ask some of the smart folks in the intelligence community

404
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,160
who've kind of come up with some of these scientific models. What I will say though,

405
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,000
is that for the purposes of this discussion, we can't forget the simple fact that something

406
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,560
less than 15% of the ocean floor has been mapped. Meaning we know more about the surface of the moon

407
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,760
than we do what's in our own oceans. And let's not forget, look, my generation, I remember this. I

408
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,840
remember the notion of a giant kraken in the ocean and sea monsters as being silly and oh,

409
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,640
this is all just wives' tales. And it wasn't until we actually had proof positive of the

410
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,920
giant squid of the Pacific that there are giant kraken, right? It just turns out that

411
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,400
these aren't sea monsters. They're part of nature and our normal paradigm, our normal reality in

412
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,320
which we live in. So we're always learning something new about what could be and what

413
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,640
is in our natural environment. And the ocean is certainly no exception. Is it possible that

414
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,560
there's something down there that's been speculated? Sure. And is it possible? Yeah,

415
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,200
sure. And you've seen it. Yeah. I mean, we've seen things in the water and we know that we're...

416
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,120
So the Navy had a program for a long time. So the Air Force had something called the Fast Walker

417
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,960
program. I can talk about that. It's been declassified. The DSO office had this effort

418
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,960
to try to track things from space. And one of the things was UFOs, believe it or not.

419
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,600
The Navy had something similar and they call it the Fast Mover program. And they would pick up

420
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,400
information. They would pick up data, in some cases sonar returns of things that are moving

421
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:03,760
at a very, very high velocity, almost seems to be stalking or trailing the submarine only to

422
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,760
pass by the submarine very, very fast and then disappear. Tim Gallaudet mentions this. Tim does

423
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,880
and not only Tim, a lot of folks do. In Naval Intelligence. Absolutely. Yes, sir. Do you think

424
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,240
Naval Intelligence has more intel on the UAP subject than a lot of these other intelligence groups?

425
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,400
I think they've been more forthcoming. I'm not sure they're being... I think they've been more

426
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,320
forthcoming. I'll tell you, I talked to a Navy captain of a boomer sub and he was telling me

427
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:38,560
the story how they were picking up on a sonar, an object moving 450 knots underwater, which is really

428
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,600
fast, faster than most. It's insanely fast. And he said it was bigger than us. It was bigger than

429
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,640
a boomer class submarine that they're on, right? And so I asked him and I feel kind of silly,

430
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,920
but I'll share this with you because it's true. I said, it's kind of an amazement. What'd you do?

431
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,120
And he looked at me with a straight face. He said, Lou, we went around it.

432
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,680
Okay. I can see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Makes sense. Dumb question, I guess.

433
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:14,000
Yeah. You avoid it. Are there current discussions about the possibility of at least some of the NHI

434
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,200
slash UAP phenomenon being artificial intelligence? Well, I don't think we can rule it out.

435
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,560
Have you seen any evidence that might suspect that that is the case? Like there is some type

436
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,640
of AI controlling these things. No, my background, but let me caveat here. My focus was more on nuts

437
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,360
and bolts of craft. It wasn't really with the occupants or other folks that were looking at that.

438
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:45,600
But let me also give you a very real example of why it's not far-fetched. Right now we have the

439
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,200
capability, you can put a helmet on and we can fly drones remotely using a helmet, using our

440
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,680
thought patterns. There was a gentleman probably earlier this year who gained some significant

441
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:05,120
notoriety. He was a quadriplegic and they decided to give him an implant that allows him to play a

442
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,000
video game. In this particular case, I think it was Call of Duty. And just using his brain

443
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,200
and his thought patterns, and it turned out that he wanted it being almost better than just about

444
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,080
any gamer out there because that interface was instant between his brain. No bandwidth.

445
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:26,080
Right. So we are already using technical means to manipulate matter. Now, taking away the

446
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,160
spookiness of it and telekinesis, no, it's technology. Not telekinesis, it's technology.

447
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,800
It's simply the ability to interpret brain waves in a certain way and electrical signals,

448
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,680
neuroelectrical signals and bioelectric signals and translate that into an action using technology.

449
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,840
So we as a simple species are already doing that. So does it make sense that in the future,

450
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,440
not only our own species, but anybody else who's technologically proficient would do the same?

451
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,360
I mean, it's clearly a more efficient way of doing things. By the time the signal goes from the brain

452
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,760
down through the muscles and then it causes a response and a reaction, there's a delay there.

453
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,480
That's not really efficient, is it? And also the signals can be misinterpreted, right? So it makes

454
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,640
sense to have that type of technical interface. And we are already doing it as a species. Now,

455
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,200
you get into the artificial intelligence aspect of it. Can NHI somehow, could it be some sort of

456
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,160
form of artificial intelligence? Because it could potentially predict what you're doing

457
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,280
if it already has information on what you've done. Right. Absolutely. And so,

458
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,000
if you look in Commander Fravor's case where this Tic-Tac object sort of got anticipated almost

459
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
to his waypoint, part of that could be, oh, it can read the future. But part of that is

460
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,920
it's just really good at mapping out the past. Right. Or exploiting the data systems on board

461
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,480
the aircraft as well, right? So there's options. I think artificial intelligence is a brave new

462
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,000
world for us because for the first time, we may be on the verge of creating true sentience,

463
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,400
but not biological, based upon silicon and not carbon, right? Based upon electricity and not the

464
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:08,000
bioelectric processes in the human brain. So artificial intelligence is, anything's almost

465
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,160
possible because we're just now beginning to scratch the surface on what it can do.

466
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,520
And we've already seen some of its capabilities, which are very compelling, which could be

467
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,320
disturbing for some people because then that brings in other questions of like really free will

468
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:27,520
and fate, right? Which is really uncomfortable as a species for us to consider because most of us

469
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,440
look at life and say, well, I've got a series of choices. You don't know what choice I'm going to

470
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,680
make ahead of time, unless you're like you, who's a magician, right? You kind of already know that

471
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,240
to some degree because you set the stage, you set the environment where only one choice is possible,

472
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,920
right? But they think it's free will. That's very concerning for a lot of people because we

473
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,800
don't like that idea that we're not in control of ourselves and our environment. And so when you

474
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,320
talk about artificial intelligence and the capabilities of it, that's something we're going

475
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,560
to have to deal with in the very near future because maybe we're not as free will as we are.

476
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:07,200
It's also something as an intelligence you'll have to exploit, right? Because you have to,

477
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,480
because the enemy is doing it. So we have to, the adversary is doing it and they're doing it quite

478
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,280
well. So we need to do that. We also need to figure out a way to defend ourselves

479
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,320
also from artificial intelligence and how to, which is very fascinating to me.

480
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,240
If artificial intelligence has a 99% certainty of something happening because it's done all the

481
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,920
calculations and algorithms and looking at our previous behavior patterns and whatnot,

482
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,720
then is there a way to spoof? Is there a way to circumvent that? Is there a way to

483
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,800
do something that artificial intelligence hasn't predicted yet? That's how you're going to survive

484
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,240
because if an adversary knows your next move on the chessboard and knows how to win the game and

485
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,160
put you in checkmate, then you've got to figure out a way where they don't know what your next

486
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,600
move is, right? And so that's kind of the situation we're in now. Yeah. I think the best way would be

487
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:03,040
to make them think you're playing chess. That's right. So, well, this is really interesting and

488
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:09,760
it leads me to also understand because you said you're tracking nuts and bolts. This is part of

489
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,880
what you were doing. Before I ask this next question, I also just want to ask, are there

490
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,240
more videos of submerged vehicles out there that you guys have access to?

491
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:29,760
Well, is there more evidence information? Yes. So video is something very difficult when you

492
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,720
talk about underwater. Sure. But you have more data. A lot more data. A lot more. Yes,

493
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,560
there's some video evidence. But underwater is much more difficult than in the atmosphere

494
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:47,760
because water will affect the electromagnetic spectrum a little bit differently and especially

495
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,720
with electro-opticals. So that's why we use sonar. We use sound waves instead of radar

496
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,760
under the ocean because sound waves travel very well, whereas electromagnetic signals

497
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,040
are much, much more difficult. So you're not using the same tools to quote unquote

498
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,440
see something underwater. You're using technical equipment to give you a sight picture of what's

499
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,840
there, but you're not actually physically seeing it. You don't have a photon of light bouncing off

500
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,960
something coming back into your eye or a camera lens and interpreting that data because light

501
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,560
doesn't travel. Look, if you've ever been to any of your folks out there, your audience or scuba

502
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,120
divers know this. Once you get past 300 feet underwater, it's virtually dark. You can't see

503
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,680
anything. Light stops. Now there's some animals and fish that have very sensitive eyes and

504
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,160
they can see much, much deeper, but for the most part, the human eye is restricted because

505
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:43,040
light waves and photons of light eventually get absorbed by the water. So it doesn't travel as far

506
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,600
as it would like when you look at the horizon. It's maybe 11 miles away. Underwater, your horizon

507
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,360
is maybe a couple hundred feet. But that sonar information can be just as valuable. Oh, yes.

508
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,920
Sonar data can be high fidelity, like incredible fidelity.

509
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:07,680
Are there reports of these giant craft down there that you've speculated that the information is

510
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,240
pointed to that these things might be massive down there?

511
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,200
Well, we've heard already from Tim Gallaudet, Admiral Gallaudet, that these things have been

512
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:23,040
a mystery for the Navy for some time. You don't have to even look at the United States Navy. You

513
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:29,280
can go back. There's anecdotal information even by some of the great explorers hundreds of years

514
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,720
ago. Sure, Nick Columbus. That's right. That's right. That experienced strange things under

515
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:42,080
the water. I spoke to some civilian fishermen in Mexico when I was down there off the coast of

516
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:48,560
Ensenada, kind of between the little island there called Guadalupe Island, the island of Guadalupe

517
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,240
and Ensenada. They report these luminous objects, these balls of light all the time under the water

518
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:00,160
and sometimes even pop out of the water and then fly away. These are people who have no interest

519
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,400
in being sensational. In fact, they love their privacy. They don't even want to be associated

520
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:11,360
publicly with this, but they've experienced this. There's log books of other seafaring captains and

521
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,760
people who've reported very similar experiences going back centuries.

522
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,800
Does that make it a place of interest for the government?

523
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,760
Well, it should, but no. Government's interest typically is from a national security perspective,

524
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,720
meaning how do we protect our people and how do we maintain a strategic advantage over our

525
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,560
adversaries? This is one of the ... People have always asked me, well, Lou, how much research

526
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,080
did you do into UFOs when you were at ATIP and historical stuff? Did you talk to this ufologist?

527
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,840
No, I didn't, because really when you're talking to a three or four star general,

528
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,760
they don't care what happened in the 1950s or 1960s. They want to know what happened yesterday.

529
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,520
You're really narrowly focusing on the incidents that involve military equities and as they're

530
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,720
happening now. If you go to a general and say, well, here's a report from 1966, they're going to

531
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,240
say, what the hell are you throwing me that for? I don't care. I want to know what happened yesterday.

532
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,720
Their focus is on the here and now, but I think that's part of a mistake because I don't think

533
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,240
you can get an accurate understanding of the here and now unless you understand a little bit

534
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,320
about the past and realize that there's pattern. As an intelligence officer, we're all about

535
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,280
patterns. Kind of like magicians, right? There's certain predicted patterns and if you understand

536
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,520
those patterns like putting together a puzzle, you can figure the puzzle out. That's why it's

537
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,720
so important that we do take a historic look at this. Now, some of the information is going to

538
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,320
be bunk or junk, but some of it may be very, very telling. Most of it happens over water, it seems.

539
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:48,240
Yes, water. There's two really interesting patterns that we've seen over time. One is,

540
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,920
there's an interest in our military capabilities and our nuclear capabilities and technology,

541
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,160
and also large bodies of water. There seems to be an overwhelming number of UAP sightings in and

542
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,280
around bodies of water, which kind of answered the question you asked me about the Navy. Are

543
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,120
they most proactive? Are they seeing the most? No, but they're all in the water the most, aren't

544
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:13,040
they? What else do you have? Well, you've got, let's say, the USS Nimitz or USS Roosevelt.

545
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:18,960
That is a huge nuclear footprint. In fact, in some cases, when that fleet goes out with the

546
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,120
nuclear carrier and nuclear submarines and other nuclear powered boats with potential nuclear

547
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,520
weapons and other technology, that's a bigger footprint than the entire state of New York

548
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,360
from a nuclear perspective. You're on the water, which is why we early on in the Pentagon set up

549
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,440
this Operation Interloper, which I can now talk about. Pentagon's given me permission to do it,

550
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,680
where we were going to set a trap for these things. We knew that having a huge nuclear

551
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,240
footprint in the middle of the ocean would be irresistible to these UAP because we had

552
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,720
experienced it so much. The idea was to set a trap, set up a ... Now, when I say trap,

553
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,720
you're going to say, allure, right? We had the intelligence community approval and the joint

554
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,600
staff to do this, the approval from the joint staff. This was a very, very comprehensive

555
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,800
effort that we were proposing and was almost unanimously accepted because they were seeing

556
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,480
the same issues we were seeing at ATIP. We were going to create this lure, and unfortunately,

557
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,920
at the last minute, they pulled the plug. They pulled the plug on the project?

558
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,960
On the project, yeah. It was called Oplane Interloper.

559
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:29,840
There has been rumors that the government hasn't been too shy about creating these type of lures

560
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:39,200
in the past to attract NHI activity, to attract UAP activity. Namely, now, this goes into a lot

561
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:47,440
of what Jake Barber talked about. Now, before we had psychics, now it's psionics, before it was

562
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:54,000
UFOs, now it's UAP, before it was extraterrestrial, now it's NHI. It's all these other terms,

563
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,440
but all three of these terms were used by Mr. Barber in his recent three-hour podcast with

564
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,520
Ross Coulthard. I wanted to get into that a little bit because I think you've already touched on it

565
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:15,040
and had said that these objects that he's describing, these egg-like objects, they're

566
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,320
not these weather balloons. They're not ours either.

567
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:29,120
They're not ours. He reported that they have specific psionic teams taking these things,

568
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,560
or at least bringing them into range to where they can take them down.

569
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,800
Is that something that you've been read into in the past? Have you been read into any of these

570
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,440
programs regarding psionics? Let's break it down, I think, for the purposes of your listener,

571
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,440
what psionics means, because you obviously know what it means, but the word psionics is something

572
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,200
that is not a general term. It's a sci-fi term.

573
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,000
Right, it's a sci-fi term. Psionics comes from the base word of psychic,

574
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,760
psychology, psychic, whatever, and dealing with the brain and potentially

575
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,520
human cognition and things like that. There is some speculation. Remember, we talked about

576
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,640
technical interfaces with brainwaves, so that technology already exists.

577
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:24,880
If you were a super-sophisticated society, would it make sense to create technology that you could

578
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,480
potentially interface with, manipulate, work with using brainwave functions instead of necessarily

579
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,920
wasting the time for the signal to go down to the hand and make a movement?

580
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,920
Which, by the way, is not very precise. I think there's an argument to save for that.

581
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,600
Then you have to ask the question, has the US government in the past been involved with

582
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,600
psionic-type research or psychic research? The answer is, again, a definitive yes.

583
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:47,840
Of course.

584
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,880
We now know through programs like Stargate and Grill Flame before that.

585
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,600
The Center Lane.

586
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,480
The Center Lane, that's right, that the US government and her adversaries have had a long

587
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:05,040
and deep rich history in using psychic research and using it for the purposes of espionage and

588
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,640
the collection of data. That's a fact. Anybody can look that up. It was actually very, very

589
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:15,520
successful. Then you have to ask the question, well, fine, but do we really accept that now

590
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,000
in society? The answer, again, is a definitive yes. Look at a lot of local police force

591
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,520
will employ psychics. By the way, to a great deal of effect, they've actually solved murderers and

592
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,640
found bodies using psychics. Now, people can poo poo it all day long. The bottom line is it works.

593
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,640
Now, how it works may be a different story. We can debate that all day long, but

594
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,400
the bottom line is proof is in the pudding. Statistically, there is something there,

595
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,640
whatever that means and however it works. We've already crossed that bridge. We don't have to

596
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:52,480
argue that. It is what it is. To your question, specific question, is it possible that the US

597
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:59,680
government employed certain individuals who had a predisposition to some of this psychic phenomena,

598
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,000
whether you call it remote viewing or channeling or psychic or what, a username du jour,

599
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:12,400
to try to interface with or communicate with a non-human intelligence? Well, I think it'd be

600
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:20,880
foolish to assume that we didn't or we wouldn't, given our previous history in human cognition.

601
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,440
The question is, has the government found success in there?

602
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,680
I can't answer that. I don't know. I'm not surprised that the allegations are there,

603
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,280
because certainly if I had unlimited budget and I was in charge, I would try throwing everything

604
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,600
at it, trying to figure it out how it works. People will say, well, that's a bunch of hooey.

605
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,760
The bottom line is, you know how we tell if people are dead or not in hospital?

606
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,120
Brainwave function. When there's no brainwave function,

607
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,360
people are presumed to be dead. Now, what is brainwave function? Now, some can argue, say,

608
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,080
well, they're actually still alive. Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe. But for argument's sake,

609
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,640
we use brainwave function to determine if a human being is still alive or not.

610
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,920
And to detect brainwave function, it's nothing more than electrical process going on in the brain.

611
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,320
And we have technology that can detect it and actually say, yes, there's higher functioning

612
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,080
of the brain or no, this person's in a vegetative state, very little chance they're going to come

613
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,760
back. That part of the brain is shut down. And how do we know that? Because we have technical

614
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,480
equipment that can detect it. We know that. That's a fact. And that's technology we accept

615
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:32,400
all the time every day. So does it make sense that if that is real, that there is an actual

616
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,760
physics behind brainwave function and we can detect it, which we do, does that also apply

617
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,200
to something else that may have some sort of brain or higher brain function? And is there a

618
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:49,120
way to interface with their form of brainwave function and therefore setting up tests where

619
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:55,120
you could have people try to, if you will, interface or some have even alleged that there's

620
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,960
some sort of conjuring capability there. I don't know that to be fact. I know there's a lot of

621
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,520
people out in- Yeah, or hijacking.

622
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,120
Hijacking, right. It's certainly very interesting. And there was even in the Russian something

623
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,520
called psychotronics. I'm not sure if you're familiar with that, but the psychotronic weapon

624
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,840
development system. And by the way, the CIA also invested in that, might know that to be fact.

625
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:21,600
And that is the ability to use human brainwave functions with a piece of technology to affect

626
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,920
matter. Now think about that for a minute. People talk about telekinesis. The bottom line is that

627
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,440
there are ways to interpret brainwave functions using technology, a technological interface,

628
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,240
and then affecting change. And we talked about that with even the God helmet and

629
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,880
other experiments we're working on where we can use-

630
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,520
The cause of the revimir and- That's right.

631
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:47,600
All these other experiments. But back to Mr. Barber, because what he's coming out with

632
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,240
recently seems to be, I mean, it seems to be obviously a lot for a lot of people

633
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:03,680
because not only did we go into, he was part of a team that recovered a craft that was of

634
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:12,400
exotic origin, but also talked about being recruited as someone with psionic ability,

635
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:19,920
also talked about using other factions that are non-governmental contractors

636
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,680
and using their technology to help down some of these things when they're in close proximity.

637
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:33,120
And then also about other crafts that were recovered that somehow had some emotional

638
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:41,680
effect on him. And it gets wooed really fast when listening to a lot of this stuff. And I know there

639
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,680
are a lot of listeners out there that when they hear of anything other than UAP, they're out

640
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:53,520
because it took them so long to even get to UAP. But we do have to understand that something's

641
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:00,000
piloting these things. These UAP, maybe they're flying themselves, but at some level, something

642
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,560
is piloting these things. You can't have a conversation about

643
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,560
extreme advanced technology without then having the conversation of who built it,

644
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,000
how does it work, why are they doing right? And these are the follow-on questions. Yes,

645
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,800
I understand it can be disturbing for a lot of people. And people say, well, our government

646
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,520
never would be involved in anything like that, using individual to do certain things. And well,

647
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,840
if that's what you think, I don't know what to tell you, but there's lots of examples where we

648
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,720
have. I mean, we've done some pretty heinous stuff and experiments on human beings without

649
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,680
their permission. Look at the CIA's use of LSD when we first did that. Canada had a hand in that

650
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,880
too, by the way. Look at the syphilis experiments, where we allowed human beings to die when we had

651
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:47,760
the cure simply because we wanted to see what happened. So there's a long laundry list of

652
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,960
malfeasance and things that people have done in the name of national security that wound up being

653
00:57:52,960 --> 00:58:00,080
absolutely atrocious and heinous. And yeah, if there are children who are predisposed to having

654
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:06,000
some sort of psychic capability, as stated by some individuals, are there individuals in our

655
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,480
government that would try to exploit that? I think in the past, probably, sure. And I've got

656
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,480
my personal reasons for saying that. But I also want to be very careful not to be conspiratorial

657
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,720
because I don't have firsthand knowledge. I've heard the rumors, and I was an atip of this going

658
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:29,200
on, but I was never part of that effort. To be clear, you heard of the rumors of the

659
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,440
psionics teams? I heard rumors of psionics teams. Or you heard rumors of the psionics

660
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:39,760
team bringing down craft? Not bringing down craft, of trying to use human brains-

661
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,160
To try to interface with some of these things. Interface with whatever that is, correct. But again,

662
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,560
I wasn't there for those experiments, I don't know. This is just kind of the hearsay that I

663
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,440
heard when I was an atip and then afterwards. It makes sense when you look at the government's

664
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,640
interest into people like Chris Bledsoe and why that would be so valuable if he could just summon

665
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:04,800
them at will. If that was the case, then that would be absolutely a leg up on the competition.

666
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:11,680
Sure, sure. There's a lot of weird stuff as a kid I experienced. I don't never talk about it

667
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:17,520
publicly, but there's been times I kind of scratched my head and said, was that coincidence?

668
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:27,600
Was that something else? Did someone plan this? It's certainly not outside the realm of possibility.

669
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,600
By the way, for the record, the whistleblower that you're referring to that came forward,

670
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:36,160
he is who he is. He was a special operator. He is an American hero. He's done a lot for his country.

671
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:43,520
Now, whether his observation and his perspective is accurate, I think he's telling his truth and

672
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,720
I think people need to understand it. He put himself to a lot of risk,

673
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,400
Jake did, for having this conversation with America. Now, for the record, I've never met

674
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,160
the guy, but I have special operator friends of mine who I've worked with that were actually

675
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,280
there with him in providing some security support and have said, hey, this guy is legit

676
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,000
and here's his background and these are the missions he's been on. He is part of that elite

677
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,320
group of the best of the best of our country. I know it's kind of difficult for a lot of people

678
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:15,680
to absorb that you have this guy that's coming out kind of out of the blue and making these claims,

679
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:25,200
but I think everybody deserves to be heard. Have you seen, heard or know of any other egg type

680
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:36,880
crafts at ATIP? Yes. You have more than one? Boy, yes. There's a story I'm dying to tell you.

681
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,040
Hopefully, I can get clear at some point to say it. That has to do with this?

682
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,560
It has to do with egg-shaped vehicles, yeah. Have you ever noticed, seen, heard of or heard

683
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:54,080
whispers of any type of language or symbols apparent on these craft? Yes. If I show you

684
01:00:54,080 --> 01:01:02,080
a picture, can you confirm or deny? It depends. Can I try? Sure. I'm going to put my old main

685
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:06,160
glasses on. For the record, this is gray and not blonde, so I'm an old dude. I need

686
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,120
as much help as I can get. This is an image. This is zoomed in.

687
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,760
Someone has taken the liberty of pointing some of these symbols out and saying that

688
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,000
there is some type of resemblance to this language.

689
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:40,000
This is really interesting. When I was at the Pentagon, I spent considerable time

690
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:47,200
researching ancient script and hieroglyphics and symbology and

691
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:56,400
even cuneiform to see if there was any similarity on what was

692
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:03,200
seen on the outside of these vehicles, which appear to be some sort of glyph or rune, if you will.

693
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:13,360
I am not familiar with this actual one. But you are familiar with there being symbols on

694
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,080
the outside of the craft. Yeah, which by the way is significant. That means something.

695
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,560
Let's break this down from a human and a scientific perspective. What is the pearl?

696
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,800
I see your notes there. What is the purpose of written script? What is it?

697
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,680
To communicate. That's right. To communicate. More importantly,

698
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:37,760
there's a way to communicate. When you are reading notes or you see a word,

699
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:47,920
I'll just kind of give it away. How do you detect it? How can you read written script?

700
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,600
Because you have eyes. It's a visual thing. People who are blind can't read.

701
01:02:52,160 --> 01:03:01,840
They use Braille. Whenever you have reports that a UAP or UFO has something written on it,

702
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,040
there's a few things that you can surmise immediately. First and foremost, that they're

703
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,880
communicating something. You don't write something unless there's a meaning behind it, whether it's

704
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:20,400
Chinese character or ancient Elizabethan English or even going back to some of the older forms of

705
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,040
written communication. You're conveying an idea, a thought, or a directive, and you're doing it

706
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:30,560
through visual sight. That means whoever that is intended to see and whoever wrote it, chances are

707
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:37,280
they have eyes or they use the electro-optical spectrum to discern their environment so that's

708
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,840
not too dissimilar from humans and other animals on this planet and that there's a higher brain

709
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:49,200
function. Dogs don't use writing. They don't read dictionaries. It's only a human thing. In fact,

710
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,880
of all the animals on our planet and all the primates, the only animal that actually use

711
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,480
written communication are human beings. Ever since we were living in caves and we were painting

712
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,080
animals that we hunted and painting our palm print, the human print on that side of that cave,

713
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:14,000
we're the only ones that do that. So when you come across in this particular case a UAP that

714
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,240
has some sort of writing on it, there's some assumptions and presumptions that can be made

715
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:23,040
immediately and that they're maybe not that dissimilar from us. Now, maybe it simply is

716
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,320
like if you ever had a Jeep and you have those upside down stickers, if you can read this,

717
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,800
flip me back over, right? Maybe it's something like that. Or if you can read this, phone home

718
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:37,760
for me because I'm in trouble. Or maybe it means something else. But yeah, we looked at that at

719
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:44,960
ATIP as wondering if there's some sort of intent that we can glean from script.

720
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,280
Because you were aware of craft that had script on it.

721
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,720
And not just me. No, there's a lot of script.

722
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,720
Yeah, it's pretty undeniable at this point.

723
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,880
Was it written or engraved in these crafts?

724
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,720
No, it was engraved. It wasn't written.

725
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,360
Did it look not too dissimilar from what I just showed you?

726
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:09,120
Much more precise than that actually. I mean, there's no doubt about what you showed me there

727
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:14,400
is someone's interpretation of what could be either script or it could be just scratches

728
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,280
and the ablative process of- It was very blatant.

729
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:25,120
Oh yeah, looking at that. It's like, hey, that's there for an intended purpose.

730
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,720
You've seen these on egg crafts?

731
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:36,480
Let me do a polite pass on that. It was on a different craft, but the egg craft is something

732
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,840
that is people are now just saying, oh, this is a new form of UFA. No, it's not.

733
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,440
And not just us. There are people, if the story ever comes out,

734
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,520
we have been dealing with this shape for a long time. It's not new. People think it's new.

735
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:54,400
It is not at all. In fact, there's some very interesting intelligence information about that.

736
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,040
I cannot go into any detail. I'm very hopeful that information will probably come out soon enough.

737
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,920
Not by me, but some scientists who actually research some of this stuff.

738
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,080
And it is not new to our intelligence community either.

739
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,840
We've been hearing about egg crafts with symbols on it since Lonnie Zamora.

740
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,640
We've also spoken to Chris Bledsoe, who he described his as being an egg as well.

741
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:24,480
So these things tend to pop up, but more than that, in both of these stories,

742
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,000
they have some type of intelligent being on the inside.

743
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,160
Well, if you think about an egg, it's almost nature's perfect solution.

744
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,720
The egg shape, there's a reason why it is what it is.

745
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,680
Yeah, it's perfect.

746
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,520
It's perfect. And it's extremely resilient to external forces.

747
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,320
Try again, there's an old trick where you take an egg and try to smash it with your fingers.

748
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,240
It's very tough to do. And so there's a reason you could even surmise the reason why

749
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,240
some of our early space capsules almost had that little bit of an egg shape to it,

750
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:58,160
because it's very resistant to Earth's atmosphere when you're coming in on reentry.

751
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,200
It's a very efficient shape. It is naturally aerodynamic, naturally.

752
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,520
So there's a lot of advantages to having something the shape of an egg.

753
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,160
In fact, if you look at World War II and Zamora bombs, they look like eggs with fins on them.

754
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,280
There's a reason for that. It's because of the efficiency of that shape.

755
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:23,760
It's really interesting that we're talking about this, because to me, this just communicates that

756
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:32,960
we also have specific data on crafts that are very close up, very HD, very...

757
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:44,160
I mean, that type of information leads me to believe that the information that we were given

758
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:49,600
with the tic-tac, the gimbal, the go-fast was all just preparatory.

759
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:57,280
Because if you're holding on to that type of clear imagery, it really cements the idea that

760
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:02,480
it's a planned dissemination to the public. But let me ask you something. If you were in charge

761
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,960
for just a day, and you know that this whole experiment only works because people have faith

762
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,640
and confidence in you, right? This is a term we call catastrophic disclosure versus controlled

763
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:18,480
disclosure. And I know people hate that idea. You have no right to control that. Look, if really

764
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,040
there is even a remote possibility that this really could be destabilizing conversation,

765
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:30,320
then it is the responsible move to handle this in a very methodical manner.

766
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:30,560
Sure.

767
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,520
Right? Because you don't want to disrupt... At the end of the day, people still have to pay

768
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,240
their mortgages and pay their cell phone bills. You've got to go to PTA meetings. You've got to

769
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:40,080
take the kids to soccer. I think we all get it. But it's the admission of that, I think,

770
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,360
that people have a hard time with. It's not so much the act of it.

771
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,440
But brother, look, you already had a former director of national intelligence,

772
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,960
state for the record, that these things are real, whatever they are. You had a former director of

773
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,720
the CIA. You had two former presidents of the United States. You've got other elected leaders

774
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,480
in other countries all saying it. I mean, people say, well, when are we going to have disclosure?

775
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,720
I say, look, you already have it. We've crossed the brubicon already. Now the question is,

776
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,120
what are we going to do about it and how are we going to have it? It may not be the flavor

777
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,280
of disclosure you want, but you already have the government. Look, you have the setting up of

778
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:12,880
Arrow. Yeah, I know there's some hiccups there and they still kind of dorking around, but that'll

779
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,760
be fixed very soon. You have a new administration in the United States that is very proactive in

780
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,040
this topic, wants the American people to know the truth and think the American people can handle

781
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:25,760
the truth. And by the way, same with our elected officials. For the first time, we have a bipartisan

782
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:30,240
issue that both Democrats and Republicans can agree with and say, yeah, you know what? Americans

783
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:37,360
deserve the truth. So we've already had disclosure, big D as people call it. It's just maybe not the

784
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:42,480
flavor people are expecting. Well, I think a lot of people are just of a simpler

785
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:49,600
sort of mind where they're like, well, just show me what you got. And I think that's what it really

786
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,560
comes down to with a lot of people's frustrations is not that... Yeah, transparency. It's a

787
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,480
transparency issue. Exactly. And this is what motivates me. I agree. Look, I think we need to

788
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,680
level with the American people. I think we need to level with the world. And let's face it. Look,

789
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,760
if we know they aren't adversarial, that is. Right. Well, even if they are adversarial,

790
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:13,840
we need to know. And look, the dumbest secret there is, is that the Canadians have been dealing

791
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,880
with this. The US has been dealing with this. The Mexican has been dealing with this. South

792
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,360
America has been dealing with it. Europe's been dealing with it. The Russians and Chinese.

793
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:25,440
Is it the worst kept secret at this point? Is it possible that maybe this is the one conversation

794
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:29,680
that can actually get countries that are adversarial to each other, say, look, for this one thing,

795
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:34,720
let's agree to agree and let's work together on this. And I will make a treaty. I promise I

796
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,120
will not exploit this technology to hurt you. And you have to do the same thing. Let's work

797
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:44,560
together scientifically on this, because maybe it'll help us as humanity move forward. Clean

798
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:49,920
energy solutions, for example, or better medical. Look, one only has to look at the 10 years of one

799
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:55,360
decade that we had this space race with the then Soviet Union, right? Now Russia. What happened

800
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:01,200
during the Apollo years? We went from 1960, 1969 to putting a person on the moon. And we did it

801
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:07,920
almost routinely, if you can imagine that, right? What happened as a result? Well, over 6,200

802
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:15,760
industries, not products, industries were a result of that one decade of competition

803
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,000
to get into space and ultimately get on the moon. Things like the LED light bulb, things like the

804
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:27,920
CAT scan that have outlived their initial intended purpose and have changed the wellbeing of humanity

805
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:35,440
for the good forever, right? And that's just 10 years of trying to get to the moon. Can you imagine

806
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:42,720
this type of technology, the potential benefits it could have for our species? Now with that said,

807
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,080
there's the counter argument, right? Of course. Every time, like nuclear energy. Yeah, it can

808
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,840
power a city, but it can also destroy it. So you can't ignore it because there are rogue nations

809
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,360
out there that will say, well, if I can fly from here to there almost instantly and not be seen,

810
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:00,080
I can put a weapon on that thing, right? And now all of a sudden, uh-oh, Pandora's box has been

811
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:08,160
open and there's a liability there. So maybe we need to have an adult conversation with the rest

812
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,880
of the world. And I'm not talking like United Nations. I'm talking bigger, like no kidding,

813
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,080
hey, guys, we got to get to the table on this because we're going to wind up, you don't want

814
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,960
to die. We don't want to die. We don't want to kill each other with this. This is like for real,

815
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,360
real psych nuclear weapons, right? You know, let's, let's not use them if we can. Yeah,

816
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,280
this is the, like the Manhattan project on steroids. That's right. But if we're smart,

817
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,240
we'll use it. We'll do this as for peaceful purposes. Yeah. For once for once. And I think

818
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:40,160
we can, and by the way, the reason why I have hope is not because of my generation. My generation is

819
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,080
paranoid. We screwed this topic up long enough. We've hit it, we suppressed it, and then we ruin

820
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:49,040
people's lives for it. It's your generation because when I had to have secret conversations

821
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:54,240
about this topic in the Pentagon, it was always because we were afraid of the reaction we were

822
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:59,120
going to get, the visceral reaction and the fear. Your generation, which is the generation of my

823
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:04,320
daughters, seem much more open to this. It's much more, hey, listen, we really need to get to the

824
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,840
bottom of this because there could be a benefit here. We don't want to go to war with Russia. We

825
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,760
don't want to go to war with China. Can we all just get along for once and try to work this out

826
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,760
because this involves all of humanity? And that gives me encouragement. That's why I think the

827
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,560
time is now to have this conversation because unlike before previous generations like mine that

828
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:28,800
completely botched this topic, your generation actually seems to be more open and more responsible

829
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,520
about it. And I think it's partly because of this type of technology. When I was in high school,

830
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:38,720
if I wanted to learn about the Andes Mountains, I had to go to a library, pick an encyclopedia

831
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:42,960
off the shelf that was probably 10 or 15 years old already. Luckily, maybe the page was still there,

832
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:48,880
wasn't ripped out for some other kid's project. I got about a paragraph and a half about the Andes

833
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,760
Mountains. Now, in virtually any language, instantaneously, in any part of the world,

834
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,720
you can pull up on your phone all the information you want and have volumes and volumes and volumes

835
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:03,360
about the Andes Mountains, how they were made and the precipitation rate and the population and

836
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:08,880
erosion rates and all that stuff. You have more information at the tip of your hand for the first

837
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,400
time. The world is connected like never before. There's great power in that because

838
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:21,440
for the first time, your generation can understand how your generation in China feel,

839
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:26,000
and you can communicate and how people in Iran feel and people in Russia and China and the UK

840
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,560
and France and Germany. And if you don't understand the language, it'll automatically be translated

841
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:38,320
for you. So that communication barrier has been evaporated. And also the cultural barrier. You

842
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:45,520
guys are far more accepting of new ideas, new principles, new perspectives than mine. Look,

843
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:51,520
I grew up in a generation where I was on the tail end of literally where we had separation

844
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:57,520
of races. Can you imagine that? How foolish and silly is that? And now it's like, my God,

845
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,520
what the hell were people thinking? That was an associated norm. That was an expect norm.

846
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,800
When I was in the military, we were always told, don't ask, don't tell. And homosexuality in the

847
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:12,720
military is bad. Well, it's silly. It's stupid. Why the hell did we ever care? Why? Because we

848
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:19,440
were ignorant. My generation made these dumb rules because we didn't know better. Your generation

849
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,960
is not that way. You don't have these preconceived notions of what should and shouldn't be. You use

850
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,920
common sense. And I think that's why the timing is like never been before, because we've never

851
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:36,240
had the technology before. And we've also never had a generation like yours before. And those two

852
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:42,160
perfect storms allow us to have a conversation like this. Great. I mean, that gives me some hope.

853
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:49,600
One of the scariest things that I've ever heard was, I think it was Hal Puthoff who said this,

854
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:58,480
and if the government discovered a drop of water, the first thing they're going to do is figure out

855
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:05,360
how to drown you in it. Yep. And part of me is thankful for that because, and you can say what

856
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:10,800
you want, but if we didn't invent the nuke first, this podcast would not be happening.

857
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,000
That's right. And that's pretty much a fact. And we've been speaking a different language,

858
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,360
perhaps. Absolutely. But at the same time, you bring up a really interesting point.

859
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,440
There is this weird, if you look at it from a biological perspective and a sociological perspective,

860
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:37,760
I guess the best way to describe it is tribalism. Ancient mankind had a small circle of people

861
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,160
within their tribe, maybe living in a cave, living in a hut, whatever. And that was a reality. And

862
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:47,120
everybody else were enemies, right? Because we were living in an environment where we were resource

863
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:53,280
starved. So either I ate or you ate. And if you ate, I didn't. And so we had this weird competition.

864
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:58,880
And then as society expanded into the village, it became now a village mentality. And we still

865
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:05,120
write books now. It takes a village, right? So our society, our little myopic society that we

866
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,280
encapsulate ourselves in, and everybody else is out there, the enemy, and we're going to stick

867
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:16,800
together. And then you had the urbanization. And once we entered this point of agriculturalism,

868
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:23,120
and we weren't nomads anymore, we gravitated to a central region and attracted more people.

869
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:29,920
So that population density became greater until eventually you had regional areas. And then

870
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:35,520
eventually you had borders of nations, right? United States, and you're Canadian, and you're Mexican.

871
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:42,240
But as we continue to push our boundaries, we begin to realize that we're really all the same.

872
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,240
And this is something that I've tried to tell people, look, if you're ever in space and you

873
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:51,280
look down at the earth, you don't see the lines between countries. We're all together. We're all

874
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:56,160
you know, we will say, well, I'm American. What does that mean? You know, because people in South

875
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,520
America, they're Americans too. They're just South Americans versus North Americans versus

876
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:05,280
Central Americans. We're all in this together. But we're fighting instinct because our instinct

877
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,400
is to be tribal. Our instinct is my loyalties to my people, my country, my family, my this, my that.

878
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:15,200
And that was in order to survive as a species, we needed to, animals do the same thing, right?

879
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:19,760
You have a pack of wolves and they stick together and they go after everything else. And so that is

880
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,960
part of the Darwinian survival and evolution of all things biological because why we live in a

881
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:30,880
resource starved environment, it's either them or me eat or be eaten. But we're now realizing

882
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:36,720
if we want to evolve to the next phase of our existence as human beings, where we rely on this

883
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:43,040
and you know, not this, not bronze, but our brains and our hearts, we have to overcome that instinct

884
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:49,920
to control, to dominate, to do all the things that nations and religions do.

885
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:55,600
In fact, that is the one thing I think that is stopping our evolution to the next phase of human

886
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:02,880
reality, which is, do we have enough sense to get rid of some of these instinctual habits that we've,

887
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,120
by the way, required to survive to get to where we are now? Like you said, the bomb, right? Thank

888
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:13,600
God, as bad as it was, thank God we had it and not them. But have we been able to outgrow that

889
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:19,600
to the point now where we can actually all have a conversation together and say, look, we're all

890
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,680
brothers and sisters. I may not agree with you. I may not understand you. You may not agree with me

891
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:31,360
and understand me, but we can agree that humanity's survival as a species demands that we begin to work

892
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,720
with each other, communicate with each other towards a common goal and stop this infighting

893
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:41,920
and competition. And maybe at some point we'll get to a point where we're not in a resource starved

894
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:46,320
environment. We are an environment where we don't have that competition and we don't need to have

895
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:53,040
that competition. Yeah. Yeah. Great. And I think that, you know, Reagan said it too at the UN

896
01:19:53,040 --> 01:20:00,400
meeting there back in the day when he was like, it would take, you know, an external

897
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:06,320
extraterrestrial threat for all of us to like be, you know, realize that, hey, we're in this together.

898
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:15,280
Maybe, hopefully it isn't an extraterrestrial threat that we're facing. Okay. I have a question

899
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:22,160
here. I have a few more questions that we got to get into. I'm just still fascinated with all the

900
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:27,600
things that you've seen. And I think that's where, I think, and I'll speak for a lot of people here.

901
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:35,360
I think that's the broadly in a general sense why people are so fascinated with people of

902
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:41,760
in your position, because you got to peek behind the curtain. We did not, right? So we,

903
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:47,920
to a certain extent, careful what you wish for. I know. That's another question I have, but

904
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:56,480
for now, like you have, you know, access to the mechanism, you have access to at least a portion

905
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:02,160
of the mechanism and you get to peek behind the veil. And all the rest of us are curious, right?

906
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:09,040
We're curious because it involves mankind. It involves our own potential religion. It involves

907
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:13,920
life and death. It involves why we're here. It involves the questions of the universe. It involves

908
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:21,440
the most important things that humanity has ever asked for. And you potentially had one of the

909
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:28,480
closest encounters with the answer. That is a great, that's heavy, man. You don't put that on

910
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:36,320
my shoulders. Are you kidding me? That is what it is. That is why people are so passionate about

911
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:42,080
this. That is why people get fired up, whether good or bad or angry or happy or they get fired

912
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:49,760
up because this is important. This is the big question. And, you know, there aren't so many

913
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:56,720
people that have come forward to talk about that. And the second we get somebody, you know, is the

914
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:01,280
second we need to grill them. It's the second we need to put them through the wringer because

915
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:05,120
you're playing with my emotions. Right. And truth, whatever that truth is, and you're going to come

916
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,880
out and if you're going to say this is the truth, then, you know, you better prove it. Exactly. And

917
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:14,720
so, you know, you of all people can understand the amount of, you know, frustration and vitriol and

918
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:21,120
all of this stuff combined because deep, deep, deep down, everyone's just hoping for an answer.

919
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:27,760
That's just deep down. But my role isn't to provide answers. My role is just to provide

920
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,160
information. It's up to you to find those answers. And this is what I try to tell people.

921
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:36,480
Well put. You know, it's don't put that responsibility on my shoulders. I'm just like you

922
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:41,520
and I'm fallible and I'm a human being and I, you know, wake up and I spill my coffee and,

923
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:47,760
you know, I'm not a messiah, man. That's not, that is, my job is simply as a purveyor of the

924
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,720
information. Here's the information. Here's the data. Here's the facts. How you interpret that

925
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:58,320
and what you think about that, brother, that's on you, not me. But a lot of us are not willing to

926
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:03,040
make that answer as long as there is information being withheld. Oh, agreed. No, you're right. And

927
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,400
that's why we're doing what we're doing. Right. Here's the information. We're going to get more

928
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:11,600
out. We do, we do want to make those answers and hopefully, you know, we don't look to anyone else

929
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,040
for answers and we can come up with those ourselves. But as long as we're aware that

930
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:20,800
there is information that is being withheld, we can't fully formulate a proper answer. And some

931
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,840
people's frustration, my guess is that you have that luxury of formulating some type of answer

932
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:32,240
that they would love to formulate themselves. Makes sense? Yeah. Good point. So, you know, forgive

933
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:37,360
me for always, you know, prying into what it is you've seen, but that's the underlying value in

934
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:43,200
this is that some of us just want to know more so that we can make our own answers. Sure. That's

935
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,680
fair. And I think that's a really good point. And that's, you know, I guess indirectly,

936
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:52,800
some of why I do what I do. You know, I want you to have information so you can make your own

937
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,800
assessment. And this is why people say, well, Lou, what do you think? You know what? To hell with

938
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,080
what Lou thinks. It doesn't matter what Lou thinks. What matters is what you think. You know, my job

939
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:05,200
is easy. This is why, you know, I used to tell people when I was a former special agent and when

940
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,560
I was a special agent in charge, our job is very simple. Provide the information to the jury,

941
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,720
let the jury decide. It doesn't matter what I think about it, but it doesn't matter how I feel

942
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:17,680
about it. What matters is what does the data suggest? What does the math suggest? What are

943
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:24,080
what is the collection of data and observations provide? And then you allow the people to make

944
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:28,640
that decision for themselves. Correct. Right. And I think it's the problem we have right now

945
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:33,920
in this UFO community, which I do not consider myself a ufologist. I'm not a researcher of UFO.

946
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,440
It happened at the job. That was it. Paid by the government, American taxpayer dollars.

947
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,440
Um, I think it's, it's critical that people be allowed to make their own interpretive decisions

948
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,960
for themselves, because this is people, of course, people say, Lou, what do you think?

949
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:54,000
Doesn't matter. What matters is what you think. Here's the data. You figure that don't be so quick

950
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,240
to give up that, that sacred right you have to think. But once again, we don't have that data.

951
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:03,280
Right. Well, we get some of it. We don't have it. You don't have all of it. There's a difference.

952
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,240
You do have some of it. Yes, we do. We do have some of it. And I know it's frustrating because

953
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:10,720
people say they want more. I get it. I understand. Well, it's because it's, it's like chocolate.

954
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:14,960
And it's not, and that's not on you that it's frustrating, by the way. And I know you shoulder

955
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:21,360
a lot of that. And, and, and to, you know, to a great extent, it's very unfair, because you have

956
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,280
been forthcoming with more information, I think, than most people would have gotten in a lifetime

957
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:29,200
of research. You know, thanks to, thanks to the things that you've done coming forward.

958
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:34,240
Thank you. I am trying. Absolutely. Absolutely. And that is undeniable. And I'm willing to fight

959
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:39,920
anyone on that. You know, but the, the problem is once, once we scrape the barrel, we're like,

960
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,680
okay, well, what's next? Right. And we know there is a next. We know there is something, right?

961
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:48,960
Right. Okay. I think part of the frustration, and let me completely transparent with you guys.

962
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,960
I do a lot of work behind the shadows, behind the scenes, in order to get to like where we are now,

963
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:00,080
whether it's a new whistleblower that maybe I've been aware of for the last few years, or

964
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:06,960
uh, maybe a secret project that will hopefully blow the lid on a lot of this, you know, whether

965
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,360
through a documentary and getting the right people to have the conversation. The problem is when you

966
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:15,920
do that in the dark, people think that you're hiding something from them. They don't realize that,

967
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,560
look, it's not you I don't trust. What I don't trust are some of the elements over there that

968
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,880
don't want this conversation to happen. And I can't have the conversation with you without

969
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,280
them hearing it. So I have to do things behind the scenes and in the dark until they become

970
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,160
revealed, right? Yes. And people look at that as, oh, well, that's Lou being secret. That's Lou,

971
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:38,800
you know, obfuscating the truth. That's Lou controlling a narrative. No, it's not.

972
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:43,360
What it's doing is allowing me the time and the ability to present the information where someone's

973
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:48,080
not going to take it away from you. And that's, that's why I do a lot of what I do when you,

974
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,720
when I leave these breadcrumbs, people say, I don't want breadcrumbs. That's why you're doing

975
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:55,600
that. Look, if you look for the last seven years, everything I've ever said has come to pass

976
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:00,400
without exception, every single thing. And I do that deliberately so people know, look,

977
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,080
I am fighting for you. I'm working for you behind the scenes. I just can't tell you everything that

978
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:08,880
I'm doing right now, but eventually you'll know. And I'm trying to, you know, I know people say,

979
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,920
well, but it's been seven years. Yeah, but we've done more than seven years than we have in the

980
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,960
last 70. I mean, guys, I'm working my ass off. Believe me, I'm putting myself in a lot of risk.

981
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:22,400
I lost almost everything pursuing this. You know, and like I said, how much are you paying

982
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:27,360
me to do your podcast right now? How much are you paying me? Zero. That's right. Find any podcaster

983
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:33,360
that I've taken a penny from, you know, it costs money, baby. It's, I'm taking time away from my

984
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:38,480
family to have this conversation with people and people don't realize that, you know, he's a grifter.

985
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,920
You don't know a grifter. If I was a grifter, you know how much money I'd have right now? I'd

986
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:48,640
be flying a Learjet. You know, I deliberately don't do that simply because I don't want to

987
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:55,040
pollute the topic. And I respect that. And I think, you know, just from my observation,

988
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:01,440
I try to remain really sort of unbiased from all of this and just look at it from like a

989
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:10,240
spectator perspective. And I think there are a lot of other bad actors in this specific area.

990
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,520
Oh yeah. There's a lot of people that caught in industries that have been selling a line of bull

991
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,080
to people for a long time and now they've got a double down, triple down. And there's a lot

992
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:22,160
and there's also a lot of trust me, bro. Yeah. Right. And people are sick of the trust. Yeah,

993
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:28,720
absolutely. And because there's a lot of it. And so, you know, I guess the reason there's probably

994
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:33,680
so much frustration. You're going to get hate by the way, as I promise you. Yeah. Just for having

995
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:37,920
me in your studio. I'm aware. Having this conversation. Oh, he's a grifter. He's full

996
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:43,600
of crap. He doesn't know. I mean, I've been called the same. I'm aware and I'm currently unfazed by

997
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,720
it. Because for me, this is not only a pursuit for them. This is a pursuit for myself as well.

998
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:54,800
I want to know, right? And whatever means I have to get that information is the means I'm going to

999
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:03,040
pursue. But they would also be lying if they said they wouldn't want to be sitting right here and

1000
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:09,840
talking with you right now. Interesting. I think a lot of people probably, yeah, if anything to

1001
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:17,120
throw a tomato at me, probably. Fine. But if it means getting a little bit more, a little closer

1002
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:21,760
to the answer that they're so desperately seeking, then I think it's worthwhile. But you know, the

1003
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:28,960
answer, here's a great point. The answer doesn't come externally. And this is why I've told people

1004
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:33,200
before. If you really want to know what's going on out there, you first got to know what's going on

1005
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:38,240
in here. Yeah. And this is the filter for everything we see and we conceive and we perceive.

1006
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:45,120
And so you have to stop saying, I demand the truth. Give me the truth. Look in the damn mirror and

1007
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:52,640
say, first of all, what can I do to be a better father, a better husband, a better citizen? And

1008
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,760
let me be the best that I can be. And then hopefully that whatever that is makes more sense.

1009
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:05,040
Because as long as we have the pride and the ego that so many of us carry around and the

1010
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,960
inability to look in the mirror and say, you know what? I don't really like that aspect of what I

1011
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:13,200
see. We're in a society where it's, oh, you have to love yourself. Oh, you're the best. You know

1012
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:19,440
what? That affirmation is BS. We need to be hypercritical of ourselves so we can be better

1013
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,760
people. I'll share. You know what these tattoos here on my arm, and by the way, I don't normally

1014
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:29,120
like tattoos, but I did it for military and other stuff. What this says? It's Latin. It says accept

1015
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:33,440
and pint it to you. It means with regret. Because there are people out there that live their lives.

1016
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:37,280
I have no regrets. You know what? You're a moron then because then you're never going to learn

1017
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:41,920
a lesson. I have lots of regret. I've done things that I wish I didn't have to do. Now,

1018
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,920
if I was put in the same situation again, would I do it for my country? Damn right, I would.

1019
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,760
But I regret the fact that as humans, we had to even be put in that situation. I never want to

1020
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:56,000
forget the faces and the lives of other human beings that maybe aren't here anymore because

1021
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,680
of things maybe I've done. And so no, I want to remember their faces. I don't want to glorify

1022
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:08,080
that because I'm still a human, you know, and I did things because I had to, not because I wanted

1023
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:13,520
to. And I think we have to be self-reflective. I think we have to have the courage to look in the

1024
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:17,920
mirror and say, you know what? I can be a better person. You're not going to be perfect. We're

1025
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:24,000
humans. We're never ever going to be perfect. But it shouldn't stop you from trying to being a better

1026
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,080
human being. And I think that is maybe one of the keys to unlock this greater mystery. You know,

1027
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:36,240
we can't, how are we going to, I'll give a perfect case one. I had a general about two and a half

1028
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:40,800
years ago now. It's been a while. He says to me after giving him a briefing on this topic, he says,

1029
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,800
Lou, this one, I was a US Space Force. He goes, look, Lou, I really don't care about this. All

1030
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:49,920
I care about is if this thing lands on the White House lawn, do I go ahead and extend my hand out

1031
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,920
to shake its hand and in friendship or do I point an M16 at its head?

1032
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,080
And I looked at him and said, my dear general, you're missing the point.

1033
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:04,480
It's not an either or solution, right? Both of those may be the wrong way to react to this.

1034
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:10,560
We need to do a better job of understanding what's actually going on. In order to do that,

1035
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,720
you first have to understand how you're wired yourself. What makes you tick? What motivates

1036
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:20,320
you? Because that's going to depend on how you interpret that data. Is it friendly? Is it a

1037
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:24,080
threat? Or is it something completely different? And so we all have to be on that same sheet of

1038
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:29,200
music. We all have to have that honest conversation with ourselves. You know what?

1039
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:33,040
We're not perfect. You know what? I'm not the best person out there. You know what? I'm not

1040
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:39,440
the prettiest. I'm not the richest. I'm not the most influential. And yeah, I've got some bad

1041
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:45,200
habits. Maybe I don't clean up the bathroom or I drink too much or I'm a gambler or whatever that

1042
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:51,920
is. But be honest with yourself, man. And then make the effort of trying to learn those lessons

1043
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:56,400
and become a better human being because maybe that's what it's going to take to really understand

1044
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:01,120
out there. You got to first understand here. I love that. I love that. Thank you for sharing

1045
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:05,680
that. And I think that's a great point. And it's one of the most refreshing things I've heard

1046
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:13,440
in this topic because even Jake Barber, we'll get back to him, he had this

1047
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:23,440
sort of this providence, this holy moment when he perceived him being in contact with whatever

1048
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:30,160
emotional feminine energy entity was in this craft, but that changed him fundamentally.

1049
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:34,720
You could see that on camera. He almost broke down into tears just even talking about it. It was

1050
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:42,480
very real to him. And he said something. He said something to the likes of everybody should feel

1051
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:48,640
this in order to understand that perspective is everything. I don't disagree with that. I think

1052
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:59,040
he's absolutely right about that. I've always stuck to this. If you understand someone,

1053
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:06,800
it is impossible to hate them. And I will die by those words. Think about anyone in your life who

1054
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:13,840
you dislike, find annoying or hate, and now really try and understand them. Really try and walk a

1055
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:19,440
mile in their shoes and try to be empathetic to what it is their entire story is from beginning

1056
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:24,320
to end and current. And that's hard to do. It's really hard to do. But if you can do that, even

1057
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:29,760
if you can get close to doing that, you find yourself feeling all sorts of other feelings

1058
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,960
for this person that aren't negative. Well, and think about if you've ever been guilty of that

1059
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,680
same behavior, which chances are we have because we're human. But we don't want to do that. And

1060
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:45,680
sometimes in life, we want to have someone we can point the finger to. Well, of course,

1061
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:49,520
because they're human beings. And it avoids us having to point it at ourselves. And accept

1062
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:54,400
responsibility. The harder thing to do, like I said, is look in the mirror and accept responsibility

1063
01:34:54,400 --> 01:35:01,200
and say, you know what? Shoot, I could have done better. I did not give it my best. And I know it.

1064
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:06,400
And I need to I need to work on that. Right. And you're not without your flaws. And that's

1065
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:12,160
something that that you've also been vocal about as well. Right. Is that, yeah, mistakes happen.

1066
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:17,280
Things happen to people. But you got to own up to it, man. You're still you haven't given up.

1067
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:23,680
No. And you know what? Accept responsibility. Remain accountable. It's not that hard. Yeah,

1068
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:28,640
it sucks. You got to swallow your pride. But guess what? That's the only way you're going to

1069
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:34,000
succeed. You have to under you have to have those lessons learned. And if you don't. Right. And for

1070
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,560
me, I had to be dumb enough. I had to put on my arms to remind myself of it. You know, you're going

1071
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:43,040
to be you're going to be doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over and over and over again.

1072
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:46,800
And something magical happens when you actually accept responsibility. Even though it's a gut

1073
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:53,440
punch to the pride and ego part. All of a sudden, you become free. It is it is freedom in a way that

1074
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:00,720
you would not expect. But it's very, very liberating. And it's also very, very, I think,

1075
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:08,880
encouraging. And it's it's it's helpful. Because you all of a sudden get more out of life.

1076
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:14,320
You begin to appreciate things you wouldn't before you walking in a park and you look at a little

1077
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:19,200
flower that's growing underneath the tree and also wow, that's that's magical. How many times have I

1078
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:24,240
walked by here and never even noticed that or cared. Right. And now all of a sudden, wow,

1079
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:28,960
beauty is right there. I don't have to go searching for beauty in a Vogue magazine or,

1080
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:34,800
you know, a New York runway. It's right there. Nature's beauty right there. And here I am this

1081
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:40,880
entire time taking it for granted. Right. So I think, you know, this is what I know to frustrate

1082
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,520
people. People always say, well, if I want to really know about that, what's your one suggestion,

1083
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:50,400
Lou? So stop worrying about that. Stop worrying about that. Stop. Start worrying about what's in

1084
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:55,520
here. And then maybe you'll unlock the secrets. You'll get a fresh perspective. Yep. All right.

1085
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:59,840
Let's get back to the nuts and bolts. This is great. I love this, by the way. Thank you for

1086
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:07,280
addressing that. Okay. Bit of a fun question. Okay. If you can get access to any archive

1087
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:14,320
out of the 19 intelligence agencies, if you can get full unrestricted access to any of their

1088
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:22,640
archives. And we're talking DOE, CIA, DOD, whatever it is, DIA, whatever. What agency?

1089
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,800
Well, it's a bit unfair for me because I had a very high security clearance. And you had access

1090
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:32,400
to a lot of stuff. But I think for me. Okay. If you were in my position.

1091
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:38,960
The CIA. And here's the reason why. Not because it's, you know, the CIA. It's not domestic.

1092
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,240
It's not domestic, but more importantly, they share a lot of information from other agencies

1093
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:50,080
goes to the CIA. So it's not just CIA information you'd have access to. You'd have access to a lot

1094
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:56,800
of other agencies, both domestic and foreign information that the CIA has access to. It's

1095
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:02,080
kind of a belly button, if you will. And so if you can get into there and really have full open

1096
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:08,400
access, you would learn a lot. Is the DOE interesting as well? Absolutely. It is. Look,

1097
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,400
by law, anything that gives off a certain amount of radiation falls under the DOE.

1098
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:21,040
Is there? Okay. So we're speaking about lures earlier, right? And how the ocean, big bodies

1099
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:29,280
of water, but also, you know, possibly strife and conflict, nuclear war, these things seem to

1100
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:38,320
attract. Are there any environmental factors that attract them? Yeah. What are some that aren't the

1101
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:44,160
ocean? What are some other environmental factors that you've seen activity in or atmospheric?

1102
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:53,920
So there is a lot of information on this topic to suggest that uranium mines are a particular

1103
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,480
interest and other mines as well, believe it or not gold. Now, if you think about it, why gold?

1104
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:04,560
Not from a monetary perspective, but what gold is, you know, gold is a very interesting metal,

1105
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,600
which, by the way, makes it valuable, not because it's printing, it's gold,

1106
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,920
because the property, the reason why NASA and the Air Force use gold a lot on the inside of

1107
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,960
radiation properties, all sorts of properties. Right. I got to be careful what I say here, but

1108
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:22,960
gold has some very interesting properties. And there has been some information to suggest that

1109
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:30,080
UAP are interested in mining operations, both uranium and gold. That was also suggested by the

1110
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:34,320
4chan whistleblower who talked about the underwater construction unit. Yeah. Interesting.

1111
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:42,480
Very interesting. I mean, if it's just my brain's jumping to Ariel, the Ariel school,

1112
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:47,600
they were close to a uranium mine as well. That's not the only one.

1113
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:52,320
Yeah. I'm sure there are other mass sightings. There's some reports, governmental reports.

1114
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,400
I can probably tell that they've been released through FOIA now, so they were classified. CIA

1115
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:05,680
reports on mines in the Congo, gold mines, where these things were seen by many, many people.

1116
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,280
Wow. Australia too.

1117
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:15,840
Oh, I mean, okay. So there's one thing being interested in the material, but there's another

1118
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:26,000
in extracting it. Have you any recorded data of observing these UAP extracting anything?

1119
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,360
No, I haven't. It doesn't mean it's not the case, but not in my experience. I haven't seen

1120
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:37,520
actually any extraction of minerals from the earth. Okay. The 4chan whistleblower said that

1121
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:42,880
the technology they used was laser somehow, and that lasers were really interesting and that China

1122
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:49,760
was actually using some of these lasers and had figured out how to bore these holes and to mine

1123
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:55,120
things that left the United States baffled. So are we sure it's actual laser? So laser

1124
01:40:55,120 --> 01:41:00,080
is very interesting. It's in a visible light spectrum and it's a very specific frequency

1125
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:04,960
of light. So green laser only uses green. It looks green because it's green and the photons

1126
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:10,160
are coming on very specific frequency. Blue lasers, red lasers. There's things that can be

1127
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:16,480
confused as lasers directed energy that are really not based in photons or the emission of

1128
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:22,400
actual light. Then you also have a, in some cases, what they call a Doppler shift. So

1129
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:27,360
part of the discussion we had in ATIP was some of the biological consequences of people getting too

1130
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:32,080
close to the things and suffering injury. Exactly. Doppler red shift, blue shift,

1131
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:38,960
what could be coming out in let's say a certain radio frequency when it goes through a certain

1132
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:46,160
process and perhaps leaves the UAP or the UFO, it gets Doppler shifted into a higher frequency

1133
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:52,160
that now becomes interpreted as visible light or possibly even energy like it could hurt you.

1134
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:58,560
X-ray for example. So when someone says, well, they're using laser technology.

1135
01:41:58,560 --> 01:41:59,440
You could look that way.

1136
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:04,000
Yeah. Is it really laser technology or is it something else that we are now superimposing

1137
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,200
our own understanding of physics and go that laser when really it might not be a laser per se,

1138
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,400
but it's interpreted that way.

1139
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,840
Yeah. It has laser like properties.

1140
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:12,560
Right. Right.

1141
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:20,960
Okay. Has there been through what you've been shown any reason to believe that

1142
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:32,560
the NHI or the UAP that you've been observing has a distinct and perhaps adverse effect on our

1143
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:41,280
religious beliefs? Well, you don't have to look at aliens and UFOs. A lot of things can threaten

1144
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:47,680
religion. But was there anything specifically that, because there has been talks of Jesus

1145
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:48,800
in Bibles and stuff?

1146
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:54,720
Let me explain it this way. There's nothing that I'm aware of that threatens or hinders

1147
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:59,920
my own interpretation of spiritualism and religion. But we can look back in the past,

1148
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:05,120
for example, look at Galileo Galilei when he first proposed the non-Earth-centric view of

1149
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:08,800
our solar system and proposed the heliocentric view of our solar system. What happened? Well,

1150
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,720
religion responded very violently and almost put him to death for it until they recanted.

1151
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:17,200
At the end of the day, we realized Galileo didn't do anything to threaten religion.

1152
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:22,480
It was mankind's interpretation of religion that was being threatened. Not God or the notion of

1153
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:28,640
God, but mankind's understanding of God or the great architect or the great beyond,

1154
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:29,520
right? Whatever you want to call it.

1155
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:39,920
I guess more specifically, my question would be, has there been anything in what you have studied

1156
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,000
that would confirm or deny religion?

1157
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,000
Everything I've seen only reinforces the notion of-

1158
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,480
The notion of religion, but nothing specifically. There's no specific data that points to

1159
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:58,560
any of the major religious events or any of the-

1160
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:02,320
Well, we have to be careful because it's very subjective, very interpretive. Let me give an

1161
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:06,880
example. I hear over and over again, people say, well, the Bible's full of UFO encounters. Look at

1162
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,800
Ezekiel's wheel. Okay, great. Or it could have just been someone's dream. Or it could have been

1163
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,720
a vision that wasn't related to UFOs at all. We don't know because we're separated by space and

1164
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:21,520
time, right? We weren't there. How do we know what the writer or the author was thinking at the time?

1165
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:30,160
You really don't. There's a lot of subjectivity there. Look, I think if anything, this topic only

1166
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:35,840
reinforces the notion that there is certainly a degree of order in this universe and that the

1167
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:40,080
cosmos is incredibly vast. Let me give you an example here. I've said this a few times

1168
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:48,720
before. There are two barriers to human beings really understanding the universe.

1169
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:53,600
In fact, if you look at the entire- There's five fundamental senses for which we judge

1170
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,880
our environment. If you can't touch it, taste it, hear it, smell it, et cetera,

1171
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,160
we really don't know it's there, right? That's the only way we have to use technology to help

1172
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:07,760
enhance some of that, but we only have five senses. Let's look at human vision for a second.

1173
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:12,640
What is human vision? Human vision is a very, very narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum

1174
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:16,640
we call the electro-optical spectrum, right? Really tiny. You can see red and we can see up

1175
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:21,840
to blue, and that's it. We think we can judge the entire universe, but that's only 0.0035%

1176
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:28,960
of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, meaning most of reality lies beyond our ability to perceive

1177
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:32,640
it. Now, are there animals that can? Sure. Honeybees can look in ultraviolet. There's

1178
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:38,080
animals that can see in infrared and whatnot. We as humans can't, so we rely on technology.

1179
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:41,520
Where I live in Wyoming, beautiful night skies. Take a look at that night sky and you'll see all

1180
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:46,080
these stars. Now look at that same night sky through a radio telescope and you start seeing

1181
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:50,480
things you can't see normally. You see large gaseous clouds and nova and things like that

1182
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:55,600
that are just as real, but they lie beyond our ability to perceive. Then you've got a scalability

1183
01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:00,800
issue. You and I are sitting in this wonderful studio you have here, having this great

1184
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:07,200
conversation between you and me. And when you look at the scale of the universe, so the visible,

1185
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:13,920
most scientists believe that the visible universe, visible horizon, it's about 40 billion, billion

1186
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:18,400
light years across. Now, to understand that and really perceive that, what does that mean? Well,

1187
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:25,280
that means take a photon of light, which travels at the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second.

1188
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:32,480
Seven and a half times around our entire planet in a second. Now think how far light can travel

1189
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:40,400
in a week and in a year. And now take that, multiply it by 40 billion, right? Incredibly

1190
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:45,840
vast. And that's only 10% of the actual size of the universe. Most cosmologists agree that the

1191
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:50,720
universe is 10 times bigger. It's just that it's so vast, light will never reach earth. So that's our

1192
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:54,400
visible horizon of 40 billion, but really the universe is probably over a hundred billion

1193
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:59,200
light years, maybe even much bigger across. And we are this infinitesimally small speck

1194
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:02,400
somewhere in the middle. I would encourage your audience, if they ever get a chance,

1195
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:07,040
get on Google, look on Google images and type in pale blue dot. What is that pale blue dot?

1196
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:11,520
That is earth. Everything you ever thought, dreamed, hoped, cried, laughed occurred on that

1197
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:16,560
tiny dot. Every moment of history that we know of since the beginning of time occurred on that

1198
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,800
planet. Everybody who's ever lived and died on that tiny little blue dot hurling through the

1199
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:25,680
vastness of space, right? That's very uncomfortable for people to look at and realize that and how

1200
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:31,280
vulnerable we really are. Real perspective. Now let's do the reverse. Let's go down.

1201
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:37,600
Let's look at Avogadro's number, 6.2 something times 10 to the negative 23rd, a hydrogen atom,

1202
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:43,920
a proton, neutron, and electron for hydrogen. That is times 10 to the negative 23rd in size.

1203
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:50,240
That's roughly the same order of magnitude as we are to the universe. And it's inside

1204
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:56,080
every human being, meaning most of reality is either too big or too small for human beings to

1205
01:47:56,080 --> 01:48:01,600
really interact with and grasp. And in fact, we can as a species, if we're lucky, one or two

1206
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:07,680
orders of magnitude up or down, and that's it. That's our reality. The truth is most of the

1207
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:13,280
universe is beyond our ability to even perceive it because it's either too big or too small.

1208
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:17,760
And so by that definition alone and the fact that we only look at 0.0036% of the entire

1209
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:28,240
electromagnetic spectrum, some incredible number, we can perceive 0.00000, keep writing those zeros

1210
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:32,640
all the way down, 1% of the entire universe in our reality. And we know most of the universe and

1211
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:37,760
reality lies beyond that. And so that's fact. That's not supposition. That's reality. And

1212
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:43,120
we have to understand that this is an awfully big and complex universe. And there's other things

1213
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:47,040
besides physical distance. We talk about physical distance, but you understand quantum mechanics

1214
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:52,320
and quantum entanglement. There are some things in the universe that really don't follow the rules

1215
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:59,280
of a three-dimensional space and time. It's inconsequential. It's irrelevant. And I know for

1216
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:05,200
us as a human physical species, that is our reality. It's hard for us to perceive a reality

1217
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:12,480
where space and time is irrelevant. But the fact is those universes exist. And so we have to really

1218
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:20,160
recalibrate the way we think about things. If we want to imagine the unimaginable, we first have to

1219
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:27,920
redefine what unimaginable is. A lot to think about, man. That's a big pill to swallow.

1220
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:36,880
Lou, you have a gold standard case that you look at, that you think back on. They're all different.

1221
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:40,320
There are so many gold standard cases. The ones I can talk about because people know about it,

1222
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:46,960
like the Nimitz incident. But the other ones, okay, platinum standard. Because if you can talk

1223
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:51,040
about the Nimitz and you consider that a gold standard, I mean, there's got to be something

1224
01:49:51,040 --> 01:50:01,200
above that. A lot. And there's a lot. In your mind, when you hear of a case or you see a case

1225
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:07,840
or you see a photo or a video floating around or whatnot, you have a Rolodex that you can compare

1226
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:17,760
it to, that you know for a fact is anomalous, that is confirmed an anomaly. Are we going to see

1227
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,520
some of those cases in the near future? That decision's not up to mine, but I certainly

1228
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:27,120
hope so. Let me give you an example without saying something specific. Let's say this coffee cup,

1229
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:32,480
let's take a look at this water bottle. Let's say this is birth. It's round, completely round.

1230
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:39,120
Yep. The way that gravity works is there are expected trajectories of things coming in and

1231
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:43,520
out of orbit. And especially with a satellite, let's say on retrograde, it comes in. That's how

1232
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,800
we know it's going to burn up over the Pacific Ocean. That's how we know at what time you can

1233
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:50,960
see the fireworks show in the sky, right? And the rocket reentering and burning up and the satellite

1234
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:58,000
and whatnot. There's an expected path that things take. Even ICBMs and missiles, if we were to

1235
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,840
launch on Russia or Russia were to launch on us, there's a very predictable pattern because

1236
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:07,040
it's physics. What you wouldn't expect looking at this as the earth is something, because most

1237
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:15,440
things come in as an arc. You wouldn't expect something going straight down and then popping

1238
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,760
straight back up because the amount of energy required to do that is enormous.

1239
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,280
Beyond our capability.

1240
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:27,280
Well, certainly beyond our capability now. And so when you see that and you have the data,

1241
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:31,120
and it's not just looking at it, it's hyperspectral data and there's other ways

1242
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:35,600
to collect information besides the human eye. I remember that's only 0.0036% of the

1243
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:39,600
spectrum, right? That's a little narrow window. Let's get a big window here. Let's get all the

1244
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:44,080
data, baby. Give me all the frequencies and I want to see everything. That's when you have

1245
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:50,000
something really special because sometimes they say seeing is believing, but your eyes can fool

1246
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:56,400
you. Look, you're a magician. I mean, this is your trade. Sleight of hand, making something appear

1247
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:02,880
to be one thing when it's really something else. So we need more data points. We need data to

1248
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:08,640
include beyond the visible spectrum. And that can tell you a lot. It can tell you heat, right?

1249
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:14,080
Things like infrared and what something is even made out of because depending on the trail and

1250
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:18,240
the color, just like we look at a star and we can tell there's a planet around it. Why? Because we

1251
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:22,480
can tell actually the atmosphere of that planet and what it's composed of because as light from

1252
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:26,560
that star travels through it and then eventually hits earth in our eyes, we can say, oh, that

1253
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,720
planet is primarily nitrogen or that planet is primarily hydrogen. That planet is composed of

1254
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:37,680
methane because the light behaves, it's absorbed by the type of gas. And so when you see something

1255
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:41,040
coming in and out, and if there happens to be a trail on it, you can look at that and you can

1256
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:47,200
analyze, okay, this thing is, this is what it's comprised of because of the color, because of the

1257
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:52,320
length, because of the heat, all sorts of different things. So without giving away specific capabilities

1258
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:56,880
here, hyperspectral technology can be very, very informative. It can tell you a lot more than just

1259
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:01,040
simply seeing something on a camera. And so those are the ones that really get very compelling.

1260
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,880
Especially when you also have footage.

1261
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,320
Especially when you also have footage.

1262
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:10,720
When you, I mean, when you see, when you like, when you browse stuff and you're,

1263
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:18,160
and you're shown things online, are you ever just like meh because of what you've seen?

1264
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:21,360
But that's, listen, but that's not because it's not compelling. It's because I've been

1265
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,960
desensitized. Because you've been desensitized.

1266
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:27,840
I have, right. It's just like, you know, a cop who comes across a crime scene and people are like,

1267
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,000
oh my God, that's horrific. It's like, meh. Okay.

1268
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,960
You know, it's, and it's unfortunate because that's just the reality of us. It's just like

1269
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:39,040
anybody who watches shows and horror shows on movies, you know, someone might say, oh,

1270
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:42,320
I don't like watching horror. That's disgusting. Someone says, that's not really that bad.

1271
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:43,840
It, you get desensitized.

1272
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:47,520
It's like a magic trick. It's like knowing how a magic trick works. And it's funny because

1273
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:52,160
I actually got to ask Bob Lazar that question. And he said, for the same reason he said,

1274
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:58,880
it's exactly like a magic trick. Why doesn't the government talk about Bob Lazar?

1275
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:04,400
Well, probably why they don't talk about me. I can imagine, you know, we go against the grain.

1276
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:07,440
I've never met Mr. Lazar, to be honest with you and for the record. So people say, well,

1277
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:11,840
what do you think of Lazar? I don't. I have no way to judge. I've never met the gentleman.

1278
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:17,920
You know, I think he's saying his truth, whatever that truth may be, just like I'm saying mine.

1279
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:18,420
Sure.

1280
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:23,120
You know, but look, the government has spent a lot of time doing the same thing to me. When

1281
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:26,640
I first came out, they even denied that ATIP was real. They even denied that I was part of it,

1282
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:30,320
right? They're like, I think somebody even accused, it wasn't even at the Pentagon. I'm like,

1283
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:35,040
dude, are you kidding me? There's my desk. You know, there's a safe that's got all the stuff in

1284
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:41,120
it. So I suspect if he's enduring the same thing, it'd be for the same reasons that

1285
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:44,240
they tried to obfuscate. You know, there's a saying we have,

1286
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:51,040
first of all, you deny everything, you admit nothing, and then you make counter accusations,

1287
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:57,760
right? And so there is this spectrum of efforts that happen when there's an inconvenient

1288
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:01,120
conversation to have in a government. The first thing you do is they deny it. And then when they

1289
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:06,720
can't deny it anymore, you know, they'll start trying to take away someone's credibility,

1290
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:11,840
like they do with Dave Groove, 24 hours of him coming out. And this, by the way, is American

1291
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:16,160
here. This guy, I worked with him at Space Force. He is exactly who he is. We had the same briefings

1292
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:21,440
together. We saw the same UAP data, right? So he comes out and says the truth. And within 24 hours,

1293
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:26,800
two guys from CIA leak medical data and try to use his PTSD against him. Now, how disgusting is

1294
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:31,840
that, right? And totally, by the way, if I were to go ahead into government and release someone's

1295
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:38,960
private data, I'd go to jail. That's HIPAA violation. Also, there's PII information there,

1296
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,520
personal identifiable information there. There's medical, radical.

1297
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,960
It's being doxed by the government.

1298
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:48,800
That's being doxed by the government. Shame on you. And you wonder why people are pissed.

1299
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:54,080
You wonder why people like me do what I do. That's why. Because that to me, let me,

1300
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:59,440
this is a, you're getting to a point now in this conversation that is very near and dear to my

1301
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:04,720
heart. And I want to share something with you. A lot of people know in my book, I talk about my

1302
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:09,360
mother passing away. And no, I'm not plugging the book. That's not why I'm here. I'm just simply

1303
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:14,080
saying that people know that because I was forthcoming about it. What some people may not

1304
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:21,280
know and I only just started talking about it was the death of my father. My father was a

1305
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:24,880
revolutionary in Cuba. He was part of the Bay of Pigs. In fact, if you type in my name and type

1306
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:29,680
in the word Bay of Pigs, you'll see his prisoner number. And he was a tortured and tormented soul

1307
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:37,040
because of it. But his later years, he got, he became very introspective. And so about a month

1308
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:42,880
before he passed away, he passed away two years ago on Father's Day, I had the opportunity. I knew

1309
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:47,120
he was dying, but he wouldn't tell me, but I could tell he was dying. And I knew my time was limited.

1310
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:50,960
So he came out to visit me and we had an opportunity to take a road trip together.

1311
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,480
So we're going to drive back down to South Florida together. And about halfway through the trip,

1312
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:59,200
I asked him a question and I look back and I feel kind of guilty about it because

1313
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:06,480
I was kind of flippant, not expecting the answer that I got. And I said, Dad, what is the greatest

1314
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:14,080
threat to humanity? Now I'm thinking to myself, is it a natural calamity, an earthquake? Is it a

1315
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:21,360
nuclear war? Is it a biological pandemic like COVID was? And he looks at me and he says,

1316
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:28,400
thought about it for a second, he says, corruption. Corruption? I said like financial corruption? He

1317
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:35,440
says, no son, corruption. Corruption in any form is the act of trading away one of your core values

1318
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:40,800
in exchange for something else. And whether it's religious corruption, moral corruption,

1319
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:47,600
governmental corruption, if you have corruption in government, then what winds up happening is

1320
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:54,240
you wind up chipping away, eroding the very foundation of a democracy. And when that occurs,

1321
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:58,720
it's a very, very quick and slippery slope down to total tyranny. And it's something my father

1322
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:06,000
actually had direct experience in. And so when you have in the government, corruption and people

1323
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,560
making decisions that they don't have the authority to make for reasons that they don't

1324
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:17,040
have the authority to even consider, and doing things like they did to Dave Groosh and myself

1325
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:23,360
and other people, that's a problem. Because now the entire democracy is at risk. This is not just,

1326
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:29,120
hey, the government trying to insulate us. Hey man, you're now going beyond the constitution here,

1327
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:32,960
which is something we all agree with. And you're telling me now the constitution doesn't matter

1328
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:37,200
and that I have to play by the rules and you don't. Hey buddy, I don't know if you remember,

1329
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:41,840
but 1776 happened. People have a vote and if you think that they're going to sit here and

1330
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:45,840
tolerate corruption, there's an old saying from Bob Marley, you can fool some people sometimes,

1331
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:50,720
but you can't fool all the people all the time. And if you think you're going to do that, brother,

1332
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:54,480
that's not the government I signed up for. That's not the constitution I signed up for. I didn't go

1333
01:58:54,480 --> 01:59:00,400
to war to allow you to do that. Because now, don't look now, but you're the enemy, right?

1334
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:08,000
And they have hijacked what the values of our country are and they're making decisions they

1335
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,760
don't have the authority to make. When they're not informing Congress, they're not informing

1336
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:18,560
the president and they're lying, that's a problem. You can justify it all day long. I don't give a

1337
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:24,160
crap what your answer is. It's still wrong. There are laws and things you have to abide by. And so

1338
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:31,520
when you see that action of people trying to defame somebody, that is egregious. And to me,

1339
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:40,240
look out, because you're now going into a territory here, into some very dangerous waters,

1340
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:48,400
that you're doing things that are against the very ethos of what it means to be a free society.

1341
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:51,840
And you don't have that permission. And by the way, I went to war for it before. Don't think

1342
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:58,240
I'll do it again. Our Congress and our executive branch deserves better. And if you are some mid

1343
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:01,840
level bureaucrat making decisions on behalf of the president and Congress for which you're not

1344
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:08,640
allowed to make, watch out, baby. You're going to have some serious explaining to do, as we like to

1345
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:18,400
say. Yeah. And rightfully so. I think the pursuit of that, and especially in defense of people who

1346
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:25,200
have given up something for the freedom of people and the freedom of choice that people have,

1347
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:33,440
I think it should be valued and protected and upheld to a standard that I think most people

1348
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:37,920
should be on board with. I think that just goes with that saying. It's egregious, like you said.

1349
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:45,040
I mean, I'm going to have to ask 2027. No, I don't want people to keep saying 2027.

1350
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:50,240
Oh, Lou said 2027. No, I never said 2027. Stop, guys. I never said that. You know what happens

1351
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:55,200
is people in the internet have got way too much time on their hands. They will clip together

1352
02:00:55,200 --> 02:01:02,800
interviews I have to create a false narrative. Okay. So let me know, then what is it? Bledsoe

1353
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:08,960
says, Bledsoe has a hard date, by the way. He says Easter Sunday, 2026 is like his date.

1354
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:15,520
I've heard people say 2025 is when we begin this, whatever. And it's obviously,

1355
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:22,080
the gold post is going to shift depending on what's been said. Recently, Jeremy Corbell,

1356
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:30,480
in his special and his three-part special, at the end of it said that the government was intending

1357
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:37,600
on having some mass siting or like a giant mothership come in and that this is going to

1358
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:45,520
happen and then 2027 has been thrown around. Can you, for everyone's sanity, shed a little

1359
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:51,200
bit of light on this just so we can stop being paranoid or we can start being paranoid?

1360
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:54,880
Let me see if I can thread the needle on this.

1361
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:56,720
Sure. Take your time.

1362
02:01:56,720 --> 02:02:01,360
I know a lot of people, this is nothing new. There's entire religions that are

1363
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:04,080
that plan for doomsday, right? The end of the world is coming. Then you have,

1364
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:07,920
oh, this is Y2K and then, oh, it's the end of the Aztec calendar, right?

1365
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:24,320
Now, there is some speculation and I won't say specifics that there may be something later on,

1366
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:30,880
but the problem is I wouldn't go to the bank with it and what the specifics are because it's,

1367
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:38,160
first of all, it's hearsay and it also was, yes, there was an official effort by some people in

1368
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:43,760
the government to actually look at this data and there were some products produced. That's a fact.

1369
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:50,800
I won't go into more detail on that, but it wasn't 2027 and it was based upon certain observations.

1370
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:56,400
I'm very careful because what I don't want to do is people are going to take this,

1371
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:59,200
they're going to hang on to these words and say, Lou says something's coming.

1372
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,640
No, I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that there were some people who were

1373
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:09,040
anticipating something happening and it was officially considered by some people

1374
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:16,160
based upon certain things and a product was written. Anything beyond that, I don't want

1375
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:22,000
to discuss because I think what happens is people take that and they take it to the bank

1376
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:26,880
and that's very dangerous. You don't want to give any credence to something that could be untrue.

1377
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:31,040
Anything could happen. A tornado could hit your studio in 10 minutes from now. It could.

1378
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:36,000
It probably won't, but it could. We have to be very careful. There's no such thing as absolute.

1379
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:42,160
But it's when you say something was observed that people's ears tend to perk up.

1380
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:46,240
Yeah. I can't go into more detail than that because, first of all, I didn't collect the data.

1381
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:53,120
I wasn't part of that effort. Thirdly, that's not really for me to discuss, but I don't think

1382
02:03:53,120 --> 02:04:02,000
people need to panic at the disco. We've been down this road many times before. Let's stop

1383
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:07,760
speculating. Let's stick to what we know and if it turns out that there's a revelation based upon

1384
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:13,600
of us all working together on this, then fine. Maybe this is what it is, but we need to make

1385
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:21,920
sure we don't do ourselves the injustice by predicting and predicating things. I think

1386
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:26,720
that's a dangerous move and I think unless the government comes out and says something,

1387
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:30,800
hey, you need to pay attention to this, then we probably should focus on other things.

1388
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:34,880
Most people would probably agree with me, but if the government did say that,

1389
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:37,200
we might be questioning why they said that. Right. Sure.

1390
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:41,680
That leads me to another question. Do you rule out the idea that you

1391
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:46,320
might be being used to further some type of governmental agenda?

1392
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:55,360
Always. Always. You have to consider that. I have rocked the boat sufficiently and I've made

1393
02:04:55,360 --> 02:05:00,480
decisions that if that was the case, I don't think they would have anticipated. I probably made their

1394
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:05,680
life very, very difficult. If I was supposed to go on some sort of agenda, I think I'd probably

1395
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:11,600
strayed from that agenda a long time ago. I say 2027, but what if this future revelation

1396
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:13,520
is something like that? Then it happens.

1397
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:16,160
You're not immune to that is what you're saying. No.

1398
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:20,400
Look, you don't know what you don't know, right? That's right.

1399
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:24,240
How do you know what you don't know? Is it possible there's some sort of master scheme

1400
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:29,360
there to manipulate Luis Elizondo and a few other insiders to get our message across? It is, but

1401
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,560
I'm also familiar with those techniques and I think I would be able to see at least one telltale.

1402
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:41,280
No one's that good where you can keep the secret forever. It would be really, really hard to do.

1403
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:43,520
Have you ever had disinfo come across your desk?

1404
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:48,960
Not at the Pentagon. Foreign disinformation, sure. That happens a lot,

1405
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,520
but actual disinformation on the UAP topic, not at all.

1406
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:52,080
Not at all.

1407
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:54,880
No, in fact, nobody wanted to talk about it. You're not going to get disinformation.

1408
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:59,040
Disinformation is usually when people are at least talking about something and you want to

1409
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:01,120
affect a decision, but when no one's talking about it-

1410
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:11,040
But you're aware of projects. Are you aware of projects of the UAP narrative being slightly-

1411
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:18,480
Yeah. Look, they did in the 70s. Air Force OSI penetrated civilian organizations in violation of

1412
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:24,240
DOD 5240.1 and other rules and regulations, possibly Executive Order 12333, and conducted

1413
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:29,200
intelligence operations and propaganda and manipulation against the American people.

1414
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:34,080
By the way, what happened two days ago? A document came out from the CIA proposing it's okay to kill

1415
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:38,800
Americans if we want to go ahead and predicate a war and have an excuse to have a war with Cuba

1416
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:47,600
and an invasion. Now think about that for a minute. Who the hell are you to propose killing

1417
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:54,080
American citizens for a political agenda? Dude, that's worthy of a coup, man. Well,

1418
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:59,280
that's not American values. Don't look now, but you've now become the enemy that we all hate.

1419
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:07,200
You don't have the right to do that, and this is what fires me up. There have been some people who

1420
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:13,120
have made suggestions to conduct illegal activities to cover this topic up, and it's going to come

1421
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:20,400
out in a few months. It's just telling you, because I was victim to some of it. When the

1422
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:25,280
American people find out the length that some people in the government are willing to go to

1423
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:32,160
to keep something secret, it's going to blow your mind. Scary. Yeah. Honestly, it's disappointing.

1424
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:40,880
I don't think it's reflective of the government. I think it's people in the government. Let's not

1425
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:45,520
forget, government is made up of people. There are some good people and there are some bad people.

1426
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:51,760
That old saying, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Maybe that's what we're dealing

1427
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:56,880
with. I want to be careful that I'm not accusing the government. I'm not labeling the government

1428
02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:01,760
or mad at the government. What I'm mad at are those rogue elements inside our government

1429
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:06,560
that are making decisions that are not in the best interest of the American people and, frankly,

1430
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:12,480
that are against our constitution. That is what motivates me to continue doing what I'm doing.

1431
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:15,760
If I have to pay the ultimate price for it, then so be it. I knew that a while ago.

1432
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:18,640
Like I've told people, the only thing that's going to stop me is a bullet in the head or

1433
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:25,360
maybe I got hit by a bus or a car accident, which has happened in the past.

1434
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:35,120
But I have to pursue the truth. I think any real patriot who served time serving their country

1435
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:40,240
feels the same way. At the end of the day, we owe it to the American people. We owe it to our

1436
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:44,880
government. There's no excuse why a president wouldn't be briefed on something. There's no

1437
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:51,040
excuse why oversight committees in our Congress can't be briefed to something. That's exactly

1438
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:55,600
what's happened. That's a problem. That's not a reflection. You can't say that's the government's

1439
02:08:55,600 --> 02:09:03,280
fault. No, that's people in the government. It's their fault. There are some people that will go

1440
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:07,840
to great lengths to keep information quiet. And it's not just the people in the government

1441
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:16,160
because what we've seen, I think, more frequently and more rampantly is these people who are working

1442
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:20,640
with the government. Oh, yeah. The proxies and the media, some elements even in the media.

1443
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:25,040
I think those tend to be a little bit more dangerous. Well, we saw this right before

1444
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:29,600
this last election, right? I mean, there are people in the media who knowingly lied about

1445
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:33,280
people. We just had a case, a landmark case against one of our major networks here,

1446
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:37,520
where there was a veteran where they tried to slander and lie about him and defamation.

1447
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:43,760
And he won the case, right? And this is a huge media organization that was super well respected.

1448
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:50,080
And it turns out there were journalists who had an agenda. And then, I mean, look at everybody

1449
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:55,040
who's surprised by it. Nobody, right? Nobody's surprised that the media would go through that

1450
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:59,840
length. But sometimes we are surprised to find out that these other contractors are involved

1451
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:08,800
in things like this, the big ones, the Raytheons, the Lockheeds. I mean, there's a few of them out

1452
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:17,280
there. One in particular, and feel free to answer however you want to answer because you've been

1453
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:22,000
asked about Lockheed in the past. You've been asked about, you know, a lot of people are familiar

1454
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:27,840
with the Wilson Davis memo and all the stuff that went on there about like the inside program and

1455
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:35,040
people doing reverse engineering. What about EG&G? Where did they go?

1456
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:42,000
You know, I'm very careful not to mention companies specifically. I went through a year

1457
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,640
process through the Pentagon to even reveal a few of the names that I did in the book.

1458
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:50,480
And I was given very clear instructions not to deviate from that.

1459
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,640
Because of your association with the Pentagon?

1460
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:58,000
No, because of their association with the Pentagon.

1461
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,440
Because of their association with the Pentagon and that some of these

1462
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,480
companies who've been responsible for doing some not very nice things in the past,

1463
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:10,320
I've been asked to, you know.

1464
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:15,280
Have you, are you aware of EG&G even being part of the picture?

1465
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:20,800
I know the name. I don't want to speculate one way or the other what I might have heard

1466
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:21,440
or what I didn't hear.

1467
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:22,800
Oh, I'm not asking for speculation.

1468
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:27,200
Sure. Yeah, yeah. No, no, I just, my point being is that, look, there's,

1469
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:31,760
anytime you mention, especially in this topic, if I mention a particular name,

1470
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:36,000
there's liability issues, right? And you have to be very, the legal, real legal consequences.

1471
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:41,120
So unless you get it approved by the Pentagon, like I did, you got to be really careful.

1472
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:42,880
You can have the lawyers coming after you.

1473
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:44,880
So you got to be really, really careful.

1474
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:50,800
And, you know, when you're someone like me who I'm living fairly modestly.

1475
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:53,520
Isn't that convenient for the government though?

1476
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:56,880
Like, I mean, it seems like, it seems to me,

1477
02:11:57,760 --> 02:12:00,400
because these private corporations are protected.

1478
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:02,000
They are protected.

1479
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,120
We're not allowed to knock on their doors to find out what they're working on

1480
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:12,560
because it's private, it's got IP that we don't have access to.

1481
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:16,480
And so legally, and there is that fine line of like, well, I mean,

1482
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:20,880
then you can just knock on anybody's door and take anybody's technology and proprietary,

1483
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:21,680
you know, information.

1484
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:27,360
But in this specific case, which is why, you know, people are trying to pass this UAP act

1485
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:31,040
and trying to see that, like, hey, if there is recovered technology,

1486
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:32,640
then we should have access to it.

1487
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,120
Right.

1488
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:36,080
Congress should be aware of it and et cetera.

1489
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:43,600
But the fact is that there is a law preventing us from doing that.

1490
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:47,360
It seems to me that that's a very convenient law.

1491
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:53,920
Well, and this is part of the double-edged sort of any capitalistic society, right?

1492
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:56,960
You have free and fair competition until you don't, right?

1493
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:59,280
And so in theory, everything is free and fair competition,

1494
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:02,080
and that needs to be protected, and I understand that.

1495
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:04,800
You know, I'll tell you something fascinating here.

1496
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:08,960
Do you know where the word corporation comes from?

1497
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:11,280
I've never thought of it.

1498
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,680
Corpus, meaning body.

1499
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:14,080
Body.

1500
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:19,040
In the United States, you can actually, when you look at the tax laws,

1501
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:22,640
a corporation has the same exact rights as an individual.

1502
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:23,680
Interesting.

1503
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:28,720
And so when you have a lawyers group of lawyers creating this corporation, this corpus,

1504
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:34,080
they're creating a living, breathing entity according to the rules and the rights of our

1505
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:34,480
country.

1506
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:39,760
They have to be recognized as an individual, and so they're afforded the same rights.

1507
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:44,800
And only when the conjurers, the great conjurers, the lawyers come back and they de-establish

1508
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:48,480
a corporation, and it is no longer a living body, right?

1509
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:49,440
It's a living thing.

1510
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:54,320
And even then, there's some rights that translate to that.

1511
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:59,360
People understand that in the United States, corporations have the same rights and privileges

1512
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:00,160
as individuals.

1513
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:02,080
It's just like a human being.

1514
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:03,600
Rights to privacy.

1515
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:05,360
Very convenient.

1516
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:07,760
Well, it can be abused.

1517
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:09,440
It works until it doesn't.

1518
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:11,200
So I want to make this clear.

1519
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:15,680
I understand why, because the US is a capitalist society, and that's how we thrive.

1520
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,520
And we've all agreed to that.

1521
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:20,320
That's our social contract, that this is the type of government we want,

1522
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:21,760
and we want the right to certify.

1523
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:22,400
I have a company.

1524
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:23,840
I want my company to be protected, right?

1525
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:24,560
I don't care what it does.

1526
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:25,360
I want to be protected.

1527
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:27,760
And I want my private information to stay private.

1528
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:28,160
Right.

1529
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:29,760
So that's not a bad thing.

1530
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:34,000
The problem is when it's abused, and there are some gray areas, and that's why you have

1531
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,720
rules and regulations on how corporations, whether it's S Corp, C Corp, LLC, and I'm

1532
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:44,160
not going to go into a class here about corporations, but it's something I know a little bit about

1533
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:45,920
because I was involved in it.

1534
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:48,000
And so we have to respect that.

1535
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,960
And then when you have a corporation, just like a human being that's got security

1536
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:54,960
clearances, that's working on national security type issues, they're even more protected,

1537
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:55,280
right?

1538
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:58,640
Because we don't want adversaries to get a hold of that technology, which is, again,

1539
02:14:58,640 --> 02:14:59,520
understandable.

1540
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:00,480
I get it.

1541
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:04,160
The problem is when people in those corporations, not the corporation itself, people in the

1542
02:15:04,160 --> 02:15:08,240
corporation are making decisions, just like people in the government are making decisions

1543
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:15,680
that are not consistent with the ethics and expectations that we have in these organizations.

1544
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:18,000
For monetary gain and power, mostly.

1545
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:18,500
Correct.

1546
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:24,260
Okay, I got maybe a couple questions left, and then we're going to hop into the questions

1547
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:26,420
from the interns, if that's all right.

1548
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:27,540
You've been great so far.

1549
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:29,860
Thank you so much for sticking through this with me.

1550
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:30,360
Sure.

1551
02:15:32,020 --> 02:15:33,300
Coffee helps, by the way.

1552
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:34,740
I can get you another one here shortly.

1553
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:36,680
Okay.

1554
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:42,180
There is a documentary coming out that you've been a part of that we just saw that's been

1555
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:44,900
making the rounds, The Age of Disclosure.

1556
02:15:45,700 --> 02:15:47,060
It seems like a big one.

1557
02:15:47,060 --> 02:15:49,620
It seems like a Dobs or Dream team.

1558
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:53,860
There's a lot of people in that lineup.

1559
02:15:55,540 --> 02:16:00,020
Can you shed any light on what's to be expected in this documentary?

1560
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:00,820
I haven't seen it yet.

1561
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:02,980
I'm very eager for it to come out.

1562
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:07,220
I have been part of facilitating a lot of the people who are in that movie to come forward.

1563
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:11,780
It's been a long project, probably about three years now.

1564
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:16,260
It's been done, as most people now know, Sub Rosa, in secret.

1565
02:16:17,060 --> 02:16:20,260
Because it's very important, and there's people that are being interviewed that have

1566
02:16:20,260 --> 02:16:21,620
never come out publicly on this topic.

1567
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:22,900
That we've not seen on the trailer.

1568
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:24,420
We've not seen on the trailer.

1569
02:16:25,940 --> 02:16:27,780
I think people can expect...

1570
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:28,260
You know what?

1571
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:29,220
People are funny, right?

1572
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:32,900
Some people come back and say, wow, this is the definitive documentary.

1573
02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:35,060
And then other people come out and say, meh.

1574
02:16:35,060 --> 02:16:35,940
Nothing burger.

1575
02:16:35,940 --> 02:16:39,220
Yeah, because you're not meeting their expectations, right?

1576
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:39,720
Sure.

1577
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:42,980
And so I'm very, very...

1578
02:16:42,980 --> 02:16:46,020
What I think it does, it certainly moves the needle in the right direction.

1579
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:51,940
Everything I try to do is to move the needle in the right direction.

1580
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:58,820
I think this film project is another example of some very brave Americans coming forward.

1581
02:16:58,820 --> 02:16:59,780
First-hand witnesses?

1582
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:03,620
I don't want to give too much away.

1583
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:05,300
I'll let the audience decide for themselves.

1584
02:17:06,180 --> 02:17:08,420
I want to be very careful what I say and what I don't say.

1585
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:13,300
But I do believe it's going to change the conversation irrevocably.

1586
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:16,420
And I'm very excited for it to come out.

1587
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:20,020
Are you aware of any new footage of UAP or NHI being featured?

1588
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:23,700
I can't discuss the details of the film, like I said.

1589
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:25,300
I have to ask on behalf of the audience.

1590
02:17:25,300 --> 02:17:25,780
Yeah, sure.

1591
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:31,060
I have not seen the film in its complete form,

1592
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:38,340
but you have some very, very significant information in that documentary.

1593
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:41,140
Jay Stratton says...

1594
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:42,180
Not just Jay.

1595
02:17:42,180 --> 02:17:44,820
Okay, well, I mean, that is interesting.

1596
02:17:44,820 --> 02:17:48,900
But Jay Stratton does say that he has seen an NHI.

1597
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:54,660
Do you know what he's referring to?

1598
02:17:56,260 --> 02:17:57,780
I do, but you have to talk to Jay about that.

1599
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:00,500
I don't like speaking on other people's behalf.

1600
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:00,740
Okay.

1601
02:18:00,740 --> 02:18:02,340
You've probably noticed that in other interviews.

1602
02:18:03,380 --> 02:18:04,740
I'm not a kiss and tell kind of guy.

1603
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:09,540
And I'm the kind of guy that if people want to throw rocks at me for that, that's fine.

1604
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:12,100
No, I respect that, actually.

1605
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:13,860
I think that's probably the best move there.

1606
02:18:14,820 --> 02:18:18,180
But is it safe to assume that you know what he's talking about?

1607
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:22,180
I don't like to presume or assume anything.

1608
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:22,420
Great.

1609
02:18:22,980 --> 02:18:23,540
Just have to...

1610
02:18:24,660 --> 02:18:26,980
Have you yourself seen NHI?

1611
02:18:30,820 --> 02:18:32,980
Let's just share that one for a little later.

1612
02:18:33,860 --> 02:18:35,380
Little later, like after this airs?

1613
02:18:37,540 --> 02:18:38,180
Maybe never.

1614
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:38,420
No.

1615
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:45,940
Again, I am very restricted on what I can say and how I say it from the government.

1616
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:47,700
I still am very loyal American.

1617
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:56,340
This conversation is continuing and I think more will be forthcoming in time.

1618
02:18:58,740 --> 02:18:59,700
And I'll leave it at that.

1619
02:19:01,060 --> 02:19:03,300
Can I ask one more about that?

1620
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:04,580
You can ask whatever you want.

1621
02:19:04,580 --> 02:19:05,860
Because that's the one I want to know.

1622
02:19:09,140 --> 02:19:12,980
How can I phrase this in a way that you can answer this?

1623
02:19:19,940 --> 02:19:23,460
Are you aware of more than one type of NHI?

1624
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:29,940
Let me see how I can answer this.

1625
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:47,220
Accuracy is very important.

1626
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:59,540
Being aware of is not necessarily the same as having proof of.

1627
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:02,180
Roger.

1628
02:20:03,460 --> 02:20:05,300
Some people, let me give you a case.

1629
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:07,060
By the way, even that proof of doesn't...

1630
02:20:07,060 --> 02:20:08,500
Even there's a double-edged sword with that.

1631
02:20:09,060 --> 02:20:11,380
There's people that will say the earth is flat.

1632
02:20:11,380 --> 02:20:12,100
They're flat earthers.

1633
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:13,620
No matter what you tell them, earth is flat.

1634
02:20:13,620 --> 02:20:15,860
The fact that the earth is round is not a truth for them.

1635
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:21,460
When ancient sailors used to talk about sea monsters in the great ocean,

1636
02:20:21,460 --> 02:20:25,220
Pacific and the Atlantic, and people said, well, that's not true.

1637
02:20:25,220 --> 02:20:26,340
That's just their observation.

1638
02:20:26,340 --> 02:20:30,100
And it turns out that there are blue whales and great white sharks and giant squid.

1639
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:35,700
It was just our interpretation at the time that made it difficult.

1640
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:36,740
We said, these are monsters.

1641
02:20:36,740 --> 02:20:39,860
Well, the reason why people didn't believe in them because we call them monsters.

1642
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:44,100
She said, hey, look, there's a giant mammal out there that looks like a dolphin,

1643
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:45,300
but it just got a lot bigger.

1644
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:50,340
That's different than saying there's a giant monster out there that does this and that.

1645
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:56,340
I know I'm being evasive on this and I'm trying to answer your question without...

1646
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:59,060
Well, what I'm gathering from this is

1647
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:03,140
there are potential that some of these NHI might look a lot like us.

1648
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:06,420
That's certainly potential.

1649
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:09,780
We do camouflaging all the time.

1650
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:14,020
And as I mentioned on another interview some time ago,

1651
02:21:15,140 --> 02:21:18,740
you can go to a zoo in Beijing right now to the panda exhibit,

1652
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:22,020
and you'll see that the zookeepers wear these fuzzy little panda suits.

1653
02:21:22,580 --> 02:21:27,700
And they do that because they don't want to perturb or disturb the pandas in their

1654
02:21:27,700 --> 02:21:28,820
local environment.

1655
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:30,820
And so they feed them and they do whatever they do,

1656
02:21:30,820 --> 02:21:32,660
but they have to wear a panda suit to do it.

1657
02:21:32,660 --> 02:21:33,700
Now, is that a panda?

1658
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:34,340
No, it's not a panda.

1659
02:21:34,340 --> 02:21:36,980
It's a human, badly acting as a panda.

1660
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:40,020
And probably the pandas realize it, but maybe they say, I'm getting food.

1661
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:41,140
I don't care anyways.

1662
02:21:41,140 --> 02:21:42,580
But it's an attempt to blend in.

1663
02:21:45,380 --> 02:21:49,060
In intelligence, camouflage, and I don't mean camouflage,

1664
02:21:49,060 --> 02:21:51,700
necessarily physical camouflage like in a military unit.

1665
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:56,180
I mean mental camouflage.

1666
02:21:56,180 --> 02:22:01,540
The ability to assimilate into an organization or a society is very important.

1667
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:03,300
And that's how spies work.

1668
02:22:03,300 --> 02:22:05,300
Spies do their job because they're like a magician.

1669
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:08,340
They get away with doing things that most people don't perceive or see.

1670
02:22:09,860 --> 02:22:13,460
And it's a way for us to protect ourselves and to do things.

1671
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:18,420
So it's not unusual.

1672
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:21,700
You know, I want to give you an example, and I might get in trouble for this.

1673
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:29,780
So there are certain circumstances in the military where military personnel

1674
02:22:29,780 --> 02:22:32,340
don't advertise their affiliation with the government.

1675
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:37,140
It doesn't say U.S. Army and Sergeant Johnson on there.

1676
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:39,460
They go in with sterile uniforms, and they do that for a reason.

1677
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:47,620
Because they don't want the affiliation of a formal government

1678
02:22:48,420 --> 02:22:49,460
entity to be known.

1679
02:22:50,980 --> 02:22:54,420
That in itself is a form of camouflage, blending in with the society.

1680
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:57,220
Army special forces do this all the time when they go into a country to train

1681
02:22:57,220 --> 02:23:00,740
individuals in weapons tactics and things like that.

1682
02:23:00,740 --> 02:23:03,380
You don't advertise, I'm a special forces guy, right?

1683
02:23:03,380 --> 02:23:05,140
They got the long shaggy beard for a reason.

1684
02:23:05,140 --> 02:23:06,500
Because they don't want to look military.

1685
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:10,020
They're wearing civilian clothes and jeans and carrying a Kalashnikov for a reason.

1686
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:11,460
Without getting into a lot of detail, right?

1687
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:22,020
So is it a hard idea to say, well, look, if something is visiting us,

1688
02:23:22,900 --> 02:23:24,100
would it want to blend in?

1689
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:28,260
There's certainly an argument for that.

1690
02:23:28,820 --> 02:23:32,900
Oh, okay.

1691
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:35,060
There's an argument for that.

1692
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:49,620
Is there evidence pointing to that being the case?

1693
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:52,580
Not proof.

1694
02:23:53,620 --> 02:23:54,740
Let me stay on the fence with that.

1695
02:23:54,980 --> 02:24:00,260
Because again, knowing how people are predisposed to take information and

1696
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:05,060
run to the hills, Lou Elizondo confirms the existence of hybrids, right?

1697
02:24:05,060 --> 02:24:06,180
That's what I'm trying to avoid.

1698
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:07,300
Because Lou Elizondo is not-

1699
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:08,260
You said it, not me.

1700
02:24:08,260 --> 02:24:08,820
Yeah, I know.

1701
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:11,780
Lou Elizondo is not confirming the existence of hybrids for the record.

1702
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:12,100
Okay.

1703
02:24:12,100 --> 02:24:12,660
You heard that.

1704
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:15,140
But I'm saying, is it a possibility?

1705
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:16,900
Sure, it's a possibility.

1706
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:21,780
Camouflage is not just a human thing.

1707
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,540
Animals in the wild do it.

1708
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:25,140
Fish do it.

1709
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:28,340
Lizards and chameleons do it.

1710
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:33,540
It's part of our natural ability to blend in.

1711
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:36,100
If you ever want to see a master of disguise, look at an octopus.

1712
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:38,020
They do it for survival.

1713
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:44,500
People say, well, you have to be a smart thing in order to try to camouflage and blend in.

1714
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:45,380
Not necessarily.

1715
02:24:45,380 --> 02:24:46,100
That's not true.

1716
02:24:46,820 --> 02:24:48,740
No, camouflage is seen throughout.

1717
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:51,140
There's a reason why my background is microbiology and immunology.

1718
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:52,260
Let me give you a perfect example.

1719
02:24:53,140 --> 02:25:03,380
There are parasites and there are microorganisms that are parasitic that mimic healthy human tissue

1720
02:25:03,380 --> 02:25:05,860
to evade the autoimmune response.

1721
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:10,420
And these are bacteria that will have brains and high functioning thought processes like we do.

1722
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:18,980
This is at a very basic elemental scale of our reality, of nature.

1723
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:25,060
Nature is a master of mimicry, and there's a reason why even plants

1724
02:25:26,740 --> 02:25:30,020
will sometimes have attributes that mimic other plants.

1725
02:25:30,020 --> 02:25:31,700
Yeah, but we're not talking about plants.

1726
02:25:31,700 --> 02:25:34,900
Well, in a greater context, I'm trying to answer your question with that answer.

1727
02:25:36,180 --> 02:25:42,100
Is that a distinctly earth thing or is that any form of life that evolves to a certain point

1728
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:45,700
uses camouflage to blend in?

1729
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:48,500
And we don't have that answer, but it's something that's being proposed.

1730
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:50,100
It's something that's being looked into.

1731
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:52,100
It's certainly something that has been discussed.

1732
02:25:54,100 --> 02:26:00,020
But obviously, as someone who's in this topic, you're also aware of the other kind,

1733
02:26:00,020 --> 02:26:08,660
the one that's a little bit more blatant in terms of observation of not being from here.

1734
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:15,300
Are there images or videos of these beings?

1735
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:23,140
I don't want people to take this the wrong way, so I'm going to abstain from that answer,

1736
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:26,580
and it's not because I'm trying to be evasive and be like, oh, Luke confirmed. No, I didn't.

1737
02:26:28,020 --> 02:26:30,580
There's a very specific reason why I'm on the fence with this.

1738
02:26:31,620 --> 02:26:38,100
I'm hoping it becomes more apparent soon, but I'm very careful not to commit one way or the other.

1739
02:26:39,460 --> 02:26:40,580
Have I heard it? Yeah, of course.

1740
02:26:41,540 --> 02:26:44,420
People that I trust and know and have had the conversation, yes.

1741
02:26:46,100 --> 02:26:51,620
But I also haven't myself experienced that, so for me to say yes or no,

1742
02:26:53,220 --> 02:26:57,220
so what I'm doing is proposing if people are having trouble understanding the question,

1743
02:26:57,220 --> 02:26:59,940
they only have to look at Mother Nature to see countless examples

1744
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,980
where biology does it for them automatically.

1745
02:27:02,980 --> 02:27:09,700
So is it that much of a stretch to, we have stealth aircraft right now that can be confused

1746
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:14,740
as a bird because of its radar profile and radar return, and we do that on purpose.

1747
02:27:19,140 --> 02:27:24,900
Camouflage is something that is animals, all life forms, on Earth at least,

1748
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:30,180
have been using that in mimicry since the beginning for survival.

1749
02:27:30,820 --> 02:27:34,420
Okay. We'll get off the NHI stuff. Thank you for answering those questions.

1750
02:27:34,420 --> 02:27:37,540
I know I didn't answer it. Your audience is going to be really pissing me for that.

1751
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:47,460
I mean, I think your reluctance to answer some of these questions provides us with enough

1752
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:54,580
information, and I'm not going to assume anything, but I'm going to say that this topic is being

1753
02:27:54,580 --> 02:28:00,020
taken seriously. All options are on the table until they're not.

1754
02:28:00,020 --> 02:28:06,900
Yeah. When it comes to pilots, obviously, you guys are thinking about that. Obviously,

1755
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:12,820
there's a department that is all about the pilots. If you're the nuts and bolts guy,

1756
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:16,340
someone else is the pilot guy or girl.

1757
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:20,580
Consider me more of an airframe kind of guy.

1758
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:26,500
Okay. Airframe kind of guy. Okay. Makes sense. But I mean, even your background in microbiology

1759
02:28:26,500 --> 02:28:32,900
does make it really interesting because- I know. I've had a lot of people approach me

1760
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:35,700
about that like, come on, it's not a coincidence on your background.

1761
02:28:36,660 --> 02:28:41,860
Because there was another 4chan whistleblower who claimed to be a microbiologist and he had,

1762
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:46,260
I mean, this is something I could maybe run by you eventually and have you look at what he wrote,

1763
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:57,860
but he basically dissected a gray alien and says he was at, what was the, I forget the location,

1764
02:28:57,860 --> 02:29:09,140
but essentially took these grays and from eyes to mouths to nose to the pores on their skin that's

1765
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:13,620
to create this like ammonia type stuff to the forefingers and the entire being.

1766
02:29:14,820 --> 02:29:20,100
This was posted to Reddit and this is a massive file. It's very complex to look at. I've shown

1767
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:29,940
it to experiencers and to abductees and it seems to coincide with all of the red flags that they've

1768
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:38,820
perceived as well. I would expect there at least to be, is there a department that is looking into

1769
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:47,940
just NHI? Without getting into trouble, let me ask you a question. Sure.

1770
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:56,580
Let's say hypothetically, you're doing something and one of your vehicles crashes and so what do

1771
02:29:56,580 --> 02:30:00,900
we do? We do a recovery mission where we go and say, okay, we're going to recover our craft and

1772
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:07,380
get the pilot out of there. How would you feel if when you get back and not only has the plane been

1773
02:30:07,380 --> 02:30:12,740
taken away, but when you say, well, how's our pilot? They say, oh, yeah, about that. We chopped

1774
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:20,580
them up into a bunch of pieces and studied them. Okay. What you're saying is that there's nothing

1775
02:30:20,580 --> 02:30:29,940
left to give back. How would you feel about that? What would the reaction be? Again, I'm a nuts and

1776
02:30:29,940 --> 02:30:35,700
bolts guy. I'm not a biological guy. You're saying that's not a good thing to put out there.

1777
02:30:36,260 --> 02:30:44,740
Probably not because how would you feel if you're out in the jungles and one of your buddy's

1778
02:30:44,740 --> 02:30:50,420
helicopters crashes and it turns out that the natives not only dismantled your helicopter,

1779
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:55,780
but wound up chopping up the pilot into a thousand pieces and, oops, sorry about that.

1780
02:30:58,660 --> 02:31:02,820
Yeah, that's a whole other can of worms. If that turns out to be potentially the case,

1781
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:10,340
if it turns out to be the case, that's not a great way to have diplomacy.

1782
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:19,700
Right. Understood. Yeah. Okay. Interesting stuff, man. All right. We're going to get to some

1783
02:31:19,700 --> 02:31:24,180
questions from the interns. Probably a little lighter. All right. Hold on a second. Let me

1784
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:30,100
prepare myself. I'm a Gemini like long walks on the beach, pina coladas. Okay. Let me turn on this

1785
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:35,380
camera. And while I set up the other camera, I thought it was interesting that we were sitting

1786
02:31:35,380 --> 02:31:42,580
with the person who's partially responsible for turning the term UFO into UAP officially.

1787
02:31:42,580 --> 02:31:49,860
So I thought it might be time to make UAP UFO again. You can pick these hats up at area52.shop.

1788
02:31:53,940 --> 02:31:59,460
Hey, this is actually funny because it kind of has to do with what we were just talking about.

1789
02:31:59,460 --> 02:32:02,820
Okay. Oh, that's cool. Survey says.

1790
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:12,180
Your Q I think is supposed to be an S. Oh yeah, it could be. What does it say here? Oh yeah.

1791
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:19,460
Do you believe any sort of cohabitation between our species and the alien species exists?

1792
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:32,900
And this is from 0811. Correct, sir. So to 0811, let me throw this at you.

1793
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:41,060
Most anthropologists agree that modern human species, homo sapiens sapiens has been around

1794
02:32:41,060 --> 02:32:45,860
between 200 to 400,000 years. Our earth is roughly four and a half billion years old,

1795
02:32:46,660 --> 02:32:55,620
according to most scientists and geologists. And so we have really only been around in modern form

1796
02:32:55,620 --> 02:33:01,300
for a very short period of time. And we've only been looking to the heavens with technology to

1797
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:07,620
actually allow us to look and only been off this planet for the last 60 years, right? Out of that

1798
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:14,500
400,000 years. And we've always been asking the question, are we alone? And we know life here on

1799
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:18,100
earth is prolific. It's everywhere. It's all the places we never expected to be. It's miles

1800
02:33:18,100 --> 02:33:23,780
beneath the Arctic ice. It's in the bottom of the ocean by the black smokers. There's life forms

1801
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:28,020
that every time we try to define what life is, mother nature wiggles her way out of the box.

1802
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:33,220
There was a time when I was taught that all life derived from photosynthesis. Turns out that's not

1803
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:36,340
true. Go to the bottom of the ocean. There's animals and critters that live off something

1804
02:33:36,340 --> 02:33:42,260
called chemosynthesis around the black smokers, these very, very hot upwellings of water and

1805
02:33:42,260 --> 02:33:47,940
minerals in deep oceans. There's bacteria that can live on the skin of the ISS space station,

1806
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:51,220
where the radiation levels are through the roof in the extremes of temperature, right?

1807
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:59,220
Every time we try to put mother nature in a box, we learn that we're wrong. And so in our quest to

1808
02:33:59,220 --> 02:34:07,940
find intelligent life in the universe, in all that time, is it possible that life found us first?

1809
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:13,380
Is it possible that because the same way we detect planets with their atmosphere,

1810
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:18,020
someone detected us and said, hey, that's a really special little planet out there.

1811
02:34:18,020 --> 02:34:25,460
We need to figure out what that's about. And it's not that this cohabitation of our species

1812
02:34:25,460 --> 02:34:30,980
is something recent. Is it possible there's a long history of there? In fact, when we were

1813
02:34:30,980 --> 02:34:36,100
proto-humans, is it possible that some sort of advanced species was already observing us?

1814
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:41,140
Mm-hmm. The universe is very old. Even the Earth being four and a half billion years old,

1815
02:34:42,180 --> 02:34:48,660
the universe is much older. We're a third, maybe fourth generation star system, which means the

1816
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:53,700
stuff that made our star came from another star, which came from a supernova, which before that

1817
02:34:53,700 --> 02:35:01,300
became from a hypernova, which before that became from... So even our Earth is relatively young in

1818
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:07,220
the scale of the universe. Is it possible that in our attempts to find intelligent life out in

1819
02:35:07,220 --> 02:35:12,340
the cosmos that it has found us first? I think it's certainly possible. In fact, I think it's

1820
02:35:13,700 --> 02:35:23,700
more than likely. Yeah, we are not alone. Okay, next question here. Let's see how this one goes.

1821
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:37,940
Cattle and human manipulations. Mutilations.

1822
02:35:37,940 --> 02:35:43,940
Yeah, mutilations, right? Cattle and human mutilations don't seem to get discussed.

1823
02:35:44,660 --> 02:35:48,420
What's your take on this? And this is from Sensubin?

1824
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:56,260
Yeah. Sensubin, okay. We know of the observables in the Pentagon. We always talked about the five

1825
02:35:56,260 --> 02:35:59,940
observables, but we've always maintained there's actually six. One of them is biological effects.

1826
02:36:00,660 --> 02:36:11,060
So I think the issue here is the word mutilations. We are superimposing two different things. A

1827
02:36:11,060 --> 02:36:16,420
mutilation is usually something very negative, and it's usually a crime. And so we hear about

1828
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:20,660
cattle mutilations. Why? Because a cattle is the sovereign property of the farmer.

1829
02:36:20,660 --> 02:36:26,500
And if an animal gets hurt or injured or destroyed in a deliberate fashion or whether it's by an

1830
02:36:26,500 --> 02:36:35,300
animal predator or human or anything else, it's a mutilation. Human mutilations usually have

1831
02:36:35,300 --> 02:36:41,300
something called human experience, not a mutilation. Most of the people, they refer to themselves as

1832
02:36:41,300 --> 02:36:48,660
quote unquote experiencers, will relay either very positive or very negative sensation. But

1833
02:36:49,220 --> 02:36:57,060
but mutilation is usually not ascribed because it's not permanent. It doesn't result in death

1834
02:36:57,060 --> 02:37:00,660
like it does for a cow, for example. No, there's been some examples.

1835
02:37:00,660 --> 02:37:08,820
Yeah. Well, yeah, there are some outlying stories of individuals have been-

1836
02:37:08,820 --> 02:37:13,140
With similar effects that the cows had. Sure. Well, the cows aren't aware.

1837
02:37:13,140 --> 02:37:18,260
Usually the cows and horses aren't around to tell you their story. What we're left is with a body

1838
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:22,820
that's in the process of decomposition, advanced decomposition, in some cases,

1839
02:37:22,820 --> 02:37:30,260
that appeared to have some sort of surgical precision without loss of blood and instant

1840
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:33,540
cauterization of blood vessels, right? Without a trace of-

1841
02:37:33,540 --> 02:37:40,020
Without a trace, right. And I've spoken to an individual who worked for the department of,

1842
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:52,100
let me see if we can get him in trouble. He was a USDA person who happened to be also a

1843
02:37:53,140 --> 02:37:57,060
veterinarian. And so he worked for the government, but he was also a senior

1844
02:37:57,060 --> 02:38:03,300
veterinarian out somewhere out west. And I had a chance to speak to him and he told me point blank,

1845
02:38:03,300 --> 02:38:08,020
look, what's happening to some of these cows? It's not natural predation and it's not us.

1846
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:14,260
Something is doing this. And we're very concerned within his office.

1847
02:38:19,620 --> 02:38:30,660
As far as humans, there are people that we have like Dr. Gary Nolan, who focused on the biological

1848
02:38:30,660 --> 02:38:33,940
effects, however you want to describe that, right? Sure.

1849
02:38:33,940 --> 02:38:40,340
However you want to describe that. Where there does seem to be, at least in some cases-

1850
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:41,380
Brain scarring and-

1851
02:38:43,380 --> 02:38:47,380
Correct. So where there's been specific morphology. Now, the question is, we have to ask,

1852
02:38:47,380 --> 02:38:51,460
is it deliberate? Look, it could just be a product of the technology. If I stick my head

1853
02:38:51,460 --> 02:38:55,700
too close to a microwave oven while the microwave oven is on and the door is open,

1854
02:38:56,660 --> 02:39:02,100
don't be surprised if I get severe negative medical consequences. I'm putting my head next

1855
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:05,940
to radiation, right? It's not the fault of the microwave. It's just doing what it does.

1856
02:39:05,940 --> 02:39:10,820
If you get near some advanced technology that you don't understand, don't be surprised if

1857
02:39:10,820 --> 02:39:15,460
something happens, right? If I'm at an airport, I jump on a 737, hey, no threat. But if I'm at

1858
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:20,020
an airport, I jump onto the tarmac, the runway where that airplane is and its engine is throttling

1859
02:39:20,020 --> 02:39:24,660
up, what's going to happen? Well, I'm going to go deaf. I'm going to get burned. Bad things happen.

1860
02:39:24,660 --> 02:39:29,380
Is it the fault of the airplane? No. It's my fault. I got too damn close to it, right?

1861
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:35,140
Yeah. That's for humans, but for the cattle part, I mean, that just seems...

1862
02:39:35,860 --> 02:39:39,940
Right. Well, so let's go back to the question. Cattle and human relations don't seem to get

1863
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:47,060
discussed. Well, not publicly. Well, but we're discussing it now, right? And what's my take on

1864
02:39:47,060 --> 02:39:53,300
it? My take is that there are some similarities, but there's also some very significant differences

1865
02:39:54,100 --> 02:40:04,740
from what I have learned and been privy to. Again, I am not an expert on bovine. I'm not an expert

1866
02:40:04,740 --> 02:40:10,340
on equine. It wasn't part of the... It could just be like the, I guess the...

1867
02:40:12,100 --> 02:40:16,740
Because it's scary when you see these animals. Yeah. Well, it's disturbing. It really is.

1868
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:22,660
Incredibly disturbing. And they're lovely animals. You didn't ask for that. And when you see them in

1869
02:40:22,660 --> 02:40:27,620
the state they're in... But don't we do the same though? Not to be obvious, but don't we do the

1870
02:40:27,620 --> 02:40:31,220
same to those animals? To rats, we do the same to those animals specifically. We eat them. Yeah.

1871
02:40:31,220 --> 02:40:34,900
Brother, we put them in a place where they're with a bunch of other animals. They know they're

1872
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:39,380
going to die. Correct. We put them through this awful little runway where they're forced to run

1873
02:40:39,380 --> 02:40:42,580
down. And the next thing they know, they've got a bull in the brain or they're getting a throat

1874
02:40:42,580 --> 02:40:47,140
slashed and they're choking on their own blood. You're correct. So when we say cattle and

1875
02:40:47,140 --> 02:40:52,180
mutilations, that's awful. Well, what's really awful? We do the same thing. But we also don't

1876
02:40:52,180 --> 02:40:58,020
advertise that. And that's my point. I think for the same reason is why it doesn't get discussed.

1877
02:40:58,020 --> 02:41:05,540
We don't talk about the deplorable conditions in these farms that these pigs get slaughtered in.

1878
02:41:05,540 --> 02:41:10,420
Yeah. Terrible. Terrible. But we don't talk about it. We don't advertise it. Could it be that that's

1879
02:41:10,420 --> 02:41:14,260
the same reason we don't talk about these cattle mutilations? Well, possibly. We also don't know

1880
02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:18,900
that maybe these cattle are being selected. Maybe they're being dispatched or perhaps killed

1881
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:23,940
before that happens. We're assuming and presuming it's all happening at once. These poor defenseless

1882
02:41:23,940 --> 02:41:28,580
animals, they're just being tortured. That may not be the case at all. It could be they're being

1883
02:41:28,580 --> 02:41:32,500
euthanized. And then they're doing it and then, okay, well, let's put it there in a far corner

1884
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:37,460
there where it'll naturally decay. Well, the dumb humans come across it, okay, but that's

1885
02:41:37,700 --> 02:41:48,420
what we're doing. We as a species do that. We mutilate animals all the time. Go to some of

1886
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:53,860
these, I want to be careful here, don't upset anybody, but go to some of these wet markets.

1887
02:41:54,660 --> 02:41:58,660
Have you seen the way some of these animals are and they're living and breathing and conscious

1888
02:41:58,660 --> 02:42:05,380
and they know what's going to happen to them. Dogs, cats, animals, birds, cattle mutilate.

1889
02:42:05,380 --> 02:42:09,540
If you ask me, that's a hell of a lot more humane than the crap we do.

1890
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:12,820
Yep. All right. Good take. I like it.

1891
02:42:12,820 --> 02:42:14,660
And we do it to ourselves too, unfortunately.

1892
02:42:15,380 --> 02:42:21,140
That is true too. Okay. Last one from the audience here.

1893
02:42:22,980 --> 02:42:23,620
That's a good one.

1894
02:42:26,740 --> 02:42:27,780
It's like a game show.

1895
02:42:27,780 --> 02:42:33,140
I love it. They said, I'm an old, I'm old school, so I remember actually the shows,

1896
02:42:33,140 --> 02:42:34,420
the game shows that did that, right?

1897
02:42:34,420 --> 02:42:35,300
Yeah, the train stations.

1898
02:42:35,940 --> 02:42:44,740
What is more interesting regarding the UAPs and related phenomena, the sky or the sea? Wow.

1899
02:42:44,740 --> 02:42:50,900
And this is from Dennis W. Dennis W, good question. All of them are good. Let me see if I can do this.

1900
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:56,260
Well, interesting is subjective, right? So if you're, well, to most people,

1901
02:42:56,260 --> 02:42:58,260
if you're an aerospace person, then the atmosphere-

1902
02:42:58,260 --> 02:43:01,860
What I mean to you, this question is directed for you.

1903
02:43:01,860 --> 02:43:04,580
No, but I'm saying here, I'm looking at it through a specific lens.

1904
02:43:04,580 --> 02:43:05,060
I see, I see.

1905
02:43:05,060 --> 02:43:09,380
I'm caveat first. So people know that I'm not, the reason why my perspective is the way it is,

1906
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:11,060
because it's to me in my background.

1907
02:43:11,060 --> 02:43:11,620
Okay, I got you.

1908
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:15,380
So if you come from an aerospace background, the things in the sky are very, very interesting.

1909
02:43:15,380 --> 02:43:19,540
If you come from an oceanographic perspective, let's say like Tim Gallaudet, then the undersea

1910
02:43:19,540 --> 02:43:24,180
things seem to be more interesting because you are an expert in those areas. And when you see

1911
02:43:24,180 --> 02:43:29,380
the UAP performing the way they're performing, whether you're an aerospace guy or an undersea guy,

1912
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:33,220
it's pretty amazing, right? So you're like, oh, wow, how is that possible?

1913
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:36,260
I mean, yeah, the air stuff is interesting, but the water is so dense and you can't,

1914
02:43:36,260 --> 02:43:38,820
how is that possible, right? And then the aerospace guy says, yeah, but we're going to,

1915
02:43:38,820 --> 02:43:42,100
the things are coming in from outer space and then you understand the physics involved.

1916
02:43:42,100 --> 02:43:48,820
And so it's important to caveat that because one is not more important than the other.

1917
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:52,180
It's no different than you driving your, what's more interesting when you're driving your car?

1918
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:56,980
Do you like driving your car in the rain or the snow? Well, it depends, you know,

1919
02:43:56,980 --> 02:43:59,860
if you're not used to driving in the rain, you'd rather drive in the snow. If you're not used to

1920
02:43:59,860 --> 02:44:03,620
driving in the snow, I'd much rather drive, you know, am I from Florida or am I from Buffalo,

1921
02:44:03,620 --> 02:44:08,820
New York, right? So it's going to be different for people with those backgrounds. For me,

1922
02:44:13,140 --> 02:44:22,580
I find very interesting the stuff that is in the sky, but not for the reason you might think,

1923
02:44:22,580 --> 02:44:26,340
not because of my background in aerospace, because frankly, it's a cop-out, it's easier

1924
02:44:26,340 --> 02:44:31,300
to collect the data. For me, it's, look, we've got so much things, airborne capability,

1925
02:44:31,300 --> 02:44:37,220
space-borne capability, ground capability, radars and all this other stuff. And it's easier to

1926
02:44:37,220 --> 02:44:42,500
collect the data and more people see it underwater. It's very tough. And unless you have a collection

1927
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:48,660
capability right there, chances are you're not going to catch it. So it's not as frequent and

1928
02:44:48,660 --> 02:44:52,260
not as often. It doesn't mean it doesn't happen just as much. It just means that we don't have

1929
02:44:53,060 --> 02:44:59,300
the persistent surveillance capabilities that we do above the water. And people will look,

1930
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:03,540
we're terrestrial things. We live on land, right? We can see the sky. We don't live underwater.

1931
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:09,940
We're not a fish or a shark, right? So for me, I find what's in the sky very interesting,

1932
02:45:09,940 --> 02:45:16,980
but only because the data is more available and it's easier to make a determination what is

1933
02:45:16,980 --> 02:45:20,740
conventional technology. Someone's being, they're confused between that, no, that's actually an

1934
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:25,780
airplane, 737 on its way to LA or that is a satellite or that's part of Starlink or that's

1935
02:45:25,780 --> 02:45:31,940
part of a, whatever that may be versus undersea. It's more of a puzzle up there. It's more of a

1936
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:36,740
puzzle up there. Underwater, we have less information, but it's also to me more scary

1937
02:45:37,460 --> 02:45:42,180
because it means it's a lot closer, right? These things are from the ocean. Now it's like,

1938
02:45:42,180 --> 02:45:48,420
wait a minute, we're neighbors. Next time I'm on a Carnival cruise ship, heading to the Caribbean,

1939
02:45:48,580 --> 02:45:54,420
is it possible one of these things are below us, right? That's an awfully deep ocean, like I said,

1940
02:45:54,420 --> 02:46:01,540
and it's interesting to consider. It's a really good question, but my answer is keep in mind,

1941
02:46:01,540 --> 02:46:07,540
it's very subjective. B, it's unqualified because I'm not an expert in the ocean.

1942
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:13,860
Sure. And C, it's a cop-out for me because it's easier. There's just simply more data for me to

1943
02:46:14,740 --> 02:46:20,180
go through. Yep. All right. Great answer. All right, man. Dude, we almost pulled three hours here.

1944
02:46:20,180 --> 02:46:25,940
Did we? Yeah, that's crazy. One more favor I'm going to ask you. I'm going to ask you to sign

1945
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:29,300
two of these. Well, three of these, one of them is for me, and I bought two extra ones because

1946
02:46:29,300 --> 02:46:34,740
we're going to give some away. I love it. To the audience. We're going to give them a chance to

1947
02:46:34,740 --> 02:46:41,780
get a signed copy here. Guys, simply, if you'd like to win one of these signed copies, make

1948
02:46:41,780 --> 02:46:52,020
sure you're subscribed, like this video, and then comment below your favorite part of this podcast

1949
02:46:52,020 --> 02:46:58,100
or this discussion. Some piece of information that you found interesting that Lou let slip through

1950
02:46:58,100 --> 02:47:05,140
the cracks, and I'm going to choose one of you there, and the other one is going to be an intern.

1951
02:47:05,140 --> 02:47:10,020
So if you want to increase your chances on winning one of these, because there are far fewer interns

1952
02:47:10,020 --> 02:47:15,220
and there are people watching this, you can go ahead and join our membership by clicking the join

1953
02:47:15,220 --> 02:47:24,340
button or go ahead and go to patreon.com slash area 52 investigations and join for five bucks a

1954
02:47:24,340 --> 02:47:28,580
month there. And we got all sorts of extra stuff, but I'll be choosing one of our interns to win the

1955
02:47:28,580 --> 02:47:35,220
other signed copy. Thank you so much for watching. And Lou. Thank you to all of you. I don't know

1956
02:47:35,220 --> 02:47:39,460
what the primary camera, but to all of you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Hopefully

1957
02:47:39,460 --> 02:47:44,580
I didn't drone on and bore the hell out of you. Talk to my wife. She'll tell you I go the hell

1958
02:47:44,580 --> 02:47:50,820
out of people all the time. But thank you truly. And if you don't mind, just so you know, you are

1959
02:47:50,820 --> 02:47:55,940
making the difference. This is only possible because of you. And not only are other people

1960
02:47:55,940 --> 02:48:00,820
listening, but governments of the world are listening to you. So thank you for your courage

1961
02:48:00,820 --> 02:48:08,100
and having the curiosity in this topic, a topic that was once perceived as being, according to the

1962
02:48:08,180 --> 02:48:11,780
American Psychological Association, as being an extreme form of deviance.

1963
02:48:12,740 --> 02:48:17,300
Thank you for being curious. Thank you for your courage, being part of this conversation with us.

1964
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:24,340
And we do it for you. So thank you and God bless. Thanks, man. You got it, brother. Appreciate it.

1965
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:27,780
Absolutely. My honor and privilege.
