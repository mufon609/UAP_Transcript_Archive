1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,200
When I was a child, I was abducted in the winter of 1995.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,880
I remember lights beaming in my room, and when I looked to my right, there was a being

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,200
reaching for me.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:28,280
After that situation, I've always felt like I've been being watched.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,480
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to another episode of Debriefed.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,920
My name is Chris Ramsey, and today we're going to be reading through a very contentious,

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,960
controversial, and polarizing topic here.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,960
This is known as the Lacerda Files.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,460
On December 16, 1999, a file was posted to some conspiracy theory forums.

10
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,600
This file alleged an interaction between a human being, a male from Sweden who remains

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,920
anonymous, and a reptilian female who goes by the name Lacerda.

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,800
So the source of the transcript is unknown, the tapes were never found, and the person

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,320
who interviewed this being was never named.

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,760
So therefore, we have no actual evidence of this ever happening, but that, folks, won't

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,080
stop us from reading through this hefty document.

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,800
This comes in two different files.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,840
So you have part one, which was released in 1999, and part two, which was then later released

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,920
in 2000, in April.

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,560
This has been translated by a person by the name of Christian Filer.

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,960
So among the varying fantastic claims, one of which being, Lacerda says that her species

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,680
evolved here on earth millions of years before humans did, and they went deep underground

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
to avoid human expansion and cataclysms.

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,960
And they also allegedly control hidden underground cities around the world.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,600
If all of this sounds a little familiar, that's because David Icke, a controversial figure

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,200
for many reasons which I won't get into, was fascinated by the topic of reptilian overlords

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,340
kind of taking over mainstream, which is the monarchy and politicians and celebrities and

27
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,340
so forth.

28
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,160
So obviously mainstream media takes this, sensationalizes it, and makes us all look

29
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,200
like tinfoil hat wearing crazies.

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,600
But you don't need a tinfoil hat to enjoy a good story.

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,240
And folks, that's exactly what we're going to be doing today.

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,120
This hefty document has about 50 pages, half of which are part two, half of which are part

33
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
one.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,720
So I'll try my best to read through as much as I can, but this will probably end up being

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,540
an intermittent series that we post between other podcasts and investigations.

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,560
And if this is something that you enjoy, folks, I would just ask you three simple things.

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,440
Like this video, subscribe, and maybe leave a comment below to help out the algorithm

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:57,360
and appease the algorithm gods that we so helplessly have to serve here on YouTube.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,380
Finding your private and personal information online has gotten easier.

40
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,940
You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to believe that your personal and private

41
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,620
information is being sold to data brokers on the dark web, which is why this video is

42
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,640
sponsored by Incogni.

43
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,960
Working with spam emails and phone calls and texts is bad enough.

44
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,680
But once you're on these lists, it doesn't stop there.

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,600
Sometimes they can take it a step further.

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Whether it's creepy DMs or finding out where you live, your personal and private information

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,160
is pretty much always at risk.

48
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,400
But there's good news.

49
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,740
You can actually demand that that information be taken off their lists.

50
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,580
The bad news is there are hundreds of lists and Incogni makes that easy.

51
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,260
All you have to do is sign in to Incogni and grant them permission to act on your behalf.

52
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,980
Then sit back and watch as they reach out to the hundreds of brokers that are selling

53
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,500
your private information and demand that it be retracted and taken off the internet.

54
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,840
They even have a very easy to understand dashboard, which allows you to track exactly where your

55
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,700
information has been taken down and what's left to do.

56
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:13,680
So go subscribe to Incogni at incogni.com slash area 52 and use promo code area 52.

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,980
And you'll save 60% off your yearly subscription folks, we paid the bills.

58
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,220
Let's get in to reading the Lucerta files.

59
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,220
All right.

60
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,680
Like I said, there is a lot here.

61
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,700
This is only half and the other half is here.

62
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,700
These are thick, thick files, baby.

63
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,500
Having guests is fun.

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,620
I do enjoy listening to people and learning from them, especially when there's so much

65
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,900
more intelligent than I am and have so much to teach me.

66
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:49,260
But every now and then nothing beats sitting here in this office with some wild stories

67
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,140
and just chopping it up with you guys.

68
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,500
So this is, this is a bit of a rare treat for myself right now.

69
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,820
I'm enjoying this.

70
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,060
I certify that the following is the absolute truth and no work of fiction.

71
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,360
These are parts of a transcript of an interview I've made with a non-human and reptilian being

72
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,600
in December of 1999.

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,720
This female being was already in contact with a friend of mine whose name is given only

74
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,840
with the abbreviation EF in the text since some months.

75
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:24,480
Let me declare that I was all my life a skeptic about UFOs, aliens and other worldly things.

76
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,620
And I thought that EF tells me just dreams or fictitious stories.

77
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,840
When he talked with me about his first contacts with non-human being Lucerta, I was still

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,760
skeptic when I met this being on December 16th last year in 1999.

79
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,240
In that small warm room in the remote house of my friend near to a town in the south of

80
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,440
Sweden, despite the fact that I saw now with my own eyes that she was not human, she has

81
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,340
told and shown me so many unbelievable things during that meeting that I can't deny the

82
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,320
reality and the truth of her words any longer.

83
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,120
This is not another of that wrong UFO papers which claim to tell the truth but tell in

84
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
fact just fiction.

85
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm convinced that this transcript contains the only truth and therefore you should read

86
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
it.

87
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,480
Folks, again, I would just kindly ask you to suspend your disbelief.

88
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,880
We know that this is probably going to read as fiction, but check it out the door.

89
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Let's have some fun.

90
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,400
I talked with her for over three hours, so the following transcript shows you only shortened

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,400
parts of the interview, because she asked me after the interview not to publish everything

92
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,920
she had told me already now.

93
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,600
The order of the questions in this transcript is not always the same order in which I had

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,520
asked them, so it may seem sometimes a little bit confusing to you.

95
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,160
It was not easy to delete all the important parts she had asked me to delete from the

96
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,000
transcript, so I apologize for the maybe unusual order.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,320
I'm in the possession of the entire transcript of the interview, 49 pages, with some of my

98
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:06,520
drawings of her body and her equipment, and also some tapes on which I have the full interview,

99
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,000
but I will not reveal this before I have permission from her.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,920
I will send the shortened form of the still fascinating document to four of my reliable

101
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,360
friends to Finland, Norway, Germany, and France, and I hope they will translate it into their

102
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,560
own language and into other languages, and I hope as many people as possible will be

103
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,320
able to read and to understand the transcript.

104
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,920
If you receive it, please send it to all your friends via email or make printouts and copy

105
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
them.

106
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,760
I mean, or better yet, talk about it on debriefed.

107
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:42,280
I certify furthermore that various paranormal abilities of her species like telepathy and

108
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,220
telekinesis, including the moving and dancing of my pencil on the table without touching

109
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,980
of an apple around 40 centimeters over her hands were shown to me during the three hours

110
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:01,480
and six minutes of meeting, and I'm absolutely sure that these abilities were no tricks.

111
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,500
The following is certainly difficult to understand and to believe for someone who hasn't experienced

112
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,060
it, but I was really in contact with her mind, and I'm now completely sure that everything

113
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,760
she said during the interview is the absolute truth about our world.

114
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm going to interject here just for a second.

115
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:29,520
This is a very, very fascinating thing that I've pondered a little bit on recently.

116
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,460
If my coffee cup decided to start talking to me immediately, like if it grew a mouth

117
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:45,180
and just started talking to me and told me anything at all, I would believe it.

118
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,280
Because this coffee cup just showed me that my reality was in fact, partially at least,

119
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:59,200
a lie, and that this new reality in the way that it behaves is now shown itself to me

120
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,920
as being the truth.

121
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,520
Therefore, everything that this coffee cup is going to relay to me, I will assume is

122
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,480
the truth.

123
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,180
And if that's what he's saying here, that's kind of what's happening.

124
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:21,600
If I show you an impossibility, I am then more inclined to have you believe that whatever

125
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,020
I say is going to be the truth.

126
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,960
Your own objective view of reality has now been questioned and replaced by something

127
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,080
else, something more magical and something real.

128
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,580
Therefore, you're going to trust whatever is delivering that message is telling you

129
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,600
the truth when in fact, that might not be the truth.

130
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,000
You might be being PsiOpt.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,200
And I say this with all due respect to everyone who's ever, in their own words, communicated

132
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,920
with some type of entity who's shown them images or given them prophetic messages.

133
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,760
Personally, I would just be cautious with that message because of the example I just

134
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
gave you.

135
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,440
My two cents.

136
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,660
Unfortunately, I have read the entire transcript and much more.

137
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,580
This very short informed by myself, I have the strong impression that everything I've

138
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,180
written sounds too unbelievable to be true, that everything sounds more like a bad science

139
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,780
fiction story from TV or cinema.

140
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,180
And I have doubts that anyone will believe my experiences, but they are true.

141
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,500
If you believe it or not, I can't expect from you that you believe my simple words without

142
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,900
evidence, but I can't give you that evidence.

143
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,680
Please read the transcript and think about it, and you will maybe see the truth in this

144
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
word, in this words.

145
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,560
So all right, some loss in translation here, obviously, this has been translated from a

146
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
different language.

147
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,040
So maybe just forgive the imperfect grammar here, there will be a new meeting between

148
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,160
me and her again in the same house in Sweden on April 23rd, 2000.

149
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,920
And she promised me to give me maybe some evidence of her existence.

150
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,600
In the meantime, I collect questions, which I will ask her then maybe she gives me permission

151
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,020
to reveal more of the missing parts in that transcript, and about the coming war.

152
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,640
Okay, believe it or not, this makes no real difference, but I hope you will believe.

153
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Ole K, that's what he's going by, January 8th, 2000.

154
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,520
So I mean, what is interesting with this is that we do have 25 years of looking into anything.

155
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:37,400
So if there was any type of prophetic or even just precognitive information in here

156
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,500
that happened in the last 25 years, we'll be able to confirm or deny that, which should

157
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,620
be interesting.

158
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:49,060
So I will be saying question and answer for both Ole, the person questioning and for Lucerta,

159
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,800
the being answering question.

160
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,340
First of all, who are you?

161
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,820
Are you an extraterrestrial species?

162
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,000
Or can your origin be found on this planet?

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Answer.

164
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,580
As you can see with your own eyes, I'm not a human being like you.

165
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:10,340
And to be honest, I'm no real mammal, despite my partly mammal-like body features, which

166
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,180
are a result of evolution.

167
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:18,320
I'm a female reptile being belonging to a very old reptilian race.

168
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,500
We are the native Terrans, and we live on that planet since millions of years.

169
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,300
We are mentioned in your religious writings, like your Christian Bible, and many of the

170
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,260
ancient human tribes were aware of our presence and worshipped us as gods.

171
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,140
For example, the Egyptians and the Inca and many other old tribes.

172
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,700
Your Christian religion has misunderstood our role in your creation, so we are mentioned

173
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,000
as evil serpents in your writings.

174
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,740
This is wrong.

175
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,860
Your race was genetically engineered by aliens and we were just more or less passive visitors

176
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,960
of the accelerated evolution process.

177
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,880
You must know, some of your scientists have already supposed this, that your species has

178
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,960
evolved in a naturally completely impossible speed within just 2-3 million years.

179
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,360
This is absolutely impossible, because evolution is a much slower process if it's natural.

180
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,820
But you have not understand this.

181
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:18,400
Your creation was artificial and done by genetic engineering, but not by us, but by an alien

182
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
species.

183
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,700
Like me, if I'm an extraterrestrial, I must answer no.

184
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,320
We are native Terrans.

185
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,040
We had and have some colonies in other solar systems, but we originate on this planet.

186
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,520
It's in fact our planet, not yours.

187
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,240
It was never yours.

188
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,880
That's a crazy way to answer that question, to be like, oh, yeah, we're not extraterrestrial,

189
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,320
we're from here, but we were here before you, this is our planet, you are invading our planet

190
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
currently.

191
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,200
Question, can you tell me your name?

192
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,480
This is difficult.

193
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,680
Because your human tongue is not able to pronounce it correctly, and a mispronunciation of our

194
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,200
names is very offensive for some of my kind.

195
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,160
Our language is very different from yours, but my name is, I will try to say it smoother

196
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,460
by use of your human letters.

197
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,460
Something like...

198
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,440
I did my best to mouth that in Parseltongue.

199
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,480
Big Harry Potter fan here, okay, so.

200
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Was this, by the way, could this have been the origin of Parseltongue that they used

201
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
in Harry Potter?

202
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,920
With a very, very strong pronunciation of the shh and k, okay, so more like, shh, shh,

203
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,320
skh, skh, skh.

204
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,520
Trying my best here.

205
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,360
We have no four names like you, but only a single but unique name, which is divided and

206
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,120
characterized by the way of speaking, and which is given not to children who have an

207
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,560
own children name, but only in a special procedure in the adolescent age at the time of either

208
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,560
religious or scientific enlightenment or awareness, as you would call it.

209
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,300
I would appreciate it if you don't try to say my real name with your human tongue.

210
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,480
Please call me Lyserta.

211
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,160
This is the name I generally use when I'm among humans and talk with them.

212
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
My apologies, Lyserta.

213
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,680
I didn't mean to offend your entire ancestry by calling them all, you know, terrible things.

214
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,760
Question, how old are you?

215
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Answer.

216
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,800
We measure the time not like you in astronomical years and in the revolve of the earth around

217
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,520
sun because we usually live beneath the surface of the planet.

218
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,480
Our time measurement depends on periodically returning cycles in the earth magnetic field.

219
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:44,400
And according to this and said with your numbers, I'm today, let me calculate, 57,653 cycles

220
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
old.

221
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:53,120
I have reached my adult phase and my awareness at 16,337 cycles ago.

222
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,440
This is a very important date for us.

223
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,120
According to your human time scale, I'm around 28 years old.

224
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
Question.

225
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,200
What is your task?

226
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,600
Do you have a job like us?

227
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,720
Answer.

228
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,320
To say it with your words, I'm a curious student of the social behavior of your species.

229
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,800
That's why I'm here to talk to you.

230
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,840
That's why I have revealed my nature to EF and now to you.

231
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,760
And that's why I give you all that secret information and why I will try to answer all

232
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,760
the questions on your many sheets of paper, honestly.

233
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,800
I will see how you react, how others of your kind react.

234
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,560
There are so many crazies and liars of your kind on this planet who claim to know the

235
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,840
truth about us, about UFOs, about aliens, and so on.

236
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,040
And some of you believe their lies.

237
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Interesting.

238
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,480
I wonder if this being is referring to David Icke's work, which was, I think, really popularized

239
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,160
around 2016.

240
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,400
So a few years before this happened, which again, could also point me in the direction

241
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,480
of this being a hoax now that somebody's done the heavy lifting on sort of the origin of

242
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,920
these reptilians, you know, maybe someone took that and ran with it.

243
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,600
I wonder how far back the reptilian idea goes to, though.

244
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:16,740
I'm not exactly sure of the original, you know, first time we had mentioned these specific

245
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
reptilian beings.

246
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,200
I'm interested to see how your species will react if you make the truth, which I will

247
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,920
tell you now, public.

248
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,440
I'm sure quite every one of you will refuse to believe my words because you need to understand

249
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,680
if you want to survive the coming years.

250
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,080
It sounds like a little bit of a threat.

251
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Question.

252
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,440
I've read your full statement, which you have given to EF about this, but can you give me

253
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,560
now just a short answer?

254
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:48,520
Are UFOs real flying objects piloted by extraterrestrials, or do they belong to your species?

255
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,920
Answer.

256
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,380
Some observed UFOs, as you call them, belong to us, but most not.

257
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,900
Most of the mysterious flying objects in the sky are not technological devices, but

258
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:05,060
mainly misinterpretations of natural phenomena your scientists have not understood, like

259
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,220
spontaneous plasma flares in the high atmosphere.

260
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:16,180
Well, that's really interesting because recently there's been a lot of talk of these plasmoids

261
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:23,120
being the sort of reason for seeing these orbs, but it's interesting that we're saying

262
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,320
it's a natural phenomenon.

263
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,640
Okay.

264
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,020
Nevertheless, some UFOs are real craft belonging either to your own species, especially to

265
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,620
your military, or to other alien species, or at last, to us.

266
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,800
But a minority of sighted craft belong really to us because we are generally very careful

267
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,660
with our movements in the atmosphere, and we have special ways to hide our ships.

268
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:54,160
If you read a report about a sighting of a metalish, again, the grammar is off here,

269
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,600
so forgive me for reading it this way, of a metalish bright gray cigar-shaped cylindrical

270
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,120
object with a length of, there are different types, let me say between 20 and 260 of your

271
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,680
meters, and if this object had made a very deep humming sound, and if there were five

272
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,660
bright red lights on the metallic surface of the cigar, one at the top, one in the middle,

273
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:28,160
two on the ends, then it's likely that someone of you have seen one of our ships, and this

274
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:35,420
means that it was either partly defect or that someone of us was not careful enough.

275
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:41,180
We have also a very small fleet of disc-shaped craft, but such UFOs belong usually to an

276
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,960
alien species.

277
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,860
Triangular UFOs belong generally to your own military, but they use foreign technology

278
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,520
to build them.

279
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,000
If you really want to try to see one of our craft, you should have a look in the skies

280
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
over the Arctic, the Antarctic, and over Inner Asia, especially over the mountains there.

281
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,920
Well that's interesting.

282
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,120
It's interesting to say that the triangular craft would be ours, because that seems to

283
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:18,120
I mean, again, this person could potentially just be borrowing from ufology lore that the

284
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:26,400
TR-3B, which is some type of back-engineered, you know, alien reproduction vehicle that

285
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,400
the military made, but that definitely does seem to fit the modern consensus of the triangular

286
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
craft.

287
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:40,600
Being more of an immaculate constellation, when we read that document a few months back,

288
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:47,600
they had also mentioned that the triangular ones were of ARV origin.

289
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,080
Again, this could all be true, or these could all be LARPs that are piggybacking on one

290
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,920
another.

291
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,120
The 4chan whistleblower, however, said he never observed any triangular craft, which

292
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,160
of course, if they were surveying the underwater mobile construction unit that was releasing

293
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,740
these UFOs into the atmosphere, that was alien tech.

294
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,960
They wouldn't have had access to triangular craft, so this all kind of does fit the narrative

295
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
currently.

296
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Question.

297
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,920
Have you a special symbol or something like that with which we can identify your kind?

298
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Answer.

299
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,280
We have two major symbols representing our species.

300
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,660
One, the more ancient symbol, is a blue serpent with four white wings on a black background.

301
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,240
The colors have religious meanings for us.

302
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,200
The symbol was used for certain parts of my society, but is today very seldom.

303
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,080
You humans have copied it very often in your old writings.

304
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,400
The other symbol is a mystic being you would call a dragon in the shape of a circle with

305
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
seven white stars in the middle.

306
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,420
This symbol is much more common today.

307
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,680
If you see one of that symbol on a cylindrical craft I've described in my previous answer

308
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,820
or on some underground installation, this thing or place belongs definitely to us.

309
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,540
And I would advise you go away from there as soon as possible.

310
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Ugh.

311
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,380
What's interesting, I want to have a look at something.

312
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,700
I bought a book recently about underwater, this craft that came out from underwater,

313
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,580
these beings that came out.

314
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,540
I think this was in Spain and there are multiple witnesses who described one of the beings

315
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,100
and one of the beings had a crest and I do believe there was a serpent on it.

316
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,540
Let me go get this real quick.

317
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,140
So the book is called UFO Contact from Undersea.

318
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,940
It is a vintage book.

319
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,500
So it says here they were dressed in a suit of very special brilliance.

320
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,400
It was the color of silver and reflected the lights around them.

321
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,420
On the suit in the right breast they had an emblem made up of a serpent in the form of

322
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:53,220
an S or maybe more like a Z with rounded corners and a wide X shaped cross lying down underneath.

323
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,420
Could this be related?

324
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,580
I don't know, but I do like the idea of having these old books and being able to be like,

325
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,660
oh, that looks like this or, you know, just connecting dots.

326
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:07,900
Question, the seven stars in the second symbol you've mentioned, do they mean the Pleiades?

327
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,900
Hmm.

328
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,460
Bit of a red flag here.

329
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:22,100
Obviously in ufology, Pleiadian star systems, the Pleiadian star system is very popular.

330
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,980
You know, Pleiadians are like some benevolent species, highly intelligent.

331
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,800
These seven stars are also, they also pretty much show up in a lot of different ancient

332
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,620
civilizations as being the origin of their gods.

333
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,800
And so unless this person is familiar with all that, like it would be a weird question

334
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,280
for a normie to just be like, oh, you mean the Pleiadian star cluster?

335
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,920
Like I don't, for me, that's like a little bit of a thing, but we carry on.

336
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,400
Answer, Pleiades?

337
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,000
No, actually, the seven stars are planets and moons and they are a symbol of our former

338
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,760
seven colonies in the solar system.

339
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,840
The stars are shown in front of the blue background and the dragon circle means the shape of the

340
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,020
earth.

341
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:12,100
The seven white stars mean moon, Mars, Venus, and the four moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

342
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,580
We had colonized in the past.

343
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,980
Two colonies are no longer in use and abandoned, so five stars would be more correct.

344
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Question.

345
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,900
As you have not allowed me to make photos, what would be very useful to prove your real

346
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,800
existence and the truth of this story?

347
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,460
Can you describe yourself, yourself detailed?

348
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,020
Answer, I know that it would be helpful to prove the authenticity of this interview if

349
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,060
you can make some photos from me.

350
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Otherwise, you humans are very skeptic.

351
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,580
That's good for us and for real alien species acting secretly on this planet.

352
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,220
So even if you had such photos, many of your kind would say that they are fraud, that I'm

353
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,900
just a masked human woman or something like that.

354
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,460
That would be very offensive for me.

355
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,840
You must understand that I can't give you permission to make photos of me or of my equipment.

356
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,600
This has various reasons, which I want not to discuss with you further.

357
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,840
But one of the reasons is the keeping up of the secrecy of our existence.

358
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,560
Another reason is more religious.

359
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,120
Nevertheless, you have permission to make drawings of my look and of my equipment.

360
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,200
I can show you later.

361
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,880
I can also try to describe myself, but I doubt that others of your kind will be able to imagine

362
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,920
my real look just from simple words, because the automatic denial of the existence of reptilian

363
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,200
species and generally of intelligent species other than your own is part of the programming

364
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
of your mind.

365
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Well, I will try.

366
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,600
Okay, bit of a bit of a contradiction here being like I'm going to grant you access to

367
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:47,520
interview me so that we can see how your kind reacts to our existence, but also be like,

368
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
no photos, please.

369
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,040
But you can draw me paint me like one of your French women.

370
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,520
Yeah, a bit strange.

371
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,720
It's a little strange to allow for one but not the other.

372
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:07,880
And it also really, really convenient, I must say.

373
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
Here we go.

374
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
This is the description.

375
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,000
Imagine the body of a normal human woman, and you have at first a good imagination of

376
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,280
my body.

377
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,920
Like you, I have a head, two arms, two hands, two legs, and two feet and the proportions

378
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,980
of my body are like yours.

379
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,780
As I'm female, I also have two breasts.

380
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,700
Despite our reptile origin, we have started to give milk to our babies during the evolution

381
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,700
process.

382
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,020
This happened about 30 million years ago, because this is the best thing to keep the

383
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,660
young alive.

384
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:43,820
Evolution had done this for your species already in the dinosaur age and a little bit later,

385
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,620
also for ours.

386
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:51,420
That means not that we are now real mammals, but the breasts of us are not as large as

387
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,300
those of human women, and the size of them is generally equal for every female of my

388
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
kind.

389
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,860
The external reproduction organs are for both sexes, smaller than those of humans,

390
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,900
but they are visible and they have the same function as yours, another gift of evolution

391
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,460
to our species.

392
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:21,380
I mean, you know, they might be a little smarter and a little older, but it seems like

393
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:27,300
it seems like humans got something going for them.

394
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,920
Okay, get your head out of the gutter.

395
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,260
My skin is mainly of a green beige color, more pale green, and we have some patterns

396
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,840
of brown irregular dots, each dot the size of one or two centimeters on our skin and

397
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,220
in our face.

398
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,380
The patterns are different for both sexes, but females have more, especially in the lower

399
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,340
body and in the face.

400
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:54,980
You can see them in my case as two lines over the eyebrows crossing my forehead, at my cheek,

401
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,420
and at my chin.

402
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,080
My eyes are a little bit larger than human eyes.

403
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,220
For this reason, we can see better in the darkness and usually dominated from the large

404
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,260
black pupils, which are surrounded from a small bright green iris.

405
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,780
Males have a dark green iris.

406
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,340
The pupil is slit and can change its size from a small black line to a wide open egg

407
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,680
shaped oval.

408
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,200
Because our retina is very light sensitive and the pupil must compare this, we have external

409
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,700
round ears, but they are smaller and not so curved as yours.

410
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,740
But we can hear better because our ears are more sensitive for sonic.

411
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,140
We can hear a wider range of sonic.

412
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,480
There's a muscle or lid which can completely close them, for example, underwater.

413
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,980
Our nose is more pointed and there is a V shaped curving between the nostrils, which

414
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,480
enabled the ancestors to see temperature.

415
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,080
We have lost most of this ability, but we can still feel temperature much better with

416
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
this organ.

417
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,500
Our lips are shaped like yours.

418
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,700
Those of females a little bit larger than those of males, but of a pale brown color.

419
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,120
And our teeth are very white and strong and a little bit longer and sharper than your

420
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,020
soft mammal teeth.

421
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,380
We have no different hair color like yours, but there is a tradition to color the hairs

422
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,300
in different ages, and the original color is like mine, a greenish brown.

423
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,740
Our hairs are thicker and stronger than yours, and they grow very slow.

424
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:35,300
In addition, the head is the only part of our body where we have hairs.

425
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,260
Our body, arms, and legs are similar in shape and size to yours, but the color is different.

426
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,900
And there are scale-like structures on the upper legs over the knee and upper arms over

427
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
the elbow.

428
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,580
Our five fingers are a little bit longer and thinner than human fingers, and our skin on

429
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,980
the palm is plain.

430
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,740
So we have no lines like you, but again a combination of scale-like skin structure and

431
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,940
of the brown dots.

432
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,340
Both sexes have the dots on the palm, and we have no fingerprints like you.

433
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,520
If you touch my skin, you will feel that it is smoother than your hairy skin.

434
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:12,460
There are small sharp horns on the upside of both middle fingers.

435
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,920
The fingernails are gray and generally longer than yours.

436
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,040
You see that my nails are not so long and round at the top.

437
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,960
This is because I'm female.

438
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,800
Males have sharp pointed nails with a length of sometimes 5 or 6 of your centimeters.

439
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,960
The following feature is very different from your body and part of our reptilian origin.

440
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,200
If you touch the backside of my upper body, you will feel a hard bony line through my

441
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,320
clothing.

442
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,080
This is not my spine, but a very difficult shaped external plate structure of skin and

443
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,240
tissue following exactly our spine from the head to the hip.

444
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,160
There is an extremely high number of nerves and large blood vessels in this structure

445
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,640
and in the plates, which are around 2 or 3 centimeters long and very touch sensitive.

446
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,200
This is the reason why we have always problems to sit in chairs with a back like this chair.

447
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,560
The main task of these small plates, beside a role in our sexuality, is simply the regulation

448
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,120
of our body temperature, and if we sit in natural or artificial sunlight, these plates

449
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,560
become more blood-filled and the vessels become wider and the sun is able to heat up our reptiloid

450
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,800
blood, which circulates through the body and through the plates for many degrees, and that

451
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,920
gives us a great pleasure.

452
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,440
What else is different from your kind?

453
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,400
Oh, we have no navel because we were born in a different way to your mammal birth.

454
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,560
The other exterior differences from your kind are minor and I think I must not mention all

455
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,680
now because most of them are not visible if we wear clothing.

456
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,680
I hope the description of my body was detailed enough.

457
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,840
I would advise you to make some drawings.

458
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,960
Okay, how bizarre.

459
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:06,160
One thing I will say and one thing that I do appreciate, whether this is a LARP, a pretend

460
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:16,360
story or an actual occurrence, is the inclusion of such biological details.

461
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:25,560
We've seen this with the EBO geneticist where he went into crazy amount of details with

462
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:31,120
not only the body, but the organs and the genetics themselves, the reproductive organs

463
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,880
or the lack thereof.

464
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,400
I find it very fascinating if you're creating this type of lore that you would include details

465
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:45,720
that otherwise, I mean, they're just completely made up, which is kind of cool, so I do appreciate

466
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
that.

467
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,760
Question, what kind of clothing do you generally wear?

468
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,360
I suppose this is not the way you dress normally.

469
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,360
Answer.

470
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,000
No, I wear this human everyday clothing only when I'm among humans.

471
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,680
To be honest, it's not very comfortable for me to wear such tight things, and it is always

472
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,440
very unusual feeling.

473
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:11,080
If we are in our home, this means our subterranean home, or in our large artificial sun areas,

474
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,880
and if we are together with others near to our own name, we are usually naked.

475
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,160
Is this shocking for you?

476
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,400
When we are in the public and together with many others of our species, we wear very wide

477
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,560
and soft clothing made of thin light stuff.

478
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,100
I have told you that many parts of our bodies are very touch sensitive, mostly the small

479
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,280
black plates so we can't feel comfortable in tight clothing because it can hurt us.

480
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:41,240
Man and woman wear often the same kind of clothing, but the colors are different for

481
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,800
the sexes.

482
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Interesting.

483
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,280
I like that.

484
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,760
I think that's cool.

485
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,560
Flowy clothing, reptilians wearing flowy clothing.

486
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Question.

487
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,840
You've said others near to your own name, do you mean your family?

488
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Answer.

489
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
No, not really.

490
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,080
You would call it a family, but with this word you mean only those of your kind which

491
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,360
belong genetically together like father or mother and child.

492
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,460
As I've said earlier, we have a very difficult and unique name.

493
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,240
Part of the pronunciation of that name is absolute unique, and there is no other being

494
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,840
with that same name.

495
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,600
But part of this name, the middle part, is pronounced in a way that told the others to

496
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:27,000
which family, I must use the word because you haven't the right one in your vocabulary,

497
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,200
you belong.

498
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,120
This means not that all in that group are genetically related to you because these groups

499
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,980
are usually very large and contain between 40 and 70 of us.

500
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:44,160
This group includes generally your genetic relations, except one of them had decided

501
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,400
to leave this group, and your connection with the father or mother is often the strongest.

502
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,140
It would be too difficult for me to explain you now our very old social system, which

503
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,240
is very complex, and we would need many hours only for the primary things.

504
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,560
But we can meet another time and I can give you detailed descriptions of all these things.

505
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
Interesting.

506
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,040
You're gonna hear me say interesting a lot and sometimes I mean interesting because it's

507
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,200
actually interesting.

508
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,760
Sometimes I mean interesting because I'm not buying it.

509
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,760
Don't let that deter you from, you know, the fiction question.

510
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,360
Have you a tail like normal reptiles?

511
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
Answer.

512
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,920
Do you see one?

513
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,480
No, we have no visible tail.

514
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,700
If you look at our skeleton, there is only a small rounded bone at the end of our spine

515
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,420
behind the pelvis.

516
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,240
This is a useless rudiment of the tail of our ancestors, but it is not visible from

517
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,320
the outside.

518
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,320
Our embryos have tails during the first months of development, but these tails disappear

519
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,280
before we're born.

520
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:48,840
A tail makes only sense for a primitive species, which tries to walk on two legs and must

521
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
held the balance with the tail.

522
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,640
But our skeleton has changed during evolution, our spine is nearly in the same shape as yours.

523
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,240
So we need no tail to stay on two feet.

524
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,960
Well, reptiles have tails and they're not walking around on two legs.

525
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,000
So that doesn't really make sense, does it?

526
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,680
Somebody we had on the podcast a long time ago, Jesse, who had a sighting in northern

527
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,720
Quebec, maybe I should ask him to read through this.

528
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,880
He does study reptiles.

529
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,840
Question You said that you were born in a different

530
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
way to us.

531
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,200
Do you lay eggs?

532
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Answer.

533
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,720
Yes, but not like your birds are primitive reptiles.

534
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,880
Actually, the embryo grows in a protein liquid inside the mother's womb.

535
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,480
But there is also an egg shaped, but very thin chalk hull around it that fills the whole

536
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,920
womb.

537
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,120
The embryo inside this hull is completely autark from the mother's body.

538
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,120
I don't know what that means.

539
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
Autark.

540
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:53,920
I think they made a mistake because autarky is is like an economic term, unless I'm mistaken.

541
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
I don't know.

542
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,240
It has every substance it needs to develop inside the chalk hull.

543
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,640
There's also a cord like your navel cord, which is connected to a point behind the back

544
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,720
plates.

545
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,120
When the baby is going to be born, the whole egg is pressed through the vagina covered

546
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:18,200
in a slimy protein substance and the baby came out of this soft egg after some minutes.

547
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,320
These two horns on our middle fingers were instinctively used from babies to break through

548
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,160
the chalk hull to take their first breath.

549
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,320
Our young are not so large as your babies when they were born.

550
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,440
They're between 30 and 35 of your centimeters tall.

551
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,800
The egg is around 40 centimeters tall.

552
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,360
This is because our vagina is smaller than a human one, but we grow to a normal size

553
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,800
of 1.60 or 1.80 meters.

554
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,320
TMI on the reptilian sex organs.

555
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
But good to know.

556
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
Question.

557
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,800
What about your body temperature?

558
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,720
You've said that you enjoy to lay in the sun.

559
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,080
What effect has this on your organism?

560
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,440
Answer.

561
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,320
We are no mammals and as reptiles, our body temperature depends on the temperature of

562
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,080
our surrounding.

563
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,800
If you touch my hand, you will maybe feel that it is colder than yours because our normal

564
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,560
body temperature is around 30 to 33 degrees centigrade.

565
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,000
If we sit in the sun, especially naked with our row of small back plates in the sun, our

566
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,480
body temperature can rise for eight or nine degrees within minutes.

567
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,520
This rise causes a production of many enzymes and hormones in our body.

568
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:37,480
Our heart and brain and every organ becomes more active when we feel than very, very good.

569
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,720
You humans only enjoy to be in the sun, but for us, it is the greatest pleasure you can

570
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
imagine.

571
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,700
Maybe like your sexual excitement.

572
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,440
We also enjoy to swim in very warm water or other liquids to rise our body temperature.

573
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,600
If we are for some hours in the shadow, our temperature goes back to 30 to 33 degrees.

574
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,240
This can cause no harm to us, but we feel much better in the sun.

575
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:12,640
They become horny sun lizards when exposed to sunlight.

576
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,800
And they say artificial sunrooms in the underground, but it's not the same for us in the real sun.

577
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Okay.

578
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Question.

579
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
What do you eat?

580
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Answer.

581
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:29,560
Generally various things like you, flesh, fruit, flesh, who says flesh?

582
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Right away.

583
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,520
If a reptilian told me I eat flesh, I might have to, I might have to like actively defend

584
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
myself.

585
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
Who says flesh?

586
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:44,960
Just say meat, generally various things like you flesh, fruit, vegetables, special kinds

587
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,000
of fungus from subterranean farms and other things.

588
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,840
We can also eat and digest some substances which are poisonous for you.

589
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:58,280
The main difference between you and us is that we must eat flesh because our body needs

590
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,440
the proteins.

591
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,440
We can't live completely vegetarian like your kind because our digestion would stop working

592
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,840
and we would die after some weeks or maybe months without flesh.

593
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,880
Many of us eat raw flesh or other things which would be disgusting for you.

594
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,280
Personally, I prefer cooked flesh and surface fruits like apples or oranges.

595
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Question.

596
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,360
Can you tell me something about the natural history and evolution of your species?

597
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,960
How old is your species?

598
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,600
Have you evolved from primitive reptiles as mankind has evolved from apes?

599
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,120
Nice segue, by the way.

600
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,120
I would also have segued past that.

601
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,200
After she said flesh nine times, I'd be like, are you hungry right now?

602
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Do you want to?

603
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,560
Can I get you a little sandwich or something?

604
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,660
This is more of like a longer answer as well.

605
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,200
This is a very long and complex story and it sounds certainly unbelievable to you, but

606
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
it's the truth.

607
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,400
I will try to explain it in short.

608
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,480
Around 65 million years ago, many of our unadvanced ancestors from the dinosaur race died in a

609
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,200
global cataclysm.

610
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,120
The reason for this destruction was not a natural disaster, an asteroid impact as your

611
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,680
scientists believe falsely, but a war between two alien groups that took mainly place in

612
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,880
the orbit and high atmosphere of your planet.

613
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,680
According to our limited knowledge about the early days, this global war was the first

614
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,800
alien war on planet Earth, but it was definitely not the last.

615
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,120
The future war is coming soon, while a cold war as you call it between alien groups is

616
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,520
ongoing since the last 73 years on your planet.

617
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,800
The opponents in this 65 million year old war were two advanced alien species whose

618
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,400
both names are again not pronounceable for your tongues.

619
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,040
I'm able to say them, but it would hurt your ear if I tell you the names in their original

620
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
way.

621
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,400
One race was humanoid, like your species, but much older, and was from this universe,

622
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:02,280
from a solar system in the star constellation you call Procyon today in your maps.

623
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,180
The other species about which we know not so much was a reptilian species, but they

624
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:13,640
have nothing to do with our own species because they have evolved from local saurians without

625
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,040
exterior influence, except the successful manipulation of our own genes by us.

626
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:27,280
Okay, so two races, one humanoid, one reptilian, but they evolved in a more unaided way from

627
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,160
their saurian ancestors or dinosaurs.

628
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,800
And she says more about that later.

629
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,000
The advanced reptilian species came not from this universe, but from a, well, how should

630
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,220
I explain it to you?

631
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,720
Your scientists have not really understood the true nature of the universe because your

632
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:50,560
is not able to see the easiest things and relies on wrong mathematics and numbers.

633
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,660
This is part of the genetic programming of your kind to which I will come later.

634
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,160
Let me say that you are nearly as far away from the understanding of the universe as

635
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,640
you were 500 years ago.

636
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,160
That makes sense to me.

637
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,800
I feel like we might have even been closer 500 years ago to understanding the true meaning

638
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,720
of the universe versus now, because I think now we're able to sort of dissect and study

639
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,880
the universe a little bit more.

640
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:24,960
But that brings us nowhere closer to perhaps a deeper spiritual, you know, existence here

641
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
in this universe.

642
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,540
To use a term, you will maybe understand the other species came not from this universe,

643
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:37,480
but from another bubble in the foam of the omniverse, okay, a bubble in the foam of the

644
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,480
omniverse.

645
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,480
Cool.

646
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,320
I like the idea of the universe as being foam bubbles.

647
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,980
You would call it maybe another dimension, but this is not the right word to describe

648
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,980
it correctly.

649
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,880
By the way, the term dimension is generally wrong in the way that you understand it.

650
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,620
The fact you should remember is that advanced species are able to walk between bubbles by

651
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:03,240
use of, as you would call it, quantum technology, and sometimes in special ways, only by use

652
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,480
of their mind.

653
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,240
My own species had also advanced mental abilities in comparison to your species, but we are

654
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:17,400
not able to do the mastering, the master string slash bubble changing without technology.

655
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:23,680
But other species active on this planet are able and this looks to you like magic as it

656
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
had to your ancestors.

657
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,680
Okay.

658
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
That's cool.

659
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,360
I like the idea of traveling through dimensions like in the scale of evolution, you would

660
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:39,280
have sort of like us being at the bottom of the totem pole, a little bit higher would

661
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,200
be perhaps somebody that can manipulate gravity with a craft.

662
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,600
Even higher than that is using more technology to now penetrate through these dimensions.

663
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,120
And even higher than that would be some type of species which has reached this spiritual

664
00:44:54,120 --> 00:45:00,200
apotheosis and who can now travel through dimensions by simply using intention.

665
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,600
I mean that, you know, sounds like very peak evolution to me.

666
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,920
Back to our own history.

667
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,480
The first species, the humanoids, had reached Earth around 150 years before the reptilians

668
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,920
and they built some colonies on the former continents.

669
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,840
There was a large colony on the continent you call Antarctica today and another one

670
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,560
on the continent you call Asia today.

671
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,000
These people live together with animal like saurians on the planet without problems.

672
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Okay.

673
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,040
So animal like saurians being the dinosaurs.

674
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,440
When the advanced reptilian species arrived in this system, the humanoid colonists from

675
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,640
Procyon tried to communicate peacefully, but they were not successful and a global war

676
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,020
started within months.

677
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,680
You must understand that both species were interested in this young planet, not for its

678
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,280
biology and underdeveloped species, but for only one reason, raw material, especially

679
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,280
copper.

680
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,500
To understand this reason, you must know that copper is a very important material for some

681
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:04,020
even today, because it is, together with some unstable materials, able to produce new stable

682
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:09,320
elements if you induce a high electromagnetic field in the right angle with a high nuclear

683
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,520
radiation field to produce an over-crossing of fluctuating fields.

684
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,980
The fusion of copper and other elements in such a magnetic radiation field chamber can

685
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:25,100
produce a force field of special nature that is very useful for various technological tasks.

686
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:30,420
If there is a physicist out there that understands what the heck I just said, please leave a

687
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,820
detailed comment below.

688
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:38,540
I might otherwise be inclined to use my own personal GPT assistant to help me dissect

689
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,540
some of this.

690
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,540
And that's exactly what I'm going to do.

691
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,580
I'm going to read this to Chad GPT, see what she says.

692
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,820
Does this make sense?

693
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:51,900
And can you please deliver that verdict to me in a way that a eighth grader would understand?

694
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,580
So it says, yes, the idea in the document makes some sense, but it's also highly theoretical

695
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,800
and not something science has fully proven.

696
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,660
It sounds like it's describing a way to change materials and create special force fields

697
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,740
using a mix of strong magnetism, radiation, and copper.

698
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,180
Copper is important because it might help create new elements.

699
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:13,060
If you blast copper with a strong magnetism and nuclear radiation at just the right angles,

700
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,540
you might cause a reaction where the atoms behave in a new way.

701
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,540
Okay.

702
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:22,380
Final verdict, the idea isn't impossible, but it's also not confirmed science.

703
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,360
Some of it sounds like real physics, while other parts feel theoretical or even sci-fi

704
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,960
level speculation.

705
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,780
If true, it could be connected to exotic technology, possibly even things like advanced propulsion

706
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,260
or force fields.

707
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,260
Cool.

708
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:42,520
I like the Chad GPT also has an open mind that that gives me some hope, but it says,

709
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,260
but the base for this is an extremely complex formula you are not able to discover because

710
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,420
of the restrictions of your simple mind.

711
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:54,020
Can we stop with the condescending alien language?

712
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,860
You don't have to remind us at every turn that we are inferior.

713
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:04,180
Need I remind you of our genetically superior appendages?

714
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:12,220
Also strange to me is that they would be so advanced, so much superior, so much better,

715
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,740
but we have the sun.

716
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:20,940
The one thing that gives them the most pleasure in the world is the sun, and they don't bask

717
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,940
in it every day.

718
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,580
They use artificial suns.

719
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:33,940
To me, that's a bit of a red flag because the things that we do, human beings, for these

720
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,660
types of arousal, some humans will stop at nothing.

721
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,060
If it meant coming out from these caverns, so be it.

722
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,700
I just find it weird that they're, but maybe we get into that.

723
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,420
Maybe the answer in here clarifies that a little bit.

724
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,740
Both species wanted to have the copper of planet earth, and for this reason they fought

725
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,660
a not very long war in space and orbit.

726
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,780
The humanoid species seemed to be successful during the first time, but in the last battle

727
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:05,180
the reptilians decided to use a mighty experimental weapon, a special kind of fusion bomb, which

728
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,100
should destroy the life forms on the planet, but should not harm the valuable raw materials

729
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,420
and the copper.

730
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:15,820
The bomb was fired from space and detonated at a point of your planet called middle America

731
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,820
today.

732
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:21,580
As it detonated in the ocean, it produced an unpredictable fusion with hydrogen, and

733
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,060
the effect was much stronger than the reptilians had expected.

734
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:31,260
A deadly radiation, an overproduction of fusion oxygen, a fallout of different elements, and

735
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:36,100
a nuclear winter for nearly 200 years were the results.

736
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,340
Most of the humanoids were killed and the reptilians lost their interest on the planet

737
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,760
after some years for, even for us, unknown reasons.

738
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,460
Maybe because of the radiation.

739
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,820
Planet earth was on its own again, and the animals on the surface died.

740
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,220
By the way, one result of the fusion bomb was the fallout of different elements and

741
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:59,060
the materials created in the burning process, and one of that material was iridium.

742
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:03,780
Your human scientists today see the iridium concentration in the ground as evidence for

743
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,700
an asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs.

744
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,300
That is not true, but how should you know that?

745
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,300
Okay, interesting.

746
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,220
I don't know enough about paleontology to confirm or deny that, but I think that's an

747
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,540
interesting part of the story.

748
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,620
Well, most of the dinosaurs died.

749
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,740
Not all in the detonation, but in the bad things which came after the war, especially

750
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,100
in the nuclear winter and in the fallout.

751
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:28,380
Nearly all dinosaurs and reptilians were dead within the next 20 years.

752
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:34,300
Some of them, especially those in the oceans, were able to survive for the next 200 to 300

753
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,580
even in this changed world.

754
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,500
But these species also died because the climate had changed.

755
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:47,260
The nuclear winter ended after 200 years, but it was colder on earth than ever before.

756
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:53,060
Despite the cataclysm, some species were able to survive, like fish, like the sharks or

757
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,940
birds or little creepy mammals, your ancestors.

758
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:03,820
As if she called us little creepy mammals, various reptiles like crocodiles, and there

759
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:08,020
was a special kind of small but advanced dinosaur which had developed together with

760
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:13,780
the last large animal reptilians like the species you call Tyrannosaurus.

761
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:18,140
This new reptile was walking on two legs and looked a little bit like your reconstruction

762
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,220
of an iguanodon.

763
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:26,460
It's originated in this family, but it was smaller, around one and a half meters tall

764
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:32,020
with some humanoid features, a changed bone structure, a larger skull and brain, and a

765
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:38,460
hand with a thumb that was able to grab things, a different organism and digestion, advanced

766
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:44,140
eyes in the middle of the head, like your eyes, and most important, with a new and better

767
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,500
brain structure.

768
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,620
This was our direct ancestor.

769
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:52,620
There are theories that the radiation of the bomb took part in the mutations of the organism

770
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,380
of this new breed, but this is not proven.

771
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:01,500
Nevertheless, this little humanoid-like dinosaur evolved during the following 30 million years,

772
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,380
and I've said earlier a species need generally more time to evolve than you think if the

773
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,020
evolution is not artificially induced like in your case.

774
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,220
These beings were intelligent enough to not die in the next millions of years because

775
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,020
they learned to change their behavior.

776
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,220
They lived in caves instead of in the cold nature, and they learned to use stones and

777
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:25,660
branches as first tools and used fire as to help warm them, especially to warm their blood,

778
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,900
which is very important for our kind to survive.

779
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:33,900
During the next 20 million years, this species was divided by nature into 27 subspecies.

780
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,540
Unfortunately, former reptilian species were prone to divide themselves in a more or less

781
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,860
illogical way into subspecies during the evolution process.

782
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:47,900
You can clearly see this in the unnecessary high number of animal dinosaur species in

783
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,260
earlier times, okay?

784
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:55,220
And there were many mainly primitive wars between the subspecies for dominance.

785
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,220
I mean, no way to disprove that.

786
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:03,740
Well, nature was not very friendly to us, and as far as we know, the 27 subspecies were

787
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:09,420
extincted in primitive wars and in evolution because their organism and mind was not developed

788
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,820
enough to survive, and as a main reason, they were not able to change their blood temperature

789
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,700
in the right way when the climate changed.

790
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:21,900
50 million years after the war and after the dinosaurs, only three, now also technological,

791
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:27,340
advanced reptilian species were remaining on this planet together with all the lower

792
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,340
animals.

793
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,340
Okay.

794
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:34,640
Through natural and artificial crossbreedings, these three species were united to one reptilian

795
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,740
species and through the invention of genetic manipulations, we were able to eliminate the

796
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:43,180
dividing prone genes in our genetic structure.

797
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:48,100
According to our history and belief, this was the time when our final reptilian race,

798
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:52,100
as you see me today, was created by use of genetic engineering.

799
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,820
This was around 10 million years ago, and our evolution nearly stopped at that point.

800
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:00,640
Well, actually, there were some minor changes in our look toward a more humanoid and mammal-like

801
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,260
appearance during this coming ages, but we have not divided again into subspecies.

802
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:11,220
You see, we are a very old race in comparison to your kind, which was jumping around to

803
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:16,860
small monkey-like animals in the trees at this time while we invented technology, colonized

804
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:21,020
other planets of the system, built large cities on this planet, which disappeared without

805
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:26,180
a trace in the ages, and engineered our own genes while your genes were still those of

806
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,180
animals.

807
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,540
Again, the condescension is palpable here.

808
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,020
You can cut it with a knife.

809
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:36,220
10 million years ago, the small simians started to grow and they came down from the trees

810
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,740
to the ground, again, because of the change of the climate, especially on the so-called

811
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,760
African continent.

812
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,860
But they evolved very slow, as it is normal for a mammal, and if nothing extraordinary

813
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,080
had happened to your kind, we wouldn't be able to sit here and talk, because I would

814
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,640
sit in front of my comfortable modern house, and you would sit in your cave, clothed with

815
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,140
fur, trying to discover the secrets of fire.

816
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,840
Or you'd maybe sit in one of our zoos, wow.

817
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:08,280
But the things had developed differently, and you believe you are the crown of creation,

818
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,220
and you can sit in your modern house, and we must hide and live beneath the earth and

819
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,060
in remote areas.

820
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,080
Around 1.5 million years ago, another alien species arrived on earth.

821
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,320
It was surprisingly the first species since over 60 million years.

822
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,320
This would be more surprising for you if you would not know how many different species

823
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,040
are here today.

824
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:32,880
The interest of this humanoid species, you call them Elojim today.

825
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,960
Elohim?

826
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,160
Is it Elohim?

827
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,840
Is that like the Anunnaki type deal?

828
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:45,560
So it's a Hebrew word that's like a divine being, okay, so like an angel or a divine being,

829
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,560
I see.

830
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,020
You call them Elohim today.

831
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:54,480
Was not the raw material and the copper, it were, to our astonishment, the unadvanced

832
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,120
ape humanoids.

833
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,480
Wow.

834
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,560
So the interest wasn't the copper, it was us, okay?

835
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:06,320
Despite of our presence on this planet, the aliens decided to help the apes to evolve

836
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,480
to serve them in the future as some kind of slave race in coming wars.

837
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,960
The fate of your species was not really important for us, but we didn't like the presence of

838
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:22,300
the Elohim on our planet and they didn't like our presence on their new galactic zoo planet.

839
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:28,800
And so your sixth and seventh creation was the reason for a war between us and them.

840
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:34,720
You can read about that war, for example, partly in the book you call the Bible.

841
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,720
In a very strange way of description, the real truth is a very long and difficult story.

842
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,720
Should I continue?

843
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,640
Yes, but not today.

844
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,600
That'll be it for the read through today.

845
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:53,720
Now 15 pages we've covered, which means this will probably be a four part series in total,

846
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,680
maybe five, maybe three, but I definitely need to know if you guys want to see more

847
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,680
of this.

848
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,680
Do you want me to keep reading through it?

849
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:07,480
I will happily read through it if this video reaches its intended audience.

850
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:12,400
And I hope it does, because this stuff just really gets my gears going.

851
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,240
In terms of creative thinking, you know, I think it's interesting to think that there

852
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:26,260
were some ancient civilizations living alongside the Saurian, you know, animal population.

853
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:31,380
And the fact that humanoids were sort of at war with these reptilians or these different

854
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:37,380
type of reptilians and that they evolved next to us while, you know, and then, you know,

855
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:43,100
we get a small glimpse of the Elohim coming in at the end and really using us and this

856
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:52,940
falls into a lot of the Anunnaki Nephilim sort of territory as well, where if I'm not mistaken,

857
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:59,180
they also genetically engineered man and made, you know, this race of slaves to like

858
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:05,140
mine gold or whatever it was, but it seems like that's falling into this type of lore

859
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,560
and it's kind of coalescing.

860
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:11,780
So I'm really interested to see how many more points of connection we can find once we move

861
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:16,840
forward and it seems like we're going to get into the heavy stuff real soon.

862
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:23,240
We did cover a lot of the physiology, you know, some of the history, but I would also

863
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:30,420
like to know more about perhaps the provenance, like where did those races come from?

864
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,060
What star system are they from?

865
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:35,680
And more importantly, what are the reptilians doing right now?

866
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,980
Why aren't they taking over?

867
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,640
Are they being stopped or suppressed?

868
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,640
I don't know.

869
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,680
Very interesting stuff.

870
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,940
Maybe you guys have found some connections that I've missed and I would love to hear

871
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,740
that if that was the case.

872
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:51,580
Also, if you want to be engaging with me in different conversations, I'm always on Discord,

873
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,940
by the way.

874
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:59,900
If you guys want to join a really cool community of open minded people who are together with

875
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:05,180
me collectively, learning about all this stuff, some of us for the first time, don't be shy.

876
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,180
Don't be a stranger.

877
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,180
Come on by to Discord.

878
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,180
It's totally free.

879
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,640
Links in the description.

880
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,700
Thank you all so much for being so supportive on this channel and following me through this

881
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,700
incredible journey.

882
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:18,500
I am very grateful and humbled by your presence.

883
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,500
Thank you so much.
