1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Hello, I'm in.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,080
I had a friend who was working with me at my counseling center for many years.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,320
He revealed to me that he was in fact an alien, which sounded superficial, and he could have

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,320
been a good liar until he was able to demonstrate that he was more than just a human.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,040
And he was friends with me for many years, and I never knew it until he was able to demonstrate

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,040
this to me.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:40,320
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to a very special episode of Debriefed.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,080
My name is Chris Ramsey, and today I'm here to introduce you a conversation that I had

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,640
recently with Randall Nickerson.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,160
I just wanted to come here to sort of preface the interview.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,760
For those of you unfamiliar with Randall's story, him and his sister Glinda have been

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,320
abducted multiple times.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,220
They were featured in the 90s on shows like Oprah and Good Morning America.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,040
One of Dr. Mac's patients, Randy, here says his abduction occurred while he was awake.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:14,960
They had put me out for a little over an hour, and when I came to...

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,000
And yeah, I have a hard time with this.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,880
Why?

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
Because I don't want to believe it, and I really don't.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
Why?

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
It...

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:39,960
I mean, it's totally made me question what life's about, and it's stirred my life up

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
a lot.

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,200
It was a very popular case of abduction, which pretty much upended their lives, especially

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Randall's.

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
To this day, Randall has a pretty hard time talking about it, and has since basically

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,240
turned his entire life into reporting on and investigating the UFO and NHI phenomenon.

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,480
Now, this was a last-minute podcast.

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Nothing was planned.

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,560
He just happened to be in town, and out of respect for Randall, he didn't want to talk

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,460
about his own personal abduction story, and I didn't want to press him on that either.

31
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,160
But Randall's story isn't simply defined by his abduction.

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,920
See, Randall is also an amazing filmmaker and documentarian, and recently he put out

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,120
the documentary, The Ariel Phenomenon.

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,920
From all over Zimbabwe, we were phoning the BBC to say, we've seen something weird.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,480
There were three of us that saw it.

36
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,880
Myself, the copilot, and the pilot in the other aircraft.

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
No wings.

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
No nothing.

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
Shiny over thing.

40
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Ariel, school 19th, September 94.

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,560
Did you tell me what you saw on Friday?

42
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,040
The silver thing in amongst this clump of trees.

43
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,720
We saw this black figure running.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,320
His face was like this, and his eyes were down here.

45
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,360
I just thought it was some kind of failure from a different point.

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,160
When you looked at those children, they were absolutely credible.

47
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,920
And whereabouts was it?

48
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,800
Dishonored in the trees over there.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,720
There was a big group of kids pointing and making noise and shouting and screaming.

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,560
The panic spread.

51
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,200
Am I safe or am I not safe?

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,880
These are Harvard psychiatrists.

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,400
Meet Dr. John Mack, a believer in aliens from outer space.

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,680
We came away convinced that an extraordinary event occurred here.

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,120
I think they want people to know that we're actually making harm on this world.

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,800
Would you like to see him again?

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Yes.

58
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,400
And if you saw him again, what would you do?

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,200
I'll ask him some questions.

60
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,120
What would you like to ask him?

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,520
I'll ask him, what is he doing on Earth and what does he want with us?

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,160
Basically picking up John Mack's work of where he left off and continuing his research into

63
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,280
the mass sighting that took place in Rua Zimbabwe.

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,680
Over 60 children reported seeing this craft and two beings exiting this craft.

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,280
They subsequently drew images and even wrote down exactly what they remember happening.

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,560
And I also just want to say that at times Randall during this podcast will seem a little

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,680
bit reluctant to talk about certain things.

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,840
And that definitely stems from his own personal experiences.

69
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,000
So this is just to give you a little bit of context on who he is.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,360
He recently also appeared on the Danny Jones podcast and I highly recommend you check that

71
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,960
out if you want to know a little bit more about his personal history.

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
Stick around after the podcast if you like.

73
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,280
We recorded a little extra podcast for the interns only and you can do that by going

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,600
to Patreon or clicking join on the memberships.

75
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,760
And yeah, thanks for watching.

76
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,840
First of all, thank you so much for doing this Randall.

77
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,880
It was a pleasure.

78
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,100
We got to know each other in the last couple of days, spent New Year's together.

79
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,040
Just a joy to meet you and to get to know you as a person in the little time that we

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
had.

81
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
It was just really pleasant.

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,880
So really made my New Year's meeting you.

83
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
So thank you for that.

84
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,840
For those of you who don't know Randall's work, we're going to be talking about a lot

85
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,920
about something that's extremely fascinating.

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:23,940
One of the biggest cases in history in terms of mass sighting, Randall's a really good

87
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,320
filmmaker known for his documentary, Ariel Phenomenon.

88
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,840
And it just highlights one of the most significant sightings in human history that was ever

89
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,640
documented initially by like John Mack.

90
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,120
And then you kind of picked up the torch and continued that and then developed relationships

91
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,400
obviously with the people there.

92
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,720
And this case, you know, not only is just awesome in terms of data for people who are

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,520
interested in ufology, but for you became a really big part of your life.

94
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,680
Like that you, this case is really, really close to you.

95
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,720
And so, you know, for me, it's a bit of an honor to even be able to talk about this case

96
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,520
with you because I think like you'll be the closest person to that event that I'll possibly

97
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
ever meet.

98
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
Right.

99
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,360
So for me, this is this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity.

100
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
So thank you for being here.

101
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Thank you.

102
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Thank you.

103
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,520
I mean, I really appreciated meeting you and love the magic, bro.

104
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Thank you.

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,120
It was really, I've enjoyed our time together a lot.

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,280
Like I feel, yeah, I like you genuinely like you as a person.

107
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Thank you.

108
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
I appreciate you.

109
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
You know, and that's nice.

110
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Yeah.

111
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,320
It's very disarming in a sense, you know, like, hey, I can be myself with you.

112
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
You know?

113
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Yeah.

114
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
I appreciate you.

115
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
I do appreciate you as well.

116
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,000
And didn't expect to do an interview or anything.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm like, hey, I like this guy.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I know.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is last minute.

122
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,520
But the magic thing is cool because you actually, you know, people might not know this about

123
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,000
you, probably don't know this about you, but you like dabbled a little bit in some sleight

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
of hand.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And, you know, we kind of connected on that the first first time I met you.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I was like, I do magic.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,100
And you're like, oh, and like, you're like, I did a little bit of that, too.

128
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,960
So I noticed when I was performing to like people, I see how you were looking at something

129
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,800
and how you're reacting to something is very similar to how I would react to something.

130
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,280
So you already had like a mind for it and understood that there was something behind

131
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
the trick.

132
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Mm hmm.

133
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
So that's cool.

134
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm still trying to figure out how that got on my I could get if it was one mark or that's

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
a crop.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Uh huh.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Like, I'm like, damn.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah.

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,160
That was really, really cool.

142
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm glad you like that.

143
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
It's a cool gift.

144
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,780
You know, I reminisced on it on the drive home and how it's such a cool gift because

145
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,420
you even said that you told me, you know, to be able to impart sort of wonder onto people.

146
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,180
It's just like a really nice gift to have.

147
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,740
And it just reminded me so much of that and like thinking about that because, you know,

148
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,500
I forget that sometimes to take it for granted that it's just a trick, you know, but I set

149
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,020
out learning it to give that gift of wonder.

150
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,940
And so thank you for reminding me of that.

151
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:26,420
That was it really made me think I was like it is I am lucky to have this sort of I don't

152
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,140
want to call it a gift, but you know, I've practiced it a lot.

153
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,580
But to have that to be able to share that people break the ice with people, I don't

154
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,580
know.

155
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,580
You know, it, it, it helps.

156
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,580
Yeah.

157
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,220
I mean, I don't even know where we would even start with this.

158
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,220
For people who aren't familiar, this was 1994.

159
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,220
Yes.

160
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,940
September 16th, 1994.

161
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,500
And it was in it was a town, right?

162
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,460
Town of Rua or?

163
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:01,660
It's on the border of Rua in a Gurumandi actually, but Rua is right.

164
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,900
It's right on the border at a primary school.

165
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,140
Basically K through seven.

166
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,220
How far removed from like the population is this is this school?

167
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,900
It's a little bit off the beaten path, isn't it?

168
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
It is.

169
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,900
Yeah.

170
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:30,220
You know, you get out there, there is villages, you know, and densely populated, Rua is very

171
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,900
densely populated village.

172
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,620
But it's, you know, the farmers actually started it in 91 because they were sending their kids

173
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,220
to Harare, which is the capital.

174
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,220
And is it the capital?

175
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
I think it is.

176
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,220
Oh, unfamiliar.

177
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Sorry.

178
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,220
Yeah, no.

179
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,900
I like to double check my work.

180
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,260
Harare Zimbabwe, yeah.

181
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:02,220
So yeah, the farmers were, you know, wanted to set up a school and there was a house and

182
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,180
then they built the school over the years.

183
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,300
And then they, you know, brought so the farmers kids, missionary kids, kids from all over

184
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,100
in the villages as well.

185
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,940
And it's just an amazing, it's a beautiful.

186
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
It's like a college campus.

187
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
It's huge.

188
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Really?

189
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,940
Real estate wise.

190
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:31,700
And so it's a beautiful school, beautiful people.

191
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,660
You know, it's not wealthy.

192
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,660
You know what I mean?

193
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,100
In a way, it's just not that way.

194
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,700
And people don't do it for that reason.

195
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,260
A lot of heart there.

196
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,540
And the people I met, I mean, all of them, the kids involved in the story, like when

197
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:57,700
I started way in 2007 and slowly got to know these people and the teachers and parents

198
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:08,140
and everybody involved in this case, yeah, you get to know them and love them as people.

199
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:19,180
I just have to mention because one of our, one of the kids had passed away, Emily.

200
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,660
Just it affected a lot of people.

201
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:36,860
She was 38 years old and just loved her as a creative person and heart.

202
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:46,180
She's in the film and I spent a lot of time with her and just saw her do some really just

203
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:52,940
giving from her heart to people that had less, you know, or were struggling, like little

204
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:59,460
moments I would see that and I don't even know what to say.

205
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:10,140
I think everybody that knew her is still in shock that she's no longer with us.

206
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,700
And I have to say the other kids too, like I call them kids, but they're, you know, they

207
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:24,300
were kids, but they're just, I feel like they, it's not been easy for them, you know, to

208
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:32,100
come forward or have me tell their story, you know, and then all these other people

209
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:38,100
come in with different intentions because, you know, when I was working on it, I was,

210
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,260
I knew it was a great story.

211
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,780
And then when other people found out, they kind of jumped in like, oh yeah, we want this,

212
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,260
you know, and they didn't have the same caring.

213
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,780
They see money signs.

214
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,500
Money signs and fame, you know.

215
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,540
That was never my purpose for now.

216
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Clearly, yeah.

217
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,100
I mean, even with, you know, you look at the final product, you can tell, you know, there's

218
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
heart there.

219
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,860
There's heart in your interactions.

220
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:09,460
And you know, I mean, there's one thing that I'll say, first of all, sorry for your loss.

221
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,460
I'm sorry for that and I know that, you know, I heard that you guys are very close and Luigi

222
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,340
as well, who's here off camera, by the way, he was also very close.

223
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:25,180
They're a family, I mean, they're an amazing family.

224
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,180
Wonderful people.

225
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:32,380
I went to the funeral and oh my God, like they are just tragic.

226
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,980
I mean, there were tears in that.

227
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,380
I don't think I've been to a funeral that I've heard so many people crying.

228
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:48,220
Yeah, she had a lot of effect on people and anyway, but the family just put out love and

229
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,860
respect to the family.

230
00:13:51,860 --> 00:14:01,500
Yeah, that, you know, as someone who is coming into this space with, you know, intentions

231
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:09,700
to shine a light on some of this, partially for my own curiosity, you know, admittedly,

232
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,980
but also to give people voice and make this a little bit normalized and stuff, you know,

233
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:22,660
going into this, but there is a sticky sort of situation that you can put yourself in

234
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,100
when speaking to experiencers because the last thing that I want to do is feel like

235
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,260
I'm exploiting anyone, right?

236
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:37,380
And that's, I think, I think just like extremely important to be aware of because, you know,

237
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,460
when dealing with people, you're not only dealing with people who are, who have seen

238
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,820
something amazing, you're dealing with people who are, you know, traumatized and, you know,

239
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,940
the last thing you want to do is, you know, be pushy or be like, but, you know, from your

240
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:58,060
angle coming into this, like, how aware were you of that?

241
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,740
Like a probably, I mean, hyper aware is my guess, but like, did you, like, how did you

242
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,620
navigate that?

243
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:12,980
You know, just like being very honest with them, like, I'm not here to, I'm here to really

244
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
hear your story.

245
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:24,860
Like, I'm not here to exploit it or to kind of understanding that what it was, was impactful.

246
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,700
I mean, anybody you talk to that's had this happen, they are going to remember it till

247
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,260
the day they die.

248
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:39,820
They will remember that time and that's the kind of experiences and it affects your whole

249
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,860
development depending on how old you were or whatever happens.

250
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:51,420
So just trust, you know, trying to say, you know, I really want to hear what, what, what

251
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,740
you went through.

252
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:02,060
It's been hard, I think, throughout history because people really don't understand what

253
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:09,220
people go through, the ontological shock of having, like, that's not supposed to exist

254
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:17,820
or be real and all of a sudden you can't go back there anymore because you've seen it,

255
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,060
you've seen it and it changes a lot for those people.

256
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:30,060
They go through so much that people don't realize it's sort of callously misunderstood.

257
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:36,740
And in that process, what happens is those people, you know, over time say, I don't want

258
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,020
to talk about it anymore, people don't understand, I'm not going to talk about it anymore.

259
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:50,380
So they get quiet over time, the more they are public, the more you're, you pay consequences

260
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,380
for that.

261
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,380
Yeah.

262
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:59,220
And it's unfortunate because it's really important that, that what witnesses have to say.

263
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,620
Yeah.

264
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,140
And I mean, that's, it's a great point and on top of that, you have also people trying

265
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:11,620
to actively shut you up, you know, which is like the counter, you know, energy to that.

266
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,460
You got people who are like, no, you need to share this and you got people being like,

267
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,620
if you share that, something bad is going to happen to you.

268
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:25,100
And so, you know, that's such a murky territory to, to navigate as a filmmaker, as a documentarian,

269
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,860
but also it's just a person trying to talk to somebody with an experience.

270
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,100
I mean, it's just such a touchy area.

271
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
It is.

272
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
It's very personal.

273
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,460
And with children even more so, I would think, right?

274
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,460
Yeah.

275
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,100
How were the, how were the parents with all of this?

276
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,220
When you were, you know, were they involved at any capacity?

277
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,500
Did you see any pushback?

278
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Did you?

279
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Oh yeah.

280
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Yeah, very much.

281
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,700
There, there was, well, it was mainly around religion, right?

282
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,380
And then it depended on, the fascinating thing about the school was the diversity in that

283
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:09,420
school, religious wise and people from all different colors and backgrounds from different

284
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
countries.

285
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,500
It was just, it was a really interesting mix of people.

286
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,900
You just don't really see in a lot of schools.

287
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:27,060
Yeah, it was very international, I would say, and you had, so you had the indigenous people

288
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:35,620
and you had missionaries and you had government, their children, you know, all over the place.

289
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:45,460
English, Australia, you just had every, so anyway, the piece is, that was interesting.

290
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:53,260
And then how each parent, the parents or how they interpreted it from what they were brought

291
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,260
up with.

292
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:03,180
Yeah, so, yeah, you had a few parents that were very pushing back big time, but you had

293
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:11,500
a lot of parents that were, that my child, you know, were very supportive of their children.

294
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,980
Like this is not, my child would not do this, right?

295
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,540
Like they knew their children well and they stood up for their children.

296
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540
Wow.

297
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,340
That was, like it's not even in the movie.

298
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,860
So much footage and interviews that I did that just didn't, it would have been a three

299
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,860
hour movie.

300
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,860
Yeah.

301
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,940
I mean, time was our biggest problem.

302
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,500
I wouldn't have minded.

303
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:42,340
I know we've been, that's the next thing is, you know, we wanted to do the director's cut.

304
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,620
It's still, yeah.

305
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,300
That's difficult though, as someone who, you know, I do a lot of editing myself.

306
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:57,140
Like when you're, when you got so much, you know, quote unquote gold, you know, in a project,

307
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,940
like chopping that up, it's got to be tough.

308
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,340
And they call it killing your babies.

309
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
Killing your babies.

310
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,340
Yeah, that's what I say too.

311
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
Yeah.

312
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,940
It's a tough job.

313
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,060
Is there, is there any scene in there that you kind of regretted not leaving in?

314
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,700
Was there anything that you were like, maybe that should have been in?

315
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:26,820
Not, I mean, for that time, we had to get it to, you know, it was an hour and 41.

316
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,700
Was that the mandate?

317
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,900
Basically an hour and a half, 90 minutes.

318
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:40,060
So we were a little over that, but that's the best we could do without, we had a three

319
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
hours solid.

320
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Yeah.

321
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Wow.

322
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,340
And so given the time constraints, I think it was well done.

323
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:55,020
Chris Seward was amazing editor and story editor.

324
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,740
But it was a challenge whittling it down.

325
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,220
Once we had the three hour, we're like, damn, this is really, really good.

326
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,900
But you know, people have to use the bathroom around that time period, an hour and a half.

327
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,380
So that's kind of why it's all based around that and the tensions, man.

328
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:20,380
But yeah, there's many scenes, you know, I was just showing Luigi and a few other people

329
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:29,300
the scene with Emily making the decision to go to Africa, which we didn't include in it.

330
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,460
But it's just, I love that scene.

331
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,460
Wow.

332
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
Yeah.

333
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,260
We shot it at NORAD up in the St. Adolf, I think.

334
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,860
Yeah.

335
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
The old NORAD base.

336
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
Yeah.

337
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,860
Beautiful.

338
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,340
Yeah.

339
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:47,540
So yeah, there's so many of the scenes and, you know, we had a good half hour just on

340
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:59,540
the spiritual, the natives, native indigenous chiefs and medicine men who we went to see.

341
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,300
And Emily went to see several of them with us.

342
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:09,420
And that was a very large piece that was really well cut together, but it was a half

343
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,420
hour.

344
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,420
Right.

345
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,420
Just that.

346
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,820
Because that's fascinating.

347
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,620
This is not new to them.

348
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,980
It's not new to them at all.

349
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,500
They weren't surprised by any of it?

350
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Oh, not at all.

351
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Wow.

352
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
They've seen them themselves.

353
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Did you find?

354
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,460
That was amazing because I'm shooting about Ariel.

355
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,460
And then the chief starts talking about like little details and I'm like, oh my God, he

356
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,020
has seen them himself.

357
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:40,700
Like and I want to stop everything and go, I want to, I need to take this guy and toss

358
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,300
him, you know, and I didn't get the chance to do that except with a few people, a few

359
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:53,900
of the medicine men chiefs, the village, you know, doctors, basically.

360
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,900
That's exciting.

361
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
They were so familiar with it.

362
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,660
It was just.

363
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,100
That was Emily with that.

364
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,380
Like the fact that like, was that comforting to her?

365
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,380
Was that?

366
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
Yeah.

367
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,380
Yeah.

368
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,380
Very much.

369
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,260
It must have been like so validating being like, oh, finally someone who gets it.

370
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Like.

371
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Yeah.

372
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,260
So we, in the movie, we show bits and pieces of that, but it was much more in-depth than

373
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
they.

374
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,260
Yeah.

375
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,100
That was, I mean, it was fascinating for me to be over in Africa.

376
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,140
Three trips I went, by the way, just three times I was, I spent a year and three months

377
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,140
in Africa.

378
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
Wow.

379
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Living there.

380
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,180
What was your, what was your favorite thing about Africa aside from, I know that the people

381
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,660
is amazing and the scenery is amazing, but what's, what's something that just like you

382
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,780
took home with you?

383
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,780
The wildlife.

384
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,420
The wildlife.

385
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,380
When I wasn't doing interviews, I was out.

386
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,380
Drive it self-driving.

387
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,380
Really?

388
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,380
Oh yeah.

389
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,380
What were you seeing?

390
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,380
Like.

391
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,380
Oh God.

392
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,380
Everything.

393
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,380
They got everything out there?

394
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,380
Everything.

395
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,620
Oh yeah.

396
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,620
Really?

397
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,260
I was out there for days and days and days.

398
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Wow.

399
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:09,180
Between interviews, I'd be like, okay, I found this child or person, one of the witnesses

400
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:15,300
or their parents or somebody else that witnessed it in the area, and I'm like, okay, I've got

401
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,340
three days and I would go into a park, you know?

402
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,340
Wow.

403
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,100
When I first got there, I went on a proper safari and I learned as much as I could, and

404
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:34,740
then I started meeting more people that basically were telling me this is what you don't do.

405
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
Yeah.

406
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
And do.

407
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,700
And then I got up enough courage to start going on my own, and then I, big thing was

408
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,260
camping with a Bushman, camping in a pup tent.

409
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
Out there.

410
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
Out there.

411
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
Oh my God.

412
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,300
Are you hearing all sorts of stuff at night?

413
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,140
Oh my God.

414
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:03,140
Like we were at the campfire, you know, you set your truck up, or the Range Rover, and

415
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:09,020
then your tent and the fire in a triangle, because you need to, you know.

416
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Defenses.

417
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,020
Yeah.

418
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,900
And so you'd see the reflection of the eyes of the hyena.

419
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Whoa.

420
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,060
They come up to the, about 50 feet away from the site, and they just lay down and just

421
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,780
watch for opportunity.

422
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,860
And then you hear the lions roaring, and you can hear them from miles and miles away.

423
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
They're so loud.

424
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,220
They rattle at your chest.

425
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,820
So once you, once that fire goes out, you better be in that tent or the vehicle.

426
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:41,540
So we were, and it's a, it's a serious, I have not had anything more serious than that

427
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,540
at Shard.

428
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,540
I bet.

429
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,540
It sounds incredible.

430
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:49,380
There's certain rules, you know, you don't allow them to see you.

431
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,620
They can smell you, but don't leave, you can't leave anything open window-wise.

432
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,460
You can't be like on your phone with the light shining your face at night type deal.

433
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,460
Can't let them see you.

434
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
Yeah.

435
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,540
Because if they see you and smell you, they're coming.

436
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,540
Oh.

437
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,220
It's just, yeah, it's a whole different thing.

438
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,020
And if you're near any body of water, you got to worry about the crocs because they

439
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
come out on land at night.

440
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
Wow.

441
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,140
They'll go like a mile away from the water at night.

442
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,140
Really?

443
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,140
Wow.

444
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
Yeah.

445
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
That's terrifying.

446
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,900
Everything.

447
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Everything.

448
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
Okay.

449
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Everything.

450
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,900
It has the potential to do that.

451
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
But, you know, it's so funny.

452
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
You'd be camping.

453
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Sorry.

454
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,900
I'm going on about this.

455
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
No, it's fine.

456
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,380
It was, it was, it was just magical.

457
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,380
Yeah.

458
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,820
And there was something weird about being there was like, I kind of know this, you know?

459
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,440
You felt familiar.

460
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:47,460
It oddly felt like I somehow, at some point I, I was familiar with that feeling.

461
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
Yeah.

462
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,260
I mean, it felt like home and a weird, I've never felt that.

463
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,740
It was like a past life type thing, maybe.

464
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
Maybe.

465
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740
Yeah.

466
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
Yeah.

467
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,740
I just, I'd never felt that anywhere like that.

468
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,500
But yeah, that's, oh.

469
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,420
What was the, what was the night sky like there?

470
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,620
I mean, I'm guessing because of the lack of light pollution, you must've had like some

471
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,420
amazing night, like sky watching.

472
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
Yeah, very much.

473
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,180
You ever see anything out there?

474
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180
That's all I'd be thinking about.

475
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,900
I'd be like seeing that many stars, checking out satellites and whatnot.

476
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,220
Well, yeah.

477
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:33,020
The thing about, everything's backwards because you're upside down on the ball.

478
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,300
Oh, weird.

479
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,580
So the sun rises in a different direction.

480
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:43,420
You see, you know, Orion upside down.

481
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
Right.

482
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,460
The moon rises, goes the other way.

483
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:52,060
It's, when you really pay attention, you're like, wow, this is, I'm on the bottom side

484
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,940
of a ball.

485
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,300
And so your perspective is completely, that fascinated me.

486
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Seeing a new sky.

487
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,300
Yeah.

488
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Yeah.

489
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,300
And the skies are just so dark.

490
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,300
Like you can see everything.

491
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Wow.

492
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Yeah.

493
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:12,900
I try to spend as much, they, they spend a lot of time outside, you know.

494
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,980
I probably would too.

495
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
Yeah.

496
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,980
Oh, it's beautiful.

497
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,060
The only thing you do have to worry about is the, everything killing you.

498
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,100
500 pound cat.

499
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,260
Being food is a problem.

500
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,940
Being just a, being just like a food with, with, with technology on you.

501
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,940
That's all you are.

502
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
Yeah.

503
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,940
All right.

504
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:39,900
So getting back to this sighting, this, okay, I'm going to encourage everybody to just go

505
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
watch the documentary.

506
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,060
I'm, you know, given a play by play, it's just much better to just go watch the documentary,

507
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,180
go get familiar with it.

508
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:54,460
You know, see for yourself, the, the truth that is spoken by these witnesses, that is

509
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:00,740
for me, I think one of the most compelling pieces of evidence.

510
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,580
And in today's day and age, even more compelling than possibly a 4k video, because that can

511
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,020
be faked.

512
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,140
You can, you can film something on 4k and I can ask chat GPT to like cook something

513
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,140
up pretty much.

514
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:20,620
You know, we're, we're almost there, but you can't fake, you can't fake these interactions.

515
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:27,180
And you know, as someone who's studied human psychology, you know, for magic and you can,

516
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,900
you can just tell, you don't even need to be an expert, but you can tell when you look

517
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:37,540
at someone, especially children, that, you know, and then I will, I will say as well

518
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,420
that like, sure, kids will embellish, kids will, you know, and lay it on thick sometimes

519
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,980
too.

520
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,540
But the core of what they're saying happened.

521
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,700
This happened to them.

522
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:56,180
What piece of information for you personally, were you like, oh shit, this is real.

523
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,540
Yeah, that's interesting.

524
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:06,340
So I, you know, I had just John Max material in the beginning, which was very moving, for

525
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,340
sure.

526
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,260
A lot of things I didn't understand what they were referencing, because it was from a different

527
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,500
culture.

528
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:21,820
So I kind of like, well, I think once I found the school was still there, and then I got

529
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,300
on a plane very quickly, like I have got to go there.

530
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,940
And that kind of opened up, you know, I wasn't convinced either way.

531
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,700
I mean, I knew these people were telling the truth.

532
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,820
It's pretty obvious that they're, you can tell, you know, I mean, people know when people

533
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,820
are truthful.

534
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
Yeah.

535
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,940
It's in the eyes and behavior.

536
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,940
It's hard to fake that.

537
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,420
I don't know if it's even possible.

538
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,660
I've never, never seen that really.

539
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,700
I got a good BS detector and yeah, that's what I first saw.

540
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:03,540
And then I was discovering more, well, then I first met the teachers that were there when

541
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,540
I went there.

542
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:09,540
And the first time, and yeah, I was like, well, what do you think?

543
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,540
It definitely happened.

544
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,660
I'm like, wow, that's interesting.

545
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:19,540
Like there were still three teachers that were still there, that were there at the time.

546
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,940
And I didn't know what to expect.

547
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:31,780
I was just showing up and doing like a pre-investigation, like, you know, and there were many steps

548
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:37,340
like of the teachers was, that was the first thing.

549
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:46,820
Then I started talking to the first witnesses, found all those people, and there was a progression

550
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:52,220
and I kept hearing the same in the eyes and the truthfulness of it, the directness of

551
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:59,580
it, that it was kind of a step process in a way.

552
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,820
The more I found out and the more people I met that had seen it, and it wasn't just the

553
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:10,500
kids at school, it wasn't just some of the teachers, it was a lot of people from outside

554
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,380
that area, which also wasn't in the film really.

555
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,820
Some of the archival was there, but there were others.

556
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,180
Just local interactions?

557
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,140
Yeah, within a range, within a radius of that location.

558
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:30,220
Yeah, because there was a lot of sightings in that area that were reported prior to that.

559
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:41,580
And one of them was, I had to look at what was going on in space because I had to look

560
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,580
at everything.

561
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,300
I mean, what was going on in space?

562
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,620
What satellite rocket bodies were coming in?

563
00:32:49,620 --> 00:33:00,380
We had sent up 130 rockets that year, so that means every three days something's fallen

564
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
through.

565
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,580
And a lot of stuff falls in Africa.

566
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,180
A lot of our launches end up in the Indian Ocean, and they have actually a whole museum

567
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,100
over there of rocket bodies and things that have fallen out of the sky that we have launched

568
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,460
or other countries have launched because they land in the desert in Africa.

569
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,460
Big pieces.

570
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,780
And so I looked into all that, and that was fascinating.

571
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,580
And the space shuttle was up that day.

572
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,980
So this is a huge piece.

573
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:38,940
So it was STS-64, was up in orbit that day, the very same day Ariel happened.

574
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:47,540
And they were doing the first untethered spacewalk of a human being from the shuttle.

575
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:53,500
It literally started two or three hours after the incident at Ariel.

576
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,500
It looks like you've got an object right in front of you, Mark.

577
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Can you look out there?

578
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

579
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Never mind.

580
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
It was monumental.

581
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,140
It was also one of the longest spacewalks at the time, also.

582
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:15,060
The Russians had been up a few, like a week earlier, and did their long spacewalk.

583
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:21,020
And then when we went up, and then we were testing this untethered, it was jetpack.

584
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,780
The first time we ever tested it in space.

585
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,380
So you could fly around without being tethered to the craft.

586
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,860
So it was a major, it's in the museum in Huntsville, Alabama.

587
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,860
It's an incredible coincidence.

588
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,860
Yeah.

589
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:42,060
I find it highly interesting because if anything, it was a human, a first for humans, a milestone.

590
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,740
They're in a museum for that reason.

591
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,740
They're in Huntsville.

592
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,580
Both of those safer packs, they were called Safer.

593
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:57,300
So that became a study for me, a lot of world events, what was going on at the time, what

594
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,700
was on movies, what was on TV.

595
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,700
Nobody knows all that.

596
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,940
I had to really dig deep to see.

597
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,220
Find the prosaic explanation.

598
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,220
Yeah.

599
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Yeah.

600
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,220
I was good with that.

601
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,500
That was where it led.

602
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,400
I was okay with that.

603
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:26,220
One of the things that really kind of moved me a lot was when I started to find the grade

604
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,100
one, grade two, people that were young at the time.

605
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:39,620
The ones they didn't interview because the headmaster made a decision, which I kind of

606
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:51,760
think was proper at the time because the younger kids were really much more upset too, right?

607
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,100
So they decided to keep the grade ones and twos and younger out of it.

608
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,620
They didn't interview them.

609
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,780
They didn't have them draw pictures or anything.

610
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:11,060
Then I started to find those kids and they're telling me what they saw and their perspective

611
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,760
and their memories.

612
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,740
That was really fascinating because they never got a chance to ... I had to find out, were

613
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,740
they actually there?

614
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,740
Yes.

615
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,740
Okay.

616
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,740
I got their name.

617
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,740
I know they were there.

618
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,740
Got the school pictures.

619
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,740
That's her.

620
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,740
That kind of tipped it for me.

621
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,820
Not that I didn't believe everybody else.

622
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,180
That was the point though.

623
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,180
That was like when you got there, you were like, this happened, this is real.

624
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,180
Yeah.

625
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:53,420
I just remember that, those interviews, because they never got a chance to speak about it

626
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,180
and they had never forgotten it and it was the same thing.

627
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,420
It was also the other witnesses too, but it was just ...

628
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,740
Certain excitement that they had talking about it that felt a little bit different.

629
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,820
Were they just eager to share it or were they also reluctant?

630
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,220
No, there was a lot of reluctance I had to deal with.

631
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:22,580
There were kids that were ... Yeah, they would not share ... There was no question it left

632
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,540
a very big impression on them and affected their lives.

633
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,100
These kids had also seen not just the craft, but ...

634
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
Creatures, yeah.

635
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,660
I came out of that, yeah.

636
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,100
And then I saw a lot of people struggling with religion.

637
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,980
What did this mean?

638
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
Was it the devil?

639
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,940
Was it ... I saw a lot of that struggle.

640
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:52,340
Yeah, so there were quite a few reluctant people.

641
00:37:52,460 --> 00:38:01,140
I found more of the reluctance from the males than the females to me, Frank.

642
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,100
It's always like that for some reason.

643
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:11,420
Men are like we're guarded, we're more sure of reality it seems like and for some reason,

644
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:20,160
I think naturally women are just a little bit more open to esoteric explanations of

645
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,320
things or spirituality in that case or just open to other options.

646
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:31,640
Maybe that softens the blow for them, ontologically speaking, like they don't go through the same

647
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,680
brick wall that we do.

648
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
I agree.

649
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:42,880
I think that is a thing where it's ... Males just have a very much harder not being in

650
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
control.

651
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,440
There's all the stigma or whatever that are put on men more than women.

652
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,600
Women have their own thing too.

653
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,480
I definitely noticed that quite a bit, the witnesses.

654
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,200
There was definitely moments where I was just like, oh yeah, this definitely happened, definitely.

655
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:17,680
There was obviously just like any major sighting, there's always a government presence that

656
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,080
tends to impose itself to try and control the situation.

657
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:27,240
What was it like with that?

658
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:36,640
I know there was that, but how much did that deter you or inspire you to keep going?

659
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,400
From the Zimbabwean government?

660
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Yeah.

661
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,720
Well, I had to be really careful with that.

662
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,600
It's a dictatorship.

663
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:58,080
At the time it happened, Tim Leach from the BBC finally found him, and Gunter, who's the

664
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,000
last surviving investigator who was on the scene, they all did excellent work at the

665
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,640
time.

666
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:14,440
They really did, but he had gone to the military to see, did you guys have this on radar?

667
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,160
Which they said their radar was down, and then people would report that I think they

668
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:26,640
were flying F4 Phantoms at the time, older hand-me-downs.

669
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,520
But people were seeing them flying really low altitude like they were looking for something

670
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,640
through that whole area, a lot of witnesses to that.

671
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,080
When I was in the country the first time, that was 2008, I wasn't supposed to be in

672
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
the country.

673
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,360
That's when the New York Times reporter got arrested.

674
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
When I flew out of-

675
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Wow.

676
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
Oh, yeah.

677
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
It was political violence.

678
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,680
People were being killed and tortured.

679
00:40:51,680 --> 00:41:00,120
That was the, I was also, was that not, I'm thinking 2008, 2007, 2008, was that not-

680
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,600
Egypt soon after.

681
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Yeah.

682
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,640
Was Iraq as well during that time, or was that before that?

683
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
I mean, there was a lot of global-

684
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
That was 2009.

685
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
That was 2009.

686
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Yeah, there was-

687
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
But there's global tensions.

688
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
Maybe at the same time.

689
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
Yeah.

690
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
Yeah.

691
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
Up and around that time.

692
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
Yeah.

693
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,360
Yeah, so I wasn't supposed to be there.

694
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:27,240
There's a State Department warnings and everything, and I stayed in a shack, no water, no heat,

695
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:37,600
I mean, cold water, and thanks to Nikki Carter, who was wonderful, helped me through.

696
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,120
She took the risk I took, no doubt about it.

697
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,360
I wish she could come on some of these shows.

698
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,580
She was originally one of the reporters who also interviewed these kids, so going back

699
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,900
to the footage, I had John, only had John Max footage in the beginning, and then I started

700
00:41:52,900 --> 00:42:01,300
to find other interviews done by Nikki Carter for SABC, the Dutch did it, there's another

701
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:09,120
guy from Germany went over there and recorded 42 of the kids, interviewed 42.

702
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:14,600
So I ended up with six or seven different archival sources, like, oh my God, that's

703
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:21,600
brilliant, and so that was one part of the whole thing, was just collecting what happened

704
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:28,680
at the time, what did people say, what did each individual child witness say, what did

705
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,820
the teachers say, what did the parents say, so I had a ton of that, and then it was real

706
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:41,660
time, 20 years later at that time, of a lot of those same people, and a lot of new people

707
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:49,140
I had no idea about, that had also witnessed this, yeah, that, oh man.

708
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:58,380
It's intense, it's an intense thing to happen to so many people, you know, you touched on

709
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:06,420
that this was like an international kind of, there was a lot of diversity in this school,

710
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,940
that obviously has to have something to do with the reason, right?

711
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:17,020
Boy, you know, I don't know what the reason, I still do not know.

712
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:23,460
If you had to take a stab in the dark, engine failure, or would it be, it would be deliberate,

713
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,460
wouldn't it?

714
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:31,100
I think it was deliberate, but my biggest thing to me is what was going on up in space

715
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,100
at the time.

716
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,940
I've been told, and I did find this, I did confirm this, somebody from, who's out publicly

717
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:46,500
a lot now, a military man, he said, you know, there's a lot of uranium mines right around

718
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:53,840
that area, and I didn't really, I wasn't out to search for the reason, but I did check

719
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,440
that out, and that is correct, you know, he's like, they're really interested in nuclear

720
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,680
material, and it doesn't really matter to me, but it's interesting that that was told

721
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,540
to me by that person, so, but I don't, I still don't know, I wasn't out to say, I have the

722
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:18,120
answers to this, right, I don't, and a lot of the witnesses don't, but they do, you know,

723
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:23,160
they saw what they saw and they reported it, it was very consistent.

724
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,960
You know, this is just one incident out of, guys, only knows how many around the world

725
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,880
have met so many other people, you know, that have seen this from every single country on

726
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:42,000
this planet, same kind of thing, whether there's two of them or, you know, and also, one of

727
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,640
the things I've found really interesting with the research was the number of schools, primary

728
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:57,280
schools, essentially, mostly schools of that age range that had had similar incidents

729
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,920
all over the, all over the world, and I started collecting all these newspaper clippings,

730
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:12,600
people would send them to me, Westall, Chile, my gosh, there's so many, really, yeah, probably

731
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:19,360
Brazil I'm guessing as well, Brazil, oh my gosh, and I keep hearing more about it, somebody

732
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:25,320
did write, Preston Dennett, I believe, wrote a book on school sightings, we were, yeah,

733
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:33,200
he was kind of doing it at the same time, so that's an interesting aspect is the children

734
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,680
and why, yeah, that's a whole nother.

735
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:43,000
Yeah, I mean, there's also, you know, the idea that if you're going to ask someone a

736
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
question, right, and you want them to be truthful, two types of people you can count on is a

737
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,840
child or a drunk, right, this is, you know, you don't, you don't count on a politician

738
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:02,800
to tell you the truth, you know, or anyone else with an agenda, yeah, you got to people

739
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:09,640
who have, you know, no sort of social inhibition, it'd be nice to have leaders that actually

740
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,600
told us the truth, it really would be nice.

741
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:18,080
Yeah, absolutely, but, you know, unfortunately, I don't think that's just part of our system,

742
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:25,800
so we got to depend on people like yourself to report on it, you know, for those of us

743
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,880
seeking it.

744
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:35,520
Have you felt since you've been there and since you've looked into that particular case,

745
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,840
have you seen a difference in how the world looks at the phenomenon?

746
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,600
Oh, yeah, very, very much.

747
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:49,880
And has that changed how you sort of investigate the phenomenon yourself?

748
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,880
Now?

749
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,080
Yeah.

750
00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:01,600
We were in the edit room working on the final in 2017, we're all sitting there and there's

751
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:08,480
a TV up on the, you know, there's a whole deck of screens up top, and the TV is in

752
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,680
the center on the news, and we're all sitting there editing the film, me and two editors,

753
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,000
Chris and Rick, and all of a sudden, the New York Times thing is on the news, and we're

754
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,200
sitting there like, holy shit, like it was a moment, we took pictures because we're all

755
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,240
like, this is big.

756
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,880
And we're working on a movie at the same time about this very subject.

757
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:42,040
And it was interesting to see that transition and how it's continued to now, I mean, I go

758
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:48,000
out, if I go out to dinner or something, and I run into friends, we're talking about it,

759
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,940
like they would, they would never ever, you know, some of the guys that hang out are mechanics

760
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,280
and hardcore, I love them, race car driver, whatever.

761
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,760
People that do hardcore physical stuff, they're not the one, they don't tend to believe in

762
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,520
anything they can't hold in their hand.

763
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,880
And now we're having conversations like that, I never thought would happen, to be honest.

764
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
Wow.

765
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,880
Yeah.

766
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,880
So it has changed a lot.

767
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,520
And then watching that change through the making of the film, because when I started,

768
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,280
nobody was really like me.

769
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:32,080
But you're also, I think, an important part of that change itself, like, I mean, you're

770
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,720
also to thank for that, like, you've taken some steps in your life and in your career

771
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,160
to, you know, obviously be public about a lot of things.

772
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:48,360
And you know, that on whatever capacity moves the needle, right?

773
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:54,360
A lot of people have, but a lot of, you know, people have been speaking up about this for

774
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,040
since the 1950s.

775
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:02,120
If you look at the documentaries from the 1950s and 60s, it's the same thing.

776
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:07,120
They've got footage of it, you know, like, it's the same.

777
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:20,120
When I was, Dan Aykroyd had helped me, like, he did a trailer for me and spoke about it.

778
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:26,280
It's there and I know viewers that are watching this, they will see it and they will feel

779
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,840
kind of vindicated and they'll go, you know, boy, those kids are telling the truth.

780
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,680
And I was telling the truth when I had my experience and it will, it's going to provide

781
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,320
a lot of reinforcement.

782
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,760
He kept saying, he's like, there's nothing new here.

783
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,560
We're just rehashing what we already know.

784
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
And he's right.

785
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,920
I didn't realize what he was saying at the time until I started going back to all those

786
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
old documentaries.

787
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:56,360
I was like, oh my God, it's the same story, the same things that people have reported.

788
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,720
We are in a different day, I think.

789
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,800
We're getting a little more truth.

790
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,800
I get a kick out of it.

791
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:07,600
Like, well, we're trying to remove the stigma, right, Congress and the DOD and Air Force.

792
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:13,760
But at the same time, we're going to give you a little truth and then throw you off

793
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,760
a little here.

794
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,800
It's just like, yeah, let's get to it.

795
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:27,800
You had a, you know, back in 56, whatever it was, was it Major Sampson, Sampson, what

796
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,800
was his name?

797
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,800
Kehoe?

798
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,400
He came forward like, and he was like, yeah, this is not our technology.

799
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,520
And he was saying a lot of the same things we're saying today about, you know, the drone

800
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:44,720
incursions where it's like, it's not ours, it's not theirs.

801
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,720
What does that leave you with?

802
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,160
You know, and that's kind of, like you said, we're repeating that.

803
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,480
But I think more people are listening now.

804
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:58,360
And I think more people are, and maybe it isn't even such that more people are believing

805
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,040
it, but more people are publicly believing it.

806
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:08,080
Because I think down to your core is, you know, we're all human, and we all kind of

807
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:12,440
have the same outlook in that we don't want to believe that we're alone.

808
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,040
There is that desire to not be alone in this place.

809
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:25,080
And so I think deep down, you know, we all kind of want it to some extent to be real.

810
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,840
But back then you just wouldn't vocalize that.

811
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,840
Yeah.

812
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,000
You know, and so there was a lot, it was a lot easier to suppress something.

813
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,600
I think in an era where people didn't find it socially acceptable to share these ideas

814
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,600
and thoughts.

815
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,600
True.

816
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,040
It's a lot harder to keep that in the pot.

817
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,560
You know, it's overflowing, it's brimming, we're trying to get it out there now.

818
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,200
And people are more willing to come forward, more celebrities, like look, Dan Aykroyd,

819
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,160
and you know, it's important to have these voices.

820
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,160
Absolutely.

821
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,640
I found it interesting, this whole the drone thing, because, you know, all of a sudden

822
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:07,920
everybody's, you know, is watching the skies and videotaping, you know, a lot of it's airplanes,

823
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,720
a lot of it is drones, right?

824
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:18,040
But there's a few, I'm like, well, that is definitely interesting there.

825
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:24,040
You know, so I don't think we've had that many cameras pointed at the sky all over the

826
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,040
world.

827
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,040
That's pretty unique.

828
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,840
And, you know, I'm not saying anything, just sort of like observing, like, this is interesting.

829
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,760
I mean, it could be a way to throw everybody off, like, oh, it's just drones, people are

830
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,760
saying, right?

831
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,440
But this has been going on for.

832
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,560
I mean, incursions like this have been going on since the 50s.

833
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,560
Yeah.

834
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,080
I mean, the military base thing and these secret sites, that's a big deal.

835
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:58,760
Lake and Heath back in the 50s, 80s, you know, well, Brentwater, and even, I mean, sightings

836
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,480
in Jersey, actually, which is big sightings.

837
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:09,920
thing is World of the Worlds, that was in New Jersey, 1938, like, testbed, like, that

838
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,160
was the first thing it hit me, it was like, well, that's interesting, New Jersey gets

839
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,160
it again.

840
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,160
Yeah.

841
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,760
How are people going to react?

842
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,480
Yeah, it's just a modern Orson Welles thing going on right now.

843
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,480
Maybe.

844
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,160
What the sightings that I'm finding really interesting are out in Arizona, Oregon.

845
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,200
Have you heard the ATC, Air Traffic Control?

846
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,440
Yep.

847
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,440
It's like six, seven pilots.

848
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,440
Yeah.

849
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,440
Yeah.

850
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,400
The radio, the communication between the pilots, this thing going coast to coast in seconds

851
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,120
and going out to the ocean.

852
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,120
Yeah.

853
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,120
Right.

854
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,320
We're seeing three or four targets, you know, they're all altitudes up and down, it's pretty

855
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,320
crazy.

856
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:57,960
Just had another one show up about my one o'clock, about a thousand feet high, zipping towards

857
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,000
us and then back out towards the ocean, it's red, red in color.

858
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Moving at extreme speeds, I don't even know how to describe that, but I'm 661, I'm on the

859
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
clock.

860
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I'm on the clock, Roger.

861
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You are cleared to maneuver as necessary, I left the right to avoid the USO out there

862
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
and all the reports you're giving us are good information, appreciate it.

863
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
So I've interviewed witnesses who've seen that exact same behavior.

864
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah, wow.

865
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
This is covering massive distances and doing really crazy stuff.

866
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And you're a pilot yourself.

867
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yeah.

868
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And so I don't know if anybody knows that, but like that's interesting because as a pilot,

869
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I feel like you're just a little bit more credible on these sightings, you know, just

870
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
from that standpoint alone.

871
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Well, you have to be, you know, you see a lot up there.

872
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yeah.

873
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And you learn, that's another thing I get a kick out of too, like people, a lot of people

874
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
have never really studied this guy and they're out there with cameras.

875
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah, Star Lincoln.

876
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Oh, I had a guy come in a couple of weeks ago.

877
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
He's like, dude, look at this.

878
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You have a line like that's Starlink though.

879
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, I've got a few of those.

880
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I mean, there's a lot to see out there and a lot to understand.

881
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And then when you see an actual anomaly, it's pretty clear, you know, and then you still

882
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
have to go through the process of examining and eliminating.

883
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You do.

884
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And you just have to.

885
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
But yeah, it's an air safety issue, you know, to be able to know what you're looking at,

886
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
knowing where a plane is going.

887
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
The reason they have a red and a green light on each side is it's crossing this way at

888
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
night.

889
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
You know, if you're seeing that red light, it's going that way.

890
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Right.

891
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yeah, because you're up there, you're not really sure what's moving.

892
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
If you're moving, if it's moving.

893
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
That's right.

894
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah.

895
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I mean, that's super interesting because, you know, that makes like that you mentioned,

896
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
even the Oregon pilot, you know, mentioned, like when you hear something like that as

897
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
a pilot, you take that more seriously.

898
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Oh my God.

899
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yeah.

900
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Because you know everything they're saying.

901
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's vetted.

902
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It's like.

903
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Well, and they know that pilots do not talk like that unless they're saying something.

904
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I mean, and the interesting about that, we're talking about the 13 minute drop.

905
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Yeah.

906
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So the controllers, a senior, more senior controller comes in and then there's a bunch

907
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
of controllers around.

908
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Does it take a picture?

909
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Can you send me a video?

910
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah, exactly.

911
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I got my number.

912
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I love that.

913
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
But that's exactly what would happen.

914
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It's so interesting too, like the community I'm around of pilots, like they're very, they're

915
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
pretty cool people.

916
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Hmm.

917
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Pilots see quite a bit, but they just do not talk about, they don't talk about it.

918
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It's touchy being a pilot.

919
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
You know, we spoke about this a little bit yesterday when, you know, if a, as someone

920
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
who has like, what is it, a class two or three, you know, you've got to watch what you say

921
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
because you could lose your license because you're, you're essentially, you're a threat

922
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
to, you know, many lives being, being a pilot, a commercial pilot.

923
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It's commercial.

924
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Yeah.

925
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And so if you say like, oh, you know, I have a history of dealing with depression, like

926
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
there goes your license.

927
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yeah.

928
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So you got to, you got to keep your mouth shut about things like that and you got to

929
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
suppress it.

930
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And that's really tough and puts them in a really bizarre situation when their people

931
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
were trying to count on for specific information.

932
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
We just, they just can't talk about it.

933
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Yeah, that's very true.

934
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
You know, it's for class three.

935
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It's like, yeah, I mean, that's general, general aviation.

936
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,000
But the commercial pilots, yeah, they, I've talked to many of them, interviewed, you know,

937
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
even one of the pilots that saw what he saw the night before Arrow, that night, flying

938
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
back.

939
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And this thing was, I mean, we were here and we saw the thing coming from here and it must

940
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
have gone down here towards the Free State, Orange Free State, Lesotho and onto the East

941
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Coast there.

942
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And I had a friend of mine who was going to format on us in another aircraft.

943
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
He called us on the radio and said that he could actually see us and he was coming up

944
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
and we must keep a lookout for him.

945
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And I actually said to him, well, I can see you on the left-hand side of the aircraft.

946
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And he confirmed that he was on the right-hand side of us.

947
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And I said to him, well, if you're on our right-hand side, what is it we're seeing on

948
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
the left?

949
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And on our left-hand side was a ball of light.

950
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I don't know what it was.

951
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And he saw it.

952
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
My co-pilot saw it.

953
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:42,000
And we noticed this thing go from the left-hand wingtip across our track and disappear across

954
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
the horizon.

955
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And that took about three or four seconds.

956
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I posted that interview on our website.

957
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:59,000
He showed up without any of his ID or who he was flying for because of many of that

958
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
reasons.

959
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
But he shared it because it wasn't just him.

960
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
It was his co-pilot and another pilot.

961
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oddly, in Africa, they'll fly in formation because there's just different rules over

962
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
there.

963
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You'll have two commercial jets flying side by side.

964
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
That's an odd thing to see if you're looking up.

965
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Well, yeah, it's just the rules are a little different.

966
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
There's places where there is no radar coverage at all.

967
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah, there's huge vast areas.

968
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
There's no radar coverage.

969
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So you can kind of do what you want.

970
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
But anyway, it is an issue because it's discussed.

971
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It's discussed among them.

972
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Like being a pilot yourself, you've heard stories.

973
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh, yeah.

974
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
But usually it's followed up with, yeah, don't tell anybody.

975
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Could you share one of the stories without giving away who said it or would that give

976
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
it away?

977
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Boy, I'd have to think about the...

978
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
There's been a lot.

979
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I don't want to put you on the spot.

980
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
If there's anything that comes to mind, though, but...

981
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yeah, let me think about it.

982
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Sure.

983
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
The interesting thing is because they know I fly.

984
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
We can speak the same language.

985
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
We have the same kind of understanding.

986
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
They may have a lot more hours than I do.

987
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I love these guys that have 35,000 hours.

988
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I've got 1,600.

989
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Whoa, yeah.

990
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It's a big difference.

991
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Big difference.

992
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
But yeah, anyway, that's a whole other topic.

993
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
But it's important because they don't have a voice.

994
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And I'm hoping that particular incident that was recorded on ATC, I hope those people get

995
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
interviewed.

996
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Or I hope they're not reprimanded either.

997
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
They shouldn't be.

998
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Well, they shouldn't be.

999
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Because they have so many...

1000
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
That's the amazing thing about it is I think there's five or six, maybe even more than

1001
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
that.

1002
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
They're all calling in.

1003
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
People chiming in.

1004
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It was exciting.

1005
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I see it too.

1006
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Really?

1007
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Yeah.

1008
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Yeah, a friend of mine sent me that.

1009
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And I'm like, well, yeah, I've interviewed a Navy man who witnessed the same thing when

1010
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:19,000
he was active duty, him and another engineer on the P-3.

1011
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So the same behavior, it would come up and then it would just zoom out at ridiculous

1012
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
speeds.

1013
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Impossible speeds.

1014
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Yeah.

1015
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And then repeat the behavior.

1016
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Like, what are they doing?

1017
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
What are these things?

1018
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
It must be so wildly different also to see it from that perspective because being on

1019
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
the ground looking up is one thing.

1020
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And sure, you can spot anomalous behavior, but there's so much going on above your head.

1021
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Like you said, there's rockets coming back into orbit.

1022
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Elon's got 4,600 satellites up there.

1023
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
There's a lot.

1024
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
There's asteroids.

1025
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
There's things burning up.

1026
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
You're catching reflections off certain crafts that are just orbiting the planet that are

1027
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
reflecting off the sun.

1028
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So you're getting glimmers.

1029
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:17,000
But being at that altitude and seeing something straight on I think is such a different and

1030
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:26,000
interesting perspective to this because now you can confirm that it's not in space because

1031
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
being on the ground, you have no point of reference.

1032
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It's either a big object that's far away or a small object that's close, like I don't

1033
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
know.

1034
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Being level playing field with this thing, watching it go, I mean that must be just a

1035
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
much more intense experience.

1036
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:51,000
So even with Ariel, the radar coverage in, well actually they did catch it on radar on

1037
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
the corner of the scope, but they had it on their own.

1038
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
They have your radar in the plane.

1039
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
It's limited.

1040
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
TCAS for Collision Avoidance for commercial.

1041
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
They picked it up on the TCAS.

1042
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
So did those people in that clip we're talking about in Oregon I think.

1043
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah.

1044
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
So they had it on their TCAS, but the radar station didn't have it on.

1045
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So it's telling you this object is in very close proximity, but at the same time radar

1046
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
doesn't have it as a primary target.

1047
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
That's interesting.

1048
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Because the same thing happened the night before Ariel.

1049
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:37,000
A lot of the pilots talk like, I got it on my TCAS, like Collision Avoidance, yet you

1050
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
guys don't have it on radar.

1051
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
South Africa, on the one pilot I did interview, they did have it on radar.

1052
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
He went to the tower right when he landed.

1053
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
He's like, did you guys get this on radar?

1054
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
It's like we had it on for like two seconds, but it was going so fast that we don't know

1055
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
where it was.

1056
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Well, and he saw it.

1057
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
That's what he saw.

1058
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I mean, within two seconds, I think it's four seconds, he's at 25,000 feet.

1059
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
So your horizon's massive.

1060
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:20,000
You can see a lot of, and within four seconds it completely crossed the horizon and at kind

1061
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
of a straight line, not like a meteorite or anything like that.

1062
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
He thought it was another aircraft coming up next to him.

1063
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Anyway, those are interesting interviews because the pilots are, that's, they are, they have

1064
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
to...

1065
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Incredible.

1066
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Yeah, you got to pay attention.

1067
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
You have to know what you're doing.

1068
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Your life's at risk.

1069
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Other people's lives are at risk if you have passengers.

1070
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Yeah, there seems to be a concerted effort to, within the last few years anyways, at

1071
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:58,000
least to sort of bridge that gap at the FAA and allow for commercial pilots to report

1072
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
these things and create this funnel where they can now...

1073
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I know that Ryan Graves is working with that as well.

1074
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I think it's very important and it's cool that he is working with it because he's someone

1075
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I believe that we can sort of trust on this issue.

1076
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,000
He seems like a straight shooter, understands some of the capabilities of these crafts

1077
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
and has heard a lot of testimony as well.

1078
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:28,000
A lot of people come to him, so I think it's important, but ultimately if you look at things

1079
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:38,000
like even the O'Hare incident, was it 06 or 07 or whatever it was, and everything was

1080
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:46,000
confiscated, it was like they just right away shut that thing down and it was a hiccup.

1081
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
But that was a mass sighting as well.

1082
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:55,000
But that got controlled real quick because it happened around an airport.

1083
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
That's the other thing is there is a fear, I'm pretty sure, among pilots and among air

1084
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:12,000
staff in general, not just pilots, but radar operators and even ground crew that you shouldn't

1085
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
speak of this, you shouldn't talk of this.

1086
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It's true.

1087
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
A lot of people are fighting for those jobs.

1088
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Right.

1089
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Yeah, it's unfortunate because we lose a lot of information.

1090
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
That's what drives me.

1091
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Every little bit of data is important, information, testimony, witness what you witness,

1092
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,000
paints a picture, and so many people just don't come forward.

1093
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Yeah, that's the other thing.

1094
01:06:48,000 --> 01:07:00,000
A pilot, F-111 Air Force, they witnessed a vehicle up at 25,000, again 25,000, it's interesting

1095
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:08,000
because they are seen at an interesting altitude between 20,000 and 30,000 feet, a lot of them.

1096
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:15,000
We stay up at 35,000, 40,000 for most of our commercial flights are up there.

1097
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
But a lot of the activity is around 25, which is fascinating to me.

1098
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Because you wouldn't see it if you're in a plane, maybe?

1099
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:30,000
No, it's just, maybe, it's just not, I don't think that's the, it's just interesting.

1100
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:43,000
There is an altitude that is, people see that anyway, it was a F-111, and they had it on their onboard radar.

1101
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And they saw the target coming toward them.

1102
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
This is an interview I did.

1103
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And it was on a head-on collision, that was the worry, because it was heading right toward them.

1104
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And they were in the clouds, so they couldn't see it.

1105
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:05,000
And then all of a sudden the clouds break open, and then it comes out of the clouds, and it's huge.

1106
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
What's it? Oh my God.

1107
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Oh my God.

1108
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Like a black cigar-shaped, and he's estimating, you know, 700 to 900 feet long.

1109
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Oh my God.

1110
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Yeah, it's a big deal.

1111
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:28,000
And these empanages, that's what he would call them, like big circle-y or circular like hangars.

1112
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You could look into it, and you could see the shadow.

1113
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
He explains this.

1114
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Boy, I don't know if I should be talking about this yet.

1115
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
But, yeah.

1116
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
So, I mean, they were both afraid to even report it, you know, when they landed.

1117
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And they did, they kept quiet about it.

1118
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
But he's been thinking about it ever since 1981.

1119
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Of course. Why wouldn't you? That's haunting.

1120
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I mean, you're so vulnerable being up there.

1121
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And, you know, he wasn't alone. He was a navigator. Sorry.

1122
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
He was the navigator and the pilot.

1123
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
They were like, did you see that? You know, they both saw it.

1124
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Wow.

1125
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Yep.

1126
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So, there's a lot of interesting things that get seen.

1127
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I just don't get, again, like that would have been helpful to, you know, why?

1128
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
You know, do we already know all this?

1129
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Do we not need that information, or is it the concern for public panic?

1130
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
That they create the stigma.

1131
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Do you think it's a concern for public panic?

1132
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I do.

1133
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
That's the main reason in your mind?

1134
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
That's what I've heard over and over.

1135
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yeah. It seems to be, I mean, that seems to definitely be a reason.

1136
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Like, I mean, you know, there's so many examples, if you look back in history,

1137
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
where ontological shock has literally crippled people.

1138
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And, you know, they've probably played the scenario out a billion times

1139
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
in a billion different ways, whoever the people are in the program, you know,

1140
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
to make sure that, hey, we don't want to destroy the economy or start a war

1141
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
or whatever it is.

1142
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
But, you know, part of me also thinks that, like, man, humans,

1143
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
humans are just greedy sometimes too.

1144
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And, like, I really, I don't know, this is just a gut feeling,

1145
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
but I really feel like they're just like a small group of people

1146
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
that just don't want you to know.

1147
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Yeah.

1148
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And they're just like, nope, that's ours.

1149
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You can't have it.

1150
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And they got money, they got power, they got, you know,

1151
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
and that just gets them off.

1152
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And I, because, you know, a lot of us could handle it.

1153
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Not the entirety of it perhaps.

1154
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
But I think, you know, if you go around asking people,

1155
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
there are ways to disseminate information that are probably a lot

1156
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
more, that's a lot easier than what they're doing now.

1157
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
You know, this whole, like, leak and deny and, like,

1158
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
it's just so bizarre of a behavior.

1159
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And then, like, even with, like, the drone stuff happening,

1160
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
they're like, we don't know what it is.

1161
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
This seems like a really sloppy job, you know,

1162
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
if you were to give out some information.

1163
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I just think there's, like, an easy way to do it.

1164
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And for some reason, whatever that reason is,

1165
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
they just don't want people to know.

1166
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
They don't want people to know.

1167
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Well, it's, you know, it's already been disclosed, essentially.

1168
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
People don't even realize that it's already happened.

1169
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
But, you know, they don't have to, I feel the same way.

1170
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Like, you know, do whatever you guys want.

1171
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Keep doing what you're doing.

1172
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You don't have to share everything.

1173
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Just tell us that there's intelligent life in the universe, please.

1174
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
And I think the end result of that,

1175
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
it's going to be shocking for a lot of people,

1176
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
and it's going to be a transitional period

1177
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
that I think everybody goes through

1178
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
when they actually see it or come to terms with it.

1179
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And then there's going to be a lot of excitement

1180
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
about, like you were saying, like, oh, man,

1181
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
wait, we're not alone out here?

1182
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
That opens up space to a lot of excitement and exploration,

1183
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
and I think that's going to move us forward

1184
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
in a way we've never seen before.

1185
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So I think it's...

1186
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Yeah, there's things I probably agree

1187
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
that they shouldn't share with us, but...

1188
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Isn't that positive overall?

1189
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
If humanity finds out?

1190
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Yeah, I think so.

1191
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It's going to be some hard pills to swallow, so to speak.

1192
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
But, yeah, I think we're already there.

1193
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
We're already...

1194
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I mean, it's no accident that we're in space.

1195
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
You know, we're just getting off this planet.

1196
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
We're starting to explore, and, of course,

1197
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
we're running into these things more often

1198
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
than these things are paying attention, you bet.

1199
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It's a critical stage of our evolution.

1200
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Right, we hit a certain technological peak,

1201
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
and now they're popping up,

1202
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
whether it's, like, nuke or space travel.

1203
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
It feels like they're like, oh,

1204
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
they're finally getting out of the playpen.

1205
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Yeah.

1206
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yeah, I believe that.

1207
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Do you believe they've been here for a long time?

1208
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I do.

1209
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Like thousands of years?

1210
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Yeah.

1211
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Yeah.

1212
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Is there any part of you that believes

1213
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,000
that they are responsible for us?

1214
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I don't know.

1215
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Boy, there's so many pieces to that.

1216
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
It wouldn't surprise me.

1217
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I just don't know.

1218
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So I kind of have my own little, like, speculative,

1219
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
like, okay, let's, how is this,

1220
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
there's some pretty spectacular things

1221
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
that have happened in our past that are still there,

1222
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
you know, as pyramids or, you know,

1223
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:06,000
just really curious technologies.

1224
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
So I don't know.

1225
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I mean, that's kind of the, I'd like to know that.

1226
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I think if, you know, if there's a lot of things

1227
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
that I think if we find out, we'll be like,

1228
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
oh, that makes total sense.

1229
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Yeah.

1230
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
The puzzle pieces fit, you know.

1231
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
It's like revealing a magic trick, really.

1232
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Yeah.

1233
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
You overcomplicate things sometimes in your head,

1234
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
and you're like, oh, he must have had this

1235
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
electromagnetic thing up his sleeve.

1236
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And then I'm like, no, it's just like an invisible thread

1237
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
or something.

1238
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
And then they're like, oh, yeah, of course, you know.

1239
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
But we overcomplicate things sometimes

1240
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
because, you know, we just overthink.

1241
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Yeah.

1242
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It might be a lot simpler.

1243
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I think it is.

1244
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I think it is.

1245
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And people make it more complex, well, for various reasons.

1246
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Yeah.

1247
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
To keep advantage over others or profit.

1248
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
You know, a whole bunch of things human beings do.

1249
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
But I find it interesting, the whole timing of all this,

1250
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
where all these things that we have to deal with

1251
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
are all coming to a head, you know.

1252
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
We're out.

1253
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
We're getting off the planet.

1254
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
We've got a climate issue, big time.

1255
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And then, I don't know, it's just so,

1256
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
we're at the edge of a lot of things.

1257
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:30,000
So if you could place yourself behind a rock somewhere

1258
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,000
at any point in history and have, like, the best view

1259
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
of anything being done, whether it's a visitation

1260
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,000
or some monumental event, besides Rua,

1261
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
where would you put yourself?

1262
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Fly on the wall.

1263
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
No one will ever see you.

1264
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And you get to have the best view.

1265
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
You get to soak, take it all in, whatever that thing is.

1266
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I mean, there's several.

1267
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I mean, immediately think of around the building

1268
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
of the Great Pyramid.

1269
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I would have loved to have seen who was involved or her.

1270
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
How that was done?

1271
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
How that was done?

1272
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Well, I'd like to see who was there,

1273
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
besides the human beings.

1274
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
If that, I don't even know.

1275
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I would just, boy, that's a, have you been to the pyramids?

1276
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Never been, no.

1277
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Oh, my God.

1278
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
No.

1279
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
You have to see that.

1280
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I would love to one day.

1281
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It is, it's just, you leave there a different person.

1282
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Because as close as I've been is Coral Castle in Florida.

1283
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Oh, I haven't seen that.

1284
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I'd like to see that.

1285
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Yeah, it's OK.

1286
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,000
But it is, it's one of the wonders for sure, wonders of the world.

1287
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
They're colossal.

1288
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
They're really just, pictures don't do it justice.

1289
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
They don't.

1290
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Like, you know, the Statue of Liberty is like, oh, geez.

1291
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
It's a lot bigger than, you know, when you see it,

1292
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
when you see it, you're like, eh.

1293
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
But, boy, you see the pyramids, you're like, oh, my God.

1294
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
These things are, wow.

1295
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Yeah, there's this, they're like megalithic.

1296
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I've seen pictures of people in comparison next to them,

1297
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
and they just stand next to a rock,

1298
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and they're not even half the size of the rock.

1299
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And you're just like, wait, I don't know what?

1300
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Like, it's really hard to comprehend on photo,

1301
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
but in person must be just, yeah, I guess it just, yeah, it just shows you.

1302
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
It cements that idea of how can we do this?

1303
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Yeah.

1304
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Yeah.

1305
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Yeah, it's pretty stunning.

1306
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Tell you, I'd like to see.

1307
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Where would you like to be?

1308
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Holloman.

1309
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Oh, yeah, in 1954?

1310
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Yep.

1311
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I'd like to be behind a little rock somewhere in a safe area,

1312
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
and just kind of, or maybe in that helicopter or whatever.

1313
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Just be, yeah, boots on the ground somewhere there,

1314
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
and watch that happen.

1315
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Yeah, I would love to know, what was that?

1316
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Yeah, going to the jeep.

1317
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
What did they tell us?

1318
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Yeah.

1319
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Well, here's my question.

1320
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Is there any small talk?

1321
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Well, I mean, I'm sure if there was a conversation,

1322
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
they said some very frank things.

1323
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I would like to know what they said.

1324
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
If you could ask one question, what would it be?

1325
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:55,000
That's something you want to keep for yourself?

1326
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Yeah.

1327
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Yeah, that's fine.

1328
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I do have a personal law.

1329
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
And I think I know the questions.

1330
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Yeah.

1331
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
All right.

1332
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
How about we take some questions from Patreon?

1333
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Is that cool?

1334
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Sure.

1335
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
All right.

1336
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I'm just going to hit record on the other camera here.

1337
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
One second.

1338
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
All right.

1339
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I'm going to pull these questions up.

1340
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
This is from our interns, as we call them.

1341
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
They are allowed because they pay a fee every month.

1342
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
They get access to a lot of perks.

1343
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And one of those perks is asking the guest a question.

1344
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So I've only got a few here because this was like a last minute thing.

1345
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
But we'll try to pull some out.

1346
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I think we might have answered some of these, honestly.

1347
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Oh, OK.

1348
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
This is actually a good question.

1349
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
And this isn't a question that is normally typical.

1350
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So I do like this one from Jaydenity.

1351
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Jaydenity.

1352
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Yeah.

1353
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Jaydenity, maybe.

1354
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I don't know.

1355
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
What do you think are the strongest counter arguments skeptics present?

1356
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Now, specifically, the Ariel thing.

1357
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
What's like a strong counter argument that a skeptic would present?

1358
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Something you've heard.

1359
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And then maybe elaborate on how you could counter argue that.

1360
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Mass hallucination was one.

1361
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
So I went and spoke to a lot of psychiatrists.

1362
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
And it was really interesting.

1363
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Like, well, we don't really know what that is.

1364
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Right.

1365
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Like, we don't have examples of it's not.

1366
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Anyway, I was OK because I wanted to see what are the other examples of this.

1367
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
So that was one.

1368
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
That's one that you can't just easily dismiss either because it's just so last resort.

1369
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Well, blanket statement.

1370
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Everybody's on drugs or something.

1371
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Yeah.

1372
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Is there a problem with that?

1373
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Or are the other witnesses, like the pilots that were up there.

1374
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Yeah.

1375
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
So they're having the same mass hallucination.

1376
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And then the people in the village are also having that.

1377
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I mean, it just didn't appear that way at all.

1378
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000
And then I guess military aircraft is like is maybe the other one.

1379
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
That was the other one.

1380
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Satellite rocket body reentry, which I looked into quite a bit.

1381
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And the problem with that was that you had a lot of people.

1382
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
And there's no question that probably did happen.

1383
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
But there was something else seen there.

1384
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Throughout that whole week.

1385
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Yeah.

1386
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Not just at the school.

1387
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Right.

1388
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Right.

1389
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
All over.

1390
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Because clearly whatever happened at school wasn't a crash.

1391
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
No.

1392
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
That was not a rocket reentry.

1393
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
No.

1394
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
And it was interesting because I did find people that saw a reentry.

1395
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And then I found other people.

1396
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,000
And the thing was these were not unqualified witnesses, so to speak.

1397
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
They were people that worked at the airport.

1398
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
People that, you know, veterinary.

1399
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Just different people.

1400
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
They're not stupid.

1401
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And they witnessed hovering.

1402
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,000
They witnessed a lot of things that are not what a reentry looks like.

1403
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Yeah.

1404
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Or space debris coming in.

1405
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
So yeah, I mean, that was the other thing I had to entertain.

1406
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Well, what else could this have been?

1407
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
And I still keep kind of an open.

1408
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Yeah.

1409
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
But what are you left with?

1410
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
That's the crazy part.

1411
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
What are you left with?

1412
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
If you take away those things, you're like, what are you left with?

1413
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
You're not left with much.

1414
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,000
If you're jumping to mass hallucination, it doesn't leave you with many options, I feel.

1415
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
That's kind of bottom of the barrel stuff there.

1416
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Yeah.

1417
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You know?

1418
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Yeah, I mean, the whole thing about the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.

1419
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
The Occam's razor.

1420
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Yeah.

1421
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I do believe that is true, but maybe not with this stuff.

1422
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
You know, maybe we're seeing something.

1423
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:10,000
We can't put everything under that category with something as extraordinary as this.

1424
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And people are putting their reputations on the line.

1425
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:21,000
And we're seeing a lot of that right now with these people are coming forward that are F-16 pilots, F-18 pilots.

1426
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I mean, people with some serious credentials that could go to jail if they're lying or be dismissed from or lose their clearances.

1427
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Even if Congress says, well, we got a whistleblower protection act or whatever, it's like that doesn't mean really anything.

1428
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
You know, if you feel like you're being threatened.

1429
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Very true.

1430
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I mean, I hope they do something because that is happening to quite a few people.

1431
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,000
There are private funds now which are coming out like the UAP Disclosure Fund, I think,

1432
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and some other private organizations that are gathering money for whistleblowers.

1433
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Right.

1434
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Because one of the things that like aside from life-threatening interactions, they're also just threatening to have no pension.

1435
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Right.

1436
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:16,000
And that's like a big deal if you got family and you're trying to take care of them and you can't enter the workforce again because your reputation is tarnished.

1437
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Who's taking care of you?

1438
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And if you see how much the government takes care of veterans, well, then you can kind of draw a clear line and see that, oh, you might also be left out to dry.

1439
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
So, you know, it's good that a lot of these private organizations are beginning to at least take some action.

1440
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Yeah, that's wonderful.

1441
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
That's necessary.

1442
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
All right.

1443
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,000
We have – I think we answered this one.

1444
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I mean, I'll throw it up.

1445
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Maybe you got something else to add to it.

1446
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
But –

1447
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Sure.

1448
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
We did – I think we did talk about this.

1449
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
How cool is that?

1450
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
That's awesome.

1451
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
What was the purpose of the Ariel sighting?

1452
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I find the interesting part, and it was a very real thing, are the messages they get the kids.

1453
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,000
What made me really convinced like that really happened was the males that did not want to talk about it.

1454
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Yet they had had that images put into their head about, you know, the destruction of the planet, what we were doing, stuff like that.

1455
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
That was a very real thing.

1456
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
You know, I initially thought, well, maybe this is what happens when you see something weird and odd.

1457
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:34,000
You start thinking about your own environment and it causes all kinds of – you know, I kind of explored that quite a bit.

1458
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:49,000
But when I started to find kids that were – talked to me about it but did not want to discuss it on camera or didn't want to talk about it at all, yet they admitted that that happened, that was pretty interesting.

1459
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And so, you know, why kids?

1460
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Why tell them that?

1461
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
I mean, they're going to grow up.

1462
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:02,000
They're growing up now and just – how are they influencing society from what they learned?

1463
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
They're all over the world.

1464
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
It's very common for people that have had encounters, the very same thing.

1465
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It's not just that.

1466
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:22,000
It's a pretty common aspect to this, that you're shown certain things about your own species, what your own species is doing to this environment.

1467
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Kind of takes the heat off you as an alien entity, too, I feel.

1468
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You know, if you're like, oh, you think I'm scary.

1469
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Yeah, look what you're doing.

1470
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Exactly.

1471
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Look how scary this is, right?

1472
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Kind of softens the blow a little bit, maybe, you know, to be like, no, no, no, we're not the bad guys.

1473
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Yeah.

1474
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
It's like every zombie movie I've ever watched.

1475
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
It's not the zombies you've got to be afraid of.

1476
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
You know, it's the people.

1477
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It's the humans.

1478
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Yeah.

1479
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Interesting.

1480
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Well, I mean, I always reference it to wildlife and how we – you know, animals overpopulate an area.

1481
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
When the deer overpopulate, they start to get disease and they start to have other issues.

1482
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,000
So we call them to keep that from happening.

1483
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:12,000
You know, there's just tons of things we do with – because we can't have a conversation about what you're doing.

1484
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:21,000
We know a little better than they do about certain things that aren't going to happen if they go too far in that direction.

1485
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Yeah.

1486
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:32,000
And you know, it is interesting, too, that like just like giving the children these images and talking and visiting the children, you know, they grow up.

1487
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:38,000
They're affected by this for life, you know, as you know with your interactions with them.

1488
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:48,000
But they go on to also sort of become in their own ways ambassadors for the phenomenon.

1489
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Yeah.

1490
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Right?

1491
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
A lot of people out there.

1492
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Not just that incident.

1493
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
You don't just forget it and move on.

1494
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I mean, look at even – you know, you want to look at Travis Walton.

1495
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Yeah.

1496
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
He's not going to go and get a regular job.

1497
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
No.

1498
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Yeah.

1499
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And now this is his life, you know.

1500
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And so they must be aware that they have that effect.

1501
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
True.

1502
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
But you don't get paid for that.

1503
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
No.

1504
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Right?

1505
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Yeah.

1506
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It's kind of a – you know what I mean?

1507
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And if you do, you get ostracized, apparently.

1508
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
That's true.

1509
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
That's true.

1510
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
It's – but it's such an important thing to share.

1511
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And boy, so many people.

1512
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:29,000
And what they do have to share is really that wonder.

1513
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
We talked with magic, right?

1514
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
The awe.

1515
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
But it's actually real.

1516
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Yeah.

1517
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Like it's a real –

1518
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
It's not pretend.

1519
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It's not.

1520
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And it's going to take time.

1521
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,000
But I just think of all these people that have come forward, so many.

1522
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And I don't know how we – I don't know how we treat those people properly.

1523
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
That's been on my mind a lot.

1524
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Because they've been through so much.

1525
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,000
They're misunderstood, mislabeled.

1526
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I don't know how we as a society, as a species, integrate those people.

1527
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I mean, they should be – in my mind, they should be treated like veterans of a war,

1528
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
you know, in a sense.

1529
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Right.

1530
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
And we're kind of making light of it.

1531
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Yeah.

1532
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And we leave them out there.

1533
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Yeah.

1534
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:28,000
You know, I'm glad that Burroughs and, you know, they've gotten medical care for what

1535
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
they went through.

1536
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Think – you know, that was a huge deal.

1537
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Randall Shum.

1538
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yeah.

1539
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
And – but there's so many other people that – they just don't get the proper care.

1540
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Yeah.

1541
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Psychologically, you mean?

1542
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah.

1543
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Psychologically.

1544
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And physically, yeah, in some cases.

1545
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Yeah.

1546
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Which has been mentioned in the hearings as well.

1547
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Yeah.

1548
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
That, like, hey, if this isn't happening, why are we treating people for wounds?

1549
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Right.

1550
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Right.

1551
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Exposure to certain things, like, okay.

1552
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Kind of insane that we're treating wounds of a pretend phenomenon.

1553
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah.

1554
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Okay.

1555
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I think we've got one more here.

1556
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Well, I think this is kind of exactly what we just touched on, which is synchronous.

1557
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
This is from Hex0811.

1558
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Yeah.

1559
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Is the population ready as a whole?

1560
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I think so.

1561
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
I think 20 years ago, no.

1562
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
30.

1563
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:34,000
You know, I think the – hmm, there's so many parts of it that have made it possible

1564
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,000
to get to be at this point, which is the web, you know.

1565
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
The world has gotten a lot smaller.

1566
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Religion is not as dogged in a way than it was before.

1567
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
We're already out in space.

1568
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
There's many things that have come together, but I think so.

1569
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I think it's what's going to propel us into the future is just say, okay.

1570
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
And we're going to have to take that slow.

1571
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I mean, that's the thing about confronting a superior – you know, let's just say that.

1572
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:19,000
An alpha species is very humbling.

1573
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
And let's see what that relationship is.

1574
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And man, the thing that I get, I always think of as like, what have they seen already?

1575
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:34,000
What other places have they been, other planets that they know about, you know?

1576
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
The knowledge.

1577
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:42,000
The knowledge base, which would save us a lot of time figuring it out.

1578
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
They know that, though.

1579
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I would think so.

1580
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Yeah.

1581
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Just so strange.

1582
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It's so strange because, you know, you get to the end of these questions, and there's

1583
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
always something that just doesn't compute.

1584
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,000
There's always something that's like, this doesn't equal zero when I put them together.

1585
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
What parts?

1586
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I mean, for me, it's a lot of the why.

1587
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
It's a lot of the why.

1588
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
The why just doesn't make sense from what I've heard, you know?

1589
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
That's the question I didn't answer, is the why.

1590
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Yeah.

1591
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
And I mean, that's the big question, you know?

1592
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,000
We're past the, even the what, or the when, or the where.

1593
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:33,000
It's really about the why, and it's not like, you know, why us?

1594
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
That's the whole thing, right?

1595
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Because you have to imagine that there's a big universe out there.

1596
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
There is something special here.

1597
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
There has to be.

1598
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
There has to be.

1599
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It has to be something unique, and I would kick myself for saying this years ago because

1600
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I'd be like, wow, you're just being egotistical.

1601
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
You're being human.

1602
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
You're thinking we're special.

1603
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
You know, we're just like everyone else in the universe.

1604
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
But it doesn't seem that way.

1605
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
It doesn't seem that way.

1606
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It seems like we are a valuable, call it asset.

1607
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Call it, you know, you want to call it experiment.

1608
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
You want to call it byproduct.

1609
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
You want to call it whatever.

1610
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:16,000
But there's something extremely valuable here that they are clearly interested in.

1611
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Yeah.

1612
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Why bother?

1613
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Yeah.

1614
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And why hide that?

1615
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Why not let us know?

1616
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Why hide that?

1617
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Why are they hiding that?

1618
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:33,000
What is there to know that is to our detriment, that is not to our benefit?

1619
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
From these...

1620
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Yeah.

1621
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Why is it...

1622
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
If it was to our benefit, what's the Harman telling us?

1623
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I think I know the answer to that question.

1624
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Yeah.

1625
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I think it's delicate to expose yourself to a species that doesn't, not as advanced as

1626
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
you.

1627
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Yeah.

1628
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And I think they're very, in my personal opinion, from people I've interviewed, it just, I think,

1629
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,000
it appears they're very aware of that.

1630
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I could be wrong.

1631
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
It could be...

1632
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
The covertness of it is very interesting.

1633
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Because it's not completely covert.

1634
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Not quite.

1635
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
It's like...

1636
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
They could do a better job even.

1637
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Right.

1638
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Oh yeah.

1639
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Yeah.

1640
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
It's like...

1641
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
It's almost like they don't care that much.

1642
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Or they kind of want to give you a hint.

1643
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Yeah.

1644
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Yeah.

1645
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,000
And that's, I guess, part of this whole hidden agenda that we're, I guess, not ready to be

1646
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
privy to or whatever that is.

1647
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:49,000
It's just a little frustrating being someone who, deep within, understands that there could

1648
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:57,000
be some good from this and that we'd probably, like Reagan said, we'd be a lot more, we'd

1649
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
be treating each other a lot better if we understood that there was something out there.

1650
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I agree with that.

1651
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
100%.

1652
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And so it's just strange that we don't get that.

1653
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
There's got to be something else then.

1654
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Profit?

1655
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Yeah.

1656
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
It goes back to like...

1657
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Who knows?

1658
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Fear sells.

1659
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Yeah.

1660
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Fear sells.

1661
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Anyway.

1662
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Yeah.

1663
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
All right.

1664
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Well, do you mind sticking around for like an extra 20?

1665
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
We're going to cut this one and then just do like a little talk on Patreon.

1666
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Is that cool?

1667
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Sure.

1668
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
And we can talk about some other stuff.

1669
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Guys, if you want to head over to obviously become an intern or a member, you can click

1670
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
all the buttons below and follow that.

1671
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
We're going to continue the conversation.

1672
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,000
But I also highly suggest you go check out Aerial Phenomenon, an incredible documentary.

1673
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Is there anywhere they can follow your work?

1674
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Is there a link that we'll add below?

1675
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
AerialPhenomenon.com.

1676
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Yep.

1677
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
That's our primary.

1678
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Okay.

1679
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Yeah.

1680
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:00,000
It's available on Apple TV and Amazon.

1681
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Yeah.

1682
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Go support Randall and his work.

1683
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I'm looking forward to what you got going on next.

1684
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:17,000
And whenever you decide to share that with the world, I will be here and I will be waiting

1685
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
on BetaBreath.

1686
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
So I appreciate you being here.

1687
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
This has been a lot of fun.

1688
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Same here.

1689
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Thank you.

1690
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Appreciate it.

1691
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Thank you.
