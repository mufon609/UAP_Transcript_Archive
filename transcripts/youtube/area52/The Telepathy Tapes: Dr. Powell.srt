1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
But I would say that one of the most impressive

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,880
was this girl named Haley.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,520
She literally did six different sessions,

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,280
each two hours long.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,320
I took a random number generator

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,840
and I created random numbers,

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,760
like five, six digits.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,160
And then I would come up with an operation between them.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,480
It would be multiplying them or dividing them.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,400
And then I would ask her to give me all the numbers

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,840
that are part of the equation.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,000
When you say she would give you all the numbers,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,840
this is without seeing the numbers, this is...

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, yes, yes.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,920
Okay.

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,200
It was 162 numbers

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,160
and she got all but seven correct

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,960
and the seven mistakes she made she got on the second try.

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,440
Because we're instantly sending

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,960
and receiving information through space,

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,160
does that imply that we might be able to perceive

22
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,280
or even affect information through time?

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Have you ever seen or heard of any examples

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,880
of these children sort of interacting

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,920
with something that, for a lack of a better word,

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,040
is non-human?

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,960
I've heard accounts that they're evil ones

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,720
and then that they're good ones.

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,800
But I was observing some children

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,840
who were really advanced in math

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,320
and they were autistic.

32
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,320
And I looked over at this one little boy's piece of paper

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,800
and he had drawn the head that looks like a gray.

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,680
I was just like,

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,920
oh, that's kind of an interesting thing

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,240
for a little six-year-old to be drawing.

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,960
Have you seen any interest from intelligence agencies

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,360
when it comes to your work?

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,640
Welcome back to another episode of Debrief.

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,560
Today, it is my esteemed pleasure and honor

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,560
to introduce to you a conversation

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,440
that I've recently had with Dr. Diane Hennessy Powell.

43
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,360
Dr. Powell is a distinguished neuropsychiatrist,

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,440
neuroscientist, and author renowned

45
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,920
for her interdisciplinary research

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,440
into human consciousness and psychic phenomena.

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,800
She earned her medical degree

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,520
from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,120
where she also completed a post-doctoral training

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,920
in medicine, neurology, and psychiatry.

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,600
She has served on the faculty of Harvard Medical School

52
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,120
and participated in a think tank on human consciousness

53
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,000
at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,920
Now, throughout her career,

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,080
Dr. Powell has explored the intersection

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,480
between neuroscience and psychic phenomena

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,360
with a particular focus on telepathy in autistic savants.

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,120
Her groundbreaking work known as The Telepathy Project

59
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,600
investigates reports of telepathic communication

60
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,680
in nonverbal autistic children,

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,440
aiming to understand the mechanism behind such abilities.

62
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
In her book, The ESP Enigma,

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
A Scientific Case for Psychic Phenomena,

64
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
Dr. Powell presents a comprehensive analysis

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,960
on various psychic phenomena.

66
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,720
But one of the most widely recognized

67
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,960
and perhaps most topical contributions to telepathy

68
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,200
is her involvement with the absolutely viral sensation

69
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,640
of a project known as the telepathy tapes.

70
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
This is a series of recordings

71
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,400
that documents remarkable instances

72
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,240
of telepathic communication in her research subjects.

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,360
Now, these tapes have garnered

74
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,640
significant attention recently,

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,560
even so much as reaching a top five position

76
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,040
on the Spotify charts with only 10 episodes.

77
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,720
It's filled to the brim not only with evidence,

78
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,480
a lot of evidence of telepathy,

79
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,960
but also with just really interesting human stories

80
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,160
about people who in our society

81
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,040
have been a little bit discarded or suppressed.

82
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
Through Dr. Powell's work,

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,040
they've literally given these people a voice.

84
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,560
I don't think I remember the last time

85
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,920
I gave something such a hard push in real life.

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,200
Like everybody I come across,

87
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,080
I'm like, you have to listen to the telepathy tapes.

88
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,160
So do yourself a favor and go check that out.

89
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,120
And now it is my pleasure and honor

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,080
to present to you a conversation

91
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,880
between myself and Dr. Diane Hennessey Powell.

92
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,880
I am joined today by Dr. Powell,

93
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,640
Dr. Diane Hennessey Powell,

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,480
who has been doing amazing research

95
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,560
in the field of Psy for a very long time,

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,920
namely recently on a very popular podcast

97
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,120
that's taken the internet by storm, the telepathy tapes.

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
So first of all,

99
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,400
thank you Dr. Powell for joining me today.

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,880
You're welcome, it's a pleasure.

101
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,720
Dr. Powell, I wanna start this interview

102
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,200
with a giant disclaimer and propose that our conversation

103
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,400
will be based entirely on the statement that Psy exists

104
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
and it is real.

105
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,560
I also wanna say that any speculation derived

106
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,600
from this statement will be for the sake

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,720
of thought experiments and encourage lateral thinking.

108
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,880
I know that your time is precious

109
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,160
and I don't wanna dwell on skepticism too much.

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes.

111
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,600
So in your book, the ESP Enigma,

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
the scientific case for study for psychic phenomena,

113
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,560
you provide case studies and real world examples

114
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,600
of psychic phenomena, telepathy and so on,

115
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,160
demonstrated by people with autism, namely like Savants.

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,080
You also demonstrated this during the telepathy tapes.

117
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,520
If I had to ask you,

118
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,960
what is the most significant discovery

119
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,120
that you've come across while working with these kids?

120
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,880
Boy, there's so many.

121
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,600
I mean, it's one of those things where it's really unfolded

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
with one ability after another.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,080
So I mean, it starts off with a parent telling me

124
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,120
that these kids have Savant skills,

125
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,160
that for example, they know things in science

126
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,200
that they were never taught

127
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,200
or they have several languages that they can read

128
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,360
or a lot of them are nonverbal so they can't speak.

129
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,400
But I'll hear these things and I'm told

130
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,520
that there was no exposure.

131
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
And that's something that is well documented

132
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,440
as Savant syndrome is that you can have people

133
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,560
that know things and you don't understand how they know them.

134
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,080
And so that I was sort of expecting,

135
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,960
but the first thing that happened was the first kind

136
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,320
of dominoed fall, if you will,

137
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,040
was having parents say to me,

138
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,680
and they're all telepathic, by the way.

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,120
And so I thought, oh, wait a minute.

140
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,400
Okay, so that's a confounding variable

141
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
because if I'm testing this kid

142
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,480
to see if he's a mathematical Savant

143
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,960
and I'm there looking at the calculator

144
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,240
to see if his answer is correct,

145
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,840
how do I know he's not just getting the information from me?

146
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,160
And I mean, some people would say,

147
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
oh, well, it's all non-local information.

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,920
Isn't that interesting?

149
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,520
But the scientist in me, the theoretician in me,

150
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,520
wants to, if possible, really define these things,

151
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,880
delineate them to really understand.

152
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,400
First, you have to sort of tease everything apart

153
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,720
and then you can see later if they're all the same thing.

154
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,600
If I saw the same brain activity common to all of them,

155
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,040
I'd say, okay, maybe they are all the same thing.

156
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,640
Maybe it all is just navigating space-time,

157
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,880
but maybe there's something else.

158
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,120
And the neuropsychiatrist in me knows

159
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,120
that there's this correlation between the EEG

160
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,560
and what our inner experience is.

161
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,680
So if somebody says they're visualizing something,

162
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,080
you'll see heightened activity in the visual cortex.

163
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,080
If there's people who say that they're hearing something,

164
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,960
I mean, there's a part of the brain,

165
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,720
the auditory cortex that you would expect

166
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,480
to have more activity that you can pick up.

167
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,320
And so there's this way in which,

168
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,520
I think as a neuropsychiatrist, I'm thinking,

169
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,480
okay, wouldn't it be validating

170
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,040
if you have somebody report,

171
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,960
well, this is what's happening for me,

172
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,240
and then you see the brain activity

173
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,760
is in correspondence with that.

174
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,080
And a good example of that is Laura Lynn Jackson,

175
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,560
who's a famous psychic who also does,

176
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,800
receives information as a medium.

177
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,960
And she reports that the information always comes

178
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,720
in her right visual field when it comes

179
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,040
from like, it's either psychic or medium.

180
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,440
I oftentimes get my left right confused.

181
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,600
Anyway, but one of them is where she sees

182
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,520
the information that's psychic,

183
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,440
and the other is where she sees the information

184
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
that is mediumship.

185
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,880
And then when you look at her EEG,

186
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,600
you'll see that the corresponding sections

187
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,840
of the visual cortex to those visual fields,

188
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,840
actually what showed a shift in the usual brain activity.

189
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,960
And so that kind of science can help

190
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,720
to validate these abilities if you see that.

191
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,160
So anyway, but I, and I'm curious,

192
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,160
if somebody is precognitive, which was the next thing.

193
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,400
First of all, I heard that they were precognitive,

194
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,800
and then it's another thing to actually have examples

195
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,080
in which it happens, where they say,

196
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,400
something's gonna, that they're concerned about something

197
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
and then it does happen.

198
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,080
So, and then I'd say after that, then they start,

199
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,560
the next thing to kind of come up is that,

200
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,560
oh, by the way, I get visited by people

201
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,560
that are on the other side, and I can get a reading

202
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,040
about this relative of yours who's standing

203
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
over in the corner there.

204
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,720
I haven't been able to do, I know how to set up studies

205
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,280
so that I could test for mediumship,

206
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,440
but at this point, that is really just anecdotal.

207
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,360
But what you see is that you just see,

208
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,200
if you think about the phenomena that's been described

209
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,200
in parapsychology, I think all of them are described

210
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,680
by many of these children.

211
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,640
It's just that they each have their own sort of specialty,

212
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,800
but what they all share in common

213
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,360
is definitely the telepathy.

214
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,400
That's fascinating.

215
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,160
And that's, I think one of the biggest takeaways for me,

216
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,040
especially listening to the telepathy tapes

217
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,240
is finding out that they all have this.

218
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,560
And everybody says this with such confidence,

219
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,560
they all have this, and it's just so mind boggling to me

220
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,640
that we can say that, that they all have this.

221
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,640
That is a big piece of data that we have to prove

222
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,000
that this ability exists.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,480
That is a massive piece of data if they're all doing this.

224
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
Have you ever found within these,

225
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,040
especially the nonverbal community,

226
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,000
have you found that there is a correlation

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
between the strength of the telepathy and their condition?

228
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah, well, that's an interesting question.

229
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,560
I mean, one of the things I'd like to do

230
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,200
is I'd like to actually, in a formal way,

231
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,360
actually test that.

232
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,160
I mean, we can easily do that.

233
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,000
And, but what I would say is that,

234
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,960
I, you know, one of the reasons why,

235
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,160
I mean, obviously, there's no way I've tested on speakers.

236
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,200
But one of the reasons, besides the fact

237
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,080
that you hear how emphatically,

238
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,400
somebody who's working as a speech pathologist,

239
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,600
has like five of these kids in their office every day,

240
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,280
and they say emphatically, you know, they all do it.

241
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,880
You know, that bears a lot of weight for me,

242
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,040
because they would be the ones in the front lines

243
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,520
telling you, you know, that this is what they're experiencing.

244
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,360
Another reason why I think it's possible, quite possible,

245
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,880
is that really relates to this theory that I have

246
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,880
that came from the fact that the ones

247
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,880
who seem to be the most profoundly telepathic

248
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,360
are the ones who receptive language is intact

249
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,480
and their expressive language

250
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,120
was short-circuited during development.

251
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,920
They were developing normally,

252
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,680
and then something happens such that the area of their brain

253
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,280
that's involved in speech expression

254
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,280
gets excessively pruned, okay?

255
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,960
And therefore, they have what's basically

256
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,440
an expressive aphasia, which a lot of neurologists

257
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,960
are familiar with as, oh, somebody has a stroke,

258
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,880
and they can still understand language,

259
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,920
but they just can't express it.

260
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,440
And the expression goes for not just using your mouth,

261
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,160
but using your fingers as well.

262
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,120
You know, it's very connected.

263
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,680
And that's been the reasons why babies who are deaf,

264
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,680
I mean, they actually can babble with sighing, okay?

265
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,280
They're doing all these, you know,

266
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,080
just like the baby babbling,

267
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,040
there's a certain babbling that occurs

268
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,920
with the baby with their hand.

269
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,320
And if they're deaf, we see that they're using their hand

270
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,640
and we try to form it into symbols and language,

271
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,640
but we're so speech-oriented that we then start working

272
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
with them to get their lips to be that

273
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,520
which can create a much more rich symbolism, you know,

274
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,240
which we call language.

275
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,240
And so what you have here is you have this innate desire

276
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,120
on the part of this infant to communicate.

277
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,040
And when it gets disrupted, then they become really good

278
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,320
at what they've got left because the desire

279
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,640
to communicate doesn't go away.

280
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,640
And what I think is that I suspect that telepathy,

281
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,520
this ability to tap into the consciousness

282
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,320
of those that are in our surroundings,

283
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,640
that that is something that we're, it's innate,

284
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,720
we're all born with that.

285
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,720
And that ability to do that is a lot of how we then start

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
to make associations between sounds that we're hearing,

287
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,200
around us and some kind of meaning.

288
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,400
You know, it's like, it seems so miraculous

289
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,520
when you think, well, how did, you know,

290
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,120
we didn't always have Sesame Street teaching kids how to,

291
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,240
you know, and they're picking up the oral stuff first

292
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,280
before we even think about teaching them to read.

293
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,440
And if you've ever studied a foreign language,

294
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,960
it's like, there's a lot to figuring out

295
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,000
where one word ends and another word begins,

296
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,800
and you know, all of the, you know,

297
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,840
and the meaning of, you know, everything.

298
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,720
And you know, not everything's a noun, you know?

299
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,520
And so we're, and they're somehow picking up all of that.

300
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,160
And as I'm saying, this aha moment that I had was,

301
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,760
I was like, okay, you know,

302
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,760
the most profoundly telepathic are the ones who can't,

303
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,440
they have no choice.

304
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,360
That's the only thing that they have is

305
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,320
they just don't let go of the default means

306
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,880
by which they entered into, you know,

307
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,920
this existence able to communicate.

308
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,600
And what's frustrating for these kids

309
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,440
is that people can't read their mind.

310
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,280
And so they're experiencing all of this information,

311
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,560
and yet until they were actually given the ability to spell,

312
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,280
which doesn't require as accurate

313
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,240
of a sensory motor system.

314
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,200
You know, I mean, a lot of these kids,

315
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,720
their proprioception is off.

316
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
So they don't know exactly where their finger is in space.

317
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,640
And a lot of the physical therapy

318
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,000
and occupational therapy that they get is trying to,

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,880
and so the spelling activity itself,

320
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,520
but pointing to a big letter board,

321
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,080
is precisely to try to help to get them

322
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,960
to have enough accuracy.

323
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,680
And then once they master, I mean,

324
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,800
then you'll see that they're not hesitating

325
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,360
between each letter while they're trying to do the telepathy.

326
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
They're just going,

327
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,320
bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing,

328
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,600
spelling out what it is that is being thought, you know?

329
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,640
And you're like, how is it, I mean, at first I'm like,

330
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,720
how is it that they can be spelling

331
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,080
what their parent is thinking?

332
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,520
And then you realize,

333
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,600
if they're tapping into their consciousness,

334
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,040
they're not just getting the message,

335
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,120
they're also getting the spelling too.

336
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,400
That's right, yeah.

337
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,840
Wow, that is so mind blowing.

338
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,120
It is, I mean, so I have so many questions.

339
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,280
Do you think that, because obviously this sounds like,

340
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,280
like you said, like this yearning to express oneself

341
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,160
is what's responsible for this.

342
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,960
And I would say express oneself as opposed to communicate

343
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,680
because the reception side is,

344
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,000
like, do we see that in people

345
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
who have a hard time receiving

346
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,040
that they would receive telepathic messages more,

347
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,840
or is it more about expression, like self-expression?

348
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,600
Do you think that we're more prone to develop these things

349
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,200
if our ways to express ourselves are inhibited

350
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,640
versus our ways to intake information?

351
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,280
Well, I agree with you that I think that there's

352
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,240
just as much an innate sort of drive for self-expression

353
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,360
as there is for communication.

354
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,160
But if you think about what's going on with an early child

355
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,960
who's totally dependent upon us for everything,

356
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,560
it's like they can't open the refrigerator door,

357
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,200
they can't, they can't,

358
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,640
there's so much they can't do

359
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,840
unless they learn how to communicate.

360
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
To survival.

361
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,040
Because a lot of things are,

362
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,920
it's a form of expression to be throwing a tantrum.

363
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,760
Right.

364
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
Yeah, I'm sure expressing myself

365
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,240
is I'm banging my head against the wall

366
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,160
because I'm so frustrated

367
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,800
because I can't communicate with you

368
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,200
that this is what I want or need.

369
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,200
And so I think that, yeah, as we get older,

370
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,200
the self-expression becomes more critical.

371
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,480
And that's, I mean, you get into the age of the,

372
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,600
even starting like the age of three,

373
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,560
the terrible twos and threes where the kid says no

374
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,960
and anything you say, there's a no

375
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,280
because they're wanting to see that they can

376
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,560
at least oppose the program

377
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,080
even though it's really actually

378
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,200
what they want to do anyway.

379
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
I mean, you don't get into struggles

380
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,840
with a three-year-old over that stuff

381
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,680
because they don't really mean no 99% of the time

382
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,720
when they say it.

383
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,560
Wow.

384
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,240
So, okay, that is super interesting.

385
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,880
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it comes down to, I guess, survival.

386
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,920
And it reminds me a lot about the work

387
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,720
that Dr. Edwin May did with Joe McMonagle

388
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,200
in that they would have,

389
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,760
the targets would be more accurately described

390
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,080
if like, for instance, someone's life was in danger

391
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
or if it involved children.

392
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,440
So it almost seems like it's consciousness's way

393
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,240
of wanting itself to survive.

394
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,600
And it's doing that by any means necessary

395
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,960
and by all means available to it.

396
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,800
Is that fair to say?

397
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,280
Yeah, absolutely.

398
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,000
I mean, consciousness is, I mean, yeah,

399
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,960
the question is what is it that needs self-expression?

400
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,000
Consciousness needs expression, right?

401
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,400
And so what happens is that in the first several years

402
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,080
of life, I mean, particularly the first five years of life,

403
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,360
I mean, the brain is undergoing massive, massive development.

404
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,360
And what's driving it is, you know,

405
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,160
I mean, these things that we're talking about.

406
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,160
And if what happens is, if there's, something goes wrong,

407
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,520
there's so much plasticity,

408
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,120
there's so much flexibility to come up with

409
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,920
either a new workaround, you know,

410
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,520
or to, you know, some kind of loophole

411
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,600
or, you know, or maintaining a default system

412
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
that, you know, that worked,

413
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,800
but, you know, wasn't perfect, you know, in certain ways,

414
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,120
you know, but basically that consciousness

415
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,800
is going to try to fulfill those drives

416
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,960
and will work with what it's got

417
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,520
during that developmental phase, you know,

418
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,480
to make that happen.

419
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,880
And so that's why I'm so interested in, you know,

420
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,720
like, what's the brain wiring of, you know,

421
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,040
of some of these individuals who had their, you know,

422
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,720
had their language disrupted,

423
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,040
and then they have these abilities, you know,

424
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,760
how did they rewire their brains

425
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,200
and how does that rewiring relate to their specific set

426
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,440
of special skills, you know, beyond just the telepathy,

427
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,000
you know, the savant skills, you know,

428
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,720
which are more common in autistics

429
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,600
than they are in other population.

430
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,320
The other population that they're the most common in,

431
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,440
there's the blind.

432
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,320
Both of those are circumstances

433
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,120
in which you have something that gets disrupted,

434
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,680
something that is usually used by us to navigate

435
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,120
or to, you know, to get around for survival purposes.

436
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,120
And an alternative is, you know,

437
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,240
is rewired into their system.

438
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,400
Yeah, enhanced.

439
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,240
Yeah, they're even better at that.

440
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,880
I mean, like the, I don't know if you're familiar

441
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,520
with like the people who are blind who can echolocate.

442
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,360
Yes.

443
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,560
They can just click, you know, click,

444
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,320
and then detect the signal bouncing off of things

445
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,680
and they can do all kinds of things

446
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,400
that, you know, a lot of sighted people be afraid to do.

447
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,920
Exactly, I remember seeing that on,

448
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,680
I think it was like Ripley's, believe it or not,

449
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,360
or something like a long time ago.

450
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,960
And I remember myself like in my room,

451
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,920
trying to click and closing my eyes and seeing if I could,

452
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,720
and yeah, it felt impossible to me.

453
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,760
So it was that much more impressive when I, you know,

454
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,920
when I seen someone do it.

455
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Okay, I want to speak about this particular phenomenon

456
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,000
that I've heard about through the telepathy tapes,

457
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,480
which I think really captivated a lot of people

458
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,760
and, you know, raised a million questions in my own mind.

459
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,600
The talk on the Hill.

460
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,320
This is, I mean, this is like,

461
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,280
it really feels like something out of a sci-fi movie

462
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,840
or a comic book or something.

463
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,160
It is genuinely, I think for me,

464
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,640
one of the most inspiring things

465
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,080
that I've heard throughout this project.

466
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,640
And to give maybe people a brief summary,

467
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,880
and maybe you can help me on this,

468
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,880
but it's essentially a place where these mainly,

469
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,960
I think, nonverbal communicators go to

470
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,680
in a state of sort of meditation

471
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,600
and communicate thoughts and ideas

472
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,640
and teach each other things.

473
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,200
And if I'm not mistaken, there are a lot of them

474
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,440
who do this, is that correct?

475
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,240
Is that fair to say?

476
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,080
Yeah, yeah, that's fair to say it.

477
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,680
What's interesting is that there's been more

478
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,480
than one group of individuals

479
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,840
who have brought up the Hill without,

480
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,080
before we had the telepathy tapes released.

481
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,840
So without it being that they heard about it

482
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,320
and said, oh yeah, I go to the Hill too.

483
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,240
And that's number one.

484
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,240
Number two is the fact that there's more than one Hill.

485
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,640
And one person put it

486
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,280
that there's Hills for different ages,

487
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,920
kind of almost like how high school,

488
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,440
you've got junior high, high school,

489
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,960
that there's different general age groups.

490
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,360
And that makes sense.

491
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,480
Socially, birds of a feather flock together.

492
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,280
So if you were to open up a big playground

493
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,800
and you had five-year-olds and nine-year-olds

494
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,360
and 15-year-olds, you know,

495
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,240
they're gonna self-assort by age.

496
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,600
And then another thing that's interesting

497
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,080
is that more than one child has described it

498
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,440
as having a library.

499
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,600
And that makes a lot of people then think about,

500
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,440
oh, is that the Akasha preference?

501
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,440
Or what is that?

502
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

503
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,520
And they're sort of like, you know, they're studying.

504
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,440
You know, and a lot of this is occurring

505
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,720
while they're sleeping and dreaming sleep,

506
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,200
which we know dreaming sleep is more closely associated

507
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,360
with psychic abilities than a lot of other states.

508
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,680
And, but some of them can, you know, also, I guess,

509
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,920
during the day, they can, you know,

510
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,880
just kind of go up to the bedroom and shut the door

511
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,480
and kind of go to the hill and visit their friends.

512
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,760
But they need to be in a safe place like their bed to do it.

513
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,080
They're not just walking around, you know, going to the hill.

514
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,360
I mean, it's my understanding.

515
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,600
So is there a specific example

516
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,840
of some like verifiable case that has happened?

517
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,240
So for instance, like someone went to go learn something

518
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,440
and they came back with more knowledge

519
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,320
than they had prior to going to the hill.

520
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,920
Like, is there any, or has there been any form

521
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,240
of like telepathic communication between two individuals

522
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,520
that was later confirmed,

523
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,760
even though they didn't meet each other

524
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,600
and know of each other,

525
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,200
that they confirmed each other's existence?

526
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,640
Is there, has there been any examples of that?

527
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,640
I've been told that that has happened.

528
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,360
Yeah, I mean, I haven't been able to, you know,

529
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,960
personally, you know, witness it, you know,

530
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,000
do the controlled experiments that I'd like to do.

531
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,760
But yes, I've been told that, definitely,

532
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,640
that, you know, there are these, there are friendships.

533
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,360
I mean, you know, so there are certain kids

534
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,160
that have more of an affinity for another kid, you know?

535
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,560
So it's not that they're just going to the hill

536
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,440
and getting, you know, and talking with everybody,

537
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,000
you know, it's that they, you know,

538
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,640
they have some specifically more

539
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,840
that they want to see on the hill.

540
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,400
So there's that kind of thing going on.

541
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,240
And that, you know, and so that telepathy

542
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,880
between two people, you know,

543
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,600
whether it's happening on the hill or whatever,

544
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,000
I mean, that's, you know, harder to say,

545
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,360
but, you know, it's impressive that, you know,

546
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,560
if there really is, you know, telepathy happening

547
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,240
between them, which is, you know, there's no reason to,

548
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,080
I mean, discount the people who were reporting that.

549
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
Sure.

550
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,080
And, but there's, you know, there's just so much about this

551
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,360
that, you know, they're interconnected with one another.

552
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
There's just so much about this

553
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,600
that just needs to be explored.

554
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,520
And so that's one of the ones that,

555
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,160
that's one of the ones I want to, I want to set up.

556
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,880
I mean, the experiment that I want to set up

557
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,240
for the documentary is I want it to make,

558
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,800
I mean, I'm going to be doing other experiments,

559
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,320
but I want it for the documentary.

560
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,760
I want to have the best possible demonstration

561
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,040
of this phenomenon possible.

562
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,640
And to me at this point,

563
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,240
I think one of the best demonstrations would be

564
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,240
to have two kids, totally separate individuals,

565
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,320
you know, being, you know, where, you know,

566
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,600
two different states, you know, across the country,

567
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,600
whatever, but they're totally apart from one another.

568
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,280
They're each working with their best facilitator

569
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,680
for their communication, but that's not the person

570
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,720
who's holding the thoughts about, you know,

571
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,440
that the kid's supposed to read.

572
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,440
It's, let's see the two kids and communicate

573
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,280
with one another and see what happens.

574
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,160
And so that's an experiment I really want to set up,

575
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,000
among others.

576
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,080
Yeah, I mean, that sounds exciting,

577
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,000
and I'm sure everybody would be very excited

578
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,640
to see something like that happen.

579
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,920
You know, it's so interesting how we're kind of sort

580
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,400
of casually strolling by the idea

581
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,240
that these kids are reading their parents' minds.

582
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,240
It's such a, like a post-psychic disclosure world

583
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,800
that I feel like we're living in right now,

584
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,840
which, and I didn't even get to revel

585
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,760
in like this psychic phenomenon yet.

586
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,640
So I freak out from time to time,

587
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,360
just even thinking about this, like internally,

588
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,960
and it makes me very excited.

589
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,800
But could you perhaps, just for the audience

590
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,080
that maybe isn't familiar, give one example

591
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,960
of some type of test, of the many, many tests

592
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,040
that were performed, one example,

593
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,320
and of the sort of variables that were controlled

594
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,160
during this test and what the outcome was?

595
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,040
Sure, I mean, so the child, actually,

596
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,480
that I spent the most time, some of the children

597
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,120
that I spent the most time studying,

598
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,840
actually aren't even part of those telepathy tapes.

599
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,760
Those children that are in that are ones

600
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,520
that Kai wanted to, she wanted to be there

601
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,720
from the very beginning, you know,

602
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,720
that she didn't want to see somebody had already tested.

603
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,160
But I would say that one of the most impressive

604
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,680
was this girl named Haley, who was somebody

605
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,680
that she literally, she literally did six different sessions

606
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,360
each two hours long with two separate therapists

607
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,440
where we had a barrier between them,

608
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,760
a visual barrier between her and the therapist.

609
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,240
And she loved numbers.

610
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,640
And so, and she didn't like it to be just, you know,

611
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,600
simple numbers.

612
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,600
And so what I would do is I took a random number generator

613
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,000
and I created random numbers, like, you know,

614
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,760
five, six digits, you know, different, you know,

615
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,760
anything between, you know, zero and, you know,

616
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,280
10 million kind of thing, and then any, you know,

617
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,160
whatever numbers came up, and then I would come up

618
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,520
with an operation between them, you know,

619
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,800
either be multiplying them or dividing them

620
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,520
or finding a cute root or whatever, but those numbers.

621
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,480
And then I would ask her to give me all the numbers

622
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,840
that are part of the equation.

623
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,880
Okay, so what is the equation in the first place?

624
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,000
And then she'd point to all the numbers, you know,

625
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,880
and what is the operation?

626
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,000
When you say she would give you all the numbers,

627
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,280
this is without seeing the numbers,

628
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,320
this is completely across the room.

629
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,440
Yes, yes, yes.

630
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,800
Okay.

631
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,080
Yeah, yeah, but, you know, the therapist would be thinking

632
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,720
of, you know, the therapist would be looking

633
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,040
at the mathematical equation I gave her,

634
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,360
and let's say, you know, it was, you know,

635
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,360
one, five, seven, four times, you know, 302, okay?

636
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,240
And so she would say those two numbers,

637
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,400
she would also choose that it was times,

638
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,520
because she had the, you know, the, you know,

639
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,400
on her stencil board, she had, you know,

640
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,160
the thing for those kinds of operations.

641
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,800
And then I'd say, and what does that, you know,

642
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,360
and the therapist said, what does that equal?

643
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,120
And then she would give you the correct answer.

644
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,880
And so if you add up, if you just treat

645
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,280
all of those individual digits,

646
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,560
both of the numbers that were part of the, you know,

647
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,080
the mathematical operation

648
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,280
and the numbers that were the answer,

649
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
she did, I tested her for, it was 162,

650
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,080
it was 162 numbers, and she got all but seven correct,

651
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,040
and the seven mistakes she made,

652
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,280
she got on the second try.

653
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,200
All in a matter of, all in a matter of,

654
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,200
um, gosh, you know, 15 minutes, maybe.

655
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,800
I mean, yeah, and so that gives you,

656
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,720
because she's not there trying to pick up

657
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,880
some kind of subtle cue, you know,

658
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,280
or that, you know, she's just going at it, like, okay.

659
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,240
This is fascinating.

660
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,600
I mean, this is, it does look like it is

661
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,920
instant communication, by the way.

662
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,240
There's no bandwidth.

663
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,160
And that is something as, you know, I'm a magician.

664
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,680
I've pretended to have these psychic abilities,

665
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
and I'm pretty sure I could convince someone

666
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,920
that I have psychic abilities

667
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,320
because I've been doing it for so long, right?

668
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,160
There is a moral and ethical line that I do,

669
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,840
that I do respect, but, you know, for me,

670
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,040
it's always about dramatically playing up the idea

671
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,880
that, oh, you're thinking I'm getting a two,

672
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,360
but these children are doing it instantly.

673
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,480
There's no hesitation.

674
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,800
And so that brings me to the next question,

675
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,040
because when perceiving or sort of communicating

676
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,080
information non-locally through remote viewing

677
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,360
or through telepathy, like, because we're instantly sending

678
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,320
and receiving information through space,

679
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,560
does that imply that we might be able to perceive

680
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,080
or even affect information through time?

681
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,240
Oh, I, well, yeah, I mean, I, you know,

682
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,440
I look at both quantum physics and the theory of relativity.

683
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
You know, the theory of relativity tells us

684
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,600
that our concept of time is an illusion.

685
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,960
It's not just moving like an arrow does

686
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,280
in a single direction.

687
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,280
And so I think a lot of these parapsychological phenomena,

688
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,520
what they tell us is exactly what physicists

689
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,520
were telling us 100 years ago,

690
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,960
and that is that we're locked into,

691
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,000
our sensory system has kind of fooled us

692
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,840
into just thinking that reality is just

693
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,840
three physical dimensions and a very limited, you know,

694
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,760
view of what time is.

695
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,760
And so we know that space-time itself curves,

696
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,680
and it curves as a result of something called gravity.

697
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,160
We don't understand, you know,

698
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,160
we don't understand gravity entirely

699
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,280
by any stretch of the imagination,

700
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,280
but we do know that that was, you know,

701
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,040
Einstein's, you know, a description of gravity,

702
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,800
and it really, you know, it holds up.

703
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,640
And so, you know, similarly, we know from quantum physics

704
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,480
that you have certain conservation laws

705
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,160
that if you have two particles that were associated

706
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,720
with one another, they say two electrons,

707
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,640
and one has a spin that goes up

708
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,160
and the other has a spin that goes down,

709
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,400
that no matter how far apart they are,

710
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,400
if you switch the spin on one of them

711
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,240
to the opposite direction, that other particle

712
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,960
has to instantaneously switch as well,

713
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,640
because they're really still connected.

714
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,120
I mean, that's what it's telling us.

715
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,120
And I think they're still connected by other dimensions.

716
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,560
You know, that's-

717
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,400
Like a field.

718
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,600
I think, yeah, I think that the spookiness

719
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,680
of entanglement goes away once you realize

720
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,560
that things that we think are separate

721
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,280
in this very limited view of reality,

722
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,120
they're really not separate.

723
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,680
Similarly, you know, things that, you know,

724
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,720
we think of as being solid, we know are not solid

725
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,800
based on how much space there is in an atom.

726
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,360
Yeah, I mean, that's, you know, there's,

727
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,960
I think it was Einstein that said,

728
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,720
the only reason we have time is so that everything

729
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,120
doesn't happen all at once.

730
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,120
Yeah, exactly.

731
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,880
And that's really, that is, is it's a mental construct.

732
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,640
Yeah, it's a human interface.

733
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,640
Yeah, exactly.

734
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,960
And so that's so much of what we're talking about here is,

735
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,880
you know, is the human interface.

736
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,640
I mean, that's what drew me to neuropsychiatry

737
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,080
because what it did was it put me in a position

738
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,760
where I could have knowledge of the brain

739
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,720
and at the same time, spend hours talking with people

740
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,000
who would describe what their reality was to me,

741
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,880
what their experience actually was.

742
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,720
I mean, talking with people who are diagnosed

743
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,920
as schizophrenic is like talking to somebody

744
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,440
who's currently in a dream.

745
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,200
Wow.

746
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
But the difference is that it's a dream

747
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,160
they totally believe.

748
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,640
Right, yeah, why wouldn't they?

749
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,280
Yeah, and so then the funny thing is,

750
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,040
is that when you see these people that come in your office

751
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,280
that are diagnosed schizophrenic,

752
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,280
and they come in with proof of their reality,

753
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,200
and you're like, okay. Wow, wow.

754
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,800
You have to think of that.

755
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Well, what does that say?

756
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,800
Is it that we're labeling people

757
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,720
as having schizophrenia or psychosis

758
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,200
who just happened to for whatever reason

759
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,200
be having these experiences more

760
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,840
but it's not that their reality

761
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,160
is any less real than our reality.

762
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,680
I mean, is that what that says?

763
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,120
I mean, these are the kind of questions

764
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,760
that I think that we need to ask ourselves,

765
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,160
but at the same time, there's some realities

766
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,040
people could be living in

767
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,720
that don't have good survival value.

768
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,720
And so then it's fine if they're a shaman in a cave

769
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,120
or somebody who's a guru on a mountain,

770
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,920
having everybody take care of all your basic needs

771
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,840
so that you can be spending that much time

772
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,160
in an alternative reality

773
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,400
that might contain information for us that's valuable,

774
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,160
which is a lot of indigenous cultures,

775
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,200
they valued these kinds of people.

776
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,760
What we did was we just automatically label everybody

777
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,560
as insane as they are,

778
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,760
as insane reports those experiences.

779
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,200
So I think that there can be survival value

780
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,920
in not ever having those experiences,

781
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,000
because you can always be on task.

782
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So where you run into some problems

783
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
is when people are a blend,

784
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,200
where they have those experiences

785
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,200
and yet they're in order to have any kind of life

786
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,080
in our society,

787
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,680
we also expect them to be operating

788
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,480
from a more embodied perspective than they're capable of.

789
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,320
Right.

790
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,400
Yeah, I mean, that's one of the,

791
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,720
I think more tragic sides of this phenomenon as well

792
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,520
is that these individuals are so gifted

793
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,640
and we have so much to learn from them.

794
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,400
But I think with the help of people like yourselves

795
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,320
and people like Kai and this documentary and your work,

796
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,720
I think we'll be able to shed some light on their value

797
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,400
as human beings in our society.

798
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,320
Because I think for just a long time,

799
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,240
this really, really made me very sad

800
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,520
was looking at how these individuals have been treated,

801
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,760
not only in other countries,

802
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,520
but in even the United States, North America,

803
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,520
historically, and it hasn't been too good.

804
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,440
It's been appalling, it's been appalling.

805
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,080
People were using shock collars on these kids.

806
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,800
They would do the adverse of behavioral stuff

807
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,960
when these kids were in institutions.

808
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,440
And that is a practice that,

809
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,600
I don't think it ended that long ago.

810
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,360
It certainly was still being done

811
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,280
during the course of my career.

812
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,760
Yeah, other countries have been known,

813
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,400
there's been, people have been euthanized for these things.

814
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,920
And it's just an absolute tragedy.

815
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,080
So first of all, it's so good that you're doing this.

816
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,440
And I'm so glad to be able to help spread this message

817
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,360
because it deserves the attention.

818
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,760
Okay, I do want to ask about something

819
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,480
since we're playing thought experiments here.

820
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm someone who definitely believes

821
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,680
in non-human intelligence.

822
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,960
And I wanted to ask,

823
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,800
because you touched on this

824
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,480
a little bit at the beginning of the conversation,

825
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,360
but have you ever seen or heard

826
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,480
of any examples of these children

827
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,960
sort of interacting with something that,

828
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,200
for a lack of a better word, is non-human?

829
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,880
Well, so I haven't personally witnessed it myself.

830
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,120
What I, I've heard accounts,

831
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:25,240
I've heard accounts that they're evil ones,

832
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,320
and then that they're good ones.

833
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,480
But they're putting it in terms of entities,

834
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,080
which who knows what they are.

835
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,760
And I remember once I was actually somewhere

836
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,880
where I was observing some children

837
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,960
who were really advanced in math,

838
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,640
and they were in this math club,

839
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,760
and they were autistic.

840
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,120
And I looked over at this one little boy's

841
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,160
piece of paper, and he had drawn the head

842
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,160
that looks like a gray with those classic eyes.

843
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,360
And I was just like, oh, that's kind of an interesting thing

844
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,360
for a little six-year-old to be drawing.

845
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,600
So that's the kind of evidence

846
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,240
that this is a possibility that I've seen.

847
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,720
And it's the kind of thing that,

848
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,200
I mean, obviously, we're gonna be wanting to know

849
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,040
what is it that these children are experiencing.

850
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,640
We also wanna know how can we support them best,

851
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,960
because a lot of their experiences

852
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,560
are quite frightening for them.

853
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,880
I mean, I just, in the last couple of days,

854
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,960
I've had a couple of parents who've contacted me

855
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,840
because they're desperate,

856
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,680
because they don't know what to do for their child,

857
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,720
because their child has had precognitions

858
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,080
that have come true that were not good,

859
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,080
and they're having precognitions of things that aren't good.

860
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,000
And so, but the problem is they don't,

861
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,480
it's like, is that gonna happen tomorrow?

862
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,440
Is it gonna happen a month from now?

863
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,680
I mean, what do you do?

864
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,680
You can't lock your father up or your sister,

865
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,080
but you're on house arrest

866
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,960
because you're afraid she's gonna go out the door

867
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,040
and something's gonna happen to her.

868
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,040
And it's like, so there's a lot of different aspects

869
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,800
to all of this that,

870
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,480
my background is both a scientist and as a clinician

871
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,480
and a compassionate human being.

872
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,120
I wanna see all of,

873
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,400
I wanna see so much manifest

874
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,120
so that we have the appropriate kind of support

875
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,280
for these individuals,

876
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,640
whether we're talking about their education

877
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,200
or we're talking about their emotional support,

878
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,760
because if you think about it,

879
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,200
I mean, how would you behave

880
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,360
if you experienced the world that they do?

881
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,080
Yeah, I wouldn't even,

882
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,080
I can't even imagine what it is

883
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,320
that they're experiencing and that's just it.

884
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,160
That's the, I think part of my fascination with it too

885
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,280
is that I want to understand

886
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,800
because I think there is value there

887
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,200
and there is something to appreciate

888
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,280
on a human level from our existence.

889
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,200
There's so much to learn in a world,

890
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,320
I mean, we're at a place in the world

891
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,600
where we're the most disenchanted we've ever been.

892
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,080
And this for me provides real magic.

893
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,760
This is, it's just, it's given me a lot to look forward to,

894
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,800
a lot to be hopeful for, for our species as well.

895
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,440
And I think, you know, I think I agree with you.

896
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,000
I think, yeah, the more eyes, the better.

897
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,200
The more work, the better.

898
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,440
The more help, the better.

899
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,280
Yeah, I can't imagine

900
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,120
what all of those things must be like.

901
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,120
And when you touched on precognition there,

902
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,040
reminds me, I interviewed Graham Nichols.

903
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,960
Not sure if you're familiar with Graham Nichols.

904
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,800
He does a lot of out-of-body experience work.

905
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,040
And, you know, he's worked with Dean Raden

906
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,200
and Rupert Sheldrake.

907
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,200
And he had a verifiable precognition

908
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,120
that happened as well during an out-of-body experience.

909
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,400
He was surrounded by multiple people, five of his friends,

910
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,480
and they wrote down, you know,

911
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,200
he said there was gonna be this explosion

912
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,200
on this street in London, in Soho.

913
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,040
He doesn't know when, but he's like,

914
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,800
he felt like he saw the explosion,

915
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,400
and five days later it occurred exactly where he had said.

916
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,480
And, you know, when I heard something like that,

917
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,280
you know, it begs the question, like,

918
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,400
is that something you can alter?

919
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,640
Is that, is there a reason you're getting this?

920
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,680
Is it, because he, I don't think he would have been there.

921
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,680
So what was really the point of it?

922
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,360
And like, so, I mean, there's, like you said,

923
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,120
so many questions, so much to discover,

924
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,480
so much to learn from, and for someone like you

925
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,800
to be in every single one of those directions,

926
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,360
I mean, that's a lot of responsibility.

927
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,480
That's a lot of work.

928
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,840
Yeah, yeah, believe me.

929
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,240
Yeah, but, you know, to your point, you know,

930
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,800
I just wanted to make the comment

931
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,800
that I became really fascinated by this work

932
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
by Phyllis Atwater, and she wrote a book called

933
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,880
Future Memory, and the way that she,

934
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,840
and I talk about this in my book, The ESPNew,

935
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,000
and the way that she describes Future Memory,

936
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
it sounds like, it's like she gets a glimpse into the future,

937
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,680
and it just plays like a movie,

938
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,720
and then it collapses down, and she gets these,

939
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,360
you know, visual shifts and different things

940
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,960
before it happens, and it's like she sees a movie,

941
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,960
then it shuts down, and then sometime in the future,

942
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,440
that moment arrives, and she can, like,

943
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,840
she knows exactly what somebody's gonna say, you know?

944
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,320
That she knows exactly what's gonna happen next.

945
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,920
It literally is like having had the movie from the future,

946
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,920
you know, and this is that idea of the block universe

947
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,280
where the past, present, past, all co-exist.

948
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,040
It really is like you've seen something from the future

949
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,040
that it's so vivid, and then the question comes up

950
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,520
when you realize, I've been here before,

951
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,960
can you alter the course of events?

952
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,960
And what she tells in her book is that sometimes you can,

953
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,680
and sometimes you can't, sometimes you're in a situation

954
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,480
where you can actually act on this recognition,

955
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,920
oh, this is where the bus is gonna hit that lady

956
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,920
walking across the street, and you can grab the lady's arm.

957
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,400
Or some things just seem to be part of,

958
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,320
whether it's a sole contract or whatever it is,

959
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,400
some things seem to, that you can't prevent them.

960
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,480
It's like it's in the hard wiring, and, you know,

961
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,920
and so I think that a lot of life is like that,

962
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,920
that we have free will, and yet at the same time,

963
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,080
there's a lot of things that are already, you know,

964
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,480
part of the script of why we're here,

965
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,720
and it can be hard to discern what's what,

966
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,200
but I encourage people to not think

967
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,880
that it's all just locked in stone, and you know,

968
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,840
it's like, okay, you know, I saw that end of the future,

969
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,400
and that means it has to happen,

970
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,400
because I think that maybe it's part of why we get warnings.

971
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,800
Yeah, I mean, that's a great point,

972
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,100
and it would be like sort of us warning ourselves

973
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,160
in the past, but like, you know, it's,

974
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,600
I read this book by Dr. Michael Newton,

975
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,880
The Journey of Souls, and I read a few of his books,

976
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,200
and you know, he mentions as well,

977
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,720
because you mentioned soul contract,

978
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,960
and he does mention something like that as well,

979
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,000
where when these souls are choosing their incarnation

980
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,120
or whatever it is, that they scrub through their lives,

981
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,800
and the further forward they go,

982
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,360
the sort of blurrier it gets

983
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,240
because of the amount of variables

984
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,520
are just sort of increasing the further away you get.

985
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,600
So it's almost like it's a probability factor,

986
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,520
but free will can still sort of impose itself

987
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,060
to a certain extent in the future.

988
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,360
You can see the past probably with a lot more clarity

989
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,660
than you could the future.

990
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,940
Okay, has any of the people you've worked with

991
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:05,940
demonstrated any ability of PK or telekinesis?

992
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,660
Have you ever seen any of that in person,

993
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,020
or have you ever heard of, maybe anecdotally,

994
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,820
of someone doing something like that?

995
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,980
Because I know they did some tests in the 80s in China

996
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,540
and in Tibet with these children, you know,

997
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,380
but that's so far away, and it's in a time where,

998
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,320
you know, it's kind of nebulous.

999
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,180
Have you ever seen any evidence of that?

1000
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,960
Well, so I haven't seen it in person,

1001
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,960
but what I have seen is there are at least

1002
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,500
two or three different individuals who are not children,

1003
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,900
they're adults, but they're on the spectrum

1004
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:49,340
who contacted me a long time ago,

1005
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:54,340
and they have sent me multiple videos of them doing things

1006
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,460
that would be considered PK, you know.

1007
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:03,460
So for example, having like pinwheels,

1008
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,540
where you have like, you know, maybe three or four

1009
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,260
different layers of different pinwheels, okay,

1010
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:16,100
and being able to move some of them this way

1011
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,760
and others that way, you know,

1012
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,980
through, you know, just making a hand motion like this,

1013
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,180
and then you'll see, you know,

1014
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,380
and the fact that what's important about it being

1015
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,420
multiple pinwheels is that, you know,

1016
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,140
if it was just, oh, there's a fan behind her

1017
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,540
that I can't see, you know, it's like,

1018
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,820
but, you know, if you've got multiple pinwheels,

1019
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,980
obviously they should be going in the same direction,

1020
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,420
you know, if they're getting hit by something like that.

1021
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:47,260
So, and then, you know, another form that I've seen

1022
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:52,260
in videos again is somebody being outside

1023
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:58,300
and pointing to the sky and having the cloud disperse.

1024
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,900
Yeah, cloud bursting.

1025
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,500
Yeah, I've seen that on video as well.

1026
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,580
Yeah, these are, I mean, just more examples

1027
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,140
of amazing things that are left to be discovered

1028
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,700
and studied and tested, you know, that's quite exciting

1029
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,740
because it does, you know, just the fact that this exists,

1030
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:21,180
that this solubility exists, I mean, it opens up

1031
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,660
an immense floodgate and, you know,

1032
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,740
I think to that effect, that's probably, you know,

1033
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,260
the reason why there's such a big pushback

1034
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,660
is that this completely shifts the idea

1035
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:40,660
of materialist science into an entirely new era

1036
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,900
of undiscovered, uncharted territory

1037
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,100
and that can be daunting.

1038
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,740
It, you know, it can be shocking ontologically,

1039
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:53,100
it can be all of those things, but, you know,

1040
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,260
what better time than now, I think.

1041
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,660
We might as well go for it.

1042
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:03,660
I, 100%, I mean, 100%, I mean, I think we're overdue

1043
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:09,980
for a paradigm shift, really, and I think that my work

1044
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:14,260
is just, you know, the thing that's just kinda

1045
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:17,820
potentially push it over, you know,

1046
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:22,820
but it's been there waiting to be tipped over, you know.

1047
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,260
But what's interesting is it's kind of,

1048
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,780
it's almost like the, you know, the iceberg effect

1049
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,780
where, you know, the iceberg, the part of the iceberg

1050
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,380
you don't see underwater is melting, okay,

1051
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,900
so you can be like, you can be in a, you know,

1052
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,460
Kodiak, you know, right near this iceberg, you know,

1053
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,180
and then all of a sudden the thing decides to flip on you,

1054
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,500
you know, that's a big thing to flip, you know,

1055
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,540
it's not like a slow little thing like this,

1056
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:59,300
it just goes, and overnight, totally different.

1057
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:03,820
Yeah, I expect something like that to happen very soon.

1058
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,940
I'll end with one final question here,

1059
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,020
and, you know, feel free to answer this

1060
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,780
in any way you see fit, but I had to ask,

1061
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,740
have you seen any interest from intelligence agencies

1062
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,260
when it comes to your work,

1063
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,980
especially in this particular field?

1064
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,500
Well, first of all, I've always been self-funding,

1065
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,820
and so I've never taken any money

1066
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,940
from any of the, you know, three-letter agencies,

1067
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,260
and I've been, but the reality is,

1068
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,900
the reality is, I've been too public about this work

1069
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,700
in scientific conferences

1070
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,660
where I know there's a high intelligence,

1071
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,220
I mean, just by definition, okay, I mean,

1072
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:54,100
if you go to a parapsychological association,

1073
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,300
you tell me you don't think there's anybody

1074
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,660
that, you know, reports back to intelligence

1075
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,860
at what they learned?

1076
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,740
I mean, you know, it's, I'd be naive to think

1077
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,980
that that wasn't the case,

1078
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,980
and so, yeah, you know,

1079
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,220
I think that they're interested in my work,

1080
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:17,220
I mean, there's, but I haven't anybody, you know,

1081
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,340
come to me and, you know, offer me a position like that,

1082
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:25,340
I mean, I've been working, yeah, I've been wanting to,

1083
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,780
one of the things, I have somebody who's interested

1084
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,740
in funding my research who says that one of the things

1085
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,460
that's the problem with being funded

1086
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,020
by the three-letter agencies is that things remain

1087
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,700
classified and you have no control over it,

1088
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:43,460
and so he wants to see private investors step up

1089
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,540
to the plate to fund research

1090
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,460
that then becomes the public's property, you know,

1091
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,020
it's kind of the, because that's been part of the problem

1092
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:55,020
is that, you know, a lot of this stuff still remains,

1093
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,980
a lot of the stuff still remains classified.

1094
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,820
Still secret.

1095
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:04,780
And so, but, you know, the reality is,

1096
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:11,500
is that public perception has not diminished

1097
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,300
in terms of its beliefs of this, if anything, you know,

1098
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,300
it's grown.

1099
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,980
It's increased, yeah.

1100
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,980
Do you ever feel sort of apprehensive

1101
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,980
about these agencies approaching these children perhaps,

1102
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,380
like in the future?

1103
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,100
As someone who follows a lot of this stuff,

1104
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,940
and I've looked at all the Stargate stuff

1105
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,420
and all the, you know, Grill Flame, and it goes back,

1106
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,260
and MKUltra and all these things,

1107
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:42,140
but do you ever, are you ever weary of that fact

1108
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:45,140
or cognizant of that fact that, you know,

1109
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,780
they might be approached one day?

1110
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,780
Because I feel like that would be of great interest

1111
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,860
to a lot of these agencies.

1112
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:57,660
Well, I mean, one of the things to say is that

1113
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,500
none of us want, we're very protective of these children.

1114
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,940
None of us want to see them get exploited.

1115
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,780
We really don't.

1116
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,940
What we want is for them to have opportunities

1117
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:12,140
to get an education and make the contributions

1118
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,500
they want to in the world.

1119
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,540
And rather turning them into, you know,

1120
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,860
psychic spies or this or that, you know,

1121
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:24,860
what they want to do is help solve a lot of the big questions

1122
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,780
that we have that have to do with saving the planet,

1123
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,820
you know, and, you know, they're very interested

1124
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:36,660
in making the world a better place.

1125
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:40,900
And I think that that's a beautiful mission

1126
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,220
that we need to protect as much as we're protecting them.

1127
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:45,980
Well said.

1128
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,700
Yeah, I think that's a perfect way to end it.

1129
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,500
You know, it completely sort of exemplifies

1130
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:56,140
their mission statement and who they are.

1131
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,460
I think, you know, you look at these children

1132
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,180
and even these adults and the one thing you can tell

1133
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,660
for sure is that they're all pure of heart.

1134
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:10,620
And I think that is the biggest gift that they have,

1135
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:15,380
you know, is showing us that amount of compassion,

1136
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,780
not only for each other, but for this earth.

1137
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,700
So a beautiful message.

1138
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,620
Thank you so much, Dr. Powell.

1139
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,700
You've been just an absolute delight.

1140
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,980
I enjoyed picking your brain,

1141
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,780
so thank you for letting me do that.

1142
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,740
You're very welcome.

1143
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:32,660
Thank you.

1144
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,580
So there you have it, folks.

1145
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,020
That is my interview with Dr. Diane Hennessey Powell

1146
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,980
on telepathy and her work therein.

1147
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:42,100
Just a fascinating human being.

1148
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,060
And honestly, I commend her for her work

1149
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,260
because it has to be so challenging

1150
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,460
to not only get past the hurdles of communication

1151
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,140
with a lot of these people,

1152
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,180
but just even hearing their stories,

1153
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,660
you know, listening to the telepathy tapes

1154
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,540
was such an emotional rollercoaster for myself

1155
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,140
that I couldn't imagine being subjected to that

1156
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,300
on a daily basis.

1157
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,820
It definitely takes a strong person to, you know,

1158
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:09,220
be exposed to this type of stuff on a daily basis.

1159
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,420
Folks, I would love to hear your thoughts on all of this.

1160
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:16,700
What in this interview was the most interesting thing

1161
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,300
that you took away from this?

I appreciate you so much.

1183
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,780
Couldn't have done this without you.

1184
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,420
This is my acceptance speech, by the way.

1185
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,300
I didn't practice.

1186
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,420
I didn't write anything down.

1187
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,940
Yeah, okay, I'll leave it at that.

1188
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,220
Happy holidays, everybody.

1189
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,660
Merry Christmas and all that stuff.

1190
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,900
And we'll see you on the next video.

1191
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:26,900
Peace.
