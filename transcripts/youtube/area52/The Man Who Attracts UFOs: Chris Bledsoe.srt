1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,200
Agent Ramsey we've got a new investigation for you something your department should have a look at

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,600
I'm sending over the information as we speak you'll need to travel to North Carolina pack your bags

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,320
Throughout human history the appearance of luminous orbs in the sky has ignited wonder fear and

4
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,240
speculation these ethereal lights hovering darting or pulsing with a strange intelligence

5
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:02,560
transcend folklore and defy easy categorization they challenge our understanding of reality itself

6
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,280
stirring questions about consciousness dimensions and the unknown forces shaping our existence

7
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,440
what if these phenomena are not mere anomalies but deliberate messages encoded in light and mystery

8
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,480
amid the myriad of accounts of contact and unexplained encounters fewer as polarizing or

9
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,840
profound as the story of Chris Bledsoe his journey took a dramatic turn in 2008 with an

10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,720
extraordinary event an encounter not just with luminous orbs but with its occupants and what

11
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,520
followed was a cascade of disbelief and ostracism as his family became the target of ridicule

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,040
relegated to the fringes of their community this eventually inspired Chris to write his

13
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:59,520
best-selling book UFO of God in it he recounts the events that upended his life but more importantly

14
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,960
he unpacks the spiritual and existential questions those experiences forced him to confront

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,760
Bledsoe's story isn't just about UFOs or alien craft it explores the deeply spiritual

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
intertwining divine intervention ancient archetypes

17
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,760
mysterious healing abilities prophetic messages and even a burning tree this tree just spontaneously

18
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,000
combusted in our backyard it's a modern day odyssey but this is no mere personal account

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,320
Bledsoe's experiences have captured the attention of powerful institutions

20
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,880
including the US government and even the Vatican why would agencies rooted in geopolitics and

21
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,720
theology take an interest in a rural man's encounters with orcs could the truths here

22
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,600
be so profound that they might blur the lines between science and religion in this investigation

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,680
we'll trace the arc of Bledsoe's encounters from his initial contact to the intricate spiritual

24
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
revelations that followed what is it about his story that bridges the gap between the skies and

25
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,160
the sacred and why does it matter now more than ever oh my god oh my god look at that

26
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:20,720

expectations not expecting anything except a good conversation and just uh just hanging out so good

39
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:50,160
morning the day of the event that changed everything was january the eighth of 07

40
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,200
i was a builder always been a builder my wife's family were builders my dad was a builder

41
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,520
other than growing up on farming and building is what i did career was to be a pilot a commercial

42
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,680
pilot which i have achieved that um but i never i quit flying because of having children i wanted

43
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,880
to be home with my children so i was in the building business in a big way went desert storm and

44
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:31,040
the 911 thing happened 2001 i was caught with 72 houses under construction i was a big builder

45
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,760
a lot of houses we built 100 a year so now i'm with these houses and the world trade center

46
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,880
collapse and being in fedville north carolina which is home of fort brag fort liberty they call it now

47
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,440
predominant military town it dried up the housing market nobody's buying

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
really you're seeing just broad-based declines across all of the major technologies

49
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,320
and that means life as most americans know it is about to change in some cases dramatically

50
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,760
they don't know if they're going to be in iraq or iran or where they're going to be

51
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,320
next week so the military just shut down so here i am with nearly a hundred thousand dollars a month

52
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,880
going out in interest and overhead and no houses sell up

53
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,200
so i saw a train wreck come in i was suffering with crone's disease

54
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:38,000
since my early 20s 26 or 27 and developed that and by now 2001 i went from happy and

55
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,520
you know living on a golf course in a big old house with a pool and kids playing golf at the

56
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:54,640
country club you know i grew up to all of a sudden i see the end coming i'm losing everything and i

57
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:03,680
did i lost it all by 2005 i had gone through about 18 million dollars worth of apartments and condo

58
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,120
or houses everything i had and rental property to to to pay the interest and all until i

59
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,800
eventually sold the company i'm sick with crones at the worst point of my life

60
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:26,560
because the more you stress the worse that disease gets recovering from a near-death

61
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
experience in the hospital by a doctor that over-medicated me

62
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,040
to try to get back into the workforce now i'm not able to work i'm dealing with this

63
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,840
sickness and now the worst depression i'm starting over i'm 46 years old now i've

64
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,160
got to apply for free lunches for my kids in school that's how bad it got

65
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,820
me

66
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,600
and so january the eighth of 07 i was had finally started back trying to work a bit

67
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,440
right after christmas my crew went down to the coast and finished the house and brought a check

68
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,600
back so they show up to my house so that day the eighth and they want to celebrate called me about

69
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,000
two o'clock said hey boss we'd like to go fishing you want to come celebrate with us

70
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,840
i said why not it's just me and chris jr and my wife and other three kids were out of town

71
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,600
were with their mom and so we we waited on them well they called me i went to their house i picked

72
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,840
them up they're between me and the river's three and a half miles away by car and their houses were

73
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,520
kind of in between that so it went out of my way much to pick them up and plus i had the only

74
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:52,240
four drive that could get down in this bottom so now we're walking along we're parked on the river

75
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:01,920
we cross the cornfield and i kind of give you an idea where we were this is cornfield on on our left

76
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,480
and in the middle of this field is a little tube road that drives across this field to the far side

77
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,640
to the trees and when you get to those trees the river's down in there so you go down the hill

78
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,960
through a gate a metal gate sits right on the crest of the hill this is flat cornfield and the

79
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,120
river dives off down in and this gate's sitting right up there on the peak of that hill right you

80
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,800
don't notice it till you're down looking up all you see is the sky and this big old metal gate

81
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:42,080
right i drove down in there about a quarter mile down to the end of a cul-de-sac we park

82
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,160
by three o'clock they were sitting on the bank fishing and i told them i said i'm going to walk

83
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,920
down in the forest and just meditate i'm not into fishing didn't tell them what i was thinking

84
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,800
i'm crying out lord help me what do i do i'm 46 i'm sick can't afford to

85
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,720
feed my children now i need help this is the mindset this is the important part that everyone

86
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,880
understands what we're dealing what i was dealing with so i go in the woods i find a big old tree

87
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:24,240
along the river on a gully and i sat down for about an hour now it's 4 30 4 45 and it's getting

88
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,360
dark in the woods the sun sets at 5 30 in january around here so down under that canopy it's already

89
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,240
dark in there so i walked back out to where they were fishing and asked them did they want to stay

90
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,760
or fish some more and um they wanted to fish we just got here boss let's fish more

91
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,400
so i said okay we need to get a fire going it's going to get cold tonight got a fire going in about

92
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:57,360
10 minutes to five now i told them once i knew they had the fire and they're sitting there on

93
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,120
the bank with the fire they're facing the water with their poles and the fire right behind them

94
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,160
i was always an organizer trying to organize people so i thought they're okay

95
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,760
now i'm going to walk up the hill

96
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,520
so i told them that's what i was going to do i was going to sit up there to dark

97
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,840
and watch for wildlife to come out in the field maybe a deer would walk out a coyote or turkeys

98
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,400
and uh they're telling why but that was the excuse i use all the while i'm struggling mentally

99
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,000
what i do how do i feed my children i'm depressed worse than ever

100
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,720
i'm struggling with thoughts you know just a bad place to be i'm broke i have nothing

101
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,760
anyhow and i got a little spooked because i heard something walking in the woods beside me

102
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,440
which nothing really spooks me at night like that as i grew up hunting and from a young age

103
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,320
in the woods and and never afraid but all of a sudden i'm got a little spooked

104
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,960
because when i'd stop it would stop and i couldn't see in the woods it's so thick

105
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:19,920
but i could hear it and it sounded like two feet at times walking and um so i'd stop and i'd look

106
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,440
and i got on my knees three times to look under the shrubs trying to see past the barrier of

107
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:35,920
shrubs that line most of the roads and fields around it so i get on down to the the dog leg

108
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,200
left toward the west so i'm parallel in the river for a little more than an eighth of a mile now i

109
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,960
got an eighth of a mile to go up to the gate and and i'm facing west so i can see the sky

110
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,200
and the sky is not black the stars aren't out but i knew the sun was probably beneath the tree

111
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,800
so i walked up that hill and when i got within 30 feet of the top of that hill

112
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,240
i began to see what i thought was the sun the top of it and the higher i got up that hill

113
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,760
the more of the sun i could see and by the time i got to where i could see the whole thing i thought

114
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,160
man that don't even that that's weird

115
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,080
i could see what looked like the sun the same size when you can look at it in the evening it

116
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:29,520
doesn't hurt your eyes but it was more blood red and it looked like fire going around it and for

117
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,720
the first minute i thought oh that i'd struggle with it you know this has got to be the sun

118
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,320
so i'm i take a few more steps up that hill and now there are two of these i can see much more

119
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:48,720
wider view and i've got two suns that look just alike and they're just above the trees just beyond

120
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,040
the road so there's 200 yards of field and they're probably 100 yards behind that up

121
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,240
just above the trees just set in there two big glowing orange tangerine orange the blood red

122
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:10,800
tangerine orange the blood red it kind of in that mix of colors and they're swirling around

123
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,920
and around fire and little tips of flames are shooting off in all directions so i'm freaked

124
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,160
out now i never seen anything like that never thought about ufos all i thought about it was

125
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,880
losing my business and being sick and dealing with that so i squatted down and hid myself

126
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,000
i had still more hill in front of me i'm not to the top yet so i'm using that as my advantage

127
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,800
you know i've ducked down and i look up and they're there i don't know how long i sit there doing that

128
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:51,440
but it wasn't long that i had gotten afraid enough that i got worried about the boys down the hill

129
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,800
and chris jr so i thought i've got to run i just can't take this any longer you know i didn't know

130
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:11,680
knew i was there so by saying that is a very big part of this for example if you see a light fly

131
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,800
by a star or a satellite or whatever it is even though it's an orb you see it it's different than

132
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,680
just seeing something than something responding and seeing you and coming in your space and say

133
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:34,000
i see you see now you got this power that you can't imagine that has you on its radar so i turned

134
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
to run and when i did i had to look back one more time so i'm i actually turned my body while i'm

135
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,440
hiding squatted down behind that hill and i'll turn real slow and i'm facing down and i know

136
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,440
i've got to go down that way no flashlight through these weeds and ruts you know so i'm making this

137
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,240
plant to get away i committed i'm running now i had to look back one more time and so i

138
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:09,360
raised up i looked back to take off and that's when everything changed this third setting sun

139
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:19,440
right above me just appeared and shot down the very minute it was so time that i knew without a

140
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:27,360
shadow of a doubt that it saw me and that i was on its radar and that's when the chills set in

141
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:35,360
and the fear set in and the feeling of being like a lab rat or uh you know something and

142
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,400
something that i couldn't get away from something that's got me so next thing i remember it's the

143
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:50,160
last 50 feet to the fire i can see the fire is very low now it's just a tiny little fire

144
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,080
and three men standing around it looking down no longer fishing and i'm coming out of the

145
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:02,080
dark right they don't see me coming but i can see them and when i got really close to them i

146
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:11,360
shouted i said hey guys you would never guess what i just saw immediately one of the guys said where

147
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,400
and there and i won't say the words he said have you been i said what do you mean i was

148
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,320
just up at the hill no you won't see yeah i was i haven't gone but 20 minutes oh no you've been

149
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,080
gone all night i'm like no way i was going 20 minutes no you've been gone all night

150
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,840
then i realized chris junior's not there so i said where's junior they said well he's been

151
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,120
gone two hours looking for you we can't find him either

152
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,200
so i took off from them running shouting for him so he's in the far back of the cul-de-sac

153
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,160
missing that's the last time they saw him i ran back there shouting for him

154
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,840
worried he's lost in a big head of woods that is very rugged and goes for 60 miles to the beach

155
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
or more of this woods

156
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,200
in this clip taken from a podcast hosted by one of chris's sons ryan called bled so said so

157
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,560
ryan and his co-host nick get chris jr to open up about his experience for the first time in

158
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,080
over a decade now chris jr's discomfort in recalling the encounter immediately becomes

159
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,000
apparent as he repeatedly fails to vocalize the event which is clearly still very traumatic

160
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,960
well so it started out we were you know all fishing on the river right right we got

161
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:47,200
wondering where's dad at so i'm with a couple guys and down this dark path i happen to see these two

162
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,160
red glowing balls of light it was really dark out and i happened to be looking down that way

163
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,960
and i saw these two orbs you know about this big about waist high off the ground just floating

164
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,360
so all i could see was these two bright red orbs side beside where were they when you first saw

165
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,080
down the path there coming down the road yeah two just little you know they're not very big

166
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,760
just a ball of light red ball of light talking to this old fella gene he's the one that was like

167
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,080

168
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,920

169
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,360
of cotton that's how quiet it was i'm telling these guys about this and and they're like

170
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,200
oh i don't see nothing quite playing with me they thought out they literally did not see these red

171
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,320
balls of light i was pointing saw them and tried to tell the guys i tried to yes yes i tried to

172
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,440

173
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,840
yeah oh because dad was missing for four hours yeah i thought i would stay just in case he came

174
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,400
back okay got in the truck and left and i knew these things were in the woods you know or i knew

175
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,680
they were still there so um i just went into the wood line you know thinking i'm gonna get i guess

176
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,320
get a better view of them or and um

177
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:24,160
you know i was by myself and um i'm gonna get back on track yeah so i went in the wood line and um

178
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,800
i saw these two little guys come out of the out of the woods right along the side of the right

179
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:39,360
where the river was i'm sorry dude that's totally totally totally totally fine

180
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,120
and then next thing you know i didn't see any more orbs i just saw these little creatures come

181
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,600
walking out the woods it was really dark and just like little creatures a little skinny

182
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:00,480
and i could see the you know they're i guess their body but not like uh what they were wearing

183
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,280
i'm struggling with all this you know i'm a panicked dad now where's my son so i start

184
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,920
making my way into the thickness the shrubbery stick around the edge to get into the woods i

185
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,000
didn't have a flashlight i'm panicked shouting for it i thought if i could get in there i could

186
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,920
find them all right i'm i was standing in the wood lines and i in the wood line and i saw these

187
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,000
take your time bro yeah take your time we we want you your comfort level is the most important

188
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:43,680
seriously well i've never talked about it yeah i get the worst anxiety when i think about it

189
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:51,680
and that's why i stay strapped okay well i saw these two little guys

190
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,360
i never can talk about it it's good man

191
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,240
we can seriously stop if you want to and about that time these two little three foot tall

192
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,320
three or four foot tall little tiny little midget men come out of the woods and they're tiny little

193
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:34,480
people very dark almost translucent you know like it like a shadow almost they had big red eyes

194
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:42,000
yeah they were abnormally large for their size yeah their head was it didn't look symmetrical

195
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,520
i don't know how to put in the words what i'm thinking i'm in the wood line and and they're

196
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,760
they come out of the woods for me and i'm across this little field right so they're on the river

197
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:03,200
side and i'm on the opposite side right in the edge of the woods they uh come straight for me

198
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,080
they knew i was there they could see me in the wood line and one of them was looking at me at all

199
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:18,400
times he was describing these creatures that would look at him and paralyze it i think one was picking

200
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,640
up cans and bottles and looking at them sticks and put them on the ground on their hands and knees

201
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:33,040
while one was always staring at that's what scared him to death he was looking me right now

202
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:40,800
looking me right in the eyes i felt like he was the whole time he was staring me down one of them

203
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:48,000
and the other one i remember seeing him bend over and pick up a bottle and uh he just kind of looked

204
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,040
at it and sat it back down there was a little glass bottle i just i remember the way that their

205
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:02,080
eyes moved it always kind of freaked me out one of them would just kind of go down and come back up

206
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,720
and then the other one would like one eye was always open at all times yeah like crazy sounds

207
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,200
yeah and but it was flat on the bottom exactly yeah it was flat like the eyelid itself

208
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,640
you know it would it would come down and go back up and at all times when this was happening i

209
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,280
couldn't scream or yell you know i couldn't cry or run or whatever i was trying to do all these

210
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:37,520
things couldn't move because i knew something was up i'm looking at these little tiny these little

211
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:44,720
tiny dark looking guys and i can't i can't do anything this is why i never i didn't ever

212
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,160
you know i want to talk about it because i my brain scrambles into it it's the only way you

213
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,760
can get over the truck comes back down the path that yeah dad's truck that the guys had taken to

214
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,800
find dad they look over really fast at this truck that's coming down this long path and

215
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,320
they both look over at it really fast and they they haul ass they run and on all fours into

216
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:18,320
a pile of cut down trees dad pulls up and these guys and they're hollering for me i could hear

217
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:25,200
him saying junior i hear him i'm i'd walked about five to eight feet into those bushes

218
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,920
is where i almost stepped on him and he'd come up from under those bushes grabbing onto me

219
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,720
and he's he's in shock he's in pennant like right over there and they don't know what the

220
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,280
fuck i'm talking about and he's like where have you been daddy why'd you leave me why'd you leave

221
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,600
me i've been looking for you all night i said son i ain't been gone for 20 minutes no dad you've

222
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,480
been going all night and he's weeping and he's crying and he's like these creatures they scared

223
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,080
me dad they scared me bad i'm like creatures he said yeah these creatures they had red eyes

224
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,240
and i couldn't move and i was paralyzed and he's telling me all this right i want to go home i want

225
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,440
to go home just take me home this is all he's saying i'm trying to explain to him and me and

226
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:15,520
dad both said at the same time essentially i saw a ufo and i was saying i just saw some like a

227
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,960
little alien or whatever yeah we both were saying that at the same time to one another

228
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,360
so i lead him back to the fire where these three guys are standing and now their eyes are biggest

229
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,880
pie plates because they're hearing jr talking freaking out about creatures and i've been going

230
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,520
all night they've been looking for me and i'm talking about these big balls of fire in the sky

231
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,400
so about that time one of the guys with me shouts and says look and we all look up

232
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,840
and there were eight or nine stars that looked like stars the brightest ones you see in the

233
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,040
night sky they just appeared in a big circle above us and somebody points up in the sky

234
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,520
and we all look up and there are a ton of different little lights in the sky

235
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:13,280
and they all are doing this weird thing and they flew out away and they come back together and they

236
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,920
went around in circles it looked like somebody choreographed them you know was directing them

237
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:24,640
how to work see what what looked like bright stars you know they were scattered one you know

238
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,960
across the treeline and i could just you could just see them descending slowly and then a couple

239
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,120
of them shoot down over the side of the river and it just like dropping like i said you know

240
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,560
it looked like a piece of a hot steel or something you know they were oranges and then you could see

241
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,840
separate other colors it was orange and maybe yellow i remember being one on the left uh right

242
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,160
one in the middle and one toward the left from that tree to this tree they were right there you

243
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,280
could see them just perfect right there we're sitting there looking at this and then three of

244
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,320
these things come out of the sky all the way to ground and landed in front of us on the other side

245
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,040
of the river that's when it freaked me out now so hey guys look y'all see them y'all see these

246
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,880
i got some paranoia to open my pocket now and that's when the phoenix said you know

247
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:20,000
okay we gotta go we just all loaded up in the truck pandemonium sits in and we all jump in my

248
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,320
truck leaving fishing poles and everything and we took off out of there we get back up to the top

249
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,160
of that hill come over that hill very fast almost went airborne going over it accelerating up that

250
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:40,560
hill and i had to gem on the brakes because in front of us now are the same three orbs but

251
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,640
two of them were in the exact same spot the first two red balls of fire but the third one that

252
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:54,320
appeared it came down as the one that took me that took me for four hours now it's sitting in

253
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:01,280
the road blocking our path to the highway it was a light right on it was a big light it was just

254
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,640
another big low-end light it was like oh but didn't you know like i said it just kind of just

255
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,520
hold your hand up like that kind of try to remember it what if from the distance

256
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,920
i could put my hand around it like that maybe it's about five feet off the ground just sitting there

257
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:25,200
hovering and it looked like an egg or a football laying on its side standing up but like something

258
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,880
it was more like a tic tac sort of i didn't know what a tic tac was but what got the government

259
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,880
on me there's a whole fleet of them look on the essay was when i did report this

260
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,960
i reported the length to being approximately 45 to 50 feet long it's shaped like a

261
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,800
a pill or egg or a football you know the light going around this thing was mesmerizing i mean

262
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:59,360
it was like this these blades are look like crystals the light actually just doing this

263
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,320
around and around and it's just sitting there doing that everybody's freaked out i was just

264
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,720
kind of in my own world some of them are crying some of them are begging we didn't have a phone

265
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,480
but they they were pointing at shit and screaming and yelling and it was fucking chaos

266
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,680
so happened to be a house back in there to our right i drove across the ditch up in their yard

267
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,600
tried to signal them their tv was playing through the front door you could see it

268
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,520
their cars were there nobody answered the door the very next day the guys went back to get our

269
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,120
fishing poles and stuff they went over to his house because he knew him they played football

270
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,120
softball together one of the guys he said we were home all night you didn't come to my house

271
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,200
like yeah we were we were blowing the horn at your front door all this was investigated by NASA

272
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:07,120
people from NASA and the intelligence world very thoroughly about that time after we discovered

273
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,600
nobody's there i back out of their property back out on the road now i'm back facing this thing

274
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,200
and we're not going anywhere it's blocking the road about that time we heard three gunshots

275
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,320
and on the third shot this thing pivots and here it comes down the highway and comes right up over

276
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,520
my truck silent and it was so low i could have shot it with a slingshot through the top of the

277
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,400
sunroof it made no sound so once it passed overhead it kind of pivoted to the north and

278
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,040
fired off like it was out of a cannon and went out of sight so i hit the gas and away we're

279
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,880
going we're going home and the weird thing was i'm no longer afraid i'm in this different

280
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,400
my mind is seems like time has slowed down and i'm looking at everything from a different

281
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,600
perspective i'm not afraid i'm curious i'm watching them like wondering why they're so

282
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:11,840
afraid they were freaked out everybody badly but one of those unique things about this the miracles

283
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:22,560
that happen is um on the way to take them home between where we were and the first guy's houses

284
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:29,040
are two miles away and then about four miles five maybe to the follow follow but a mile from

285
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:35,600
where we were is where i was shot when i was 10 and the first near death and a little less than

286
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:44,240
a mile from where we were is where i read a bit in the book about my first wife was killed in a

287
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,240
car wreck uh turned her car over end over end and was thrown out and i happened to be

288
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,840
uh riding down that road i'd been out of town all day come home and i found her didn't notice

289
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,560
her until i stumbled on her just saw the car laying on the side and she died right there with me hold

290
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:12,640
her and um so i felt guilty all my life about that that i should have been home it wasn't my

291
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:19,920
fault i wasn't there so everything a person and the traumatic the trauma of

292
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,360
seeing her mangled up you know it's bad

293
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,080
it has

294
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:42,880
but the joy was is right when we got to that spot and we got to pass by the spot

295
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:51,520
to drop these guys off this thing this thing was hovering right directly over top where i found her

296
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,680
and i slammed on the brakes because it was right for i mean it was literally we were almost up under

297
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:05,120
it right it was there above us and just above the power line and it freaked everybody out so bad they

298
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,640
started beating on the seat and screaming go go go and i jammed on the brakes i'm trying to stop

299
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:16,480
i want to get out and look because i'm reliving that whole thing that happened 20 years before

300
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:25,040
20 years before and this vision came into my head they did this and they told me that

301
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:31,280
don't it's not your fault you don't need to worry about that anymore she says fine

302
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:41,280
so that was the first time in 20 years that i felt relief from it not being my fault

303
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,280
so

304
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,280
now i i hit the gas i wanted to stop they wouldn't let me i drop them off i take them on home and i

305
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,600
drop them off so chris junior and i go back home and we get home about 11 30 and he's running

306
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,680
through the house like a madman turning lights on i'm in my study trying to find out if it's

307
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:24,480
been on tv if the military's coming and about that time i hear this sound go over my house and

308
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:32,320
it sounded like a helicopter and i just knew that fort brag was because the way it came

309
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,040
is from brag and the way it was going was directly to the river so in my mind

310
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,360
fort brag's on the way yeah here they come

311
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,520
my dad raised dogs all his life he hunt hunted with dogs until he died he still had 15 hound dogs

312
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:01,920
and a kennel behind his house we lived side by side back then on six acres and behind the

313
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,560
house was a head of woods and then there was the dog kennel all of a sudden all these dogs start

314
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,240
barking so i thought immediately somebody's breaking into dad's garage so i told creature

315
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,080
no we're gonna i gotta go out there and see who's breaking into dad's shop he's like no dad please

316
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:24,480
don't go out there don't go don't go beg of me and i had a chesapeake bay retriever sitting on the

317
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,720
back steps hair standing up and she's barking towards the direction of the kennels i said look

318
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,600
i'm gonna send her ahead of us we'll sneak down the path and see what we can see and he

319
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:44,160
did not want to go but when i open that door i'm going he grabs me by the back of the shirt and

320
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,560
rosie took off down into i went out about 40 yards and looked back to see if we were coming

321
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:59,040
and she went on it so jr and i will make our way quietly across our property back into the woods

322
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:07,680
and up we snuck up to the dog kennel now it's so loud you got 15 hounds and a retriever barking

323
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:15,360
every breath and we're standing where i can see them and i said i'm gonna send rosie in in the

324
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,120
woods we're trained dogs they do whatever you you know i can make her attack somebody and you and

325
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:28,800
i need to run back to down the path to the yard to this big oak tree and we'll use it to hide behind

326
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,480
and let the dog come on out push whatever's in there out i take off running he's got me by the

327
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,560
shirt we get to the grass to the out of the out of the woods out onto the back centipede

328
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,200
i gotta make a left now hard left to go to the back corner to cut this dog off and i slipped

329
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:55,040
because of a frost on the grass and jr turned loose i thought he was just to turn loose and

330
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:01,280
was still behind me i got 100 yards to run right so i ran on back to this back of this property

331
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,280
thinking he's behind me undoubtedly he had had all the excitement he could handle

332
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,440
and he made a right and went back to the house and went in the house while i went left and went to

333
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,480
the back of the property so i'm still thinking he's behind me right now i run up to this tree

334
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,400
i hear the dogs come in i'm in front of the dog now and i run up to this tree in a full run

335
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,080
because it's just going down quick right and i run and i hit the tree stopped myself and i'm

336
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:37,440
panting trying to be quiet because they could hear you know any animal whatever to hear that

337
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,880
would go the other way the very second i run up to that tree i'm trying to catch my breath

338
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,160
i turn around and i look to see if jr is coming on up behind me and this is when everything

339
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,800
changed it was no longer jr back there but behind me about four feet behind me

340
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,840
is a very little creature that he described on the river with the glowing red eyes so now

341
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:12,880
behind me four feet behind me is this little translucent glowing toddler no higher than that

342
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:21,680
it's glowing the color of the moon like the moon that soft white glow but it was so shiny on the

343
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:29,040
outside the outer surface of this being was shiny like glass gleaming and underneath this shirt

344
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:38,400
or whatever it had on was a triangle shape like a triangle very important symbol to some people in

345
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:45,200
the government i immediately thought i was dead i was so afraid when i saw that and that's my backs

346
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,560
to it right i'm holding on to the tree and i'm panting and i see it and i'm like oh my god so

347
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,040
i didn't want to get closer to it so i sucked myself even right against the tree and i used it

348
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,080
to turn myself around and i dropped my hands down and i looked at it and i said i surrender

349
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:10,480
i don't mean you no harm i thought it was gone and here's the dog still coming closer and louder

350
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,680
and louder and louder and she's just in the woods good now and this thing's behind me and and when

351
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,920
i dropped my hands it said you don't understand we're not here to hurt you we're here to help you

352
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:30,000
and about that time it the dog comes busting out of the forest behind me right out of the street

353
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,480
i knew that was where it was coming and just being just vanished in front of me the dog ran

354
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,360
right on by ran a quarter mile i could still hear her running barking you heard this in your head

355
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,240
no i could hear the dog barking no but the uh the voice telling you the voice was an audible voice

356
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:55,120
in my head i heard it sound like a man deeply walked back to the house contemplating it should

357
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,760
i tell chris jr what i just saw he's afraid already i don't want to tell no more

358
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,600
so i took that to the house and and um i was very quiet about it

359
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,200
this also sparked chris's first miraculous healing event which he says cured him of his

360
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,320
crone's disease from that point forward that day i never took another pill for crone's disease

361
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:28,320
for the rest of my life i have no symptoms um i've been tested at chapel hill university

362
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:37,200
where did it go my books title ufo of god because of that very night i'm crying out to god help me

363
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:45,600
and these ufo's come out of the sky it is we're looking beings with glowing eyes and uh healed me

364
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,280
and forever changed my life there were several other healing events that had also taken place

365
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,000
which we'll get into a bit later i then asked chris if he could take me back to that day in the

366
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:07,440
woods what happened in those four hours of missing time for the first uh 14 months i could not think

367
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:15,040
about it and you could not convince me that i missed any time my son and the guys with me

368
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,000
were the ones that convinced me because they walked back to and they showed me to where they

369
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,840
had moved the truck and i had massive headaches thinking about it up to that point which was at

370
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,200
least a year between the initial experience and then the uh it was more like a year and a half he

371
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,680
would sometimes pass out if he even tried to think about what happened he would scream in his sleep

372
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,800
have nightmares cold sweats there were sometimes we would film him like he's talking about all

373
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,400
these strange things and it was like night terrors plagued him he couldn't remember and i would begin

374
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,840
to talk in my sleep at night a lot of times shouting and screaming afraid things they were

375
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:59,280
showing me so they brought in a psychiatrist from harvard a harvard trained psychiatrist that

376
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,920
was trained under dr john mack dr michael o'connell we loved him

377
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,320
and uh he said chris they put a block in your brain that um i'm going to remove that block

378
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:19,440
but i'm going to program you to remember everything that happened and so immediately i began to recall

379
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,480
things that happened but it was all images images images of things i couldn't make sense of what i

380
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:34,400
began to remember was first off was how they come and got me that that orb that shot down as

381
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,880
an orange ball beside the other two orange balls it came straight at me and it shifted into this

382
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,360
white egg came right up over top of me above me and i look up and all i could see was this

383
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,280
ball of light that just engulfed me around me and next thing i know i'm in a black room

384
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,960
and i could hear my breath and i was panicked and i was afraid i couldn't see anything in

385
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:08,400
either direction i couldn't even see me i got so afraid i could i could hear myself and this light

386
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,360
started to appear around me like a spotlight from above and i could see completely around me

387
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:21,280
my feet and all of white but i could stick my hand in the blackness and it would disappear

388
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,800
couldn't see outside of the light around me and soon this light started receding back

389
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:35,120
to where i began to see these three shadowy figures they were there with me and um well

390
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:41,920
that began a virtual tour it was a beautiful experience but they're describing everything

391
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,920
that they were showing me so i was basically in an orb felt like a bubble that i could touch the

392
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,880
walls but i couldn't see them i could see the stars under me and fill the floor but couldn't

393
00:44:52,880 --> 00:45:00,240
see the floor is that clear i began to see always sees different places in the u.s they would be up

394
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:09,280
looking down telling me what i'm seeing one particular thing that stuck out was us looking

395
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:17,440
at the pyramids in egypt and i'm seeing the spanks from the rear so we're up in the air looking over

396
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:25,520
the pyramids at the rear end of this pain then i see hathor's temple and i see all these engravings

397
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,040
about nature and about animals and birds and their deities are animals and birds right

398
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:37,760
understand any of it but this is what they were showing me these memories surfaced during hypnotic

399
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,640
regression which you can listen to in its entirety on the bledso setso podcasts which i've linked

400
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,040
below and these images were from that regression which was featured on a tv documentary in this

401
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,960
documentary ufos over earth the fayetteville incident after regressing chris through hypnosis

402
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,880
and submitting him to a stress detector test despite the multiple eyewitness accounts they

403
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,320
eventually deemed that chris wasn't being entirely truthful it was tough it was tough not to believe

404
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:13,360
there is no doubt in my mind what i saw whatever this machine says i don't know

405
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:21,280
um and don't care but i know what i saw and this documentary then began what chris refers to as

406
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,640
the five years of darkness which led him to eventually write his best-selling book ufo of

407
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:33,360
god i was a deacon in the pentagon so whole in this church imagine that and me talking about

408
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,600
you know ufos automatically you're playing with satan himself that's the devil

409
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:47,280
so now for the next five years this is what i call five years of darkness it changed

410
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
everybody in our house for the first time in our life we were not open we avoided the dinner table

411
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,320
together our marriage and our family was on the verge of splitting up over this thing

412
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:05,760
so it's been tough but um it's not a train wreck yet

413
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:14,400
the community is accusing me of being crazy accusing me of endangering my family

414
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,880
that i'm bringing the devil into my house they called social services on me

415
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,120
and trying to separate me from my family they tried to get my kids to be out of the house

416
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:34,480
i shouldn't be around them so my kids are at home now and here's the thing the phenomenon never left

417
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:42,160
from that day forward it didn't never leave it was at my house and i experienced it in the woods

418
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,760
and now when my wife and kids are coming home they're getting the daylight scared out of them

419
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,920
because i've got orbs in the house i've got beans walking shadowy beans my wife will tell you she

420
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,240
followed them to the house and they go through the walls and stuff always an orbit up here

421
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,880
a flash and then these shadow beans step out when they walk through five years of this um

422
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,960
my daughter's coming home from school crying the teachers are calling them out in front of the

423
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:19,440
classmates and my boys were all 13 15 and 17 now they're made fun of in school they were at dating

424
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:26,800
age so five years of this it turned into affecting my children in such a way

425
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:34,240
that i was angry ryan weighs in on what that period was like for him i remember getting off

426
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,240
the school bus days after it happened my grandpa immediately told me when i got to his house

427
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,480
he said boy your daddy's been smoking dope in the woods and he's been seeing green boogerman

428
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,280
i was like what do you mean what are you talking about he said he's been going crazy he's been

429
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,080
seeing green boogerman in the woods so that night when my dad gets home i start asking him

430
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:01,840
about the green boogerman and he broke it down and he told me everything and even as a 13 year

431
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:08,720
old child i had this deep sense that everything he was telling me was true i could just feel it i

432
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:17,360
could feel his intensity and just his genuineness and my brother who was with him i asked him about

433
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:22,160
everything and they explained me everything that happened and there was a lot of confusion at the

434
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,000
time so i don't think they quite understood everything that was happening and i think they

435
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:34,160
were processing a lot but you also have to keep in mind that we were a very tight Christian family

436
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,720
and not just our media family but our whole extended family the community really and the

437
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,880
way that we were taught was that there is no such thing as aliens or even ghosts and as far as i

438
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,920
knew you know my dad my my siblings my whole family we didn't believe in any of this stuff

439
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,200
so when he's talking to me about these things i know he's he's coming from somewhere pretty serious

440
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:05,120
and for me it always angered me and from a young age i realized that i had to

441
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,760
and maybe it was a subconscious thing but i always felt like i had to

442
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,360
defend them defend their honor defend their integrity which i think is a lot of the reason

443
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,960
why i am going out and being as vocal and public as i am i don't know maybe it's helping the part

444
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:28,960
of me as a child who was tormented watching them suffer maybe it's trying to make that right in

445
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:35,440
some way overcome by guilt once again chris calls out to the heavens as he once did this time

446
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:43,520
he's met with something else an entity an entity that he and the government refers to as

447
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:54,800
the lady so fast forward five years later now we're talking 2012 and this is the lady

448
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:01,200
we you asked me about the lady everybody talks about this figure the lady

449
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:13,200
in my book this this lady got the attention of the vatican to every branch of the government

450
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,880
and to several foreign countries they're all interested in this experience so i'm at the point

451
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,680
chris to where i wanted to quit i'm feeling the burden of being a bad father and i brought this

452
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:35,520
in my house and my kids lives are ruined my boys are set back and they become isolated and ashamed

453
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:46,000
and so on easter sunday saturday night of easter of 2012 i walk outside about 9 30 and i had so much

454
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:54,560
sadness and shame because of my children what i was seeing happening with them i was ready to

455
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:00,080
end it all so i walked out that night i looked up at the sky and i started shouting to the heavens

456
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:07,200
i said thank you for ruining my life and so i quit i'm never going to talk about this again

457
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:14,000
i'm done with you thank you for helping me but now you've ruined my life my whole family this is what

458
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,280
i said that night i went to bed this is sunday morning easter sunday morning at three a.m i

459
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:28,640
heard an audible voice in my room very loud man voice i mean it woke me up out of a dead sleep

460
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,560
i set up in the room i said who's in here i heard that it was the same voice that came from that

461
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:43,280
little being five years earlier it said arise in this manly voice the next thing i know i

462
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,280
didn't know why but i could see movement in the room these shadowy beings they always look shadowy

463
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:56,880
whatever it does it can completely control us like a machine and it could turn you on and off

464
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:03,760
pause us like a video game they had this kind of control so i'm up and i'm getting dressed at two

465
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:10,400
o'clock in the morning completely dressed out the back door i got now i'm following these three

466
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:17,600
again three shadowy figures not saying a word i'm not afraid but i'm behind them and they lead me

467
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,760
out to this dog camp if one of these figures reaches out and hands me something i said this is

468
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:35,440
your shimashki and it was shaped like a five pound pack of hamburger one of those tubes you

469
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,480
know it's twisted on me that's what it is shaped exactly like that but it felt like a living

470
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:46,800
creature it felt like it had fur that was prickly like a hedgehog sort of i couldn't feel the legs

471
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,800
or head i was struggling to see it because it's in the dark and so i dropped it immediately on

472
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:59,040
the ground because it felt like it was prickly my fingers and this voice said no you pick that up

473
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,280
you must keep so i reached down i picked this thing up and i'm juggling it and when i look up

474
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,880
these figures are gone now here i am at the dog kennel with this weird thing in my hand i don't

475
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:17,760
know what it is if it's going to bite me or what can't really see it good so i open a dog kennel

476
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,040
set it in i close the door just told me to keep it i thought well it's going to be safe there

477
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:31,680
the minute i had set that the kennel close that door this wind all i can tell you it wasn't in the

478
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:38,880
trees it wasn't blowing around the whole place it was directly focused in front of me a blast of

479
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,120
wind like somebody hit you with a cannon or a leak blower or something blew me backwards

480
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:51,920
right into the grass the leaves and as i'm falling backwards i see

481
00:54:53,040 --> 00:55:02,240
what looked like a translucent see-through cow bull cow run over top of me and i could see stars

482
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:12,000
inside it as it went over and that bit of message is going to be in another book what we discovered

483
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,680
about that a scientist that i've studied with a little and he mapped the great pyramid with

484
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:26,240
lidar and discovered that bull with the stars in it a huge one is painted on the wall inside

485
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:33,440
the king's chamber as a dna helix above it the only inscriptions ever found in that whole pyramid

486
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:41,120
they never found any until brother grant found us but it was the same thing that ran me over

487
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:49,840
that bull with the symbols of the stars in it so i land on my back the minute i roll over and i

488
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:56,720
start trying to get up to run i get up to my knees is all i got i push up to my knees next step was

489
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:04,960
to jump and go right but i was stopped because this cow was not there anymore but about six

490
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:12,640
feet from me maybe eight feet i couldn't reach her but it was a lady there and she's glowing

491
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:20,320
this beautiful bluish white color and lit up a circle on the ground probably 15 20 feet circle

492
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:27,600
and i'm inside that circle lit up and she's just floating three feet off the ground there's this

493
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:35,840
long white dress that i had a collar on opening white sparkly dress sitting down to the top side

494
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:43,280
feet and she was barefoot right here toes and this whole beautiful lady she was as human as

495
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:51,200
me and you and as beautiful as most beautiful woman you ever saw as she leaned storm and she said

496
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,600
you know i'm you know this is your burden you must bear you're going to tell this story

497
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:05,360
and if you do i will help you i'll always be with you and from this point forward

498
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:09,360
we will allow you to film our presence and share us with others

499
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,880
during another hypnotic regression chris goes into detail about what the lady's message was

500
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:24,240
so long story short the first regression was about the 2007 experience and it was

501
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:30,400
conducted at four hours missing time yeah it was it was conducted like a year later yes this one

502
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,080
is about the 2012 encounter with the lady and this regression was done many years 2018 she said she

503
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:46,160
was the divine feminine the manifestation of the universal force of love that she has existed since

504
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:53,600
before creation throughout all time you know throughout the universe that she's this force

505
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:59,600
that she is known as hathor but that throughout time she's gone by many names

506
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:09,200
and she said that there is a dark force that is basically scripting end times prophecy through

507
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:16,560
the book of revelations to try to manifest a cataclysm to wipe us out you know um that

508
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:21,520
they're trying to snuff out god but that there is this evil alien threat that that would be

509
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:29,280
the grand deception right and um she said he has to tell a story and if he doesn't then blood

510
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,000
would be on his hands you know something bad does happen and that there's going to be a star alignment

511
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:40,800
when the red star regulus aligns with the gaze of the sphinx just before dawn in the constellation

512
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:48,800
leo on the gaze of the sphinx in other words before daylight so before the sun rises

513
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:56,960
regulus should appear right on top of the sand as a red star is that at that moment would be a shift

514
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:05,520
into a whole new consciousness a new knowledge so i come home i mean i wrote this down and i

515
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:11,440
told it to quite a few people so they run these dilemmas to this program to see if it was even

516
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:19,920
going to happen as lo and behold easter of 2026 is when that's supposed to happen and so i put

517
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:28,960
that writing to some guys in the pentagon and um 2013 is when i told them that and now they're all

518
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:37,760
talking about 2026 2026 you hear it all over we've discovered yeah right i gave them the date you

519
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:45,520
know 12 years ago that something magic was going to happen what it is i don't know after meeting

520
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:51,280
this entity whom he calls the lady chris describes several other miraculous healing

521
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,040
events that had occurred and the first one was witnessed by ufo researcher grant cameron nelly

522
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:04,640
gets up off the ground and when she runs by him i saw blood shoot out of her neck like a

523
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:10,960
strange and i've got this dog i take her out the door and lay her down on the patio she got a hole

524
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,720
in her neck that long and it's gapped open that wide and you can see that deep and i could probably

525
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:23,120
stuck my finger that deep in her neck and how that happened nobody knows so i threw my hand on her

526
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:28,800
neck and i'm panicking holding her on the ground and trying to put pressure on her neck everybody

527
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:35,440
oh my god freaked out grant's got his camera out filming and when i knew that she was dead she won't

528
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:42,560
put him back in there was no hope and i looked up at the sky i said lord help her and immediately

529
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:49,120
i felt her just go limp and everybody saw it and when i raised my hand up off of this

530
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:55,040
her neck there was no more hole there it vanished and it vanished in front of everybody witnesses

531
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:01,840
even when camera filming that the other miraculous healing event was when chris was summoned to

532
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:08,640
washington by what sounds like some government entities to help a dying child who was given a

533
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:16,160
year to live and word got around about that and that drug that opened so many doors next thing i

534
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:24,160
know without getting into much detail about this i get a phone call in july um what are you doing

535
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:31,760
tomorrow i said tomorrow is july 3rd i said kids to be home he said we need you in dc

536
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:38,560
i said we who's we he said well we have a young boy up here that

537
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:48,160
is from a prominent family and he's very sick and in fact he is um he was given a make-a-wish

538
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:54,880
by president obama and he's had every bit they've exhausted every bit of care they can for him from

539
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:02,000
children's clinics from boston wherever and nobody could help him what he had according to

540
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:09,120
this guy was telling me he had a mitochondrial dna disease he was born with the inability to eat

541
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:17,280
and digest food they always die by the time they're 13 basically and um so

542
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,000
how i went from a dog getting mysteriously injured to a miracle happening in front of

543
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:31,760
everybody to now i'm being flown up to dc to some child that i had no idea what happened with me

544
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:40,880
how that happened i didn't do anything i just something up there did it long story short that

545
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:48,960
little boy um is now an american university he's about 22 years he's doing all right yeah

546
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,120
i can't help but connect several pieces of chris's story to the recent whistleblower

547
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,840
testimony of jake barber an air force veteran who claims to have assisted in the retrieval

548
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:04,160
of alien craft for the government who also describes an egg-like craft

549
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:11,280
and recalls a strong presence of a divine feminine i felt like i was possessed by the most

550
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:19,680
beautiful spirit i've ever been possessed by could this be the same entity or possibly even

551
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,600
related to past religious events like the 1917 sightings of our lady of fatima in portugal

552
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:32,720
sun started to roll like dancing from one place to another place where a lady described as brighter

553
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:38,320
than the sun appeared six times to a group of children and during the final apparition

554
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:48,320
on october 13th 1917 she was witnessed by over 70 000 people including skeptics and journalists

555
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:58,320
and it was documented as suddenly the clouds parted and the sun appeared as a spinning

556
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:05,040
multicolored disk zigzagging across the sky and seemingly plunging towards earth before returning

557
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:11,600
to its normal position the event later called the miracle of the sun was witnessed up to 40 kilometers

558
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:18,720
away this lady had also imparted the children with three secrets the last of which was kept secret by

559
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:26,240
the vatican until the year 2000 but many speculate is still incomplete sister lucia the last surviving

560
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:32,240
visionary was kept under strict vatican supervision for decades limiting what she could say publicly

561
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:38,640
and father malachy martin a former vatican insider claimed that the third secret was so terrifying

562
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:43,360
that its release would cause panic could this be why the government and the vatican have taken

563
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:48,880
such an interest into chris's story i'm gonna name an agency you just say yes or no whether

564
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,920
they contacted you whether you had contact with them is that okay something you're comfortable

might sound trivial to some of you watching or listening to this there is a very important

572
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:53,040
component to chris's story which we haven't really touched on and that is the involvement of some of

573
01:05:53,120 --> 01:06:00,320
the most important intelligence and space agencies in the world we are going to focus

574
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:06,000
on a few key people with whom chris has had a long-standing relationship one from nasa one

575
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,880
from the cia and one well the last one seems to have his hand in every pot let's start with

576
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,000
herald pavenmeyer or how he's a former nasa scientist and a prominent figure in the field

577
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,280
of astronomy and ufo research he worked at nasa during the era of verner von brown

578
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,160
contributing to the agency's advancement during the space race

579
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,360
pavenmeyer also maintained a professional relationship with j allen heinick the

580
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:37,280
astrophysicist and ufo researcher known for his involvement with project bluebook how before his

581
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:46,400
passing a few years ago had taken a great interest in chris's life he came in 2008 in the fall maybe

582
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:53,520
october september october just knocked on my door ryan and emily answered the door and uh

583
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:00,400
and he asked if i was home and of course i wasn't so they called me and i said well tell him to

584
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:08,720
stick around if he wants to wants to be an hour for before i get there i was home playing xbox

585
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:14,400
and i'm in my pajamas and you know probably playing fallout 3 or something and there's a

586
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:21,440
ring at the door and i go enter the door and it's this really tall he's like six foot four

587
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:26,320
six foot five and i was a kid so i was like whoa this this guy's intimidating right he said hey i'm

588
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:32,640
hal pavenmeyer i am a part of the press corps from nasa i drove 12 hours from cape canaveral

589
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:37,680
looking for the house of chris bledsoe is this the bledsoe residence and i'm like yes it is and

590
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:43,120
he shows me his badge it's nasa it says press corps right you know right on it so i tell my

591
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:49,120
mom you know someone from nasa's here and we get dad on the phone he's like keep him entertained

592
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,800
you know bring him in i'll be there in an hour well i was in fact very nervous at him the rumor

593
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:01,840
was back then in those days that the men in black would come get you and and that was all over the

594
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:07,600
news and the tv you know the men black movie was out then so we were afraid when he first came

595
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:15,680
and it didn't take long that everybody took a liking to him and he with us and

596
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:27,680
he was there for 11 years before he died how had a security clearance up until he died and had been

597
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:38,800
working with nasa for years 50 59 years i think and he he graduated ohio state university

598
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:46,880
when he was very young under j allen heinig and so that got him right in the back door

599
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:56,160
that's what he did he worked to debunk that was what his job was he uh he he's told me

600
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:08,720
many stories about even a couple of wrecked sites that he actually investigated and he was basically

601
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:15,600
like the guy that nasa would send if a reported case was getting serious attention from the

602
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:23,040
government it would send him and his role which he writes about in his book he would infiltrate the

603
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:28,880
family um get them to warm up to him and trust them and then he would try to covertly debunk

604
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,320
them so that's why he came and he's told us this he was open about this before he died

605
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:40,720
that he came to debunk us uh he spent days and days that he would go out and investigate

606
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:47,760
the whole surrounding area to and went to the faa and did all the

607
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:55,600
the stuff that they do and he could never debunk it and after a while he began to see it with me

608
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:02,560
so has he ever sort of tipped to you any sort of blowback that he had from nasa by being your

609
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,600
friend or by sticking around or has any of that ever come up well yeah he would he would often

610
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:15,840
ask me to keep his presence quiet right and so there were many years there that we took

611
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:24,560
the worst abuse from the neighbors from family and we couldn't tell them you know

612
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,000
that they were saying you're lying we don't believe you where i was hanging out down at

613
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
cape canaveral and had scientists at my house all the time we couldn't talk about next up

614
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,680
jim semivan now jim is a former senior officer with the cia's directorate of operations where

615
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:47,840
he spent over two decades specializing in national security and managing covert and clandestine

616
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:53,520
operations after retiring he co-founded to the stars academy alongside tom delong focusing on

617
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,680
the study of ufos and related phenomena he also befriended chris chris bloodsoe's experience

618
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:04,560
probably one of the most dramatic i mean this is just a wonderful wonderful man and i believe

619
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,560
every word he tells me and um about this and not only do i believe every word he tells me

620
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:20,560
he attracted the attention of a lot of people dia nasa cia other agencies everybody wanted to

621
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:29,120
get close to him uh but he also met um he met the entities themselves and he also met the lady

622
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:36,160
not many people meet the lady i i i will tell you that in some circles it's taken very very

623
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:42,160
seriously we've been friends a long time it was right in the middle of the drones right and they're

624
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:48,000
asking me what i was thinking about this whole thing kind of funny he's the clown with teeth

625
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:57,360
right he's that funny clown little guy he's a little guy and uh but he has teeth and we joke

626
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:03,840
about that and so he's he's very powerful and a lot of people are afraid of who he is you ended

627
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:11,520
up getting one of the most vip treatments i think any civilian will ever get uh you met a

628
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:19,440
gentleman by the name of tim taylor tim taylor otherwise known as the dragon is an enigmatic

629
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:25,040
character to say the least portrayed in diana pesolga's book american cosmic as tyler d

630
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:32,000
he was in charge of mission control at nasa has worked for elon musk as an advisor he once brought

631
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,800
diana and dr gary nolan blindfolded an hour in the desert to an alleged secret ufo crash site so

632
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,760
he takes gary nolan and i gary is a professor at stanford to be blindfolded it's a secret place

633
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,880
it's in new mexico it was a crash site from apparently the 19 some one of the ones in the

634
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:55,760
1940s he's had access to the vatican archives and claims that his biomedical patents of which there

635
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:02,160
are over 40 and have sold for hundreds of millions of dollars came to him as future

636
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:09,040
memories as he put it implanted by non-human intelligence he walks around tsa when he goes

637
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,640
to airports and he's once told the bledsoe's that the closest thing he can describe his job to

638
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:21,600
is the movie the adjustment bureau wild to say the least and he's apparently even briefed

639
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:27,280
president obama about the bledsoe's sending chris bledsoe a text with a picture of the camp

640
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:32,880
david stamp on a napkin something you can only get from the president's personal retreat tim's

641
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:41,440
an interesting guy uh to say the least you know this guy's got 40 biomedical patents he's worked

642
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:48,160
with nasa space x and all of the above he's been to the vatican archives but also not much is known

643
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:52,400
about it makes him a little bit of an elusive character you're probably familiar with diana

644
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:58,640
basolka's book as well and she mentions tyler we've come to the conclusion that that is tim

645
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:04,880
taylor what was your relationship with him at first and how did that relationship change over time

646
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:15,120
well tim um tim is a ghost right i think it was 2013 early 2013 when we met or late 2012 he knew

647
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:21,840
where i was i mean these people the intelligence world knows where i'm at all the time so somehow

648
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:28,720
he knew i was in pennsylvania in a log cabin on the delaware river and just shows up one afternoon

649
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:35,600
long story short without saying a whole lot more uh we met overnight he flew in one evening and

650
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:41,280
was gone the next day he wanted to meet and asked me if he could come to the house and meet the

651
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:49,760
family and i said yeah and three weeks later he was at my house and had a laptop and a bag on his

652
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:56,880
back full of credentials and did a gave us a briefing that on the laptop that said for the

653
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:02,960
bloodsoe family and had all the warnings and all that stuff and so that was in the days when

654
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:11,200
you couldn't talk about it was more secretive in the 20s 12s and 13s and 15s and up to about

655
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:18,320
2016 or 17 is when they first started mentioning it loosening up and i knew they were going to do

656
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:26,320
that in fact that was the plan i'd heard back then well i've heard plans of 2025 since i met

657
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:35,360
hal pavenmeyer in 2008 he told me then that they were going to have disclosure in 2025 that was

658
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:41,840
the plan i've been listening there's a whole lot that i haven't talked about such as nasa why was

659
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:49,200
i at nasa why did they get me down there how did i get in that's my crew quarters i got to meet the

660
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:57,200
general i got a special pin that only certain people have and they wanted to know from me what

661
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:04,640
in other words let's just say they're just now talking about the plasma those are the orbs that

662
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:11,520
interact with they're angelic beings because they're not just you know there's an intelligence

663
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:19,120
there's created some force created they were being harassed they're astronauts and everybody

664
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:24,320
were being harassed by these orbs and stuff and you were told that by it by ten about it way back

665
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:30,160
then when he briefed you when he showed up to your house how did he introduce himself like what

666
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:37,920
agency national reconnaissance office he had a he had a necklace with badges

667
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:50,000
credentials and they were individual air force cia nasa dod area 51 and more

668
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:58,080
he goes to camp david and meets with the president i introduced tim taylor to diana pesok and uh she

669
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:04,240
was scared of him for the first couple years until she actually met and they became friends

670
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:12,960
and then they went over to the archives and there was a ceremony in my honor that they held and

671
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,200
they put my picture in the picture of the archives when they went in the basement

672
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:23,680
they actually put a picture of me between the books of galileo and copernicus down in the

673
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:31,760
vatican basement so the whole thing was done as they were diana was working with investigate me

674
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:40,800
and so it's nasa so it was it was bigger than just getting in the door so let's go back to

675
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,920
this briefing now this briefing was a was a classified briefing i'm guessing i was told not

676
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:54,720
to share and there were stuff i was given or or shared by email and by

677
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:03,360
electronic means that i had to delete and there were things that if i tried to email it it would

678
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:12,720
flag them so you know as a fact i shared something with my wife photo i got and immediately i got a

679
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:20,320
call you know you're not sure that when he invited you to nasa what did you feel was the

680
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:26,480
sense of his importance did you notice that like people around him sort of just like open doors

681
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:33,440
for him or like how what was that like his code name is the dragon and he carries a big fat dragon

682
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:41,200
tattoo on his arm and when i went on that base he called out a temporary tattoo and put it on my arm

683
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:48,480
tattoo of a dragon and there we went about as in fact he had another guy from the n.r.o give us a

684
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:54,960
tour but he told us good not to go over the speed limit not one mile an hour because they had they

685
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:03,200
would get you and as soon as we get back after the launch was over and we go and pick him up right at

686
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:10,720
the mission control he jumps in as a driver and i'm not joking we went 80 miles an hour all over

687
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:18,160
that base and everybody would just wave him up i mean he's just in control does what he wants

688
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:26,240
he controls the launches they wanted me to tell them all i could about the nature of them and

689
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:30,800
why they were doing certain things why they were shooting rockets out of the sky

690
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,440
and i'm like do you have weapons on those things there is a famous video out there of one of these

691
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,520
ufos or objects or whatever it is taking down one of these rockets that they were shooting up

692
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:50,880
i've seen it who showed this to you tyler did following one such test launch lieutenant jacobs

693
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,840
was unexpectedly told to report to the office of major florence mansman on the screen was the

694
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:01,600
film we had shot the nose cone separate the shaft flew out in front of we saw this as obviously

695
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:08,720
reflections of light rippling like that and then we saw the dummy warhead flying along it's going

696
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:12,480
between six and eight thousand miles an hour at that point and it's on the the fringe of space

697
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:19,600
and suddenly into that that frame an object flew in chasing the chaff the warhead and so on at the

698
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:25,600
same speed and in polar orbit it fired a beam of light at the warhead the beam of light struck that

699
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,320
the object flew up shot another beam of light at the dummy warhead went around shot another

700
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,000
beam of light at it went down shot a beam of light and then flew out the same way to come in

701
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,600
at which time the dummy warhead fell out of the frame the lights came on and major mansman said

702
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:47,120
to me were you guys screwing around up there and i said no sir and he said what was that and i said

703
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:53,920
it looks like we got a ufo and he said lieutenant jacobs you are never to speak of this again it

704
01:20:53,920 --> 01:21:00,240
never happened yeah quite a few well i saw these things i don't want to talk about sure understood

705
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:10,960
one thing is in the book there is mention of meta materials yep can you tell us how that came to be

706
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:16,640
and what happened with that it's well known that these orbs and i say well known the the military

707
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:24,240
knows it right they've got video of it somehow know that these orbs will often drip like molten

708
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:30,880
metal drip looks like welders welding and you know slag falling off of them they do that

709
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:38,800
i was at a friend's house at an organized group meeting up two hours from here they invited me

710
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:50,480
there and i'm in a group of strangers and this orb shows up up over her driveway over the house

711
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:57,920
and drip this metal on the driveway so i got the metal and you have pictures of that as well right

712
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:04,640
yeah i got this metal i had the possession of it i end up with a material and i kept it for quite

713
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:10,480
a while but some friends at nasa knew i had it and they knew that i was connected to another

714
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:17,040
guy up in ohio that had some scared to tell anybody what he had but he came home one evening

715
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:22,480
he sees a light over his house and and it took off and when he pulled up the driveway there's

716
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:27,840
something glowing red in the grass and he lets it cool down he picked it up and put in a shoe box

717
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,560
in there it stayed for 15 years but he felt comfortable talking to me i'm just an average

718
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:38,240
guy right so he told me about it and i'll let some folks at nasa know about it and they wanted

719
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:45,520
to go up and so i flew we flew up there and got a piece just a little piece of it for testing

720
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:53,280
and then tom delong and lou elizando wanted some of it and they called me and i ended up letting

721
01:22:53,280 --> 01:23:03,440
them have three pieces as well it won't a year later i get a call that uh it said well uh news

722
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:10,080
to let you know you're not getting this medal back wow that it was classified by the military

723
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:16,320
you got confiscated and you just gonna have to chalk it up for one for our country as early as

724
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:21,360
two years ago i had people come in here from dc telling me if i could get another piece of it

725
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:27,920
it'd be worth a billion dollars they did send you something in return didn't they well i've got

726
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:37,200
quite a few different things in return there yeah all right it was like a pin well yeah well i can't

727
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:44,000
talk about that all right yeah you're talking about the triangle pin uh-huh yeah and there's

728
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:51,520
other thing too that i actually speak about but okay well that pin elected me into a club of

729
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:59,360
basically astronauts that have experienced the phenomena first hand not in a sleep or in a dream

730
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:06,320
or a regression it was there in the daylight or in front of me and you interact with it so you and

731
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:12,720
other astronauts have these pins yeah you're part of a small group that experienced it that's

732
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:19,840
incredible yeah what about the vatican yeah they've investigated me they've investigated you yeah

733
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,520
they're heavily involved in the uap issue aren't they hugely they have been for a long time yep

734
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:32,160
from the beginning and so is all the churches all the churches together all of them are deeply

735
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:37,520
rooted into this and they're in regular contact with our government and with me yeah a lot of

736
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:44,080
work for the government oh you always hear these generals in the pentagon they think it's demonic

737
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:50,240
they don't ever want to tell it right well right they're protecting the church right and their

738
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:56,320
belief and a lot of these churches don't want the connection that is biblical

739
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,640
there is something spiritual about this phenomenon 100 percent

740
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:15,440
you've spoken to some of the most important people in this country yeah some of the people

741
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:21,280
that the public might not even know are important we'll put it that way they have no clue and those

742
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:25,840
people know about this phenomenon yes and they know this is very real yes and they know this

743
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:31,360
is happening and this has been happening yeah so all we're seeing with this sort of disclosure

744
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:36,000
stuff that's on tv this is just like a horse and pony show right now basically little let's just

745
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,840
say i've been to harvard university and i've met with some scientists there that's the first time

746
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:48,560
i've ever revealed it on your show right now and i can't tell you any more there but i have met with

747
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:55,200
scientists i have been on their campus and there will be more to come about that so there are

748
01:25:55,200 --> 01:26:03,920
serious people around me that know it's real that want to study this and get to the bottom now due

749
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:09,360
to the overcast we weren't able to skywatch at chris's that night which really isn't the

750
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:14,160
reason i went there in the first place but ryan wanted to make it up to me and asked if i'd join

751
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:19,200
him and a few friends the next night for some sky watching on the beach and here's what happened

752
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:26,560
okay not even kidding i was looking up at the sky we were following something moving okay i don't

753
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,760
know what it was your guess is good as mine but right in front of it this camera flash this really

754
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:37,680
bright flash just popped out of nowhere stopped didn't flash since hasn't flashed that was

755
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:42,160
incredible yeah so i'm looking at you you're vlogging you're talking about stuff that you're

756
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:47,840
seeing and the video is priceless because your face is like you know your reaction

757
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:53,600
and someone behind you is like what the hell is that what is that look what is that hey

758
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,440
hey

759
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:16,320
oh my god oh my god look at that no i missed it what was that

760
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,680
and by the time i turn around you guys are already like whoa you know you're all seeing it i felt

761
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:27,520
like i saw it last and i was just frozen like my hand was in my pocket on my phone and i was

762
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,960
thinking the thought that went through my mind was like don't take your eyes off this

763
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:41,840
that was incredible there oh look something's coming back did you did you guys see that

764
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:50,640
i am absolutely blown away right now what i saw i i've sky watched with hundreds of people in my

765
01:27:50,640 --> 01:28:00,240
life and what we just saw is probably the craziest thing that i have ever seen with a crowd of people

766
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:07,360
outside of my family it was insane it was like it was like a long oblong sequence of orange lights

767
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:12,240
yeah that that was spectacular you know i'm still freaking out i spent my whole life at least more

768
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:16,160
than half of it looking at the sky that was a really big orb you know it was about this big

769
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:21,360
you know so say you look at the moon if if you're you know you're so far away from the moon but

770
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:28,320
you're looking up in the sky you hold your finger up there or a ruler it's about an inch this thing

771
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:35,360
was that big yeah at least it wasn't a dot it was like it was a long like on the horizon it looked

772
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:41,280
like like several inches this thing was huge it was one of the biggest things i've ever seen

773
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:47,680
in this space you know and you know orbs and crafts and stuff and it looked like these massive

774
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:53,840
orange balls of fire which is what my dad saw the first time and then it happens again these

775
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,840
strangers complete strangers they start walking towards us on the beach and they're like did

776
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:06,640
y'all see that they got the coast guard on the phone no we saw like a row of nine you guys saw

777
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:13,200
it you guys saw that yes yeah i didn't see that you saw it i didn't see that

778
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:18,960

779
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:26,160

780
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:34,640
in ufos man if anybody doesn't think that we're the only people in this universe yeah as big as

781
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:40,640
it is yep something wrong with yeah there you go so what's that one

782
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,760
and what's that one look at that

783
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:52,240
and what's that one look at that look at that right now did you miss that

784
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:57,120
a giant light right over the water oh really i don't know if i caught it on camera it was like

785
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:03,600
orange

786
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:22,560
you have a good night you too get home safe ryan there was another there was another one when they

787
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:30,160
were talking yeah there there look look look what is that

788
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:51,040
that is not a flare that is not a flare

789
01:30:53,520 --> 01:31:00,400
and then the girl he was with you know tells us a story about how her father in 1968 was with his

790
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:06,160
buddies drinking yeah and three same beach at the same beach and three orbs went right over their

791
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:11,200
head and he passed out and woke up with like dots behind his knees is what she said he was like

792
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:19,120
hours later he woke up yeah that's crazy so my dad grew up here on bison beach right okay he and a

793
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,280
bunch of his buddies went down to johnny mercer's one night and they're looking out over the ocean

794
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:29,280
like we are they see these three dome lights come in and they start running up towards the dunes

795
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:34,560
and they look over them there's a bright light over my dad blacks out and he wakes up and it's

796
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:40,880
like missing time and everything but he's got these two dots behind his knees like he was abducted

797
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:46,000
no coincidence he swears to god on the story might have been stabbed or something you're talking

798
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,200
you're talking to the right people there's i think there's a reason we met on this beach tonight

799
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:58,320
all of us i think there really is yeah so we just saw we saw something absolutely anomalous

800
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:04,000
that appeared a row of like nine lights yeah this giant what seemed like a craft

801
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:13,280
that went away these people showed up and lo and behold again multiple orbs start appearing

802
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:18,240
yeah again i fully did not expect to see it again we saw it the first time and it looked like the

803
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:24,240
millennium fountain and it was crazy and i was like okay so that was awesome but no way we'll

804
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:31,520
see it again and what maybe five minutes later or so 10 maybe happened again when those people

805
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,000
were here right they were here right yeah they saw it oh come on they saw it the first time that's

806
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,560
why they came over they called the coast guard and and then after there was like a fireball

807
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:45,760
yeah and it was just hanging there it stayed in the air for like five seconds yeah like a rotating

808
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,480
orange fireball and if it was like i mean because what the guy at first he's like he thought it was

809
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:56,000
like a flare like somebody needed help out there but you would see a flare go up yes absolutely

810
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:01,440
and then it would go down yeah this just stayed there they appeared in the air they appeared out

811
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:06,240
of thin air stayed there at the same vertical beautiful never seen anything i've never seen

812
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:09,280
anything like that either i'm having a hard time getting over it guys

813
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:14,320
and to boot we got an eclipse tonight so not only is it a harvest moon

814
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:21,520
and a supermoon and a supermoon but that thing up there is going to be eclipsed in about 15 minutes

815
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:32,960
beautiful if there's one message you want to get out to my audience

816
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:38,800
that are tonight on a clear sky they're going to look up what's one thing you want them to know

817
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:49,840
um this phenomenon is here for us all it's a beautiful spiritual connection

818
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:56,320
and i want to add this one thing there's a pattern to it that you'll never hear discussed

819
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:03,600
i have thousands of people that write me that never report and of the i probably have eight

820
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:10,560
thousand emails i haven't even opened this is so many people reaching out that there's one pattern

821
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:18,320
that's predominant now you never hear this on tv you never hear any experts talk about it because

822
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:30,400
these patterns lead to conclusions right and that is that 99.9 percent of all people that i meet

823
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:37,520
that tell me that they've had this experience or they started seeing things all tell me

824
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:44,640
because i'll ask them after they tell me their story all right when this happened to you where

825
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:52,800
were you at in life tell me what was going on they'll all say oh my husband died i had a near

826
01:34:52,800 --> 01:35:04,080
death experience my daughter died my son died my wife died or um tragic stuff very always suffering

827
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:12,960
and always trauma so what kind of force that can hear your thoughts and it knows your heart will

828
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:21,920
care about you enough to come here to to show itself to you and say i'm here we've been taught

829
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:29,760
that it's evil that it's got to be demonic and i'm here to tell you that's not what's happened to me

830
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:36,880
and it's still here and i have shared it with thousands of people from my book to in person

831
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:44,800
and i see nothing but the most beautiful letters of people pouring out of my heart saying

832
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:54,640
my life has changed i'm i'm i was an atheist now i believe and my whole life has been transformed

833
01:35:54,640 --> 01:36:04,240
and i see it every day so go out tonight and open your heart look up to the heavens and and um

834
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:12,080
um know it have faith that something's going to respond to you because it it does it's there

835
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:20,240
it never leaves you don't have to go into a big ritual it's all right in our thoughts

836
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:30,800
accept that it's real and open your heart and love and and caring for your friends and family

837
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:37,840
that type of energy coming from you is what calls it if you walk out there skeptic oh blah

838
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:41,920
blah you know you can take a hike you're not going to see anything that's probably why the

839
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:49,040
government has a hard time seeing it yeah that's why right folks at nasa i ask them i said why are

840
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:55,840
you here you've got all the scientists and all the equipment and space shuttles and spaceships and

841
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:00,240
cameras and satellites what do you need me why are you here scaring my family

842
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:11,040
and the guy looked at me he said um he said we see it but it has absolutely nothing to do with us

843
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,480
will not interact or respond but it does you and we'd like to study that with you

844
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,840
so if you don't tell anybody that you're interacting with us we'll let you onto some

845
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:29,120
secrets and that's what the first well that i'm still interacting with people from there

846
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:32,320
as high up as the kid and we'll leave it at that

847
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:39,200
thank you my friend thank you chris i really appreciate your time you're more than welcome

848
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:46,080
anytime thank you final thoughts

849
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:56,000
this is tough and i want to start by saying that the more that this subject gets pulled into the

850
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,840
light the more we're going to be faced with conversations that are much like these so i

851
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:09,600
want to preface this segment by saying it's important to enter these conversations in the

852
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:18,880
future from the most neutral point of view that you can spare i've said this before but this

853
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:26,000
is a subject that is incredibly polarizing it's very nature puts into question most people's

854
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:32,560
core belief and so i think it's incredibly important that we remain respectful throughout

855
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:38,000
this discourse that we end up having whether through the anonymity of our online profiles

856
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,760
or better yet in person belief is an incredibly personal journey

857
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:55,040
it doesn't come from scripture and it certainly also doesn't come from a redacted file being

858
01:38:55,280 --> 01:39:03,520
slid across the table belief comes from within your own personal experience here on earth

859
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:12,160
it is ever evolving ever changing i believe chris bledsoe had an experience that was witnessed by

860
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:18,640
three other people i believe his son also had an experience that has obviously left him

861
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:24,560
you know traumatized to a certain extent i know for a fact that he is in contact and has been

862
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:29,920
visited by very important people within the government on a personal note i do think that

863
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:36,800
some of the things he's filmed in the past have probably a prosaic explanation for i can't be

864
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:43,840
certain of that but i know that there are thousands of satellites above our heads and i know that

865
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:50,160
and i know that every year about a thousand pieces of space debris burns up in our atmosphere

866
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:56,240
and that includes old rockets and satellite parts there's a lot of activity in our skies

867
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:02,800
that much i know i'm not an expert so i can't tell you what the difference between space debris

868
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:08,000
and an orb is and i also can't tell you to believe someone when they say it is an orb

869
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:15,520
or it is an angel or it is space junk i think that is up to you to do your own research

870
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:22,480
and find out now whether that's getting some state-of-the-art equipment and a radar

871
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:29,120
and a camera and a telescope figuring out what that is or whether that's just going outside

872
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:36,320
and sending your love out into the sky to see if you can sort of summon one of these celestial

873
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:43,120
bodies that's up to you i think it's healthier if we continue this conversation forever because

874
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:48,080
i do think the unhealthiest thing that anyone could do is stop being curious and stop searching

875
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:54,000
use the information that chris and ryan gave you in this documentary and let that help nourish

876
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:00,640
some type of newborn curiosity or let it empower your skepticism and go get some equipment and

877
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:08,960
try filming it for yourself but i think one thing we can all agree on is chris's message of love

878
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:12,400
i think that's something we can all get behind and that's an important message

879
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:18,480
that we should all be sharing we've got enough people worrying about the militarization of this

880
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:26,800
topic i think it's healthy that we counterbalance that with some empathy thank you for watching this

881
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:34,480
