1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
15 years ago I was in Albuquerque and we weren't on a road and we experienced something that night.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We rolled on the windows and we look out and we just see like this, I mean, UFO.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sort of coming towards us and then it changed direction and then it changed again the direction and it skipped.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It disappeared.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Because this is also something mentioned by Bob Lazar.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And you had an opportunity to meet Bob. Did you bring this up to him?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I did.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Fast forward a few years and I'm in Washington so I'm like, you know what, I'm going to ask a big question.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I told the lady in front of me and as I'm talking to her, the entire table stopped talking.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
All the attention turned on me.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You know, I just want to ask you, is there something out there?

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And she told me, you're not crazy, there is something out there.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I was like, boom, like, oh my God.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
During COVID, after I retired, I decided to go on a journey.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I decided to do ayahuasca.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
When it started, I start leaving my body, I start levitating and I'm not leaving my body going up like this.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm leaving it going up like this, looking down.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're seeing yourself?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, I even see my friend.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He was texting someone.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I told him, I said, you were texting this person.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He said, how did you know?

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I went over your shoulder and I saw it.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And I'm not alone.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There's something that sort of lifts me up.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And can I use, I'm going to draw it to you.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No eyes, no mouth.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And it was communicating with me, you know, who are you?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And it says, I'm you and everybody at the same time.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And the air you breathe and the water you drink.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I know why you're here.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're curious to know about what is consciousness.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And I'm going to show it to you.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And then I see the map, the planet, the solar system.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's like I'm going out.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like I zoom out, you know, from where I was.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I see the entire, the galaxies, the universe, the different universe, the different dimension.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The point that at one point I'm like, it's too much.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I can't take it anymore.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
1994, I was probably about six years old.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And I remember my big sister running outside from inside our house.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I follow her out into the street.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We get out into the street.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The neighbors are out looking up at the sky.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Four or five houses down.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There's a spinning disc with spinning lights all around it.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And a spotlight coming down from the center.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It must have been like, I don't know, 40 feet above this house.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That was like five houses down from us.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't remember anybody talking about it afterwards.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The memory just ends right there.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Today we are joined by an amazing guest, Georges St. Pierre.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Georges, thank you so much for doing this.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is unexpected, I think, to a lot of the viewers.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They're like, what is Georges St. Pierre doing on this podcast?

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm happy to be here.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Thank you for having me a few weeks ago with Lou Elizondo.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm really happy that you allowed me to come here and have a conversation with him.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, it was incredible.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Obviously the things that are spoken about off-camera often,

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
we get into some deeper stuff.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
More things that are speculative.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You can't really say it on camera because it's not sure.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But those are the fun conversations.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, it's a lot of stuff sometimes that when you talk about it,

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
a lot of people will roll their eyes back and it will touch your credibility.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But I'm passionate about UAPs and it's a subject that I'm very interested in.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
When I found out that Lou Elizondo came here, I was like,

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
man, he's one of the guys that I always wanted to meet.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
To have the opportunity to do it, to have a conversation with this guy, it was amazing.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
When that happened, just the weekend before, I was in Washington.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's right.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I had an opportunity to meet with some high-ranked military in the United States

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
because it was during the inauguration weekend.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I was not there really for the inauguration.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was there because with some other guy of the UFC, John Jones was there, Bo Nicole.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Connor.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, exactly.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
A lot of guys were there.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A lot of the professional athletes were there.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I had an opportunity to go and I took it because I had the chance to meet different people.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It was a great opportunity.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I would have been a fool to not take it.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I would have taken it.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think most people take that opportunity.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Of course.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I mean, it's a chance of a lifetime, an opportunity of a lifetime.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So I met a lot of people.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But of all the celebrities that I've met that weekend, I met Zuckerberg.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I met a lot of celebrities.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But for me, the thrill of my weekend, it was to be able to sit down with some of the high-ranked military,

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
some of the guys that, you know, when you want to talk about UAP's secret program and stuff like that,

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
these are the guys that knows the answers and had amazing conversation.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And still to this day, you know, a lot of these guys I'm friends with.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We text each other and I made some great friends there.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And it was just an amazing weekend.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wow.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So wait, are you okay saying how did you get into that?

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like what happened there during those interactions?

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because, you know, it's weird to go out to someone and be like, so what about the UFOs?

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How did that conversation start?

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, so the way it started is the first dinner, it was a Friday night.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The first day that I arrived in Washington, I had a dinner at night.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And I get introduced to these guys with Tim Kennedy.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Tim Kennedy, Tim Kennedy is a former USC fighter.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Green Beret.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Green Beret.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And he's the guy that on the field, you know, like he's like a cowboy, you know,

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
he's the one who do the dirty job on the field.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And he introduced me to a lot of these guys and to Sarah Averrano.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I get introduced to a lot of the people in different branch of the military there.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And we had dinner and a lot of the military people are big fans of mixed martial arts.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So they knew who I was.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I mean, to be fair, a lot of people know who you are, not just in the military.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But that's one of the reasons why I was able to get in touch with these people.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So the first dinner that we had, it was like about maybe 12, 15 people around the table.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And, you know, we didn't know each other.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You know, some of these guys, I mean, actually, except from Tim that I know for a few years,

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
all the other people around the table I had never met before.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And we all introduce each other, you know, like, and I didn't realize with who I was sitting until

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
at one point during the dinner, I was thinking, I was like, you know what, if I want to ask the question,

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
that's the time to do it, because I might never ever had another opportunity in my life to ask this question.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Maybe I'm going to look like a fool.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And they all going to make fun of me thinking, oh, I'm brain damaged or whatever.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Or maybe they're going to tell me what they are allowed to tell me.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So everybody was talking to the people next to them because it was a big table.

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
At one point, I was like, you know what, I had a conversation with different people.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But I talked to one of the person that was in front of me.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I asked her, she was a lady, and I asked her, I said, I always wanted to ask you this question.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I, you know, one day I told her one of the adventure that I had that one day and I was in a few years ago

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
before my fight with Matt Serra.

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's about 15 years ago, I was in Albuquerque and I was in a car and I was with Mike Van Arsdel,

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,000
who's a former UFC fighter, Rashad Evans, Ali Abdelaziz, who's a Khabib and Islam Makachev manager.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He was a training partner of mine and another guy named Alejandro.

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He's a Mexican, but I can't remember.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't know what he became. I lost contact with him.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And Ali, Alejandro and I were in the backseat.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Mike Van Arsdel was driving, Rashad Evans was on the passenger seat.

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And we weren't on the road and we saw something.

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We experienced something that night that all five of us, like, it's undeniable.

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Like something, we saw something like, and...

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What did you see? Was it like lights in the sky or was it...

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah, it was a light sort of coming towards us.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And when it happened, I had an impression and I don't have the...

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's not a certainty, but I was under the impression that sort of the time sort of stopped.

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Not the car, but the car kept rolling.

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But like, you know, when you get so intensely...

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Like you're mesmerized.

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah, yeah, like all of us were like...

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We only had focus on that thing.

152
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So it came towards us and then it changed direction.

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And then it changed again the direction and it skipped.

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It disappeared.

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And for that brief moment, it's sort of like...

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Everything else around us didn't matter.

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It was only this.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We were like...

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
All of us, like silence and we saw this thing.

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And after that, when it skipped and it disappeared, all of us were like,

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh my God, what is this?

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And the crazy thing about it is the way I saw it and the way my friend saw it,

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
it was different because there is no point of reference.

164
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I saw something that there was no wings.

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Like it was no noise, but we're inside of a car.

166
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But I remember seeing an interview of I think it was Rashad or Ali Abdelaziz

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
talking about that thing.

168
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Around 2010, I'm in Elk Creek, New Mexico.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And I'm with GSP, Ali Abdelaziz, who's now like the manager of mostly a lot of UFC fighters.

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And we're right on the highway.

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The traffic is starting to slow down.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And it like slows down to like almost a crawl.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And we're like, why is everybody stopping?

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Why is everybody stopping?

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And then we start to look and see where everybody's looking.

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And then we roll down the windows and we look out and we just see like this,

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I mean, UFO because of the way it was moving.

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It just didn't seem...

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I mean, it was that typical UFO movement where it was like moving

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and then it like would stop and like define gravity for a bit.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It just stayed there for a second.

182
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And, you know, the light pattern was weird as well, too.

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And as everybody's sitting there watching it, it then just like shot off.

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And the time that it lasts and it didn't correspond to exactly what I saw.

185
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I was thinking if I talk about it perfectly, I'm going to look like a liar

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
because they don't describe the same thing.

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
They all have their different description of what they've seen.

188
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't remember.

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think it was one of them said it was like almost a minute.

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And for me, it was only maybe 10, 15 seconds, if I remember.

191
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So we all have a different experience from that moment.

192
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So fast forward a few years.

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm in Washington.

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So I'm like, you know what?

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going to ask a big question.

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So I told the lady in front of me, and as I'm talking to her,

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the entire table stopped talking.

198
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
All the attention turned on me.

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So I told her what I saw.

200
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And I ask her, I say, you know, I just want to ask you, am I crazy?

201
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Or did we all collectively became crazy for a few seconds

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and saw something like an illusion?

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Or is there something out there that are not us?

204
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And she told me, you're not crazy.

205
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There is something out there.

206
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I was like, boom!

207
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Like, oh my God.

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And these are the people that knows.

209
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Because that's what they do.

210
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If someone would know, it's those guys.

211
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What was the atmosphere after that?

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Man, I'm not going to lie.

213
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Since that weekend, I mean, now I sleep good.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But the next few days after that weekend, it got me thinking so much

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I had a hard time sleeping at night.

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Because these are the sort of questions that keep me up at night.

217
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And I talked to a lot of these guys.

218
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I asked them a lot of questions.

219
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And man, this is insane.

220
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It is so crazy that I would be very reluctant publicly.

221
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And it's not me.

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
A lot of them, what they told me and a lot of stuff that I've read

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
are like seen as conspiracy theory.

224
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But what they told me fit what I've read.

225
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And I'm like, that can't be true.

226
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But I would be very reluctant to go publicly

227
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and talk about what I've read and what they told me.

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Because it will attack my credibility.

229
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
People will roll their eyes.

230
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Like, GSP just lost his mind.

231
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He's brain damaged.

232
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is no way.

233
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But I mean, it's just crazy.

234
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And I know you dive deep into this stuff.

235
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So you can understand a little bit.

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This is pretty insane.

237
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It is.

238
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And it's one of those things that when you say it out loud,

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
you're like, God, that sounds just absolutely made up.

240
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It sounds like science fiction.

241
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But the truth I've found in my research

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
is often much stranger than fiction.

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And that's something that the more I look into it,

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
the more that's becoming true.

245
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And one of the things is, first of all,

246
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
the fact that you're even just talking about this

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and being open about it, I think is really healthy.

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Like, maybe 10 years ago, this would have been considered

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
a really touchy podcast to do.

250
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But I think in today's landscape,

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
isn't that surprising to a lot of people.

252
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
They're kind of like, well, it's good.

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's good that more people are understanding.

254
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Because I do believe that in 10 years' time,

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
maybe even less, that if you don't believe

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
that there's something going on,

257
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
you're the conspiracy theorist.

258
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I think that more people are kind of coming around

259
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to this idea that, OK, all right, we're being visited,

260
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
or they're already here or something.

261
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

262
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And another thing that I think I consider

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
this very important is, you know,

264
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
because of what's going on in the world,

265
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
there's a lot of wars, there's a lot.

266
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And I feel that if we found out that we're not alone,

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
it will kind of unite us.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We will stop fighting over some stupid differences.

269
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You know what I mean?

270
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We'll get together better.

271
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And there's a lot of things that could change

272
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the entire world, the energy thing.

273
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You know, like if this thing is true,

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
this technology is true,

275
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
this can be used for the benefits of mankind.

276
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You know what I mean?

277
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And, man, it can change the world.

278
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And for me, I think it would be important to have

279
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
maybe not a full disclosure on this thing,

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
but at least more disclosure on the matter,

281
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
because it will be beneficial to the world.

282
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah, great point.

283
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You know, something you just said there, too,

284
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
is not full disclosure, and I agree with that.

285
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I think most people who are familiar enough with the topic

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
also agree with that, that there needs to be...

287
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We just need to get it out of the way that this is real.

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Like, just that.

289
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's just get past that barrier right now,

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
because we're so slowly approaching it,

291
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and what's happening is that more things are coming out

292
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
faster than we're able to disclose it, right?

293
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And so there needs to be like...

294
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We need to just bridge that gap and say,

295
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
hey, these things are real.

296
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This is happening. We are being visited.

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We're not alone. Start there.

298
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You know, Chris, most people,

299
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
like if you talk to most people,

300
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
are not even aware that, you know, you say UAPs,

301
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
there's things that flies, and not only flies,

302
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that goes under the water,

303
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
that are picked up by a very sensitive military instrument,

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and they don't know what it is.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I mean, it's been disclosed.

306
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's been declassified since, I think, 2017.

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It was in an article in the New York Post,

308
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
but most people are not aware of that.

309
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Most people still think it's not true.

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Like, I mean, you can research it. It's true.

311
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's been out...

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The cat is out of the box, so to speak.

313
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But most people are not aware of it.

314
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And I don't understand why the media don't talk more about it.

315
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I mean, it's one of the...

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I mean, are we alone? Are we...

317
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Like, even if we don't have the evidence

318
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
to really know if we're alone or not,

319
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
but this is very important.

320
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I mean, you have a certain object

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
that flies over a sensitive military installation

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and are picked up by an instrument.

323
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I mean, man, it's something to talk about,

324
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and nobody talks about it.

325
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm like, you have to dig in to find out about it.

326
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah, that's true.

327
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's crazy to me. It's important.

328
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Very important. It's arguably...

329
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The implication of it. It's huge.

330
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, the most important thing.

331
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And this is interesting because it also ties into

332
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
a lot of the other stuff that you're interested in

333
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and ancient civilizations,

334
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
this sort of idea of maybe

335
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
this cyclical civilization thing happening, perhaps,

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
or our lost technology that we might have had,

337
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
because you've been traveling the world recently

338
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
doing side quests, which is pretty cool.

339
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You did your homework. You know.

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You did the main quest,

341
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
greatest pound-for-pound fighter, UFC champion.

342
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You've done all these amazing things.

343
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I think it's kind of cool to see what you're doing now

344
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
because you're like, man, I did all this stuff.

345
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Now what? What next?

346
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And now you're looking deeper.

347
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Now you're like, well, what's the meaning?

348
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Where do we come from? What's happening?

349
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And you're going to places like Baalbek, Egypt,

350
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and all these amazing places.

351
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So what kind of fuels that quest?

352
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Knowledge.

353
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And I know that a lot of these archeological sites,

354
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
it's still an enigma.

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They have a rough idea of when it was built

356
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and how it was built,

357
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
but there's a lot of mystery surrounding it.

358
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And if someone says that they know everything,

359
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
that's not true.

360
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And the weekend I had in Washington, too,

361
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
one thing they confirmed to me is that,

362
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and I knew that before, but they just told me that

363
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
is that a lot of the ancient texts,

364
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
a lot of the religious texts that we read

365
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and a lot of the ancient texts that talks about

366
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
angelic beings flying chariot and stuff like that

367
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
are probably account of...

368
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
UAPs, UFOs.

369
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
UAPs and things that they...

370
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But they didn't say flying saucer or a spaceship

371
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
because it was outside of their vocabulary.

372
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It was outside of their frame of reference.

373
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So the way they describe it,

374
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
it was the way they use word that they knew to describe it.

375
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, chariots of fire, shields, drums.

376
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
A lot of people said drums.

377
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Angelic beings and things like that.

378
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There was one actually that said earthenware

379
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
was the...

380
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And earthenware is literally a plate.

381
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So when you think of saucer,

382
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
their word was earthenware.

383
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So like flying earthenware, you're like,

384
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
well, that's a flying saucer.

385
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And Jacques Vallee, are you familiar with Jacques Vallee?

386
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah, absolutely.

387
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, he's just like the goat when it comes to

388
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
looking at that ancient stuff

389
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
because he looks in weird, obscure references

390
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
like fairies and goblins or whatever it is.

391
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And he'll find stories where there's missing time,

392
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
where people have been taken, transported,

393
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and they're describing, like you said,

394
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
a lot of the same things,

395
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
but they just didn't have the vocabulary.

396
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Exactly.

397
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's fascinating to me

398
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
because a lot of it is subject to interpretation.

399
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So it's hard to differentiate what is it.

400
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You know what I mean?

401
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
In a lot of religious texts, for example,

402
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
it's subject to interpretation.

403
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And that's one of the reasons why there is,

404
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
for example, in Christianity,

405
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
there are the Catholic, the Protestant, the Adventist,

406
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
because they have a different interpretation of what it is.

407
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And you can make a case for a lot of these ancient texts

408
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
to be an account of something.

409
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Close encounter.

410
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

411
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That could be an interpretation as well.

412
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I think so.

413
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And I think that's a valid thing

414
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and that we're discovering that more and more.

415
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You know, you have like, what was it,

416
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Charities of the Gods or whatever.

417
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And Diana Pasolka as well puts out a lot of work.

418
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
She's a theologian or studies theology

419
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and has found that UFO is kind of like the new religion

420
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
where we're following the same symptoms

421
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
as a new religious coming.

422
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Like when Christianity was coming to be,

423
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
it was very rebellious.

424
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The Romans were pushing against it.

425
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You would get killed for following the word of Christ

426
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
until the revolution was so big that it became the thing.

427
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And that revolution, when that happened,

428
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
there was a lot of sightings.

429
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
There was a lot of angels coming down with messages,

430
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
prophetic images, all of these things.

431
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And if you look at now, that's kind of happening as well.

432
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We have some characters out there

433
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
that are also getting these images

434
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
or that are getting these sightings on command.

435
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And so yeah, if you were to take these texts

436
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and bring them back 2,000 years,

437
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
they would almost be identical.

438
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And so yeah, it does leave you questioning,

439
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
is UFO and ufology and is this the new religion?

440
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Are aliens the new angels,

441
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
not just are aliens the old angels?

442
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Are we going to worship aliens?

443
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That's right, because before they used to believe

444
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
in spirit of the forest, whatever it is.

445
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Now they became maybe religion, now it was gods,

446
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and now not everyone,

447
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
but a lot of people don't believe so much in religion anymore.

448
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So if they try to make sense of it,

449
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
they will say it's maybe coming from another planet.

450
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
We don't know what is the truth.

451
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's crazy, but there's certainly something going on.

452
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
There's certainly a phenomenon that it's hard to explain.

453
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yeah, and for anyone who hasn't had a sighting,

454
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I've had some multiple sightings in my life

455
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
that I can't explain.

456
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I can't tell you for sure if they were UFOs or extraterrestrials,

457
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
but I can tell you for me at the time,

458
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
it felt like it was, so that feeling I know,

459
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I understand that feeling,

460
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
and when you experience something,

461
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
it kind of shakes your foundation.

462
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That's the starting point where you're like,

463
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
okay, hold on, you didn't see what I saw,

464
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
you didn't feel what I felt, and that's very personal.

465
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
From what I saw, I'm easy to be discredited

466
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
because I'm not an astrophysicist,

467
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and a lot of people will say,

468
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
oh yeah, you don't have the knowledge, the credibility,

469
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
the competency to say that what you saw

470
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
was an unidentified flying object

471
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
because maybe it was Venus, or I don't know,

472
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
a swam guest, or an asteroid that bounced back,

473
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
or a satellite that followed.

474
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I mean, I've seen something that changed direction,

475
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and if it's Venus or something that could be explained,

476
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I will be very, very, very, very surprised,

477
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and the fact that all of us saw it in a different way

478
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
was like, man, I don't know what to make of it.

479
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Have you ever spoken to any of them afterwards about it?

480
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh yeah, absolutely, all the time.

481
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
We've talked about it, and a lot of them,

482
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm sure they're like me,

483
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
they're a little bit shy to talk about it,

484
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
but I think it's important.

485
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I think it could attack our credibility a little bit,

486
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
but it is important because I'm sure there's a lot of people

487
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
that have seen stuff that are shy to talk about it

488
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
because they're going to be seen as crazy,

489
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
especially when you spend a lot of your life

490
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
in a full-contact sport.

491
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
A lot of people will say, oh, he's brain damaged,

492
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
but how do you explain that the five of us see something?

493
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I mean, collectively, it's kind of crazy.

494
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah, absolutely,

495
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and I don't think that that's the case so much anymore.

496
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I think maybe, again, like 10 years ago, prior to 2017,

497
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I think that that might have been the case where it's like,

498
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
oh, who are these guys? They're just crazy.

499
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
They're conspiracy theorists,

500
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
but I think now we're in a really new landscape

501
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
where talking about it isn't so...

502
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Sure, there are some people,

503
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
but I really do think that most of the people that matter

504
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
in this subject and who are trying to push this forward,

505
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I mean, we're all in agreement here that something's going on,

506
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and what you described, too,

507
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
which is really interesting, the skipping part.

508
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I want to talk about that for a second

509
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
because this is also something mentioned by Bob Lazar,

510
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and you had an opportunity to meet Bob.

511
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah.

512
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Did you bring this up to him?

513
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I did.

514
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I met Bob, and for people who are not aware,

515
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Bob claims that he worked on a secret project in Area 51

516
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
in a place called S4, in a secret base,

517
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
and he worked on trying to back engineer an object

518
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
that is not from this world.

519
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That's his claim, and I've talked to him.

520
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I don't have any certainty,

521
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
but I believe that he believes that he tells me the truth.

522
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's what I believe.

523
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Same as Louis Lisando.

524
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You know, I'm not perfect.

525
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I've been fooled before, but when I talk to them,

526
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I trust them that what they're saying to me

527
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
is what they believe to be true.

528
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You got a good read.

529
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yes, and Bob was explaining to me then,

530
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and he used to describe these flying disks a long time ago,

531
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
like more than maybe almost 40 years.

532
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's been like when he came out.

533
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
30, 35.

534
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Almost 40 years.

535
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And the way he used to describe them, if I may,

536
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
let's say it's a disk, he was describing them

537
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
when they fly locally, they go like this,

538
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
but when they have to whatever, return from where they're from,

539
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
they point their belly, and the reason why they skip

540
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
is because of the distortion and space and time.

541
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So that's from our perspective.

542
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We've seen the object skipping,

543
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
but from maybe perhaps their perspective inside,

544
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
they don't skip, maybe they go.

545
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So I don't know because I never experienced it

546
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
being inside these things, but that's how he explained it.

547
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And I found it fascinating.

548
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Then when I talked to him, he explained that to me,

549
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and it made more sense.

550
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And I've always been very curious about also consciousness.

551
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
What is consciousness?

552
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Because we cannot even define what is consciousness.

553
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Religious people will say, oh, it's your soul.

554
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Scientists who are atheists will say,

555
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
oh, it's the chemistry of your brain, you know,

556
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and the argument that will be like,

557
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
oh, you say you're a good or a bad person,

558
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
but let's say you get in a car crash, boom,

559
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and you wake up from a coma,

560
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
maybe you won't be the same person anymore.

561
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So that's their argument.

562
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
They say, oh, that because your brain,

563
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
the chemistry of your brain is affected,

564
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
so we're, you know, in a way we're all, there's no soul.

565
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's only matter. It's only material.

566
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And that's one of the questions that keeps me up at night.

567
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Are we, you know, do we have sort of a soul

568
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
or are we only material?

569
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Are we more than our physical body?

570
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And one guy that made me change my mind on it is,

571
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
a friend of mine is Lex Friedman.

572
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
He had a podcast.

573
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And he works in AI, robotic.

574
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And one day I asked him, I said,

575
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
because I used to believe about determinism.

576
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I thought that there's no,

577
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I used to think that there's no such thing as free will,

578
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
that everything is, you know, come from a cause, the causality.

579
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
We have the illusion of free will,

580
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
but everything is predetermined.

581
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And by definition, if there's a cause,

582
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
there's no free will because a free will is something

583
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
you do spontaneously without cause.

584
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So I asked Lex, because if someone knows it's him,

585
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
he works with robot.

586
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And, you know, I asked him, I say,

587
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
do you believe in free will or determinism?

588
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And he said something to me that changed my way of thinking

589
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
because he's so smart and educated.

590
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You know, when you talk to guys like him or, you know,

591
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
even Elon Musk, I had a chance to talk to him.

592
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I was like, these guys, they make me think for freaking months

593
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and years after I've talked to them.

594
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I have to process what they tell me.

595
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And he says, George, we don't even know what is consciousness.

596
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Therefore, we cannot know if there's free will

597
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
or determinism or both.

598
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We don't know.

599
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So even him, he doesn't, you know, he doesn't know.

600
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That's the right answer.

601
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That's the right answer.

602
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You know what I mean?

603
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
When you don't know until you don't know,

604
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
you have to remain like this.

605
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So I've always been fascinated about that.

606
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And that's why during COVID, after I retired,

607
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I decided to go on a journey.

608
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I decided to do ayahuasca.

609
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And I never talked about it because as an athlete,

610
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I was always anti-drugs.

611
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Because for me, in martial arts, one of the values is respect.

612
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And, you know, if you're respectful, you're going to fight fear.

613
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You're not going to use performance-enhancing drugs.

614
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So I never wanted to use drugs.

615
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I waited after I retired to do that experience,

616
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
but I always wanted to do it because I'm very curious about consciousness.

617
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You know, we all have dreams sometimes that we can remember,

618
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
but what does it mean?

619
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Because we're sleeping and we have dreams that seem so real.

620
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So what it is?

621
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Like, is it only imagination, material from our brain,

622
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
like circuitry, or there's really something?

623
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So I decided to do an adventure, ayahuasca.

624
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Ayahuasca is psychedelic, very strong psychedelic.

625
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Extremely strong, yeah.

626
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And I never take drugs.

627
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I never snore cocaine or did anything else.

628
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I've tried marijuana before, but it's not really my thing.

629
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It makes me paranoid.

630
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I've drank, but I never did that.

631
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So I start from zero to a hundred kilometers per hour.

632
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And I got in touch with this guy because for a reason,

633
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm not allowed to say who it is and where it is.

634
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But so one night I decided to do that.

635
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And because of my name, I don't want to be, you know,

636
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
when I did it, I was kind of scared.

637
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I decided to bring a friend of mine who was my bodyguard.

638
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
His name is Eddie.

639
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
He's a friend of mine.

640
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And I decided to bring him with me alone just in case something happened

641
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
because people will laugh at it, but I'm afraid I've never done drugs before.

642
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I told him if something happened, bring me to the hospital right away.

643
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Best thing to do probably.

644
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah.

645
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So I was alone when I did it.

646
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I was with him and the shaman and one of his apprentice.

647
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And I had a friend with me that I've done ayahuasca before that did it with me.

648
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That's it.

649
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Because normally when you do that, you have a room with maybe six, eight people.

650
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But I didn't want to do because I wanted to be private.

651
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So when I first started, I took it to a cup and it's made of,

652
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I think it's made of a leaf and it's a mixture of natural ingredients

653
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
that come from the Amazon and it had been boiled.

654
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So you take it and what I did is I took it and I lay down on a mat

655
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and I'm in the basement of a house.

656
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And I didn't do it in South America.

657
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I did it here.

658
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So when it started after a few minutes, I start leaving my body.

659
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I start levitating and going towards the ceiling.

660
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And when that happened, I felt like I sort of lost control.

661
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So I kind of resisted and I came back into myself.

662
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And for the next maybe 20, 30 minutes, nothing happened.

663
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And then I started thinking, I was like, shit, I might have ruined my entire adventure.

664
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And it made me sad a little bit.

665
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Then the shaman came to see me.

666
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
He's like, are you okay, George?

667
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I explained to him like, yeah, I resisted.

668
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I left my body, but I kind of resisted because I didn't like the sensation of losing control.

669
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And he looked at me, he's like, George, you have to let yourself go.

670
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And for me, it's hard.

671
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's something I've never done.

672
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I always like to be in control because my background in mixed martial art,

673
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
you have to be in control and control all the data in order to maximize your chance of winning in a fight.

674
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But now I have to let go, to rely on something that I've never done and let it go.

675
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So he says to me, he's like, let it go.

676
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm like, okay, can I take some more?

677
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
He's like, you can take more as long as you feel good.

678
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And I see that you're good.

679
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm like, all right.

680
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So I take another cup and I lay down again.

681
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And then I left the...

682
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm not leaving my body going up like this.

683
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm leaving it going up like this, looking down.

684
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You're seeing yourself?

685
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah.

686
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm seeing myself, but I'm seeing myself and I'm still aware.

687
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm still aware that I'm in the bed.

688
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's like I'm in two places in the same time and I'm not alone.

689
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
There's something that sort of lift me up.

690
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And can I use...

691
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm going to draw it to you so you can...

692
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So this thing that I see appears to me under this shape.

693
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's called a keyhole shape, they call it.

694
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Whoa.

695
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
No eyes, no mouth, like this shape.

696
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
What color?

697
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Was it black?

698
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Was it see-through?

699
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It was no color.

700
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It was just translucent.

701
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's not like I could see it with my eyes.

702
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I was seeing it inside my head.

703
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Right, you were perceiving it.

704
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And it was communicating with me.

705
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Not like I'm talking to...

706
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Hi, how are you?

707
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Like in my head.

708
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Like a airdrop.

709
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And everything it was thinking I was receiving

710
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and everything I was...

711
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
He was thinking I was receiving.

712
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So he was like a connection, you know?

713
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And as I'm going up, I see myself.

714
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I even see my friend.

715
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
He was texting someone.

716
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And I told him, I'm like, I know you were...

717
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
After the adventure, I told him, I said, you were texting this person.

718
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
He said, how did you know?

719
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I went over your shoulder and I saw it.

720
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And I'm lifting, I'm lifting, I'm lifting.

721
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And I go through the ceiling, I see the house and I'm like...

722
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And to the opposite of what happened a few minutes before,

723
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
the first time when I didn't want to lose control,

724
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
now I feel very confident because this thing is carrying me

725
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and I feel like the best feeling in the world.

726
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Safe.

727
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Safe, love, successful, confident.

728
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Like I feel like I'm in the up top emotionally.

729
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Like I feel like I'm like the best feeling in the world.

730
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Not physically high, but mentally, man, feel like in perfect harmony.

731
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And as I'm going up, I'm like, who are you?

732
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You know, who are you?

733
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And it says, I'm you and everybody at the same time.

734
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm the air you breathe and the water you drink.

735
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And it didn't say it through my mind.

736
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And as I'm going up, I see the town where I am.

737
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I see the planet.

738
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Then it made me understand that it says to me like,

739
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I know why you're here.

740
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You're curious to know about what is consciousness.

741
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And I'm going to show it to you.

742
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm going to show you what is consciousness.

743
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And then I see the map, the planet, the solar system.

744
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It's like I'm going out.

745
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Like I zoom out from where I was.

746
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And I see the entire thing.

747
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I see the galaxies, the universe, the different universe, the different dimension.

748
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
To the point that at one point I'm like, I can't explain it.

749
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It's too much.

750
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Okay, it's too much.

751
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I can't take it anymore.

752
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's like, please, I don't want to know more.

753
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I just can't take it.

754
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And it was very weird.

755
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm the one who sort of tell him.

756
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And the whole time this thing is with me, sort of guiding me.

757
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And I'm like, because I'm in a great, I'm in a feeling of harmony.

758
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And I'm telling it, I'm like, is it only for this adventure?

759
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Will you leave me after this?

760
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Or he's like, no, I'm going to be always with you.

761
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And when things doesn't go well, close your eyes and remember me.

762
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I was always going to be there even after this adventure ends.

763
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm always there with you.

764
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I'm like, okay.

765
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And then it sort of says to me, it's like, now that you know what you came for,

766
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I would like to share something with you.

767
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
There is a lot of time that you do things that you don't realize that you hurt people.

768
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And I'm like, okay.

769
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And it's like, I'm going to show you things.

770
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But after you've seen it, it's up to you to make the effort to change.

771
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Because I cannot make the effort for you.

772
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You have to make the effort if you want to change and become better.

773
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm like, okay.

774
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And then it start going into some of my past.

775
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Your memories.

776
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
On my memory.

777
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But not like memory, like I was reliving certain memory that I push so deep inside of me,

778
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
like I didn't want to remember.

779
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And stuff from my childhood, stuff that are so personal that even I cannot talk about.

780
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:06,000
But stuff also that I've done, certain things that I've done to people,

781
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
like stuff that have been done to me, but also stuff that I've said, I've done,

782
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
that I didn't realize at the time how much I hurt certain people.

783
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And I didn't mean to hurt them, but it made me,

784
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:31,000
this thing made me sort of go through the perspective of the person that I was hurting

785
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
and live the emotion of that person live when I did that.

786
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And I lived it and now I understand.

787
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And I, shit, I really hurt that person when I did this.

788
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And like a mirror, like if I would have done it to myself.

789
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And I felt the emotion running through.

790
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And now I realize, I'm like, shit, I feel bad.

791
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I've done this and I didn't even realize that I hurt.

792
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I hurt that person.

793
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And you're so caught up with what you do.

794
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You only focus on, for me when I was young, the most important thing was

795
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
to be the strongest man in the world.

796
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And all my focus was on that.

797
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Everything I did was about to be champion.

798
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And that's what it was.

799
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
The other thing around, I was seeing it not only as a distraction,

800
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
because I had great, great times.

801
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
A lot of the people I've met, I really genuinely love those certain people

802
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
and I love them.

803
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But because my focus was not on prioritizing them

804
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and more prioritizing my goal, I hurt them in the process.

805
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And I didn't not realize that.

806
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And this adventure made me realize that.

807
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And man, it was crazy.

808
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And a lot of things, that's just one example, but a lot of things like this,

809
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I relive through my mind.

810
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It made me realize that sometimes I've said stuff in other situations

811
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
to other people and I hurt them.

812
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It made me very sensitive about stuff that I've done.

813
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And I was like, shit, I really did that.

814
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I didn't realize at that time how much I hurt certain people.

815
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And now I do.

816
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And even after my adventure was done,

817
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I call certain people and I apologize to them.

818
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I say, sorry, I know I did this, I did that.

819
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Hey, man, I did that.

820
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You know, like certain people that I noticed that I hurt.

821
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And I thought they would have found it weird that I called them.

822
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
But a lot of them, they were like, oh, they're like, oh, thank you very much.

823
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I mean, you come a long way and I appreciate you.

824
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You realize and it means a lot.

825
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And I sort of made peace.

826
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I made peace with it and it felt great.

827
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And that was one part of the inventory.

828
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And at the end, because it lasts about four hours, you know, it's a strong drug.

829
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
They call it medicine, but it's really a drug.

830
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And towards the end, this thing again, I always point it out because I want people to see.

831
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It says to me, it's like now, George, I know you hold a lot of grudge, a lot of anger.

832
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You know, you grew up with a lot of anger and you didn't let it out.

833
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It served you for what you did for your fighting.

834
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But now you have to learn how to let it go.

835
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And when I did this adventure, I was always contemplating an opportunity maybe to make a comeback or because I still had that thing inside of me.

836
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So it says to me, it's like now you're going to have to do like a detox and it will manifest physically.

837
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And I'm like, OK, you have to release all the negative emotion and it will manifest physically.

838
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Are you ready? I'm like, yes, I'm ready.

839
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And it says, like, if you need my help, I will always be there.

840
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So I said, OK, and I'm ready.

841
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And then I went to the bathroom and that day before you do ayahuasca, they advise you to not eat, to not eat anything.

842
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You know, if you eat very light and I didn't eat that day, I fasted.

843
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So I go on the bathroom because I start feeling a little bit sort of sick and I have a bucket.

844
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And I told you early on in my adventure, I had the hot the hot top in terms of emotion.

845
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I felt very good. But now, my friend, I dive down deep to the point that I have nothing to live for.

846
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Like, and I'm a very happy person in life.

847
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And but now, man, like nothing to live for.

848
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Like, basically, I want to die.

849
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And I start having very negative thoughts and it manifests physically.

850
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It comes out. I'm on the bathroom in the liquid.

851
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It comes out crying, like, like, like depressed, depressed, you know, like to the point like it's insane and throwing up.

852
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So and I'm sweating like I'm in a sauna.

853
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Like down, cry, sweat, like everything comes out.

854
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And up to the point that I can no longer take it.

855
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And now I'm thinking about this thing.

856
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm like, please, I can't take it.

857
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I can't take it. And it comes back to me.

858
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Lift me up like a little bit like I'm drowning and I cannot breathe.

859
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And they lift me up like, take a few in hell.

860
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
OK, OK, are you ready to dive back into it, George?

861
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You have to you have to let it go. Let it go.

862
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Like you have to clean it up.

863
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I'm like, OK, I'm ready. I'm ready.

864
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
OK, go back in it. And then I cry.

865
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And then when I can no longer take it up, it comes back.

866
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It lift me back up.

867
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
OK, take it. Take a break.

868
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Take a break. But we have to go back.

869
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It's almost done. OK, OK, OK.

870
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm doing it again. OK, go.

871
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Like a few times.

872
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It lasted for about 20 minutes.

873
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And even my friend was outside.

874
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
He knocked in the bathroom.

875
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And the whole time I was conscious that I was in two places at the same time.

876
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I was on the toilet, but I was also somewhere else like doing like a purge.

877
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And he knocked at the bathroom.

878
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
He said, George, you OK?

879
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I'm all right, man. I'm all right. Thank you. Thank you.

880
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Things go well. I just need to let it go.

881
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
He's like, OK, if something happened, let me know.

882
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
We would break the door and we come get you.

883
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And I'm like, no, no, no, I'm OK. I'm OK.

884
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So I was able to talk and drink that adventure to the point that when it was done.

885
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I took a shower. I changed my clothes.

886
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Man, I felt so light.

887
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
It was just like a relief.

888
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It felt so good physically and mentally.

889
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And I have no evidence to prove you that.

890
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yes, I really did lift my body.

891
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I went somewhere outside that the experience that I live in my mind.

892
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Maybe I really did it or maybe I was so freaking high that I think that I did it.

893
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I think I went to people's head and I had like a mirror emotion experience.

894
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I made it all up because I thought I can't tell you.

895
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But I'm under after living the adventure that I lived.

896
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I'm under the impression that a strong impression that there is something to consciousness

897
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
is not only measured by materialism.

898
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Now, I used to be septic, like how do you say agnostic, agnostic, agnostic.

899
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
But now I lean more towards a believer.

900
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
No, no, no, I'm really I'm really convinced that there is something.

901
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And a lot of my friends that are atheists that I told them that they say, oh, you were just so fucking high.

902
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah, maybe, maybe I was.

903
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:21,000
But it shaped me to my core so much that I think there is something, you know.

904
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And it's and I think it's a beautiful experience.

905
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I don't encourage people to take it because it's a it's a drug and I did it once.

906
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And I don't have the desire to do it again because I love my brain and I don't want to damage it.

907
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But I'm happy I've done it.

908
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm very happy I've done it because it's an experience that changes my life.

909
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Wow, George, thank you for sharing that.

910
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
No, it's something that I never talk publicly about it.

911
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
But it's something that really changes me.

912
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And I'm very happy I've done it.

913
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It's it's it's crazy.

914
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
It's it is crazy.

915
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And if some people sometimes they wonder, should I do it or not, you have to to listen to yourself.

916
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Don't force yourself.

917
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
If you force yourself, you it's not going to be good.

918
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You need to do it because you if you're ready to do it, you want to let you have to let it go and you have to treat that with respect.

919
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:31,000
You know, it's a it's a I know it was used heavily by ancient culture in a way to perhaps communicating with something or to get deep inside your own consciousness.

920
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
But it's really something that you need to treat with respect.

921
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And it's not a recreational drug.

922
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It is absolutely not.

923
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And it's a it's an experience I've done.

924
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And I'm very happy I've done it.

925
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And yeah, it changes me.

926
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
That is really, really profound.

927
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:01,000
That sounds like, you know, a lot of a lot of people we talk and we talked a little bit before this podcast about, you know, my experience.

928
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And I had a lot of people say, you know, you should after my out of body experiences.

929
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And I had like half a dozen of these where I'd leave my body through meditation.

930
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And, you know, a lot of people were like, you should do ayahuasca or you should do DMT.

931
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And so I did DMT, albeit my experience was nowhere near as like profound as yours.

932
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
There was the same element of phasing out of your body and kind of like lifting out.

933
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And I felt a very familiar sense to that.

934
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And so for me, it was very validating because like you, through my experiences, I was changed.

935
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I was also I grew up Catholic.

936
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I became atheist, moved towards agnosticism because I started being like, I don't care.

937
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
There's some I don't know. Maybe there's some maybe there isn't.

938
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I don't know.

939
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And then through these experiences of seeing my own self, I'm convinced that I'm more than my physical body.

940
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Yeah.

941
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And like you said, like there's no hard evidence anywhere.

942
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
But the hardest evidence, I like I don't need.

943
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I just there's a knowing now that I can't ignore.

944
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
There's one thing that is very important to mention that is.

945
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Because sometimes like you read Rene Descartes, he says like, let's say you put a straw in a glass of water, you see the straw bending.

946
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So your senses can fool you.

947
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
If they can fool you once, they can fool you twice or forever.

948
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So because of that, for me, it was very important that I was like, how do I know this experience is real after when I'm done?

949
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
So I asked this thing, I asked, I asked it, I say, how would I know?

950
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And it says to me, I will give you a gift that only you will know.

951
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And I didn't realize what it was, the gift.

952
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
But now I know I used to be scared of height, like crazy scared of height.

953
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I've done stuff in my life that require me to step over my fear, to challenge my fear, like skydiving.

954
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Or, you know, even when I was in Singapore, I did some climbing under a bridge.

955
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I was terrified. I've always been terrified of height.

956
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I know when I change the, you know, when the leaf in your, when in spring when you have to go on top of your house for the gutters, clean the leaf.

957
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm terrified of doing it. I freaking hate it.

958
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm like, I feel the feeling like I'm about to fall.

959
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Like, even when I go up in a building, I look down, I feel like it shake me to my core.

960
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
But now I know since my experience, I don't have that feeling anymore.

961
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Yeah, I swear, I swear it's true. If you, if you eat.

962
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So that's like a personal. Yeah, it's crazy.

963
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Like a personal confirmation that what I live is real.

964
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So there is an argument to counter that that would say, oh, the drug you took maybe break your brain and break that that that part of your brain that gives you the fear.

965
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Maybe it's the drug that done it might maybe or maybe it's really this this thing that gave me it.

966
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I don't know. But I know for a fact that now when I go on, for example, in the height, I'm aware of the danger, but I'm not paralyzed and stiff.

967
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm not like I used to be before. Right. I'm more comfortable.

968
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
But I'm aware it's dangerous, but I'm not. Yeah. You know what I mean?

969
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
We say in French, I'm frozen. You know, like I'm frozen. Yeah.

970
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And it this is something that's sort of for me. Yeah. Confirm.

971
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
That was like a little a little wink. Yes.

972
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Because for me, it's important that I have a confirmation that it's deeper, not only in my senses.

973
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I've seen something. I hear something because this could fool you sometime.

974
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
You know, and it's almost like it knew that.

975
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I want to give you something because I know it says it to me because I asked the question, I said, how would I know if it's real?

976
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
And it sort of made me understand like that's you will have a gift and I didn't realize what was the gift.

977
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And now I know that's the gift. That's interesting.

978
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Or maybe I'm completely insane. I made it all up in my mind. Who knows?

979
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
You know what I mean? Yeah, definitely.

980
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
You know, that's the counter argument. But I also counter argue that with, you know, why?

981
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Why? Why do we associate the physical with the real? Right.

982
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
What if this isn't real? And what if everything else is? Because that seems to be the trend.

983
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:41,000
It seems to be like if we're looking at interdimensional beings or even the existence, the nonexistence of space time,

984
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
like the way these things operate behaves differently.

985
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
When we sleep, time behaves differently when our brain shuts down.

986
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's like it seems like this astral or this whatever this space is might be the real in like, you know, much like the simulation theory.

987
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And I don't like that word because it makes makes us feel like a video game.

988
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I don't think that's at all it. But this is some type of lower density 3D avatar that we're sort of learning lessons through.

989
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So the way that I always see this is that that's the reality. OK, this other place is the reality.

990
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And there you have instant manifestation. You can manifest anything. You can go anywhere.

991
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Anything just happens instantly. It's so easy. But when you do that, you don't learn anything because it's everything's too easy.

992
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:37,000
You have it all. So we're put here into these, you know, 3D into this 3D reality and everything's hard and slow.

993
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And we move like through molasses here. And if we want to manifest something, it takes years or months.

994
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And we have to think of it and we have to really like and move things to make it happen.

995
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
So it's like a slow motion version of what's really going on.

996
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,000
But this is the only way that we can learn hardship and we can learn lessons that we take back to the reality. Right.

997
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So when people say, you know, is it real? Is it not real?

998
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I think what we're asking, like, is it physical or nonphysical? And I don't think nonphysical means it's not real.

999
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I think there are different reels. Yeah.

1000
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:17,000
What I get from my ayahuasca adventure also is the fact that I'm under the impression and that's only me.

1001
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
That consciousness is something that linked everything together,

1002
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
that we're all ones in the same time, that we're all different. Yeah.

1003
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
You know, in a physical, in a materialistic world, we'll say like, let's say I die.

1004
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
You bury me naked underneath the soil.

1005
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I will stop existing as an entity walking around, but I will not end.

1006
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I will be transformed. The worms will eat me.

1007
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Perhaps the grass on top of me, the herbs will grow faster because the organic material.

1008
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
So I will move from that state of walking around to another state of different things.

1009
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And I'm under the impression that that's what consciousness is about.

1010
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And it made me, it gave me also the impression that, you know, when someone die, we're all very sad.

1011
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You know, when it's normal, we're sad.

1012
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:31,000
But it gives me the impression that there's something that, you know, that person died that became part of something else

1013
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
that one day will join, will join it as well to be part of that thing.

1014
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And we're all sort of together.

1015
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I don't know how to explain. It's a freaking profound experience.

1016
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And they say, you know, we saw certain clip online, like the Rick James.

1017
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
He says, hey, cocaine is a hell of a drug, but ayahuasca is a hell of a drug too.

1018
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
So I don't know what to make of it.

1019
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Yeah, they should definitely make that a meme instead.

1020
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
They're going to make some meme now. Ayahuasca is a hell of a drug.

1021
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It's a Joe Rogan saying, Rick James.

1022
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yeah, that's, I mean, that's, that seems to be on par with a lot of beliefs.

1023
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And that's the thing. It's like, this isn't the one thing that I keep understanding is that none of this is new.

1024
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Right. And that's the feeling that I got when I was sort of leaving my body as well.

1025
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I started vibrating before it happened. Right.

1026
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I started getting, and I thought, I documented this.

1027
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I thought there was a truck on the property.

1028
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And I was like, how rude that like there's this giant truck on the property when we're trying to meditate.

1029
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Turns out, no, that was me.

1030
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
There was a vibration in me and it wasn't physical, but it felt physical.

1031
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And when that was happening, like it was just so strange.

1032
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And the feeling that I got, the overwhelming, like the only way that I can explain it is this is ancient.

1033
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:05,000
That's it. Whatever's happening to me right now, I felt tied me, connected me to thousands of years of humans.

1034
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
That this specific moment right now, you know, links me to them.

1035
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Not me researching something, not something I'm eating, not the air, not nothing, this feeling.

1036
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
This is a very human feeling. Yeah.

1037
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And this is something that links me to all of that.

1038
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Like we all have differences over time and knowledge and intelligence experience, but this we have in common.

1039
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And that was a really powerful sensation to feel that because it felt true.

1040
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It felt like, hey, this is, this is true. This is real.

1041
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And I even told you before the interview, before the podcast that I would be very interested to go back into that state.

1042
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
But I'm no longer interested to do it using drugs to get there.

1043
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I feel it's sort of a shortcut. Yep.

1044
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:11,000
And sometimes with shortcut, I feel sometimes it's like giving a gun to a child, you know, or it doesn't have the wisdom to use it.

1045
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And maybe I did ayahuasca, but I didn't have the wisdom.

1046
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I didn't work together. I just took something and I get there.

1047
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I cheated. You know what I mean?

1048
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And I feel I did it once. It was OK.

1049
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:33,000
But I'm very interested if it's if there is a way because I heard monk monks get there because your brain produced the empty.

1050
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:39,000
If there is a way to get there naturally, I would really love to learn that.

1051
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And I know you're you're you're trying to you're going down that rabbit hole.

1052
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And I'm really interested to learn these.

1053
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:59,000
When I was young, I when I was a kid, I used to have experience called sleep paralysis.

1054
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And that's how they call it. You know, I don't know what if it's what it is.

1055
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
And that's one of the reason why I first started getting interested by UFO.

1056
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You know, even before I had the encounter with my four friend that I've seen something in the sky.

1057
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
It started way earlier when I was a kid.

1058
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I used to, you know, I used to be in bed at night and I used to have nightmares of, you know, of things that came and get me.

1059
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And I used to tell my parents, I'm like, man, I was scared.

1060
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And for a long time, I was terrified.

1061
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I thought like something came to get me.

1062
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:46,000
And I met, you know, when I met Joe Rogan and he talked to me about a phenomenon, a phenomenon called sleep paralysis.

1063
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
He says, like, there's there's a phenomenon that you're in bed and you cannot move.

1064
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And your brain produced the empty and it start hallucinating things.

1065
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And that that could be it.

1066
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:05,000
And I, man, it really, it really traumatized me when I was young to the point that even now I'm an adult sometimes.

1067
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And I mean, let's say I'm in bed and I'm alone and I start thinking about it.

1068
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It makes me remember the fear and it scared me even when I'm a grown man and I can't defend myself.

1069
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
It traumatized me to that point.

1070
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:31,000
And that's one of the reasons now I would be very interesting to learn of how I could perhaps get back into that mental state if there's ways to do it naturally.

1071
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I used to be very sceptic.

1072
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I used to learn to hear all those stories.

1073
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Oh, yeah, there's that.

1074
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
They go, I'm like, yeah, right, right.

1075
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
But now that I did ayahuasca, I know it's possible to do it on drugs.

1076
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I would love to know how to do it naturally just to perhaps increase my knowledge and maybe help me be a better person.

1077
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah.

1078
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And that's probably the best intention to go into it with.

1079
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And that's probably the strongest intention as well.

1080
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Because when you rule out, this is just something in my experience as well.

1081
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And this has been echoed by a lot of people who study this.

1082
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
But when you rule out the ego part of it, that's when things happen, right?

1083
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
If it's not for monetary gain or it's not for any other purpose.

1084
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
But once the ego is out of the equation, that's when you're more receptive.

1085
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
That's when the intention's sort of pure.

1086
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And it kind of picks up on that, the phenomenon.

1087
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
It's a very interesting thing that you just mentioned, ego.

1088
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And that's one of the things I had a hard time to let it go.

1089
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:35,000
In the fighting world, it's a very egotistic industry.

1090
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Everything is about being the alpha, not being scared.

1091
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Very physical, lower density.

1092
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Yeah, 100%.

1093
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's a lot of bullying and mental warfare.

1094
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And you never want to admit that you're scared, even though deep down inside you are.

1095
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Because it shows signs of weakness.

1096
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
But it's not.

1097
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
In a way, admitting that you're scared, it showcases that you're strong.

1098
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Because you're allowed to talk about your fear.

1099
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And if I'm talking, if I'm an open book and I talk about my fear, I'm not afraid of you.

1100
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
You know what I mean?

1101
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Because I've shown my most vulnerable part.

1102
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Because I'm confident that I'm better than you.

1103
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
True strength.

1104
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Yes, yes.

1105
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:22,000
So yeah, but the ego, letting go of your ego.

1106
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
The ego at the same time, it's your pride.

1107
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It is what makes you stand up and being strong towards adversity.

1108
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
But at the same time, it's a double edged sword.

1109
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Because if you let it go, it can make you a better person.

1110
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Be more open to people, you know?

1111
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Yeah.

1112
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And that's something that you've actually talked about.

1113
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I remember hearing that too, like admitting you're nervous.

1114
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Or admitting that like, yeah, no, I am going into this fight.

1115
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You know, you're not like just everyone else where they were like, you know, this is it.

1116
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I'm going to, you know, there was a certain, but that helped you.

1117
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
That like made you a more intelligent fighter as well.

1118
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You know what happened, Chris?

1119
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Early on in my career, I mean, the way I describe it is we're not all born with the same set of card, you know?

1120
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
We all have different skills, you know?

1121
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
If I would have been born with an anti-cap, I would never be able to be champion.

1122
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I'm a very athletic person.

1123
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I've always been good in sports.

1124
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And I developed a passion with martial art early on, watching movies.

1125
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You know, Jean-Claude Van Damme and all these guys, Chuck Norris.

1126
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
They really inspire me.

1127
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Steven Seagal, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steve Astor Stallone.

1128
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And I was bullied at school.

1129
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
So I first started karate.

1130
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I started with Kyoko Shin Karate as a self-defense to defend myself in the schoolyard.

1131
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And then it transformed into a passion because things back then was not well.

1132
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Things were not going well at home.

1133
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:10,000
My dad at the time was drinking and things were not going well at school because I was getting bullied.

1134
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Instead of focusing on what the teacher was saying, I had to try to think about how I'm going to reach out my locker,

1135
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
pick up my book and get to the bus before the guys get to me and beat me up.

1136
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And that was something that was happening to me on a weekly basis.

1137
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So I was not happy.

1138
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I was not good anywhere.

1139
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I felt bad everywhere.

1140
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
The only place I felt good was the dojo because I was doing well in karate.

1141
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I was starting to collect metal.

1142
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And that was the only place where I feel like, hey, man, I'm good here.

1143
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
You know, I'm doing something well.

1144
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:53,000
And then later on, my dad, he did something that really inspired me and brought back my family together when he stopped drinking.

1145
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And it really inspired me.

1146
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And it changes my life because I saw how hard it was to fight the thirst.

1147
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And not only that he stopped drinking, he started to mentor younger people that try to stop drinking.

1148
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I remember at night, sometimes the phone was ringing at 11 at night.

1149
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And it was my dad picking up the phone.

1150
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It was maybe a younger guy.

1151
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
It was like, hey, man, I'm thirsty.

1152
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
My dad was like, I'm coming. I'm coming to get you.

1153
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
So he really inspired me because I saw how hard it was.

1154
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And I realized it only later when I was an adult, not really at the time.

1155
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
It was like sort of a delay.

1156
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And it really inspired me.

1157
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
But I remember even early on in my career, we talk about ego and pride.

1158
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:46,000
When I was looking around, I never felt I never fit.

1159
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I felt I never fit where I was.

1160
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I loved the purity to be.

1161
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I wanted to be champion.

1162
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I did it for the right reason.

1163
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I didn't want to do it because I wanted to be popular with the money because they didn't have any money and popularity back then.

1164
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I just wanted to be champion.

1165
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I wanted to be the best.

1166
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I did it for the pure reason.

1167
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:19,000
But when I was looking around and I was looking at my training partner in my environment, I didn't fit in because all the guys I was with, they were like, yeah, I can't wait for Saturday night.

1168
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I'm like, man, I'm scared.

1169
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I'm not happy to be here.

1170
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I'm happy to be in the gym to train and to have that lifestyle.

1171
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And I know if I want to continue to have that lifestyle, the sacrifice is that I need to fight Saturday night and win the fight in order to do it.

1172
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
But I don't enjoy this process.

1173
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I'm not happy to do it.

1174
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I'm happy to get to have that lifestyle for free.

1175
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But I'm not happy to go fight.

1176
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I never like to fight.

1177
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:56,000
So I decided to seek the help of sports psychologists because, man, I felt I never I didn't fit in.

1178
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And some sports psychologists tried to brainwash me.

1179
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
They were like, George, stop saying you're afraid.

1180
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
You're not afraid.

1181
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
You're excited.

1182
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And one of them, it was like it was my English used to be very like it's still bad, but used to be way worse before.

1183
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And I was thinking I was like, is it the language barrier excited?

1184
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I don't think I'm excited.

1185
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I would be excited in different situation, but I'm not excited to go to know that I'm going to fight Saturday night, not knowing if I will be badly injured or humiliated.

1186
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I'm afraid.

1187
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
And then I realized that, man, I need to make peace with it.

1188
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,000
And there is no shame to admit that you're afraid because there is no courage without fear.

1189
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
And when I made peace with that, it changes everything in my life because I made peace.

1190
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And I said it to even in my open is like, yeah, I'm scared of you.

1191
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:49,000
But no matter what, I'm going to freaking walk the walk on Saturday night and there is nothing you can do.

1192
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:58,000
And the way you counter fear, whether you're a fighter, an entrepreneur or whatever, it's with the preparation.

1193
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:06,000
The more well you prepare, the more you will build up your confidence.

1194
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And if you have confidence, remember, confidence is not the absence of fear.

1195
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It's knowing that you have what you need in order to succeed.

1196
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:30,000
And a good analogy is if I talk to young students at school, I'm telling them if you have an exam Friday and you study very hard.

1197
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Yes, you will still be afraid Friday, the day of the exam.

1198
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,000
But you have the right to be confident, to walk in there with confidence, even though you're afraid.

1199
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
But if you have not studied, you will be afraid.

1200
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
But you don't have the right to be confident because you know you didn't do the work.

1201
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,000
You didn't put in the work and confidence, whether you're a fighter, an entrepreneur, whatever you do,

1202
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:05,000
even in any situation, even if you go ask a girl on a date, confidence, whatever you do, it's the most important thing.

1203
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
One of the most important things. You need the skills, the preparation and the confidence.

1204
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Because if you don't have confidence, it's a little bit like a good analogy that my sensei was saying to me.

1205
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,000
If you don't have confidence, it's like someone who has a lot of money in his bank account, but no way of accessing it.

1206
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
You can never reach your full potential. And the way you build confidence is through preparation.

1207
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And when I made peace with it, I knew I was afraid. I made peace with it.

1208
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I remember when I was young, I thought the fear will go away over time, that I will get used to it.

1209
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I will no longer be afraid. But that's not true. It's the opposite.

1210
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
It gets worse because every fight is bigger than the last one.

1211
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:53,000
And it gets worse. But because I made peace with it, I was like, man, I know this is normal.

1212
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I need to be afraid because I know when I'm afraid, it high-end my reaction time, my reset time.

1213
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
It makes me better. So I embrace fear. I know it's a normal thing.

1214
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And if my opponent is like, are you afraid of me? I'm like, yeah, man, I'm afraid of you.

1215
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:20,000
But I'm going to fucking do it regardless. And I think from my perspective is way scarier than saying, no, I'm not afraid.

1216
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:27,000
99% of the people in my field of work are like, no, I'm not afraid. I'm going to kick his ass.

1217
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Bullshit, man. You're scared. Or either you're scared or you're a psychopath or you're a liar.

1218
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
That's the three possibilities. You're lying or you're a psychopath.

1219
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
You know what I mean? Or you're dumb as hell.

1220
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Because if you're not afraid, that means you don't know the consequences of what can happen.

1221
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
That's true. Yeah, wow, man.

1222
01:14:48,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Because you never control the entire data. When you go into a fight or you have to focus on things that you have the power to control.

1223
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
You don't want to focus. And that's the hardest thing to do because there's so many distractions.

1224
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
You don't want to focus on things you don't control. For example, what the people are going to say.

1225
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Am I going to win or lose? What my opponent is going to do?

1226
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:22,000
This needs to be wiped out of your mind, only focusing on things that you do control, things that I do.

1227
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Me as an entity, I don't exist. Am I going to be sick the morning of the fight? Am I sleeping well or not?

1228
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I don't care. It's out of my mind. The only thing that matters is the objective.

1229
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And the objective is the only thing that matters because that's what's going to lead you to the path of victory.

1230
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And this needs to be done at all costs. That's the spirit. You need to go in.

1231
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It's hard to think about it, but that's the way it is. Like a soldier. It's objective, no subjective.

1232
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:05,000
But that's such a big contrast between being there, preparing yourself physically, mentally for a physical and mental bout.

1233
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And on top of that, all the other obstacles that are being thrown your way, not only health-wise,

1234
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:17,000
but also emotionally or personally the things that you're dealing with or the media and all this stuff.

1235
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:28,000
It's a big battle going from that to what happened after this ayahuasca trip, which is completely almost like...

1236
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
180 degree.

1237
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yeah, the opposite. It's like, okay, you've done that. Now forget all that.

1238
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And you're like, how do I forget all that? That's your identity. That's everything.

1239
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:43,000
And you had to come to terms with that too. So that must have been just like...

1240
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I mean, I can even hear you telling a story and I know that it's changed you.

1241
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Let's put this scenario. If you were to somehow have a time machine and go back into the ring,

1242
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,000
but after having this experience, do you think that would make you a better or worse fighter?

1243
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
That's a good question. I think it would make me worse.

1244
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I think there's a chronological way to do it.

1245
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I think you don't want to do this before you finish your career.

1246
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Right.

1247
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And what I'm saying is only from my expertise, my experience, but I know that there's some other professional combat athlete.

1248
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:43,000
For example, Deontay Walder mentioned, I believe, that he did ayahuasca and he believed that's why his career went down.

1249
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
He said it publicly. And I can understand why.

1250
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Because that ego thing that we talk about as a fighter is the most important thing.

1251
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:01,000
That's your spine. That's what holds you up against all odds, against all the adversity.

1252
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It's your ego, your pride. But in society, it could be an obstacle.

1253
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Because sometimes an ego, you have to let your ego aside.

1254
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Putting it down, it makes you a better person, I believe.

1255
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And even the people that know me personally say that when I did ayahuasca, it really changed me.

1256
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It made me more empathetic, more in touch with other people.

1257
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I'm by no means perfect. I have a lot of issues and I need to work on myself a lot.

1258
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
But I'm a little bit better than I used to be.

1259
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I can see that as being a problem too, going into the ring with empathy.

1260
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Feeling bad for hurting your opponent is not something you want to think about.

1261
01:18:49,000 --> 01:19:00,000
You want to be like an alpha bull. You're here to destroy and kill everyone.

1262
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
That's how it is. That's how you need to be. But you can't stay like that all your life.

1263
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:11,000
And I believe one of the reasons why a lot of athletes in combat sports have a hard time letting it go.

1264
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:17,000
And you see a lot of athletes sometimes, they should have retired maybe a decade ago, but they're still out there fighting.

1265
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I mean, it's very sad. It's very, very sad. You see that happening all the time.

1266
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And they hurt themselves. Oh, CTE physically, they hurt also themselves business-wise.

1267
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Because when you finish on top, for example, for me, the best reason why I stopped is because it's my health.

1268
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I wanted to finish healthy, to have a future, to be healthy for the rest of my life.

1269
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:57,000
But also the second reason is business-wise. When you finish on top, I compare, for example, entertainers or athletes like stock in the market.

1270
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
If you finish on top, you're stuck worth a lot of money. So there's a lot of opportunity.

1271
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
When you retire and you turn around, a lot of business opportunity opens to you.

1272
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Those opportunities will not be there if you retire on a four losing streak because your stock will go down.

1273
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And it's something to think about. So a lot of people, they told me, yeah, you must have, George, you should have keep on fighting.

1274
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,000
You left a lot of money on the table. Maybe I left some money on the table, but I think I catch it up on the long run.

1275
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And on top of that, I didn't damage my health because it's not only the fight.

1276
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Think about it. When you get ready for a fight, you have to go into a training camp, get hit and all that.

1277
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
It's even worse than the fight itself and all the stresses that you have.

1278
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And for me, the stress was the most damageable thing, the stress.

1279
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I've always been very open about it. I was stressed, I was scared, and it took a lot out of me.

1280
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
A lot more than the physical damage. Oh yeah, 100%.

1281
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I developed a condition called ulcer colitis, I believe a big part because of that stress.

1282
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And in my last fight with Michael Bisping, I fought in the Madison Square Garden.

1283
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Prior to that fight, a few weeks, I had severe cramps. When I went to the bathroom, it was blood.

1284
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
And I didn't know what it was. I was like, man, is it a cancer or anything?

1285
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And I told myself, whatever it is, I'm going to deal with it after the fight in a few weeks.

1286
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
So after the fight, I did what they call a colonoscopy. They put something inside of you.

1287
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:46,000
They give you some medication to empty yourself, you know, and something that you don't want to do before the fight.

1288
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:52,000
But they put a camera and they went to see inside. I got diagnosed with ulcer colitis.

1289
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Ulcerative colitis, yeah.

1290
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
So I was on medication. But I'm not a big fan of medication.

1291
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I mean, I always look for alternative ways of how I can get better.

1292
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And I met a doctor in Toronto that changed my life. His name is Jason Fung.

1293
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Jason Fung, you can research it. Jason Fung, F-U-N-G.

1294
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:20,000
He wrote many books about fasting and he got me into a fasting program.

1295
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And believe it or not, a few months after, all my symptoms disappeared and I no longer use medication.

1296
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Do you think that that also had something to do with the fact that you weren't fighting anymore?

1297
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
It could be.

1298
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Because of stress.

1299
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Because of stress, yeah. But both, like, I mean.

1300
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,000
It could be. But I had other stresses in my life. It could be that.

1301
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
But I believe that the fasting really helped me.

1302
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Yep. I believe in fasting too, by the way.

1303
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Because it gives time to your system to rejuvenate.

1304
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
You know, if you eat all the time. And when I was fighting Michael Bisping,

1305
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I was on the diet that I was forcing myself to eat because I was trying to put on weight.

1306
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Which was, by the way, a big mistake of my part. I should have just stayed the same weight that I am.

1307
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:16,000
But I was trying to put on weight because I was fighting in a weight class heavier than I normally compete at.

1308
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:23,000
So I was trying to get bigger. But it didn't do me any good because I got sick and everything.

1309
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:32,000
But the fact that I put a lot of stress, like mental stress and physical stress, I think that's what triggered that issue.

1310
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And after when I went to fasting, different fasting protocols, it helped me get rid of all my symptoms.

1311
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Yeah. I mean, people need to be aware of the fact that diet can fix 90% of the health issues that are out there right now.

1312
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Maybe even more.

1313
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I made some research and I found out that, you know, the reason why we eat three times a day,

1314
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and sometimes even some people eat more than that, like five times a day,

1315
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,000
it's since the Industrial Revolution. Before that, this did not exist.

1316
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Since the Industrial Revolution, because of the work, the laws, they had to make time for eating for the employees.

1317
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:23,000
So if you look, if you go back, this thing did not really existed. It was since the Industrial Revolution.

1318
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:31,000
So it's really recent in our evolution that we are conditioned to eat at that time.

1319
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Think about it. Just logically think about it. Like our untargeter ancestor,

1320
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,000
they did not wake up in the morning and have breakfast, you know, most of the time because you need to work to get your breakfast.

1321
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
You need to hunt. You need, you know, you don't get your breakfast for free in a fridge.

1322
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Yeah, so exactly. So the fact that you wait in the morning, and that's what I do now, I don't get breakfast in the morning.

1323
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I eat my eggs and, you know, my coffee a little bit later during the day and after my first training.

1324
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And I just wish, Chris, I would have known that before.

1325
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It would have, it would perhaps not have caused all the harms that I did to my body.

1326
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Yeah. But then again, you know, you being on that path is what led you to this.

1327
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
So you might not have, you know. That's true. It's like a feedback loop.

1328
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
You have to, you have to go through the hardships to learn, to learn all this stuff.

1329
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:30,000
But it, I mean, it's very, very interesting. My, myself, so I eat mainly a paleo diet.

1330
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I'm, I'm like, I'm borderline in ketosis most of the time because of like this paleo diet.

1331
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I don't eat sugar, no dairy, you know, no pasta. It's strict.

1332
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
No processed food.

1333
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
No processed food, none.

1334
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Oh, interesting.

1335
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Just meat, leafy greens and root veggies.

1336
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
And do you think that helps you to get into that mental meditating state?

1337
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Because I've heard that, and correct me if I'm wrong, you're the expert on that.

1338
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Like apparently you have to be centered.

1339
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Like you cannot be hungry or sad or, you know what I mean?

1340
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Like horny or you have to be, right?

1341
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Yep. It does help. It does help. And there's been a lot of studies actually.

1342
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
There's a guy, Graham Nichols, he did a lot of research on this too.

1343
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:31,000
How actually not, his research was not eating meat, how it induces more psi ability.

1344
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:37,000
So more sort of the psychic sort of ability during these out of body experiences and all that stuff

1345
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:45,000
that there's been a correlation between like vegetarians and vegans having actually more experiences

1346
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
and more accuracy during these testings.

1347
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I tend to think that it probably isn't the lack of meat.

1348
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
My, I guess, hypothesis is it's the lack of processed food.

1349
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Chemicals.

1350
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Correct.

1351
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
There's a lot of chemicals and veggies as well.

1352
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Yes. They're everywhere.

1353
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And so it's really, it's difficult to do a diet without processed nowadays

1354
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
because processed is just so much cheaper and groceries are getting more expensive.

1355
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And so it's not easy for everyone to have like a good diet.

1356
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It's very strange, but like you look at like, okay, the poorest parts in the world,

1357
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
yes, people are very skinny because they're malnourished and they're not eating.

1358
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:26,000
And then you look at like just above that, people have a little money, are completely overweight.

1359
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And then, and you have a lot of money, you're back in shape again.

1360
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And so it's like, you know, like we really do have a system where we're offering a lot of really bad food at low cost,

1361
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
you know, and that's, that's been part of the problem.

1362
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
But to your point, there is a certain headspace that you have to be in,

1363
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
but that headspace I don't think can come at the beginning.

1364
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I think it takes practice like everything else.

1365
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Like, I don't think you can go into meditating your first time ever,

1366
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
be centered and have like an amazing experience.

1367
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I think it's just something you have to keep doing because it's different for everyone.

1368
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
The feeling, the meditation itself, calming your mind is very,

1369
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
it depends where you're at and what you've eaten really and all this.

1370
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
So it's a journey that over time you start to discover what's good for you

1371
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:26,000
and how you can actually see very clearly what's going on in your psyche when you get to that point.

1372
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:32,000
So if I'm in a meditation and something keeps popping up, something keeps at the beginning, I'd be like,

1373
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
oh, I try to shut that down. I have to shut this down.

1374
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I have to control and I have to like shut myself up.

1375
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And after a while, you're just like, okay, come on in.

1376
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
And you look at it and you observe it.

1377
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And then when you're done with you, you're like, you good now?

1378
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Okay, you can leave.

1379
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And this becomes like through practice, you're able to do this much easier.

1380
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And it becomes like fun.

1381
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,000
It becomes fun to embrace and sit with your problems and sit with those stresses or those,

1382
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
like you said, like if you're horny or if you're angry.

1383
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And they even say that during the Monroe, the Gateway experience.

1384
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Even before that, they briefed me and they're like, you might get horny during these things.

1385
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
And I'm like, what do you mean?

1386
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
It's energy.

1387
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It's one of the most primal forms of energy.

1388
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
It's creation energy, right?

1389
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
And so how at first you're like, oh, I'm getting a random boner during my meditation.

1390
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
What the hell is going on?

1391
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And then after a while you're like, oh, I can take that energy and sort of spread it through my body.

1392
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I can control it.

1393
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I can. So again, it's not about shutting down all of these things,

1394
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:40,000
but it's about re-channeling that energy and much like martial arts.

1395
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
You know, if somebody's coming at you, it's using their own energy against them

1396
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
rather than forcing against that energy, which could be damaging for you both.

1397
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Yeah.

1398
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
It's much easier to take that and roll with it.

1399
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
How do you, why?

1400
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I mean, I have to be the devil advocate now.

1401
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Why nobody has ever come publicly in a way to prove that?

1402
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Like, you know what I mean?

1403
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Like that.

1404
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
The out of body experience and stuff?

1405
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Yeah, not out of body, but like the, you know, the psionic power, because it's not proven.

1406
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Like remote viewing sort of thing.

1407
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Like why, if it's true, there is no strong evidence of, let's say like, okay,

1408
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
like someone can do it, goes public.

1409
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Okay, I bring me anybody that I will be in the room next to that person

1410
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:37,000
and know, I will, I will draw what they draw on the paper or whatever it is.

1411
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Like why you think, I mean, because I'm, I'm still septic.

1412
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Yeah.

1413
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:49,000
And sometimes I think, you know, when you do these experience, apparently from the lore,

1414
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
you have to take off your intellect and be more into intuition.

1415
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,000
But how do you make the difference between intuition and deduction?

1416
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Because when I'm fighting, I don't know what to explain it.

1417
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
If someone is about to throw a punch, I will see it coming.

1418
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Is it intuition or is it deduction?

1419
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Because I've seen that pattern so many times, so I can identify it before it comes.

1420
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Or is it both?

1421
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
It's a great question.

1422
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
What makes a good athlete an athlete?

1423
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Is it his intuition?

1424
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Because there's guys like, for example, John Jones.

1425
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Yeah.

1426
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Man, he's freaking fat.

1427
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
He's a freak of nature.

1428
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
You see him, like the way he moves is so beautiful.

1429
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Demetrius Johnson.

1430
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Is it his intuition or is it deduction that he can?

1431
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,000
All the great guys in hockey, Wayne Gretzky, you don't even look, he passed the puck.

1432
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I'm like, man, Michael Jordan.

1433
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Yeah.

1434
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Is there something more than deduction?

1435
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Of course, some of the Atheists will say the logical ways of thinking.

1436
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I mean, in our world, we'll be like, oh, he practices so much that even...

1437
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
He's in a flow stage.

1438
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Yes.

1439
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
He had a flow, but flow is not really accepted.

1440
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's like, oh, he practiced it so much that he knows where the guy is because of the practice.

1441
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Or is it something more like an intuition?

1442
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
That's my question.

1443
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And that's one of the things that could be interesting.

1444
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
You know what I mean?

1445
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Is there a way to prove it?

1446
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And why, if there is a way to prove it, why it's never been done before?

1447
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Or if it was done, is it secret?

1448
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Now we get into the CIA, like with all the program, like Stargate and all that.

1449
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
So, I mean, there's a lot to unpack there because it's...

1450
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:51,000
First of all, there is a lot of evidence showing that psi ability is real.

1451
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
There's a lot of evidence showing that remote viewing is real.

1452
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
If you know where to look, the thing is it isn't pushed on a mainstream level.

1453
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And most people won't accept it because of the shifting goal posts a lot of times.

1454
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,000
For instance, the tests that are being done to prove...

1455
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I mean, there's Dean Radin, there's Rupert Sheldrake, and there's...

1456
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Joseph McMonacle, right?

1457
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Joe McMonacle, he's a remote viewer.

1458
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
But the people that studied him, there's the doctor that studied him.

1459
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
He's the chief research physicist, Dr. Edwin May.

1460
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:31,000
He has 30 years of data spanning over six remote viewers, 30 years of data.

1461
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
So he has a clear... And he's a research physicist.

1462
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
So he has a clear line, and his line...

1463
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
And normally if you see something over time like this, you see the line go down, right?

1464
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Because it's just like... His is a straight line.

1465
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Like Joe McMonacle, straight all the way through in terms of his testing.

1466
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
What do you mean? The line is the success?

1467
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yes, correct. It's a straight line.

1468
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
How come it's not freaking public?

1469
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
That's what... It's very frustrating because I want to believe, Chris,

1470
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
and I really want to... But my freaking logical...

1471
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
The logical part of my brain is like, if there's no evidence, it's not true.

1472
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
So there is a lot of evidence. There is actually a ton of evidence.

1473
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
There are a lot of books out there too, and I can point you towards those books,

1474
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
of studies that are peer-reviewed even.

1475
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Dr. Daryl Bem did amazing studies on precognition.

1476
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,000
That was proven. They did this test, I think, 93 times or something.

1477
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
And thousands of people... This was a real test that was done.

1478
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
On remote viewing, you talk.

1479
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
This was on precognition.

1480
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I'm sorry.

1481
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Seeing the future.

1482
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1483
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Foresee something that did not happen yet.

1484
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
But on a minuscule level, right? On a scientific, like, how can we improve this?

1485
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And a lot of that has to do with what you were saying, with this instinct, right?

1486
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
And so what they would do is they would flash these images on these...

1487
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
They had them hooked up to EEG machines or whatever they were.

1488
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And they would flash images, some were positive and some were negative.

1489
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
And they would measure the brainwave activity.

1490
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
When the images were negative,

1491
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:11,000
they would see a spike in their brainwave functions,

1492
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
fractions of a second before the image was shown.

1493
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Wow.

1494
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Yes. And they did this over and over and over and over.

1495
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
And is it peer review?

1496
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Yes, it is peer review.

1497
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Really?

1498
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Yes, absolutely. But it's so minute.

1499
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Rupert Sheldrake did a test, and this as well.

1500
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
He wrote a whole book on this, very fascinating.

1501
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
But it was the connection between dogs and their owners

1502
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
and how some of them seem to have some type of psychic connection.

1503
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
And so the way that they tested this, they had the dogs at home

1504
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
and they gave the person a pager who was out of the home.

1505
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
And at a random time, they would page them to go home, okay?

1506
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And they would go home in a different way, not normal way, like not with their car.

1507
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It would be somebody else's car or a bike or a bus or something.

1508
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
And they would page them at a random time during the day.

1509
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Well, the second they page them, a lot of these dogs

1510
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
would get up off the couch and run to the door.

1511
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
As soon as the intention of the person was to go home,

1512
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
the dogs would come to the door over and over again.

1513
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Really?

1514
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
And not only that, halfway to their home,

1515
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
they would page them again to turn back.

1516
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
The dog would go back on the couch or whatever.

1517
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And so they did this over and over and they found that some of these dogs

1518
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
do have this consciousness connection.

1519
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
There's something more there.

1520
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
It's not only humans.

1521
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
No, it seems to be a field, some type of field.

1522
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
So it's not a frequency, but some type of instantaneous field

1523
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
where intention is really, really, really strong.

1524
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
And to go back to like the instinctive thing,

1525
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Joe McMonigal talks a lot about that.

1526
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:52,000
He thinks remote viewing or precognition was due to us having to survive.

1527
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And a lot of times, where's the water?

1528
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
You'd go see the shaman and the shaman would tell you where the water is.

1529
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
And the most important, the most powerful person in the tribes,

1530
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
a lot of times, weren't the strongest.

1531
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
They were the most psychic.

1532
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:12,000
According to the lore, when you dive into that sort of rabbit hole,

1533
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:17,000
the kids that have autism and problem to communicate verbally

1534
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:22,000
seems to be more prone to develop those abilities.

1535
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Yeah, like in the telepathy tapes.

1536
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Yes. It makes sense.

1537
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
From my perspective, I remember when I fight someone,

1538
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
when they call it the zone.

1539
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
And once again, it could be deduction or intuition,

1540
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
but sometimes I used to sort of know what the guy is going to do.

1541
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Like I'm in his head and take downs and, you know, it's hard to explain.

1542
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Even though when I was fighting, I sort of do it,

1543
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,000
but I don't know if it's by deduction because I've seen this pattern,

1544
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
but everybody's body is different or it's intuition sort of.

1545
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:11,000
And my question is, which ability is to foresee the future is one,

1546
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
remote viewing is another one to go somewhere, right?

1547
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:19,000
And is there, do they have telepathy, like communication,

1548
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
or do they have telekinese,

1549
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
or what is it exactly proven by pure review in that regard?

1550
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I mean, okay, so there is precognition that has been peer reviewed

1551
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
that you can look at.

1552
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Precognition is the future.

1553
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Exactly.

1554
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
But also remote viewing, there's been a lot of case studies,

1555
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
especially with Dr. Edwin May.

1556
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
He put out like volumes,

1557
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I think two million words he published on the actual tests,

1558
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
giving you the actual tests, what he did, what the results were over time,

1559
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
the wins, the losses, everything.

1560
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And you have it all there.

1561
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
And sometimes it's just incredible when you look at the data itself.

1562
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
You're like, wait a second.

1563
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
It could be a coincidence. It cannot be a coincidence.

1564
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I mean, not, no, the p-value.

1565
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
So statistically, an anomaly.

1566
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
It's okay.

1567
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Yeah, statistically, it's in the millions.

1568
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
It doesn't make sense.

1569
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,000
And this is pure review.

1570
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:22,000
It's undeniable.

1571
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Undeniable, yes.

1572
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Yes, and the work is available.

1573
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I did a whole deep dive onto this stuff.

1574
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
It is available.

1575
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:34,000
But the problem is that when you go towards certain people who are gatekeeping

1576
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
a lot of the parapsychology,

1577
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
what's happening is that the goalposts are shifting with these people.

1578
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So if you say to them, what do I need to do to prove to you that remote viewing is real?

1579
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Okay.

1580
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:52,000
They say, okay, make sure the p-value, so the statistical value, is higher than this.

1581
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
We also want these type of tests done.

1582
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
You say, okay.

1583
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
So they do those tests and then they present them.

1584
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And they're like, here you go.

1585
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
And they go, ah, there must be something wrong.

1586
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
There must be something wrong.

1587
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Do it again.

1588
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
But here, let's make the p-value like this.

1589
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
And then they do it.

1590
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
And they keep shifting these.

1591
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:13,000
And one of the reasons why, I mean, since I met you, it's not a long time ago.

1592
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
It was like two, like a few weeks.

1593
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
That's your fill of expertise.

1594
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:25,000
You're in a way, you're a magician, like a wizard, because that's what you do.

1595
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
You do the shows.

1596
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
So if someone would know, it would be you.

1597
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I remember I watched, you know, James Randi.

1598
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
He used to be, he used to debunk.

1599
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Yes.

1600
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
And he used even himself saying like, hey, I'm a con man, but I will fool you.

1601
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
And you will not know that I fool you because you will be fooled.

1602
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:48,000
And in the same way, if you would be fake, you would know because that's what you do.

1603
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Because of your expertise.

1604
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Yes.

1605
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
You're used to.

1606
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
And there is a lot of fakery.

1607
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Of course.

1608
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Because that's the magic.

1609
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
That's the beauty of a magic trick.

1610
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
But that's perhaps one of the reasons why a lot of people are septic.

1611
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
They're like, yeah, but I've seen this sort of magic trick.

1612
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
But you, you've seen a lot more than an average person.

1613
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
That's your fill of expertise.

1614
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
You dive into this and you believe in it.

1615
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So it's kind of crazy for me to believe that you believe in it.

1616
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Because if someone would know, it would be you.

1617
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
You know what I mean?

1618
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
You work with David Copperfield and all these guys.

1619
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Like, man, you cannot, it doesn't get bigger than this.

1620
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
You know what I mean?

1621
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Yeah.

1622
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
And it's not that I went into it believing.

1623
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
That's the other thing.

1624
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Oh, you did not before.

1625
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
No, of course not.

1626
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Really?

1627
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Yes.

1628
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Of course.

1629
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
That's why I did the whole remote viewing thing.

1630
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I studied remote viewing for a year.

1631
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
We documented the whole process and we were starting to get results that were really,

1632
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
really accurate.

1633
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
And we're like, man, there is something here.

1634
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Hold on.

1635
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
And, and then visiting these people and talking to these physicists and, and going back to,

1636
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I met Joe McManigal.

1637
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I met Ed Dames.

1638
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Yuri Geller I spoke with even.

1639
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Yuri Geller.

1640
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,000
He was debunked, I think, by James Randi.

1641
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
But I would like to hear his side of the story because I only hear one side.

1642
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
It's tough with him.

1643
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Yeah.

1644
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Because he's also a showman.

1645
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
You know, and he does that for a living.

1646
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Yeah.

1647
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:12,000
And you know, he's always played that blurry between the lines thing is like, he wouldn't

1648
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
answer questions like, oh, we're going to use my spoons or like, it was always like

1649
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
some, and magicians know him very well.

1650
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
He's a, he's a known magician among magicians.

1651
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Right.

1652
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:26,000
And so we know, I know how to bend spoons, you know, in a way that makes it look like

1653
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
they're bending on their own through illusion.

1654
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Right.

1655
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Now the question becomes, you know, when you have somebody who can have those power or

1656
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
not those power, sorry, someone who's practiced that ability to make it look like they're

1657
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,000
bending spoons now tell you, but also there's real spoon bending.

1658
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
You're like, then it kind of like makes it muddies up the water where you're like, I

1659
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,000
don't know if I can believe what you're saying now, because you're also showing me tricks

1660
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
and telling me the real, but now you're telling me there's real real.

1661
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,000
And I'm like, that's something I have to try for myself now, because I don't know if I

1662
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
can believe you.

1663
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I've seen, for example, James Randi, when he went to the church pop up, pop off, you

1664
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
know, he was a miracle healer.

1665
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
It was like miracle crusade.

1666
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,000
And he was, he had a mic, you know, and a hair piece.

1667
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And he knew by reading the the prayer of all the faithful before the mess that, oh, I'm

1668
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
sitting in this row.

1669
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I have a cancer.

1670
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:30,000
And he used to be like, Marilyn, sitting in row six, number five, you have like a cancer.

1671
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:37,000
And I will cure like this is insane to use to use that to.

1672
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I mean, I know placebo effect is a real thing, but you're not going to freaking cure cancer

1673
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
with that.

1674
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
But that makes it look very bad.

1675
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:52,000
My question is, when is there a moment that you said you were very septic in the beginning?

1676
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Is there a moment that you were like, holy shit, this thing is real?

1677
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Like, like me in Washington, when they freaking confirm it to me, like, like, like there's

1678
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
something going on and it's it's we cannot explain.

1679
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I don't know what it is, but we cannot explain.

1680
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Is there a moment that it hit you like crazy?

1681
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
There were several moments.

1682
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:18,000
It was a slow burn for me because I was very again, I was very like, OK, I can explain

1683
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
that with coincidence or confirmation bias or like.

1684
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:27,000
But then when I started doing it myself, I started getting really close results and they

1685
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
were pretty consistent.

1686
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Can you explain for like for me or people that are not aware, like how those experience

1687
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:38,000
are made, like in which which context that they're they're like remote viewing.

1688
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Right.

1689
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Yeah.

1690
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
How do you perform this sort of thing?

1691
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:46,000
If someone want to try it at home to see if he you know, if he can do it or.

1692
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Yeah.

1693
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
You would.

1694
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
So first of all, like there's different ways to do it.

1695
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:55,000
The way that we did it was my friend would take an image, a random generated image from

1696
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
the Internet.

1697
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
He would fold it up, put it in an envelope, a sealed envelope and write like a six digit

1698
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
random number on the envelope.

1699
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
He would then give me the six digit number and I start there.

1700
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
So you mean you see the digit?

1701
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Yeah, I see the numbers and the digit is linked to an image that you do not see.

1702
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Correct.

1703
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
OK, OK.

1704
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Yeah.

1705
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
And so that's all I have.

1706
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
And so you're not trying to decipher what that number is.

1707
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
It just gives you a point of reference non-locally to the image.

1708
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
It could be anything.

1709
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Yeah.

1710
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And you have no clue of what it is.

1711
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
No.

1712
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
OK.

1713
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Yeah.

1714
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
No, I don't know.

1715
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:34,000
So it could be a bumblebee to a bicycle to the CN tower to somebody playing soccer.

1716
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Like it's really anything.

1717
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
OK.

1718
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
And you would then there's like a series.

1719
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And this was taught.

1720
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I learned the method that was like kind of taught in the CIA, which is like sort of this

1721
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
controlled remote viewing where you have different stages.

1722
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
So stage one, two, three, four, five, etc.

1723
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
And stage one, you would scribble like this little ideogram.

1724
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
It's like a little scribble.

1725
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Then you would describe that.

1726
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
And then after that, you would go into descriptors.

1727
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
And so now we're talking, what do you perceive?

1728
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
So when you're in this calm state, you're just trying to perceive things.

1729
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,000
So you're calming your mind and you're like, what do I smell?

1730
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
What do I see?

1731
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
What does it feel like?

1732
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
What's the texture?

1733
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Is there a sound?

1734
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Is there a movement?

1735
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Is there an energy?

1736
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Is there a feeling?

1737
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
What's the gestalt?

1738
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Like, what is this?

1739
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Does this feel like an open space?

1740
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Does this feel like a building or a life form?

1741
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,000
And you would just kind of like perceive and just go on intuition and just kind of like

1742
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
and just go and just not even think about it.

1743
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Just start drawing stuff.

1744
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
We start writing all these things down first.

1745
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
You're just describing windy steel metal taste of metal.

1746
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I feel this like fuzzy.

1747
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Also this warmth and like you don't write the you don't do the image.

1748
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
You write words.

1749
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
You're just writing.

1750
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
You're writing descriptions of like what this feels like.

1751
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And you're going, going, going.

1752
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
And after that, when you're like, OK, now you go into drawing.

1753
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Now you're like, OK.

1754
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
And you're not trying to draw something specific.

1755
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
You're just drawing what your perception is.

1756
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
You're kind of like just going with it.

1757
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Because the last thing you want to do is we call this AOL, analytical overlay.

1758
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:11,000
You don't want like if I have yellow, black, fuzzy, buzzing, now I want to think Bumblebee.

1759
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Right.

1760
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
And that's a bad thing to do.

1761
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
So you don't want to.

1762
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
But automatically your brain will go to Bumblebee.

1763
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Yeah.

1764
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
And that's an AOL.

1765
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
By deduction.

1766
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Exactly.

1767
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
You want that out of the way.

1768
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
So you'll write Bumblebee as an AOL just to kind of like get it out of your mind and keep going.

1769
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
And when you're drawing, it's hard to do.

1770
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,000
But like what you can.

1771
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I'm sorry.

1772
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
When you say Bumblebee, AOL, you put AOL next to it to know that is scratch.

1773
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Exactly.

1774
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
OK.

1775
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Sorry.

1776
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Yes.

1777
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
You would just sometimes just get it out of the way.

1778
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
But other times it would keep coming back.

1779
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
And you're like, OK, it's something there.

1780
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
And it would turn out to be a Bumblebee.

1781
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
You know, so it's like hard to really discern what was what.

1782
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And then you go into more descriptors after that.

1783
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
And after you're done, you pretty much end your session.

1784
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
You take out the photo and you look at the data and you try to compare and then you evaluate.

1785
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:01,000
We give ourselves a score on zero to ten on how close we were.

1786
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I don't think I ever gave myself above seven because I'm very much confirmation biased.

1787
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,000
And I'm like, you know, so we would look at it together and try it.

1788
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
But sometimes you're like, man, like, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

1789
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,000
And there wasn't one thing I wrote down that wasn't part of the image.

1790
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
You know, and then you're like, I could have said like this could have been anything.

1791
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Yeah.

1792
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
So when that happens over and over.

1793
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
And by the way, you're while you're doing it, you're like sometimes like this is like not while you're doing it.

1794
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:34,000
But right after you're done, when you're about to open the envelope, you go so silly.

1795
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Yeah.

1796
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
This is going to be all wrong.

1797
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Yeah.

1798
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
I'm going to look like such an idiot when this is opened.

1799
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
And then you open it.

1800
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
You go, oh, my God.

1801
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
And it really shocks you.

1802
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
It's like a magic trick that you did yourself.

1803
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Wow.

1804
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:52,000
And this whole thing, how long it takes, for example, if you want to do the experiment at home with 20 minutes, maybe.

1805
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
OK, so everybody can make an exit.

1806
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And how do you differ, for example, like I don't know the exact term in English.

1807
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
You know, when you look at a cloud, it's paradox.

1808
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:11,000
You make you make something out of the cloud that looks like how do you differ from the word you wrote down or sort of.

1809
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
But it could have been anything.

1810
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
How do you defer that like to.

1811
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
So that's that's where the confirmation bias comes in.

1812
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:25,000
OK, that's where you have to like sort of like look at things really objectively and be like, is like, OK, that could have been that I could have been that.

1813
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
But sometimes it's very specific.

1814
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Perhaps you need to give it to someone that is outside of the experiment and see if he makes that connection.

1815
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Right.

1816
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Normally, that's what they did at SRI during the Stargate project.

1817
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
What would happen?

1818
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
What would happen?

1819
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:54,000
And this is really interesting, too, is a whole study on this as well, because they don't know whether you're actually perceiving the target or you're perceiving the image of the target.

1820
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
So the image of the target.

1821
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Yeah. So so what they're what they're thinking is that because time behaves very differently, too.

1822
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:13,000
And so a lot of these like Stargate people, 90 percent of their remote viewing things that they did for these like 17 out of the 19 agencies.

1823
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Star Stargate is the the program, the program by the CIA that was in the 70s.

1824
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Right. Yep. OK.

1825
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:28,000
70s and 80s and 17 of the 19 intelligence agencies of the United States used the Stargate program at one point.

1826
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
All right. Some of them came back over 100 times.

1827
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:36,000
There was five hundred and five individual missions done over the 17 out of the 19 agencies with Stargate in 20 years.

1828
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
So we know and Joint Task Force was one of the big ones, FBI.

1829
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
And so there's a lot of like people using this stuff.

1830
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:49,000
The thing is, the the people doing this, the remote viewers, they would never be getting the target.

1831
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
They would never know because it creates a feedback loop.

1832
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
So they don't know if they did well.

1833
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
No way.

1834
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Yeah. Because first of all, it's a top secret.

1835
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
So you can't you can't be briefed on it.

1836
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
No freaking way.

1837
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
And so they would do it.

1838
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And the only way that they knew that it was successful is that this agency came back for a different mission.

1839
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
No freaking way.

1840
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
And again and again and again.

1841
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Yeah. Because they they know that if even if you see the target 30 years later.

1842
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Right. Yeah.

1843
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
And finally, you get to see that remote viewing session you did back in the 70s.

1844
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Now you've changed it.

1845
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Now you've created a feedback loop to where were you remote viewing the moment you looked at the target in the future?

1846
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Or were you remote viewing the event?

1847
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Right.

1848
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
So it's a very strange.

1849
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Are you kidding me?

1850
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:42,000
It's very strange because there have been times with Angela Ford, one time they asked her like, hey, OK, here's the target.

1851
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Whatever.

1852
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,000
She starts drawing like this big drum, sort of like the circle and this and that, like all these.

1853
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
And she's like, it's a water purification plant.

1854
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:57,000
And she's like, here's the diameter and she's meters of diameter of things and everything is like perfectly laid out.

1855
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
And then she goes, yeah, water.

1856
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
And they're like, sorry.

1857
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
No, it's a water park.

1858
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
They're like, close.

1859
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
You got close to water park.

1860
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
And then she's like, something doesn't sit well with me.

1861
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
They started doing research.

1862
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Well, 50 years before that water park was there, it was a water purification plant.

1863
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
They pulled up a picture.

1864
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:23,000
The picture of the water purification plant matched her remote viewing almost one for one in size and everything.

1865
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
You could almost lay it over.

1866
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
That's how close it was.

1867
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:34,000
So now they're thinking, OK, did you go back in time and remote view or did you go forward in time and see the picture that we that we pulled up?

1868
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Oh, my God.

1869
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Very strange.

1870
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Oh, my God.

1871
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Yes.

1872
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
That's crazy.

1873
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I mean, so it becomes that's a lot of times like.

1874
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Wow.

1875
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Remote viewers like Joe McManigal did not want to see the target ever, ever, ever.

1876
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Yeah, it will affect.

1877
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Yeah. Yes.

1878
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
He always said that always.

1879
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
He was very stern.

1880
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Never show me.

1881
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Never tell me anything.

1882
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
They know some of them were very successful, like Ego Swan.

1883
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Joe McManigal is one.

1884
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I think is he the only one alive now that is from that Stargate, right?

1885
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
From the original.

1886
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Yeah.

1887
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:16,000
And the reason like, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but the reason why they started this program in the first place is because during the Cold War, they found out the Russians were doing it.

1888
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:27,000
The Russians because the Russian learned something from the German, perhaps that they were doing before the during the Second World War before the Second World War.

1889
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,000
So they want to get that knowledge and the American like, hey, they start doing it.

1890
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
We got to do it, too.

1891
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Right.

1892
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Yep. Yep.

1893
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Pretty much exactly.

1894
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
The Russians leaked purposely.

1895
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:50,000
It was thought information about experiments they did with rats to where they would they tattooed all these rats and then they tried to predict which rat would die first.

1896
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
They put them up in mountains and whatever.

1897
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
And it was it was very, very accurate.

1898
01:53:54,000 --> 01:54:02,000
But turns out and Joe McManigal talks about this that it was the guy who tattooed the rats that was actually psychic because it was the order that he tattooed them in.

1899
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Very bizarre test, but they that's what initially got leaked.

1900
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:13,000
But yeah, those psionic type programs existed before Stargate.

1901
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
You know, there was Center Lane, Grill Flame, Sunstreak.

1902
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,000
These were all psychic programs.

1903
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
It's you think it continues till this day.

1904
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Yes, yes.

1905
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
That's what I've been told.

1906
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:42,000
And wow, do you think I mean, one of the reason it's not public, it's because they don't want everybody to know about it because it could be used as a weapon if it's in the wrong hand.

1907
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:49,000
If someone becomes very good at it, I mean, it could be like the implication of this is pretty freaking crazy.

1908
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I mean, imagine imagine if it turns out to someone can enhance that power and be very good at it.

1909
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Like, I mean, what's that?

1910
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
What what can you do with it?

1911
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Yeah. And you can know where the secret base are.

1912
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I mean, I know. I mean, according to the law, certain certain peoples have been used to locate certain bases and people like other people as well for for extraction.

1913
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I mean, and those people that have done that work, they never knew, for example, for the American, they never knew if their result were good or not.

1914
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Not so sometimes because they would have to like for certain exceptions.

1915
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
But normally, no, normally like 95 percent.

1916
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And the main reason isn't because of the feedback loop is also a reason.

1917
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
But the main reason was because the they were classified projects.

1918
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:51,000
So like the CIA or let's say, I don't know, Joint Task Force, they would, you know, be trying to intercept the drug cartel coming in through the coast.

1919
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:58,000
And the Joint Task Force came back, I think, one hundred and forty one times with new missions.

1920
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Wow. Because apparently they were intercepting a lot of drug boats, really using remote viewers.

1921
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Yeah, but that is crazy.

1922
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I mean, man, I want to believe Chris, I really want to.

1923
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:15,000
And it's just like there's a thing in my brain that bullshit bullshit.

1924
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:23,000
But man, I it's hard to to have an argument when you have these results, you know, like when they come back and they ask.

1925
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I mean, there's a reason why.

1926
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:32,000
But until someone does not like use like a Star Wars, the force, you know what I mean?

1927
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
But even that I remain a little bit septic.

1928
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,000
And even if you would do that to me, I would be like, man, this freaking guy is a wizard.

1929
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:43,000
He's got a trick and like there's like a rope connected or it's hard.

1930
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,000
And then the same time, I believe.

1931
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I mean, according to the to the law, if you dive into that rabbit hole, I think there's a lot of disinformation campaign surrounding U.A.P.'s psionic stuff.

1932
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Right. I think there is because the the the organization that they use these things that works on on it, they don't want everybody to have access to it.

1933
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Right. So they perhaps use this information campaign to discrete state.

1934
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Oh, yeah. The validity of the one that are real.

1935
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Right. Correct. One hundred percent. You don't want to put that past them.

1936
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
It's they are the smartest intelligence agencies.

1937
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
You know, it's they have all the money.

1938
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
The military has all the money.

1939
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:38,000
And they're going right to, you know, out of university, grabbing mental level geniuses and grabbing like, you know, the best Ivy League intelligence people at a school and recruiting them into these three letter agencies.

1940
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Of course, you know, they got the smartest people working on this.

1941
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
And their whole job is to figure out every variable.

1942
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Right. So like every scenario possible.

1943
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Like they I guarantee you they've got probably a dozen doomsday scenarios of what if zombies, you know, like they have everything.

1944
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Right. So for sure, anything we speculate, they've probably thought of.

1945
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
We're not faster than them. Yeah.

1946
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I mean, talking to to Lazar, Lou Elizondo and all the guys I've met during my my my trip in Washington.

1947
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:15,000
One thing they a lot of them told me is that everything is very comfort, comfort mentalized.

1948
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Yes. So nobody really know the old the entire picture.

1949
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I mean, there must be someone.

1950
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I mean, one thing I've I've I've been told is like the last president to have been brief on on this matter is George Bush, senior.

1951
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Yeah. Because he was the head of CIA.

1952
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:39,000
But after that, because a president in the United States, for example, is the most powerful man on a hurt.

1953
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:44,000
People say he's really but he come in and goes every four years.

1954
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
So if they tell him everything, maybe he's going to spill the bean.

1955
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Like it's also for a security reason.

1956
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,000
You know, like you never know if he you know, mental illness, you become crazy.

1957
01:58:54,000 --> 01:59:05,000
You just say out loud the secret that that protect North America or, you know, the United States or also a plausible deniability.

1958
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Yeah. So there's a reason they don't tell the president because if something comes out and the president during a press conference, they go, hey, what about UAPs?

1959
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,000
He has to lie now in front of people.

1960
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Right. So it's better to not tell him because he has plausible deniability.

1961
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,000
He can say, I didn't know if anything goes wrong.

1962
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
God, man, I want to believe.

1963
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
But, man, it's hard.

1964
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
It's hard until you don't have the perfect evidence.

1965
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
But I want to believe, man.

1966
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
I really that's a problem.

1967
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I want to believe.

1968
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
But that does not make it true.

1969
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:43,000
You know, sometimes when you want something to happen, you see it from your your perceptions linked everything towards that.

1970
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:47,000
But that doesn't mean it's really what is happening.

1971
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
God, I really want to believe.

1972
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:57,000
And one guy I would I mean, because of the war, I might be point point out by the finger saying this, but fuck it.

1973
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
I'm going to say one guy I would like to ask the question.

1974
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:06,000
And I think one person that would know the most most of this answer is maybe Vladimir Putin.

1975
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Oh, yeah. Is the is in the KGB.

1976
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Yes. I think you would know if there's someone that knows a lot about this.

1977
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
So that would be him. Yes.

1978
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:20,000
One hundred percent. And I can promise you, if I ever meet him, I will ask him the question.

1979
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:25,000
I will even if I look like an idiot and, you know, I would freaking do it.

1980
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
And I don't know if I will be able to say what he told me.

1981
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:39,000
You know, if I have a chance, man, that would be like if I meet someone like like like him, I would freaking ask him like like I would say, can I can I talk to you for a second one on one?

1982
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I will. Maybe he's not going to say it to me with the truth or maybe he will thinking that, oh, I'm going to say it to him.

1983
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Because even if he comes out public, it's like maybe like the guys in Washington, maybe that's the way they were thinking.

1984
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Explaining to me the whole thing is like, oh, if he come out public and say everything that we told him, he's going to hurt his credibility.

1985
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So he's not going to say it regardless.

1986
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
You know, unless he's a fool, you know. Yeah.

1987
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Or maybe it softens the blow. Maybe it's like, oh, let him say it first.

1988
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Yeah, but man, I'm not the one who's going to say it now.

1989
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Now the people are going to think I'm brain damaged big time if I you know what I mean.

1990
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
But that's fascinating.

1991
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Putin definitely knows, by the way.

1992
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,000
And so does and so does senior president of China as well.

1993
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
And these guys have been in power for too long.

1994
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
The president of China, you think? Oh, absolutely.

1995
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:34,000
So Putin, the president of China, is George George Bush senior still alive?

1996
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Right. I don't think so.

1997
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Is he? I'm sorry for my. I don't even know.

1998
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
That's a good question. I'm not sure if he would.

1999
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
He would maybe know. Is George Bush senior still alive?

2000
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
We're both Canadian, so we can be forgiven on.

2001
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
No, he had 2018. Yeah.

2002
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:55,000
You know, Paul Elyar, the former minister of Canada.

2003
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Yeah, he came out publicly saying crazy claims.

2004
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I mean, this is this is a fact. He says that we're not alone.

2005
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,000
There's even like 60 freaking insane.

2006
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Like did he lost his mind or is he does he has strong evidence or he says that he what?

2007
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Man, it's hard to know now.

2008
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
But, man, there's a lot of credible people that came out publicly.

2009
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,000
One of the Israeli.

2010
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
I'm a shed. I'm a shed.

2011
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Yeah. Like, what is his position?

2012
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
He was the Israeli space in charge of the Israeli Israeli space program.

2013
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,000
He was the he's the father of the Israeli space programs.

2014
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:44,000
He put up 13 satellites into space and he was awarded the highest awards by military and and civilian awards for some of his things.

2015
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,000
And the awards that he got in the military side are classified.

2016
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,000
We don't know why he got those awards, but he got the awards.

2017
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
We don't know what the awards are for. So he's a credible source.

2018
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,000
And what did he say exactly? He says that there's a Galactic Federation.

2019
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Yeah. It's like Star Wars.

2020
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Paul Hellyer said the same thing.

2021
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
And now, you know, who knows?

2022
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Because the other thing is that we have to understand is that there are people who are fascinated with this topic that work in the government, too.

2023
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Right. So they're human.

2024
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:20,000
These people, you know, there are some people who want to believe that are in government.

2025
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
These people are perfect.

2026
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:29,000
So, you know, when I think of like even Stargate, there was General I'm forgetting his name.

2027
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:34,000
He was a stubble bind and he loved the remote viewing stuff.

2028
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:44,000
He was like, you know, but he loved it too much to where they were like, all right, we're going to make you retire now because it's like you're going in too deep.

2029
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,000
You want to believe too much. And now there's this bias.

2030
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
It affects your judgment.

2031
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:55,000
So I am a shed is friends with Yuri Geller, very close friends.

2032
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Right. So in my head, I instantly that's a bit of a red flag for me, even though Yuri Geller, some of the claims he has, I believe could be true.

2033
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:15,000
I still think that there's this sensationalist ideology that might exist here that might skew a little bit of the information that they're that they're given.

2034
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:20,000
And because they're in a position where we would trust them, they can say anything.

2035
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
And now we kind of take it as the word. Right.

2036
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:34,000
And I think we need to be careful with that, too, because I think in our government, especially especially in the Republican side of the government, there's a lot of faith based culture.

2037
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Yes. And so dangerous. Yeah.

2038
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:44,000
And so, you know, when you're talking about NHI and all of this, you know, it gets to a place where some of them want to believe more than others.

2039
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Yeah. And we just have to be aware of that, too.

2040
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:50,000
So it's like, yes, on one hand, it's very hard to get clean information. Yeah.

2041
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Which is why I think the best thing that we can do, you and I and the people watching is try these things for ourselves.

2042
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Try remote viewing. Try out a body experiences.

2043
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Go into a field and try to see E5, a UFO or, you know, do these experiences yourself, because no matter what I tell you, no matter how much data I show you or what type of trick I can do for you.

2044
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
It's not going to convince you unless you see it yourself.

2045
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:24,000
One of the arguments that a lot of scientists will say to counter the existence of NHI non-human intelligence, that would be like, oh, where are the evidence?

2046
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
The cell phone? I'm like, there's freaking tons of it, bro.

2047
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:36,000
There's tons of video that people film the orbs, but all those videos, they're not clear.

2048
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Like, they're not like, if I would film you like this, like they're sort of blurry.

2049
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Or if you look at the UFO, most of the time you see the edges sort of blurry and the explanation, according to ufologists, they would say, oh, it's because the distortion of space and time in which these vehicles are, you know,

2050
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:02,000
are functioning with, I'm like, shit, I want it to be true, man.

2051
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,000
I will continue my quest in the pursuit of truth.

2052
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:11,000
But frick, man, it's hard to know. It's hard to...

2053
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
It's fun.

2054
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Oh, it's fun. It's a lot of fun.

2055
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:29,000
But talking to a lot of the people in that field through all these years, I mean, apparently there's two schools of thought.

2056
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:36,000
There's a group of people that really want full disclosure on that matter because they're concerned.

2057
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,000
They have kids. They're concerned about the future.

2058
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,000
And a lot of the guy in Washington have thought they want full disclosure.

2059
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:55,000
And there is another group, apparently, too, that do not want disclosure because a lot of people, they harm a lot of people and they will be accounted for a lot of the pain, a lot of the things they've done.

2060
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:07,000
And I hope it's not the case, but maybe we will have to wait until those people that are accounted for the harm they've done passed out before we move to a full disclosure.

2061
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
I don't know, but...

2062
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Yeah, like there's the cover-up is covering up the crimes.

2063
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Yes, like a little bit like the JFK file that soon will be probably public.

2064
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:28,000
They say one of the arguments, I think, is Trump's was saying is he needs to wait that all the people passed out because a lot of harm has been done.

2065
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,000
But you don't want to tarnish the reputation of a living person.

2066
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:35,000
You want to wait that it's finished until you... I mean, is it true or not?

2067
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:39,000
You also have the families of those people, like the Bush family is still around.

2068
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:44,000
I don't know if it's Trump who said it or if it's someone that said it, that he said it.

2069
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Like, that's the consensus on it.

2070
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
But is it the same thing with disclosure?

2071
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Because if you dive into this thing and from what I've learned, a lot of people got hurt, man.

2072
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:59,000
They did a lot of bad stuff to acquire knowledge and control.

2073
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,000
And if the whole thing is real, it's freaking dark, man.

2074
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Yeah, dark, scary.

2075
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:13,000
I mean, the one thing I always come back to that always kind of glitches in my head is the people who want to know want everyone to know.

2076
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,000
And then the people who know want no one to know.

2077
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:26,000
So if I take that information, I look at it, and I'm like, what is so bad about the information that once you understand what it is, you don't want anyone else to know about it?

2078
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,000
And that's a scary thought experiment to be like, damn, what could that be?

2079
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:38,000
And you know what I keep thinking back to and more and more as this goes on is like, do you see Three Body Problem?

2080
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
No.

2081
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:45,000
So Three Body Problem is a book that they did, which eventually turned into a Netflix thing.

2082
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:51,000
And it's the idea that this civilization that is far away receives a signal.

2083
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:58,000
And it's kind of like the alone in the forest theory where like, you don't want to make noise in the forest.

2084
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Because if a predator sees you, he's going to come towards you.

2085
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
And that's kind of what happened.

2086
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,000
And now they send us a message saying like, all right, you got 40 years and we'll be there in 40 years.

2087
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
We're on our way.

2088
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Yeah.

2089
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:18,000
And now we've got 40 years to figure this problem out before they get here and advance our tech and like, you know, I mean, it's all science fiction, but who knows?

2090
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Look, man, there's something attached to this that a lot of the people that study that phenomenon believe that since the invention and the detonation of the atomic bomb,

2091
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:40,000
a lot of the sensitive military installation and even a lot of the guys confirmed it.

2092
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:48,000
They think that a lot of the sensitive military installation that contain nuclear weapons are monitored by these things.

2093
02:09:48,000 --> 02:10:06,000
And apparently, according to a report, like a real report, they have the capability, these UAP, to shut it off or shut it, put it on as they wish to control remotely on and off switch.

2094
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Like these freaking installation.

2095
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:13,000
That is fucking crazy, man, if it turns out to be true.

2096
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I mean, the report are there.

2097
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
It's supposed to be in Russia and America.

2098
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
And that's the thing in a court of law.

2099
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,000
This would be enough to be an evidence for it to be true.

2100
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:29,000
But because that subject is so stigmatized, man, it's so crazy.

2101
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
There's even an agreement between Russia and America.

2102
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Pull this up with Lou.

2103
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
We looked at it.

2104
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
There's an agreement.

2105
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
There's all sorts of agreements.

2106
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Like if they start their nuclear thing, like they have to let us know.

2107
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
There's like this whole thing.

2108
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:54,000
And on one of the stipulations, it says they have to call each other if ever an unidentified object is picked up on radar because they don't want to mistake it for an attack.

2109
02:10:54,000 --> 02:11:01,000
So if it says for any unidentified objects, like they have to like pick up the phone and be like, was that you?

2110
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
And they're like, no, that was not.

2111
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
So like, OK, it was a UFO, kind of like scratch that off.

2112
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
So like, it's been a problem for them, apparently.

2113
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I would just put it out there.

2114
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I mean, if there's a disclosure coming up publicly, as a public figure, I'm ready to say what I know.

2115
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
You know what I mean?

2116
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Because I don't have, you know, I'm just a freaking former retired athlete.

2117
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:39,000
You know, I'm not an astrophysicist, but to make the subject more volatile for people to bring eyeballs on the subject, I'm ready to, you know what I mean?

2118
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
To help disclosure, because I think it's important.

2119
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I think it could change the world for the best.

2120
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:59,000
But I'm not ready to go by myself in the front line because, man, if you do that, your credibility, everything will be attacked like freaking crazy.

2121
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:07,000
And I still don't know for a fact, what I've heard and learned, did they mess up with me?

2122
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Is it a freaking joke?

2123
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Because people make jokes sometimes or whatever.

2124
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:16,000
You know, like, it's a very interesting thing, man.

2125
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
But I really love to dive into it.

2126
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:33,000
And it's, man, I really hope, and according to a lot of people I've talked, and I'm sure you did in our living, there will be, we will have undiable proof that there's something.

2127
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
And I just can't wait this to happen.

2128
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Maybe even sooner than later.

2129
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I think so.

2130
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,000
George, I have one last thing we're going to do here.

2131
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Well, two last things.

2132
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
I would love for you to sign these books in a second.

2133
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Of course.

2134
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
And we're going to do some giveaways.

2135
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,000
One of them is for me and then two of them is for the audience here.

2136
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:54,000
But before we get into that, we have Patreon members or members.

2137
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Of course.

2138
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,000
We call them interns.

2139
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Yes.

2140
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
And we let them ask, so I choose three questions.

2141
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Oh, sure, for sure.

2142
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
And we're going to pull it up here.

2143
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Give me a second.

2144
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
I have to turn this camera on back here.

2145
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
All right.

2146
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Thank you.

2147
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
All right.

2148
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:16,000
So the first question we have here is a picture.

2149
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
A secret tunnel is his handle.

2150
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,000
And it's going to come up behind me.

2151
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:30,000
In your research in archaeology, have you found anything resembling giant humanoids?

2152
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Well, there's a lot of text that talks about it like the Anunnaki, the Nephilim, even in

2153
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Christianity.

2154
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Is it true or not?

2155
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:51,000
I want it to be true, but just because I want it doesn't make it true.

2156
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:54,000
It's all about an interpretation.

2157
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:59,000
If you look at the Sumerian text, there's different interpretation.

2158
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:05,000
There's one interpretation made by Zechariah Sitchin that talks about the Anunnaki that

2159
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:13,000
he believes that there was a race of aliens that were giant that engineered us.

2160
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
And it's in a nutshell.

2161
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
That's what he believes.

2162
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:24,000
But he was attacked by a lot of people.

2163
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
And a lot of people tried to debunk him.

2164
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,000
And some of the things he said turns out to be...

2165
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Some of the things he says, it's hard to dismiss.

2166
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Now in the future, it turns out to be real.

2167
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Like the asteroid belt and the formation of the Tiamat, Marduk.

2168
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:49,000
So it's hard to defer what is real, what is not.

2169
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
What is an interpretation?

2170
02:14:53,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I wanted to believe, but yeah, it's a trend among certain ancient texts.

2171
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:08,000
The interpretation of certain ancient texts that maybe once upon a time it was like a giant.

2172
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,000
But I think we need to have our strong evidence.

2173
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:18,000
I know there's a lot of things online that says they found bones of giant.

2174
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,000
But man, why is it hidden?

2175
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Yeah, where is that?

2176
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Yeah, man, why don't you put it out?

2177
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
And there's a conspiracy like, oh, they hide it.

2178
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I mean, I don't know.

2179
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Well, there's the Afghan giant.

2180
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Remember that story?

2181
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
They're the soldier.

2182
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Yeah, they all have red hair.

2183
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,000
They shot down this 13-foot tall, apparently killed one with a spear.

2184
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
And then they just mowed him down and helicoptered him out.

2185
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:47,000
What was interesting about that is that, first of all, it happened in a modern era.

2186
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:54,000
And there were a lot of people that came out on Coast to Coast AM talking about that they've seen it,

2187
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
which is like military people, which is interesting.

2188
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:00,000
But again, like you said, give us a picture, give us something.

2189
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Give us something, man.

2190
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Why there's no freaking strong evidence?

2191
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
You know what I mean?

2192
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I don't know what to make of it.

2193
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:18,000
I don't want to be the first to go publicly saying, oh, I believe in it or not, because I don't.

2194
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:21,000
I think I'm very septic.

2195
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,000
I entertain the idea of it.

2196
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:29,000
It would be cool, but I don't fully believe in it.

2197
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
I mean, it's interesting.

2198
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
I read a lot about it.

2199
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:36,000
It's not something that when I see an article about it, it's not something that I'm like, oh, it's bullshit.

2200
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
I like to read it just to amuse me.

2201
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
And then I'm like, it's interesting.

2202
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,000
I keep it in the back of my head, but I don't fully believe it.

2203
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
And I don't reject it either.

2204
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
I just put it on the side.

2205
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
You know what I mean?

2206
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,000
That's the healthiest way, I think, to approach a lot of this thing.

2207
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:56,000
I think a lot of people could learn from that because being extreme one way or the other is no good.

2208
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Staying in a relatively realistic ideology, I think that's probably...

2209
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
I agree.

2210
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
All right.

2211
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:09,000
We have next here Maverick Star.

2212
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
We talked about this.

2213
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:14,000
So this is an interesting question.

2214
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
You actually had mentioned this.

2215
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
So I guess we've already answered this.

2216
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:23,000
But have you ever felt as if you knew what was going to happen in a fight before it did?

2217
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Yes.

2218
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Sometimes in fights when you're in the zone and being in the zone is not too much.

2219
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,000
It's not too much being too much focus.

2220
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Because if you're too focused, you lose how much time there is on the clock.

2221
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:50,000
You lose what your coach are saying to you because they have a different perspective.

2222
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
And it's important to hear.

2223
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,000
You lose also because I speak English.

2224
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
I speak a little bit of Portuguese and Spanish.

2225
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I can understand sometimes like the basic.

2226
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Yes.

2227
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:05,000
So it's an advantage for me because they don't understand me, but I understand them.

2228
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:10,000
So I know when they say, for example, for example, I'm on the ground.

2229
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Cotovel is an elbow or a shaft of brass, like an armbar.

2230
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I know when they're calling something, they're going to try something.

2231
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I know before it comes.

2232
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:27,000
So is it because it's deduction?

2233
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:34,000
When you're in the states of flow, you don't want to be, like I said, too focused because you miss those cues.

2234
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:39,000
And you don't want to be too distracted because you can get caught with something you don't see coming.

2235
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
You want to be in the flow zone.

2236
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I don't know if it's because of it.

2237
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Do you feel it though?

2238
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I feel it, but I have no evidence to prove you.

2239
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:54,000
It's an intuition more than a deduction.

2240
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:05,000
You know, it's interesting because I felt when I'm in that state, the best of that state, it's when my fighters flight,

2241
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:13,000
when I'm the most afraid because it triggers something very basic to my core.

2242
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Maybe it links to the reason why the psionic team, apparently they try to recruit kids that are autism,

2243
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:30,000
that don't have the ability to speak and that are in a very poor and dangerous environment.

2244
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Maybe after a disaster, that's why they recruit those.

2245
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Maybe that's the case because I know that when I'm scared and it triggers something survival, I get into that state better.

2246
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:51,000
So that's why when I say I'm not afraid to admit that I'm afraid, it's because I know that my fear will enhance me and I embrace it.

2247
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Some people, the fear, it paralyzes them.

2248
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Me, I'm like, I fucking love it.

2249
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:01,000
I don't love it, but I know I need it to be at my best, so I embrace it.

2250
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
That's so sick.

2251
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:10,000
That's all you need to think when you go into a fight because you need to learn how to control it.

2252
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,000
That's really interesting.

2253
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
I could talk about this for forever.

2254
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:26,000
During remote viewing stuff and even psionic stuff, Jake Barber talked about a way to shortcut the psionic is to add trauma.

2255
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
So to put you in a state of fear.

2256
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
So he mentioned that.

2257
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Really?

2258
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Yes, absolutely.

2259
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
That could be interesting.

2260
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
His interview with Jesse Michaels.

2261
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Oh yeah, he said the fighter's flight thing.

2262
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
They would induce fear.

2263
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:46,000
They would induce, actively give them drugs to be more afraid and then calm them and then play this line.

2264
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Because maybe the reptilian part of your brain kicks in.

2265
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
And has access to the survival.

2266
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:58,000
And sometimes in order to survive, you have to know what's going to happen a second in the future.

2267
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,000
And so that's kind of where they're trying to tap into.

2268
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:08,000
From remote viewing, all of the most successful remote viewings happened when it was human life at stake.

2269
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Or when there was like a large amount of entropy, big change.

2270
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:17,000
So that's why they would have a really easy time finding nukes with this stuff.

2271
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:22,000
So it's almost like the universe wants you to survive.

2272
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,000
And you are the universe.

2273
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:29,000
So you're tapping into that to help you survive, help you evolve, help you see forward a little bit.

2274
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:37,000
And they give you that edge of probability on that quantum scale to help you get to that next level that you want to get to.

2275
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
So it's very, very small.

2276
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:42,000
But I mean, I think nonetheless.

2277
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
That's a very interesting theory.

2278
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,000
I mean, if you believe in that stuff, it makes sense.

2279
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:52,000
I mean, I wanted to believe and I wanted to be true.

2280
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:57,000
And maybe that's one of the reasons I was doing so well in my career.

2281
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
You tapped into this.

2282
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:00,000
I tapped into this.

2283
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Or maybe it's because by pure hard work and training, I've seen devil's pattern and I was by deduction.

2284
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Like an AI type of...

2285
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:10,000
But maybe it's something else.

2286
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I don't have the answer.

2287
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
I've done it, but I don't have the answer.

2288
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,000
And I wish I could.

2289
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
And I want to learn more about it too.

2290
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:23,000
You know, like I told you, like to tap into this thing if it is the case, if there is something to it.

2291
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Yeah.

2292
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
And that's the best thing to do too is check it out for yourself.

2293
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Last question here.

2294
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,000
And I think this is by...

2295
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
I think I forget K.

2296
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
I forget your name.

2297
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:41,000
But I don't think there was enough room on the split flap.

2298
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:47,000
It says, is information or alternative theories being suppressed in the mainstream archeology community?

2299
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I think so.

2300
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
And the reason is...

2301
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Let's talk about Gobekli Tepe.

2302
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Okay.

2303
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
It's...

2304
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Now they know it's at least like almost...

2305
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:03,000
It's 11, 600 or 12...

2306
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I mean, around 12,000 years ago.

2307
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Before that, before it was discovered, it was to the mind of archeologists,

2308
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:22,000
it was impossible that Antargetter could build these sort of things.

2309
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Because in their mind, they needed to have agriculture to settle themselves,

2310
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:33,000
to have abundance of food before they can do certain things like this.

2311
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Like Gobekli Tepe, it's an incredible site.

2312
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,000
It's pillars with carvings of animals.

2313
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:46,000
It's an alignment, an astronomical alignment.

2314
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
That is unbelievable.

2315
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I think a big part of it is still not uncovered yet.

2316
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:55,000
So we don't know what it is, what the full thing, the full site look like.

2317
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:03,000
But from what they have discovered, it changes everything that we knew about our ancestor.

2318
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:10,000
So in the mainstream, if all your life you spend time to follow one narrative,

2319
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:16,000
and now out of sudden, boom, the whole thing changes.

2320
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:26,000
If you attach certain emotion to what you read,

2321
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:33,000
it could be bad because you're attached to that truth, and now that truth is no longer real.

2322
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:40,000
And I think a lot of, not all, but I think certain maybe archeologists could have an issue

2323
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:51,000
detaching emotionally from an ideology that they've been fed all their career.

2324
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:55,000
And you have to accept the fact that, shit, there's something new, now we need to change.

2325
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:00,000
I know that a good archeologist do that.

2326
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:06,000
The one, they do it, they go only with facts, fact check.

2327
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
They attach no emotion because it's only an idea.

2328
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:15,000
If you've been taught something and you teach it and you found out it's wrong,

2329
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:18,000
it takes a lot of ego.

2330
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:23,000
You have to work on your ego telling, hey, finally what I taught you is wrong.

2331
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:27,000
We learned recently that this is what happened.

2332
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:37,000
I mean, there's a lot of emotion and money linked into that story.

2333
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:43,000
So when something changed the old paradigm, it shaped up a lot of people.

2334
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Same thing with Clovis first.

2335
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:53,000
In archeology, before, they thought that humans, it was a false point.

2336
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:58,000
At the point of the spear, they thought human came in only a few thousand years in America.

2337
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Then they found out, oh, you got pushed back by the Clovis.

2338
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Now they know that Clovis first, it was sort of a doctrine.

2339
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
It was like nobody, yeah, it's impossible.

2340
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:13,000
You're never going to find any older remain of humans before Clovis because there were no Clovis.

2341
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
It was like a doctrine.

2342
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Like Grandma and Cuck talk about it.

2343
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:22,000
And they freaking found some that are even older than Clovis.

2344
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Now they know that there were humans in America before Clovis.

2345
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:32,000
And they might find in the future even older, older, older.

2346
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:35,000
So they keep pushing back the date.

2347
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:47,000
And it shook the entire theory of how humans arrive in North America by the Bering Strait.

2348
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:54,000
And at the time, they arrived because now what we thought it was turns out to be wrong.

2349
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,000
It's much older than what we thought.

2350
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:01,000
And the more we dig in, the more we find stuff.

2351
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,000
And I think it's excited.

2352
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
But for some people, it's frustrating.

2353
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,000
And I don't think you should attach any emotion to this.

2354
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,000
It's just knowledge.

2355
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Just information.

2356
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Yeah.

2357
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:17,000
And what you know sometimes can be turned out to be wrong.

2358
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Same thing in training.

2359
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Like stuff that I used to do back then, I thought was good.

2360
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Now I know is wrong.

2361
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
And I change it.

2362
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I don't attach any emotion.

2363
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:31,000
I'm not stubborn and say, oh, I'm continue to do this because I want to improve.

2364
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:36,000
And then I have to accept like, shit, what I was doing was wrong.

2365
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:39,000
So, OK, I stopped doing it and I improve.

2366
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:47,000
You know, in sport, that's why people ask me very often, oh, is the fighter todays are better than the one in your time?

2367
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,000
And I think, yes.

2368
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,000
The reason is not because the guys are better.

2369
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:55,000
It's because the knowledge and the technology improve.

2370
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Humans were the same.

2371
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,000
We're the same human.

2372
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:02,000
But our knowledge and technology improve.

2373
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
And therefore, guys got better.

2374
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:05,000
They got better performance.

2375
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:10,000
And in a sport like combat sport, you cannot measure the result.

2376
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:15,000
But in, for example, in the races or lifting, you have data.

2377
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:20,000
You know that, for example, Usain Bolt beat Jesse Owen.

2378
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:26,000
But did he beat him because he's better or did he beat him because he had the shoes?

2379
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
He was running on the different surface.

2380
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,000
The right training.

2381
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:34,000
He also had the departure block that Jesse Owen did not have.

2382
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:41,000
He had the, you know, now, you know, like they use a lot of technology and knowledge that they didn't have back then.

2383
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Yeah.

2384
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,000
So if you give that to Jesse Owen, maybe he would have been better than Usain Bolt.

2385
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Who knows? Maybe not.

2386
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Maybe yes.

2387
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
So same thing in combat sport.

2388
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I believe the performance got better.

2389
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,000
The future generation will be better.

2390
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Not because they're really better, just because they have more access to better technology and knowledge.

2391
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
You think there's a peak to that?

2392
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
It's a good question.

2393
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Can we become like the peak performance athlete?

2394
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
I'm a pure risk.

2395
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I'm against the idea of equipment.

2396
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
I know it's a freaking business, but I think it's wrong.

2397
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
So you can measure it better?

2398
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:29,000
I think guys should be fighting maybe in shorts, bare hands, like he used to be.

2399
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I think sprinters should sprint barefoot.

2400
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:41,000
No freaking departure block on the same surface they always run, because it affects the data.

2401
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:48,000
If you give a better surface, a surface that is harder, that has more respawn when you run,

2402
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:55,000
therefore it messed up the result because the one that didn't run on that surface has a disadvantage.

2403
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
The shoes change everything.

2404
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:02,000
The grip of the shoes, the departure block, it gives you the kick in the beginning.

2405
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I just take race as an example because more people know about racing than anything else.

2406
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
But fighting is the same thing.

2407
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
You use performance enhancing drug or you use different equipment.

2408
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Excuse the data.

2409
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
It's fucked up.

2410
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:24,000
But we live in a world that we want to see the record being broken.

2411
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
And it's our nature.

2412
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:29,000
We want to go further and better and better and better.

2413
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,000
I understand it.

2414
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
And it's a lot of money attached to it, to the equipment.

2415
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,000
It's a business.

2416
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:38,000
But as a pure risk, I don't like to see it.

2417
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:43,000
But I have to make up with it because that's the reality I live in.

2418
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Wow. Great answer.

2419
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:48,000
I never actually gave that some thought.

2420
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,000
I've thought about that too.

2421
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Is Sidney Crosby better than Wayne Gretzky?

2422
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Is Wayne Gretzky better than Gordie Howe?

2423
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:58,000
But it really comes down to the improvement of equipment, the improvement of how you train,

2424
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:05,000
what you're training, and little minute things over time that are shifted a little bit.

2425
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:08,000
But yeah, they're not on an even playing field, so hard to measure.

2426
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:13,000
I went to the Raptors because I give speeches to the teams, sometimes to professional teams.

2427
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:16,000
And man, they have certain technology.

2428
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:24,000
The Raptors, for example, they know where they're more likely to score when they take a shot than other place on the field.

2429
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Like they have some freaking data that is just unbelievable.

2430
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:34,000
So they know that if they pass the ball in that sort of area and they have a guy that shoots in,

2431
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,000
they're more likely to because everything is measured.

2432
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
It's freaking crazy.

2433
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:44,000
And it's knowledge. Knowledge is a weapon.

2434
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Technology and knowledge is a weapon.

2435
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:56,000
That's how Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, the Romans, the Second World War was won because of knowledge and technology.

2436
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,000
And the same thing in my fights. I had knowledge.

2437
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I was a very good athlete, but I didn't became champion because I was the best athlete.

2438
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
There were guys that were better athlete than me.

2439
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:12,000
There's a guy that I work hard, but I'm sure there's a guy that worked just as hard and maybe harder than me.

2440
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I work smart, but there's guys that work smart.

2441
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:24,000
But I was very lucky to have the influence and certain contact that gave me the knowledge that I have.

2442
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:28,000
And that's, I think, one of the main reasons why I was successful.

2443
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:33,000
And in warfare and in life, even as an entrepreneur, I think it's a key.

2444
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:38,000
When you get knowledge and you know how to use it, you can be successful.

2445
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I mean, that and I will say your humility is also something that yourself you won't go and talk about

2446
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,000
because it's hard to talk about oneself as being humble.

2447
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:57,000
But you're a very humble person and in victory in all the successes.

2448
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:02,000
And I think that as well makes you stand out, not only as an athlete, but as a human being.

2449
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
So I think that that's really commendable as well.

2450
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Thank you, man. Thank you, Chris.

2451
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:10,000
I'm happy we crossed paths and I got to know you, man.

2452
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:13,000
And it's fun, man. It's fun.

2453
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:23,000
And I'm looking forward to these experiments that I'm willing to try to psionic stuff.

2454
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:33,000
I'm curious and I want to know if there is something to be done because you convinced me of the possibility.

2455
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I wouldn't say the truth because I don't know if it's true, but the possibility because my mind was a little bit closed before.

2456
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:43,000
But the possibility that that could be enhanced.

2457
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:47,000
And if that's the case, man, man, I want to be part of it.

2458
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
I want to want to know.

2459
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Georges Saint-Pierre, thank you very much for talking to me today.

2460
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:59,000
Thank you to you. Thank you for having received me and also for introducing me to Lou Elizondo.

2461
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
For me, it was very important.

2462
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:05,000
It's a great pleasure and to all the Quebec fans who are listening to us right now.

2463
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:12,000
It's probably a shock to hear me speak French, but I think it's mandatory too.

2464
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:16,000
I didn't know you speak French before I met you.

2465
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:20,000
And you speak like like perfect. I was like shit. I'm like, I don't know.

2466
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Maybe one day we'll do another podcast in French just for the Quebecers.

2467
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Of course, but the audience is bigger in English. It's normal. Absolutely.

2468
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:34,000
