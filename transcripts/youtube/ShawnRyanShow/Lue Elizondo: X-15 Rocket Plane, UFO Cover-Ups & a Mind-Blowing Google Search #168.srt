1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Nice. I thought Merengue. Isn't that Dominican?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,240
Yeah, so my family's Cuban. My father was actually in the Bay of Pigs. My father was

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,840
a revolutionary. He was captured by Castro's men on the beach during the invasion. He was

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,540
on the USS Houston when it got rocketed. Some CIA guys also were there, didn't make it unfortunately.

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:32,420
But he was for two years in Castro's prisons. My father was a wonderful human being, but

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,740
he's also a very tormented soul. And now we can recognize, oh, he had PTSD, right? Or

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,300
as the old timers used to say, shell shock. So he struggled with anger and volatility

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:52,180
for a very long time during his life. And as a young person, I had a really weird background.

9
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:57,460
There was always this idea, this understanding that after the Brigade 2506, which was what

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,140
my father was part of. In fact, if you type in my name, Luis Elizondo, in Bay of Pigs,

11
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,120
you'll see my father's prisoner number. There was always this understanding that there would

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:14,740
be a reinvasion by the new generation, by us, by the kids, and part of Alpha 66. So

13
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:22,140
I had a really weird upbringing as a child, always smoked filled rooms and dim lights

14
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,180
and weird conversations. And so at a very early age, I had my taste of paramilitary.

15
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,700
And I didn't even know it. I thought it was part of Boy Scouts. And, you know, you go

16
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,740
back to school one day, what'd you guys do? Well, I got my, you know, how to light a fire

17
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,620
badge. What'd you get? Oh, we disassembled AK-47s. You didn't do that?

18
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,060
We should dig into that. We should dig into that on the show. But

19
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,580
Whatever you want.

20
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,740
Yeah, we will. So Luis Elizondo, welcome to the show.

21
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,060
You can call me Lou if you want. I know I look more like a Bob or a Bill or a Joe. Thank

22
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,180
you very much. Sean, if I can say something just for a moment. This is an incredible honor

23
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,020
and privilege of mine, and not for the reasons that most people might think not because you

24
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,980
have a very successful show and you have a big audience. It's because of who you are

25
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:19,540
and what you have done in the service of your country. There's a lot of people on the outside

26
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,260
that will see things that people like you or maybe I've done, and they kind of glorify

27
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,620
that. But we also know the other side of that. We know the truth. And we know the pain that

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,700
it causes for the loved ones we leave behind. It causes even to us to some degree, right?

29
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,540
To keep a piece of that those experiences with you at all times. And some of us try

30
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,300
our best to try to suppress it. But what you have done for our nation, I'm not sure most

31
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,780
people in your audience can really appreciate. And I only know because I've been there and

32
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,900
experienced those things with you guys. And I just want to say from the bottom of my heart,

33
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,020
and on behalf of a very grateful nation, although maybe they don't realize it, thank you for

34
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,860
what you do. We are only here today having this conversation in a wonderful country that

35
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,340
we are in. We have in this incredible experiment because of the sacrifices you and your colleagues

36
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,020
have made. So before we begin, please accept my humble appreciation, sincere appreciation

37
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:25,140
for the sacrifices you and your family has had to make for us, for the rest of us chickens.

38
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,780
Thank you, man. Thank you. That means a hell of a lot. Thank you. But, wow, thank you for

39
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:39,820
saying that. Yeah. And likewise, here, likewise. Let's get into the interview. So everybody

40
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,060
starts with an introduction here. So I think we might wind up doing a little bit of a live

41
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,820
story here. I wasn't planning on doing that, but this sounds super interesting. Lou Elizondo,

42
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,900
Lou Elizondo, you're a former US Army counterintelligence special agent and former employee of the office

43
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,060
of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence. You led a previously covert program within

44
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:11,140
the Department of Defense investigating unidentified aerial phenomenon, UAP. You came forward to

45
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,480
the public about Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, ATIP, bringing to

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,580
light what the government knew about these mysterious objects in our skies. Since then,

47
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,660
you've worked to educate both the public and policymakers about the potential implications

48
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,100
of UAPs for national security, science, and human understanding. You've been involved

49
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,380
with organizations like To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science aimed at advancing research

50
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,860
into these phenomena. You're a fixture in the UAP transparency movement and have appeared

51
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,420
in numerous interviews, documentaries, and media segments discussing UAPs where you've

52
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,300
shared insight from your experience while critiquing the government's approach to transparency

53
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,540
on this subject. Welcome to the show.

54
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,620
Thank you. One point of correction. The UAP program at the Pentagon was not covert. I

55
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,580
did run covert operations and activities, but that was for another effort while working

56
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,140
for the US government. The ATIP program, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which

57
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,300
I helped lead and working with some of my colleagues, was a very sensitive program,

58
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,940
but it wasn't covert. I know people like to, and forgive me for that saying that, I don't

59
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,780
know why it says that. There's a legal definition of covert activities, and then there is from

60
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,420
the Department of Defense, which is Title 50, and then from a Title 10 or DOD perspective,

61
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:38,300
you have clandestine type operations and sensitive operations, but ATIP was not covert. It was

62
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,580
sensitive in a lot of classified aspects to it, but it was not a Title 50 program, although

63
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,900
I ran it under, when I was wearing my Title 50 hat, under the covert umbrella, but in

64
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,420
itself, it was not a covert program. It was a highly sensitive program with a lot of classified

65
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,780
aspects that I ran while I was running covert operations.

66
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,500
Did you start ATIP?

67
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,740
I did not. No, no, no. It's fascinating, actually, the way ATIP started. It actually started

68
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:14,460
off as a program called OSAP, the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Special Application Program,

69
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:24,340
You know, we love our acronyms, right, Intel Community. It was in 2007, Harry Reid, Senator,

70
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,140
who is, by the way, the Senate Majority Leader at the time, you had Senator Ted Stevens and

71
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:35,100
Senator Inouye, so Alaska and Hawaii as well, so Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, and even former

72
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,940
astronaut John Glenn, all got together on the Hill, and somebody like bipartisan, so

73
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:46,500
Republican and Democrat, got together and put funding together to create a program called,

74
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,380
the contract vehicle was called OSAP. OSAP was a big program in order to look at, from

75
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,460
the Pentagon's perspective, the UAP or UFO in vernacular, the UFO issue. From there,

76
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,420
there was an aspect of, OSAP was kind of thinking of a big umbrella, and then you have a little

77
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,020
umbrella fitting underneath this bigger umbrella, which looked at a lot of stuff to include

78
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,660
elements of what now is known as Skinwalker Ranch and some other things. ATIP was really

79
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,980
focusing on nuts and bolts of the UAP phenomenon, so OSAP did too, but they were much broader,

80
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,020
think of a shotgun approach versus a sniper approach, the shotgun being OSAP, the sniper

81
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:30,100
being ATIP, and so I was actually part of the ATIP program, although I worked with a

82
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,660
lot of the elements in OSAP, my focus was really nuts and bolts on ATIP.

83
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,700
Interesting.

84
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,540
So it was started by Jim Lakatsky and Jay Stratton on the OSAP side.

85
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:47,140
You mentioned, so it was three state senators that started in Alaska, Nevada, and Hawaii,

86
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,340
is there, I mean, interesting, a lot of UAP activity in Alaska.

87
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,260
Well, Ted Stevens had his own UAP encounter while he was a pilot, believe it or not.

88
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,820
No shit.

89
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:02,740
And let's not forget that he was in World War II, Senator Inouye actually gave his arm

90
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,660
for his country, all of our veterans, Stevens was a pilot, and he had his own UAP experience,

91
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,980
and then of course, interestingly enough, you had-

92
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,940
Who was Alaska?

93
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,940
He was Alaska, yeah, Ted Stevens.

94
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,980
What was his experience?

95
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,380
Well, he reported, you know, classic Foo Fighter experience, these objects that would

96
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,700
would pursue him while he was a pilot, and they were performing in ways that he couldn't

97
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,980
explain, they were outperforming anything that he was aware of as a pilot,

98
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,820
but instantaneous acceleration, very, very fast maneuvers, well beyond the structural

99
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,340
limitations of what we had at the time, technologically.

100
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,100
And so, and this is, by the way, this is not isolated, if you get a chance to talk to members

101
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,940
of Congress privately, a lot of them will share with you their own UAP experiences,

102
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,740
they're like, hey, man, I was fishing with my son, and all of a sudden this thing comes

103
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,140
out of the water and saw it right there in front of us.

104
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,820
I think, you know, politically, they're a little shy to have that discussion publicly,

105
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,420
now, maybe it'll come out.

106
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,580
But you'd be surprised how many people, members of Congress have had their own experience.

107
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,820
Is there a lot of, I mean, the reason I brought up the three states, Nevada, obviously a lot

108
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:15,540
of activity, Alaska, a lot of activity, Hawaii, is there a lot of activity down there?

109
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,820
Well, there is some, I would, I don't, it's hard to say there's a lot.

110
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,260
So there's an issue with Hawaii.

111
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,460
It's population density and surface area.

112
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,780
So, Nevada, Alaska, lots of landmass, when you have people all around, so you get pretty

113
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,020
much a good persistent eye in the sky, maybe there's a farmer, maybe there's someone driving

114
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,420
a truck, maybe there's a military person, military bases, Hawaii is a much smaller landmass.

115
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,660
So you have fewer people in a smaller area looking up towards the sky.

116
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,740
So we don't really know if Hawaii is necessarily a hot spot.

117
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:57,300
We do have a military presence there, as we know, and we do have a couple sensitive facilities

118
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,780
there because of geographically where it's located.

119
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,780
And so it shouldn't be any surprise that we've had UAP activity there.

120
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,020
But whether or not it's as much or as consistent as some of these other areas, like we've seen

121
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,260
with, like, New Jersey, for example, with the drones, right, where they're being reported

122
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,540
everywhere, you don't have that type of population in Hawaii and you don't have the landmass.

123
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,500
So we really don't know.

124
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,660
We don't know if there's actually more activity occurring around the waters.

125
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,820
We don't know if there's actually an increase or a decrease, simply because we don't have

126
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,740
enough persistent, I guess, I hate to use the word persistent surveillance there, but

127
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,300
we just don't.

128
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,220
Remember, it's a couple, a few little islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, right?

129
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,220
And so unless you're right there at the time something's happening, you're not going to know.

130
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
You mentioned Skimwalker Ranch.

131
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,820
I'm just going, I don't want to lose anything.

132
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,380
No, no, no.

133
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,460
Have you done any work out there with Brandon or?

134
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,740
Well, so before Brandon, there was a gentleman named Bob Bigelow from Bigelow Aerospace.

135
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,620
By the way, this is a this is a gentleman who made his fortune in the hotel industry

136
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,140
and then decided to jump to aerospace and actually succeeded, right?

137
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,580
So this is a guy who put together these inhabitable inflatable type modules that

138
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,740
could hook on to the to the ISS space station, which, by the way, they're there right now.

139
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,020
He actually has them connected.

140
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,660
And he had these projects, Genesis one, Genesis two projects to create these inflatable habitats

141
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,420
for NASA as kind of NASA's future space program.

142
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,500
And he was very successful.

143
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:35,060
So he actually helped fund through his own money a lot of what OSAP originally did to

144
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,660
include Skimwalker Ranch.

145
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,020
He owned the ranch before Brandon Fugal owned it.

146
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,300
And there was a very robust research effort ongoing.

147
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,940
People don't know that.

148
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,220
Oh, it's just a bunch of hooey.

149
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,060
No, it wasn't a lot of real stuff going on, a lot of real research.

150
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,980
And I had access to a lot of those files.

151
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,620
That wasn't my portfolio specific.

152
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,900
So I don't usually talk about it.

153
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,300
There's other people that are far more qualified than me to talk about Skimwalker Ranch.

154
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,220
And by the way, there was more than one ranch.

155
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,660
People don't know that there are other facilities.

156
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,060
I mean, I would imagine there would be.

157
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,340
But yeah, I've been trying to get Bigelow on here for for a while.

158
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,500
He is an elusive guy.

159
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,260
And then at inauguration, I actually shared an elevator with him.

160
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,780
And I didn't say anything.

161
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,140
I don't want to bug him.

162
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,220
But, you know, I just he is a let him be.

163
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,580
He is I consider him an American hero.

164
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,540
And I don't say that lightly.

165
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,660
People can think what they want of individuals.

166
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,940
But I've seen what he's been able to contribute to our country.

167
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,900
And if you ask him whether he likes me or hates me, it's really irrelevant.

168
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,580
I've seen what he's been able to do and what he has done for our nation.

169
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,020
So, you know, I'm eternally grateful for what what he's done.

170
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,260
And and there's a part of that story that hasn't come out yet.

171
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,500
I think I think our country owes him a great deal of gratitude

172
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,180
for what he's been able to do for our nation.

173
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,660
So you were affiliated with it before when Bigelow owned it.

174
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,300
I was.

175
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,740
What was some of the stuff that you I mean, what was going on there?

176
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,180
Is it similar to what's going on with Skimwalker right now?

177
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,460
Very intense.

178
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,980
You know, again, I want to be careful not to speak for other people.

179
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,620
But I can tell you that there are some very strange things that occur

180
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,140
on that facility on that ranch that that certainly warrant additional investigation.

181
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,420
Either their national security implications.

182
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,260
Well, it depends what your definition of national security is.

183
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,780
But there's certainly enough going on there that warrants further inquiry.

184
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,140
So I applaud what they're doing with what Brandon Fugel and others are doing.

185
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,020
I think it's important.

186
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,940
Why do you think Bob never shared any of the research with Brandon?

187
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,620
I've interviewed Brandon.

188
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,740
He's a friend of mine now.

189
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,900
And, you know, he did not give over any of the prior research to Brandon

190
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,700
when he bought the ranch.

191
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,220
So they're starting from square one.

192
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,940
I don't want to speak on anybody else's behalf.

193
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,780
Certainly not Bob Bigelow or anybody else.

194
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,700
And that's probably one thing you'll notice during interviews.

195
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,820
I never speak for anybody else.

196
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,980
And I don't offer my opinion very often because that opinion could be wrong.

197
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,340
I'd rather stick to the facts.

198
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,980
But it could be one of two things.

199
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,540
Let's look at the full spectrum of why.

200
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,540
It could be that maybe Bob says, look, I don't want to predicate the science.

201
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,220
I don't want to prejudice, forgive me.

202
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,140
I don't want to prejudice the science with predicated information,

203
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,380
meaning here's access to all my data and you take it from there.

204
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,420
Start from scratch.

205
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,820
So we have a fresh set of eyes on it and remain objective.

206
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,620
Maybe that's why.

207
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,220
Or it could be, hey, you know what?

208
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,340
I paid a lot of money and put a lot of time into this.

209
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,260
I consider this information proprietary.

210
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,300
And, you know, you're going to have to figure this out yourself.

211
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,020
Maybe that's why.

212
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,220
Or maybe, I don't know, maybe because there was some government involvement,

213
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,020
maybe he can't.

214
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,260
Maybe he's like, look, it's proprietary to the US.

215
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,900
All this information we did is proprietary to the US government.

216
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,540
I can't release it without the US government's approval.

217
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,380
I mean, those are just some of the what ifs.

218
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,580
I don't know why.

219
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,980
I've never had a chance to ask Mr. Fugal that question directly.

220
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,700
But I do know Bob Bigelow and he never,

221
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,580
I don't think he'd ever do anything just out of spite or to be mean.

222
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,020
I'm sure he had a very good reason.

223
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,460
He's always very calculated.

224
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,900
I'm sure he had a very good reason for that.

225
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,380
I'm always on the lookout for ways to get healthier, especially now.

226
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,820
That's why I'm so glad I discovered Armora Colostrum.

227
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,500
Armora Colostrum has thousands of people reporting absolutely life-changing benefits,

228

261
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,380
So in your experience, are the things that they were experiencing, are they very similar?

262
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,740
Um, well, you mean compared to Brandon Fugel?

263
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,380
Yeah, yeah.

264
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,940
I think there's some overlap.

265
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,780
But again, I'm not really tracking now currently the Skinwalker stuff.

266
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,220
That's another group of folks.

267
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,140
It's not that I'm not interested.

268
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,620
I am.

269
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,660
I just don't have the bandwidth.

270
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,900
I'm simply, as I tell people, I am dancing as fast as I can.

271
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,380
I cannot turn the tempo up anymore.

272
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,740
As fast as these legs will move.

273
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:33,860
So to spend my time and energy now on yet another portfolio, I just simply, I'd have to clone myself.

274
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,580
Yeah, yeah.

275
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,340
Well, Lou, we have a Patreon account.

276
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,180
They're a subscription account.

277
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,300
They're our top supporters.

278
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,020
Good for you.

279
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,660
And they've been here with us since the beginning.

280
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,220
Fantastic.

281
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,940
It keeps growing.

282
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,300
It's a community now.

283
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,300
And I wouldn't be sitting here without them, and neither would you be.

284
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,660
So one thing I offer them is to ask each and every

285
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,820
guest a question that comes on the show.

286
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,780
Absolutely.

287
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,180
This one is from Jake Gillian.

288
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:08,020
Given your unique insight into the UAP phenomena and its potential implications for humanity,

289
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,940
what do you believe is the single most critical piece of information

290
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,220
the public should understand about UAPs right now?

291
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,540
And why do you think this information has been withheld for so long?

292
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,460
Wow, wow, Jake.

293
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,580
Great, great question.

294
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,460
So let me see if I can deconstruct this a little bit.

295
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,340
What is the one single aspect about the UAP topic that should be?

296
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,140
That the public should understand about UAPs.

297
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,460
The public should understand it, should be revealed now,

298
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,780
and understand its implications and the importance of it.

299
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,720
Wow.

300
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,420
There's not just one.

301
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,220
Let me see if I can break this down for Jake.

302
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:53,460
Um, there are fundamental reasons why you classify information by law,

303
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,540
by law, and then later on policy as well.

304
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,540
Usually it's to protect two things called sources and methods.

305
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,300
And then sometimes you can use it to protect some other things we won't go into here.

306
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,900
But those are the primary reasons.

307
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:11,460
What you can't do is classify information to cover up malfeasance or illegal activities

308
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,260
or something that might be embarrassing to the United States.

309
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:14,900
You can't do it.

310
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,140
We used to do it as a nation, and finally Congress stepped in

311
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,780
after all these nasty little things that we were doing,

312
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,980
like the syphilis experiments, for example,

313
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,020
or the CIA and the LSD experiments.

314
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,940
We did some pretty nasty things.

315
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,060
So Congress stepped in and said,

316
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,300
no, Moss, if you're going to classify information,

317
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
these are the reasons why you classify information.

318
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,140
And if you do it for any other reasons, you're wrong.

319
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,340
I don't believe that any organization,

320
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:49,620
any institution, any government, any religion has the right

321
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:56,820
to classify information that should be universally provided

322
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,540
to all the people of the world and all the citizens.

323
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,980
Now, what do I mean by that?

324
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,420
Galileo Galilei, when he first proposed,

325
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,900
looked through his telescope and first proposed

326
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,260
the heliocentric model for our solar system

327
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,300
was met with so much resistance

328
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,820
that the church almost burned him alive on the stake.

329
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,140
And he had to recant and say, no, I was wrong.

330
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,820
In fact, they even refused to look through the very telescope

331
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,900
to prove his observations.

332
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,220
Now we look back and we say, well, that's silly.

333
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,820
Why would anybody care that the sun is the center

334
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
of our solar system and not Earth, right?

335
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,020
Well, at the time, that information was thought

336
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,940
to be very threatening to the Judeo-Christian belief system

337
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,660
and the institutions at the time, primarily the church.

338
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,260
So in essence, they tried to classify that idea.

339
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,700
Don't tell the world that,

340
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,180
because this goes against what we've been telling people.

341
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,500
And I don't think, we look back hindsight being 2020,

342
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,700
realize that was dumb.

343
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,620
Why would you ever do that?

344
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,300
Why would you stop somebody from telling the truth?

345
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,660
I think this topic is very much the same thing.

346
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Look, we tell everybody in modern terms every day

347
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,380
that North Korea has atomic capabilities

348
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,500
and that's not classified.

349
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,540
The fact that the Earth is not the center

350
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,620
of the solar system is not classified.

351
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,020
Now what is classified is the fact that maybe North Korea,

352
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,340
how those atomic weapons are delivered

353
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,380
and their flight characteristics and their targets, gotcha.

354
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,300
And you want to keep that classified.

355
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,780
But the fact that North Korea has atomic weapons

356
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,380
is not a classifiable fact.

357
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,140
Just like we're not alone in the cosmos.

358
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,020
These things are here.

359
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,780
It's becoming the worst kept secret.

360
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,980
It's now a liability.

361
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,180
There are two fundamental philosophies about secrets.

362
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,060
Some people believe secrets are like fine wine

363
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,820
and the longer you keep a cork on it,

364
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,140
the better it gets, the longer it ages.

365
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,660
I disagree with that.

366
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,060
I've told people all along since day one,

367
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,100
secrets are perishable.

368
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,180
They have a shelf life.

369
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,020
They're like vegetables in your refrigerator.

370
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,220
And if you leave them in there too long,

371
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,740
they're going to rot and they're going to stink.

372
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,740
And then you got a really big mess on your hands.

373
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,420
So if you allow a secret to go on longer

374
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,260
than what's necessary,

375
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,620
it actually will start working as a liability against you.

376
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,420
And ultimately, we've seen with the JFK files,

377
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,140
it will start to erode the faith and confidence

378
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,860
and public trust in the very institution

379
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,940
that that secret was there to try to protect.

380
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,340
This is no different with the UAP topic.

381
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,860
It is so obvious at this point

382
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,300
and our adversaries know it's real too,

383
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,740
to keep the mere fact of the existence of UAP

384
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,700
from the public knowledge I think is a disservice.

385
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,820
I don't think any organization, like I said,

386
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,100
or government has a right to keep that fundamental truth

387
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,300
away from the American people.

388
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,420
That's not their business to do that.

389
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,300
Now, if you want to say, well,

390
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,740
how these things actually work,

391
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,500
and because we obviously don't want North Korea

392
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,820
or some rogue nation having that capability to hurt us,

393
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,860
I got you.

394
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,020
But to deny the existence of it,

395
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,300
I think that's counterproductive.

396
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,020
I think it actually works against trying to

397
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,860
reinforce and instill faith and confidence in our government.

398
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,620
I don't think that's the way to do it.

399
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,060
I think ultimately, at the end of the day,

400
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,620
everything is going to come out anyways,

401
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,380
just like we see with the JFK files.

402
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,580
There's an old saying from Bob Marley,

403
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,100
you can fool some people sometimes,

404
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,940
but you can't fool all the people all the time.

405
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,700
And I think that's where we're at.

406
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,020
I think we now have to reconcile

407
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,020
and come back to the table and say,

408
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,500
yeah, it turns out we've been investigating things

409
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,420
for a long time, even though we haven't told you,

410
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,100
or maybe we didn't tell Congress,

411
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,340
and we didn't even tell presidents,

412
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,940
certain presidents what we were doing.

413
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,220
Now, is that a problem?

414
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,980
Yes, but we can figure that out.

415
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,020
We can get over that hill.

416
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,460
What we can't do is afford to erode any more faith

417
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,020
and confidence.

418
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,180
The faith and confidence right now in our government

419
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,860
at least was at an all-time low.

420
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,820
Most people do not trust their government.

421
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,260
That's a problem in a democracy.

422
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,180
I'm one of them.

423
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,140
Hey, brother, we both served our Uncle Sam.

424
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,640
I got you.

425
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,060
And sometimes, if you really love something

426
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,860
or love someone, you have to tell them

427
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,260
what they need to hear, not what they want to hear.

428
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,620
And this is a case, I think,

429
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,780
this is why I'm having this conversation.

430
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,540
The government needs to hear, look,

431
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,940
it's time for you to be honest with the American people.

432
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,780
I know what I was part of.

433
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,020
My colleagues know what they were part of.

434
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,900
We know what we've seen, and so do the pilots,

435
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,180
and so do the radar operators,

436
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,380
and so do the special operators,

437
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,300
and so do the CIA personnel.

438
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,500
The cat's out of the bag, guys.

439
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,020
The cat is out of the bag.

440
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,940
So back to the question here,

441
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,340
what is the one thing that should be revealed?

442
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,340
The fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.

443
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,980
In our 200,000 years of existence

444
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,700
as modern homo sapiens sapien as a species

445
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,180
and only really been the last 100 years

446
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,220
we had the technology to even begin to explore our cosmos.

447
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,860
Is it possible for our search for intelligent life

448
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,740
that in all that time,

449
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,140
Earth being four and a half billion years old approximately,

450
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,860
that intelligent life found us first?

451
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,180
Yeah, statistically, yeah.

452
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,460
And then when you look at the evidence

453
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,700
suggesting that and reinforcing that,

454
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,180
look, someone is flying these things around.

455
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,540
They are intelligently controlled.

456
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,140
They can outperform anything that we have.

457
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,460
So who's behind it?

458
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,700
That's fine if you don't want to consider that option.

459
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,860
It's either Russian, Chinese, or ours.

460
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,060
And it's not ours.

461
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,100
We've already said it's not ours.

462
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,620
We don't have that capability.

463
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,860
And we damn sure hope it's not Russian or Chinese

464
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,740
because then we're really screwed.

465
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,140
No, by the way, we've been dealing with this topic now

466
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,380
for the last, what, 70-some years.

467
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,180
Can you imagine?

468
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,260
Look, when these things, foo fighters,

469
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,380
we talked a little bit about Senator Ted Stevens

470
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,260
and allied pilots seeing these foo fighters

471
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,140
during World War II.

472
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,180
Let me ask you a question, Sean.

473
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,780
Right on the heels of World War II,

474
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,500
we have this rash of flying saucers being seen and UFOs

475
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,340
that were, in some cases, radar returns in the early 50s

476
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,780
doing 10,000 to 13,000 miles an hour, okay?

477
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,700
Where were we?

478
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,660
Well, we had just come out of World War II.

479
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,140
We became the world's premier superpower.

480
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,580
We had barely broken the sound barrier

481
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,940
and we hadn't been into space

482
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,580
and we were transitioning from propeller to jet,

483
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,300
to the jet age.

484
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,820
These things, we forget about 13,000 miles an hour,

485
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,020
we could barely break Mach 1, right?

486
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,860
Who had that capability at the time if we didn't?

487
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,100
Well, where was Russia?

488
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,500
They were just entering the atomic age themselves.

489
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,580
China, they're in the middle of a famine, right?

490
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,380
There's no one who had that capability.

491
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,580
I always use this analogy.

492
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,900
That would be like going back into the 40s.

493
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,580
That would be like going into King Tut's tomb

494
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,780
for the very first time

495
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,140
and as you're breaking down the rock wall

496
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,420
and peering into the vault,

497
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,620
all of a sudden seeing a fully assembled 747 jet

498
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,340
sitting in the tomb.

499
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,740
Temporarily, it doesn't make sense.

500
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,460
The Egyptians did not have that technology.

501
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,740
What is that aircraft doing in that tomb?

502
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,340
It doesn't make sense.

503
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,780
So, you know, there's the adage,

504
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
in the face, there's two types of people in the world.

505
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,140
In the face of new information,

506
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,500
you can change your opinion based upon new facts

507
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,340
or like some people, reject the facts

508
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,620
and stick with your own narrative

509
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,380
because it's more comfortable and convenient.

510
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,740
I think it's probably smarter and wiser

511
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,180
in the face of new facts,

512
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,100
we need to recalculate our thinking

513
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,980
and that's why I think back to this question here,

514
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,060
it's important that the people know

515
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,500
that the US government has been spending

516
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,380
your taxpayer dollars, a lot of it,

517
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,300
trying to research these things that are very real.

518
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,380
You don't spend millions and millions of dollars

519
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,780
and billions of dollars on a wild goose chase.

520
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,740
You don't do it.

521
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,420
And hiding black budgets and things,

522
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,340
you do it because something's real and legit.

523
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,060
And I think that's where we are.

524
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,140
Certainly my experience in the Pentagon

525
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,660
and the intelligence community,

526
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,980
this is substantiated.

527
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,980
Well, I mean, I think a lot of people think

528
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,180
maybe the Germans had some higher technology.

529
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,740
Well, they did though.

530
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,540
Well, they certainly did.

531
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,420
We know that, right?

532
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,100
The German Wunderwaffe program,

533
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,140
wonder weapon program,

534
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,940
had the Messerschmitt, right?

535
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,020
The ME, what was it, 108?

536
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,500
I mean, the first jet airplane, really,

537
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,580
that was the Germans that came up with it.

538
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,740
The V1 rocket, the V2 rocket, right?

539
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,860
The buzz bombs and the long range rockets.

540
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,460
Those were all German technologies.

541
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,140
In fact, with Operation Paperclip,

542
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,740
when World War II ended, what do we do?

543
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,740
We stole it all and brought it here, right?

544
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,780
Wernher von Braun and the Saturn V rocket.

545
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,660
That was just, I hate to say it,

546
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,980
but that was a glorified V2 rocket, you know?

547
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,900
So yes, the Germans did.

548
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,940
And then they had these other very interesting programs,

549
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,020
not too dissimilar to what the Pentagon had.

550
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,700
The Nazis had something called the Annernerva,

551
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,740
which really looked at some kind of far out stuff.

552
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,780
Now, some people will look and say,

553
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,100
oh, it was nothing but cult and witchcraft.

554
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,180
Okay, but there was enough there, there, enough data

555
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,660
to suggest that whatever they were doing worked

556
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,340
or could help them with the war effort.

557
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,900
So they invested a lot of time and money into that.

558
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,300
And that's not just, you know,

559
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,900
I was mentioning this because you said Germans,

560
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,580
but other countries did the same thing.

561
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,940
There's other countries that were always looking

562
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,020
for that strategic advantage.

563
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,220
What would it take for me to have a decisive advantage

564
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,420
on the battlefield, in the battle space?

565
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,940
So people say, well, why would they spend,

566
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,380
but look, our country did.

567
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,140
But one of my colleagues, Hal Pudoff,

568
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,500
the godfather of the US government,

569
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,300
the CIA's psychic espionage program.

570
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,500
That's right, I just said psychic espionage program.

571
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,460
Your tax dollars paid for programs like Stargate

572
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,820
and Grill Flame before that

573
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,660
and various other names before that.

574
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,420
Why? Because there was some information

575
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,540
to suggest that it worked.

576
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,500
And oh, by the way, the Russians were doing the same thing.

577
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,500
You know, so people look at things and say,

578
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,100
well, that's silly, that would never work.

579
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,820
And it turns out that sometimes it does work.

580
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,820
Look at the Navy SOC, your Navy guy,

581
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,300
the Navy SOCIS program back in the 50s.

582
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,260
Who would have ever thought, well,

583
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,860
I could just drop some microphones in the ocean

584
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,100
and maybe I can listen to Russian submarines.

585
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,460
It worked, right?

586
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,900
So is it really that, is it pseudoscience?

587
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,980
Well, it's pseudoscience until it works.

588
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,180
Now it's just science.

589
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,020
I mean, I also think that maybe as Americans,

590
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,900
we're a little arrogant thinking that we, you know,

591
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,300
that nobody else could have this kind of technology

592
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,180
because we're so advanced.

593
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,580
And, you know, maybe somebody else has it

594
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,700
and they're just not revealing it

595
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,940
because they don't want to play the fucking world police.

596
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,260
Right.

597
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,660
You know, we get ourselves involved in everything.

598
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,580
Well, why would you want to tell somebody,

599
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,260
look, like we're in this wonderful room here,

600
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,340
but if you're like me and sometimes paranoid,

601
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,620
I've always have contingencies

602
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,860
and I have contingencies for contingencies.

603
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,860
So if you were a country that has

604
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,020
some super secret technology,

605
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,020
would you want to advertise the world that you have it?

606
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,620
Well, it's kind of what I'm getting at.

607
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:11,860
Right.

608
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,780
So it is possible.

609
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,300
We think we're the smartest.

610
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:15,620
Right.

611
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
But this is why I say temporally,

612
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,940
I think now you're right because we know

613
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,460
that near peer adversaries

614
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,300
are absolutely ahead of us in certain areas.

615
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,100
I won't say what they are,

616
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,420
but we know that and it's a problem for us.

617
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,660
But if you go back to the end of World War II or really-

618
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,460
Who are some?

619
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,500
Who are some that are-

620
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,540
I can't say that.

621
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,740
I don't want to, you know, there's,

622
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,140
I want to let our folks in government do their job

623
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,860
and they don't need me spewing out vulnerabilities

624
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,700
that we might have where other countries are ahead of us.

625
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,220
But, you know, quantum computing, for example,

626
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,660
you know, certain type of capabilities maybe in space,

627
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,700
we have to maintain that competitive advantage.

628
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,420
But again, let's go back to what we originally said here.

629
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,980
If you look at this from a temporal perspective,

630
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,300
time perspective, at the end of World War II,

631
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,620
we really were the only world superpower at the time.

632
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,220
We had dropped the atomic bomb

633
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,420
and decisively ended World War II.

634
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,300
What was referred to as the greatest generation

635
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,060
then began to invest in the United States

636
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,140
and became the world superpower, dominant power.

637
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,860
There was no real near peer

638
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,780
other than the Russians at the time.

639
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,380
And they were still nowhere near what we were able to do.

640
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,340
So I can buy now, if you say that

641
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,660
there is a foreign adversary that has this capability,

642
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,500
okay, I doubt it, but maybe, but not 70 years ago.

643
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,540
And let's look at this because Marco Rubio,

644
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,260
the new Secretary of State when he was Senator,

645
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,540
said something very interesting.

646
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,780
He said, you know, I almost hope that these things

647
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,220
are not human because if they're human,

648
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,500
that's almost more scary who's created this technology.

649
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,020
And I think he's absolutely correct.

650
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,260
To put this into perspective,

651
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,900
we spend billions with a B, billions of dollars each year

652
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
to maintain a strategic advantage

653
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,060
from an intelligence perspective,

654
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,220
all 17 agencies of the intelligence community,

655
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,820
to know more than our enemies, right?

656
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,700
Now imagine if there was a country

657
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,980
that had the ability to develop a technology

658
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,300
and deploy this technology that could come into our country,

659
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,980
completely unimpeded, unchallenged, unseen,

660
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,300
be able to do whatever we wanted to do,

661
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,700
collect ISR on our military equities

662
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,100
and interfere with our nuclear strategic capabilities,

663
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,100
turn them off, right?

664
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,140
And then go back home, no sweat and nobody would ever know.

665
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,140
That would be, and by the way,

666
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,140
have been in development for the last 70 years

667
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,260
on this technology.

668
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,900
That would be the greatest intelligence failure

669
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,220
this country has ever experienced

670
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,900
eclipsing that of even 9-11

671
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,340
because despite the billions of dollars that we invest,

672
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,260
there wasn't a single indication or shred of information

673
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,340
over 70 years that some country

674
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,180
had managed to develop this technology.

675
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,340
Think of the resources and infrastructure required

676
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,540
to develop and deploy a technology like that, right?

677
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:10,500
And you didn't get one shred of evidence in 70 years

678
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,620
that Country X was doing that, right?

679
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,460
So choose your poison.

680
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,540
It's either someone else's or it's foreign adversarial.

681
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,660
If it's foreign adversarial,

682
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,420
you need to fire every single person right now

683
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,740
in national security and start from scratch.

684
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,220
And you better not provoke a war because we're going to lose.

685
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,620
So that's the other part of that argument.

686
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,300
If you say, okay, maybe some country

687
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,500
did develop this in secret.

688
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,140
Okay, well, how, when, where, right?

689
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,580
Under what circumstances?

690
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,820
And now China, you mean to tell me

691
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,900
it's going to be so brazen in 2004

692
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,660
to fly this right off the coast of California

693
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,980
and, oh, by the way, tangle with two F-18 Hornets?

694
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,300
That doesn't seem very smart.

695
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,540
That's certainly not where I test my secret stuff.

696
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,260
You know, we test our secret stuff at Area 51

697
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,780
in these places out of the prying eyes of people to see it.

698
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,420
Now, maybe it's some sort of red force probe, right?

699
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,580
Some provocation to see our response.

700
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,140
Sure, but there's also counter arguments to that as well.

701
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,140
So it simply doesn't make sense from a time perspective

702
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,620
that some country had this technology 70 years ago.

703
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:18,420
Now, sure, maybe, I doubt it, but I would buy that more.

704
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,340
That, okay, yeah, China, Russia in the last five years

705
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,460
has been able to develop this.

706
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,780
Not bad, look, 2004, how many people had quadcopters?

707
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,900
Drones didn't even really exist in 2004.

708
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,060
You had these fixed-wing remote-controlled airplanes

709
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,300
that you threw in combat maybe for 15 minutes

710
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
to get a sight picture on something.

711
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,740
You know, what type of drones did we have?

712
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,380
I mean, when I was in the Army, right before 2001,

713
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,020
we were dealing with model airplanes,

714
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,940
Hunter UAVs, Pioneer UAVs.

715
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,140
I mean, it could be us just now revealing it too,

716
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,060
because, I mean, if we are that technologically advanced,

717
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,380
you know, there's not really any money in that.

718
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,700
And I think we both know that a lot of these,

719
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,980
you know, the wars that we were in has to do a lot

720
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,580
with KBR, with the military.

721
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,020
Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna hold my comments to myself.

722
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,620
So for that advanced, and I mean,

723
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,140
we can end things that quickly,

724
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,820
there's not really a lot of money in that,

725
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,420
so they have to develop all this other shit that's,

726
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,020
you know, advanced.

727
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,620
The problem with that is that we,

728
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,460
when we test.

729
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,940
It's not really that advanced

730
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,020
so that we can spend all our fucking money,

731
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,860
you know what I mean?

732
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,780
Developing all this shit that's not at the top,

733
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,580
because if we just went straight to the top,

734
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,340
then it just ends immediately.

735
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,300
Well, we, I think, and it's certainly a possibility.

736
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,300
You're right, Sean.

737
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,820
It is something we have to consider,

738
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,100
but again, I go back to, how is the-

739
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,940
Nobody talks about that.

740
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,060
How, no, you're right.

741
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,260
How is the, well, because that gets into a very

742
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,060
uncomfortable part of the conversation, but-

743
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,260
But it's fucking real.

744
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
Oh, I don't disagree.

745
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

746
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,420
But, you know, that can, I'm not disagreeing.

747
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,700
But if you look at blue force capabilities

748
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,420
and how we test blue force capabilities,

749
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,060
especially sensitive capabilities.

750
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,180
What do you mean blue force capabilities?

751
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,460
US, good point, US capabilities.

752
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,940
So if you look at the way we test new types of capabilities,

753
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,780
right, for our military, for our intelligence,

754
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,580
we do it in places out of the prying eyes of eyewitnesses.

755
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,100
We do it in a place where it's gonna be safe,

756
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,940
and I don't have to worry about

757
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,140
potential midair collision, right?

758
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,740
I'm not gonna test this capability

759
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,500
without letting, let's say, the fleet commander know

760
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,740
that, hey, while you're out there in that range,

761
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,940
I'm gonna be testing my stuff there and see how you react.

762
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,060
You don't do that, because you could have midair collisions,

763
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,300
flight safety issues.

764
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,860
I mean, that's why you have a joint staff,

765
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,420
to coordinate these type of things,

766
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,260
and say, look, I'm gonna do an exercise,

767
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,380
and if I wanna test a new capability,

768
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,580
I'm gonna do that in area 51.

769
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,820
I'm gonna do it out of the prying eyes of anybody

770
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,340
in a place that's safe, and oh, by the way,

771
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,140
if it crashes, I don't have to have

772
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,060
a recovery issue on my hands, right?

773
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,620
Where, what is he gonna see, and I have a big profile.

774
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,340
So, I don't, and we've already set for the record,

775
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,420
and certainly when I was in the government,

776
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,860
we looked at Blue Force capabilities.

777
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,220
We've got some pretty cool stuff.

778
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,060
I'll tell you that.

779
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,300
I mean, even area 51, though,

780
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,540
it's not, you're talking right after World War II,

781
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,460
objects going 13,000 miles an hour.

782
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,900
In low Earth atmosphere, right?

783
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,820
That's not, area 51 isn't big enough to conceal some of it.

784
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,420
No, that's my point.

785
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,020
That's exactly my point.

786
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,180
If you're gonna test a capability like that,

787
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,060
you'll go to Antarctica if you really have to, right?

788
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,260
Or you're gonna drop it from the bottom of B-52

789
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,940
at an altitude of 60,000 feet and test what you gotta test,

790
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
which, by the way, we've done.

791
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,740
The X-15 is a perfect example.

792
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,420
But we do it in a way that is,

793
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,060
it's safe and out of the prying eyes of people

794
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,900
that are not right onto the program.

795
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,060
You don't test it right off the coast of California

796
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,020
in the middle of a fleet exercise

797
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,500
with an aircraft carrier, dozens of destroyers

798
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,340
and support vehicles and submarines and F-18s.

799
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,380
You don't do that.

800
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,940
That's not how you conduct a classified program

801
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,500
because too many people see it.

802
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,700
So I think there's an argument there to be made that,

803
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,740
obviously I would rather this technology be ours

804
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,300
than Russian or Chinese,

805
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,540
but I think we're pretty clear now as a government,

806
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,980
it's not our technology.

807
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,780
And our government has already said from the record,

808
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,580
very senior people, this is not our technology.

809
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,300
So if it's not ours, it's somebody's, whose is it?

810
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,740
What's the X-15?

811
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,860
X-15 is a rocket powered aircraft.

812
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,220
So right on the heels of the supersonic age,

813
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,660
we had just, I think it was the X-1,

814
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,740
was the experimental aircraft that Chuck Yeager used

815
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,500
to break the sound barrier for the first time,

816
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,540
roughly 763 miles an hour at sea level, plus or minus.

817
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,140
The X-15 was a hypersonic vehicle

818
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,660
that was to take people into space, believe it or not.

819
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,940
In fact, the pilots have astronaut wings.

820
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,740
It is a, think of a long skinny pencil

821
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,500
with stubby wings on it.

822
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,940
Doesn't even have landing gear, it has skids.

823
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,420
And it's dropped from the wing of a B-52 at high altitude

824
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,180
and then accelerates up to hypersonic speeds

825
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,740
and goes to the upper limits of our atmosphere

826
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,980
and into a low earth orbit.

827
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,740
In fact, if you look at that platform, the X-15,

828
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,700
not only does it have wings and control surfaces,

829
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,540
but because it flies so high, it has to have thrusters.

830
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,060
It's just like a rocket, just like a space shuttle.

831
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,740
And that was really, when you look at how we were testing,

832
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,140
I think there were only six of those ever built.

833
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,580
They started off with twin 500,000 horsepower engines.

834
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,780
Then they switch it to a general electric

835
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,500
one million horsepower engine.

836
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,820
And in fact, there was even a death associated

837
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,900
with the X-15 because apparently it had an issue

838
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,740
with telemetry and it flew so high

839
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,380
that when it was coming back down to earth, it burned up.

840
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,820
It didn't reenter properly and unfortunately

841
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,900
the test pilot was killed.

842
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,980
But the X-15 was really our first early attempts

843
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,060
and you're talking maybe 4,000 miles.

844
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,940
So Mach 5 is hypersonics.

845
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,020
The definition of Mach 5 is supersonic,

846
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,420
which is the speed of sound, faster than the speed of sound,

847
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,180
roughly 760 some miles an hour at sea level.

848
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,780
Mach 5 is defined as five times the speed of sound.

849
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,020
So five times that speed.

850
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,580
So the X-15 was one of those preliminary early efforts

851
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,500
to get into the area of hypersonics, it was manned.

852
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,520
And so the X-15 was, and so when you compare that

853
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,720
to objects that are doing 10,000, 13,000 miles an hour,

854
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,740
and we had barely broken 4,000 miles an hour with the X-15,

855
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,340
again, who had that technology?

856
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,820
And more importantly, who had that technology

857
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,380
to deploy it over the United States?

858
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,340
Because we were seeing these things

859
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,420
and they've been reported over and over again

860
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,700
since the late 1940s.

861
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,580
There's a very interesting document, Sean,

862
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:47,380
I'll share with you, that really I think emphasizes

863
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,980
and later on in the interview,

864
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,660
if you want me to read it to you, I will.

865
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,180
There's a very interesting document

866
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,700
and the date of that document that really is,

867
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,020
I think rather profound and really demonstrates

868
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,220
that we're now dealing with our technology

869
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,500
or foreign adversarial technology.

870
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,340
Let's read it right now.

871
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,180
It'll be cheap.

872
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,220
We don't forget.

873
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,060
Actually, you know what?

874
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,980
It's on my phone and I don't have my phone here.

875
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,940
Let's take a break.

876
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,980
This episode is sponsored by Roca.

877
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,300
Roca is a performance eyewear brand

878
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,860
for people who want to invest in themselves.

879
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,140
Roca manufactures premium sunglasses,

880
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,620
prescription eyeglasses, and readers,

881
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,620
and cuts all of their lenses here in the U.S.

882
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,060
at their headquarters in Austin, Texas.

883
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,580
Roca recently partnered with one of my favorite guests,

884
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,540
Dr. Andrew Huberman, to launch a new line of glasses

885
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,260
called the Wine Down Collection.

886
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,140
Guys, I've tried these.

887
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,140
You know I have problems sleeping.

888
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,580
I absolutely love, love, love these frames and lenses.

889
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,820
They're available with and without prescription

890
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,300
and have a proprietary red lens

891
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,900
that helps filter out short wavelength light.

892
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,300
Short wavelength light is in pretty much

893
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,700
all artificial light and it's terrible for your sleep.

894
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,500
Roca let me try a pair of these things

895
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,380
and I can feel the difference whenever I wear them.

896
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,180
I wear them in the evening after the sun goes down.

897
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,660
I pretty much started at dinner and I wear it until bed.

898
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,140
And let me tell you, these things work.

899
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,700
With so many options in eyewear

900
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,500
and wellness products out there,

901
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,300
it's a relief to know the glasses I'm wearing

902
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,420
help two things I really care about,

903
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,460
my vision and my sleep.

904
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,860
And as a business owner with all the decisions

905
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,380
I already need to make every day,

906
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,420
wearing a pair of Roca's glasses

907
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,220
is one of the best ones I've made.

911
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,980
One of the most important ways to stay healthy

912
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,460
is cooking your own food.

913
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,220
The best way to start the new year

914
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,700
is with a home cooked meal

915
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,060
and hex clad makes that easier than ever.

916
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,260
Hex clad are hands down the best pans I've ever used.

917
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,300
Hex clad makes cooking so much more convenient.

918
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,220
I get the performance of stainless steel

919
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,420
in the convenience of nonstick in a single pan.

920
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,220
They're easy to clean, dishwasher safe

921
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,380
and simple to wipe off after use.

922
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,100
They're even oven safe up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.

923
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,500
The patented hexagon design is durable

924
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,780
and protects against scratches even from metal utensils.

925
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,100
Plus hex clad products come with a lifetime warranty.

926
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,780
They can literally last a lifetime.

927
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,860

Bon appetit.

935
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,420
Let's eat with hex clad's revolutionary cookware.

936
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,980
So I think Sean, you'd be really surprised

937
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,500
to know that there's historical documentation

938
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,340
that substantiates what we've been dealing with

939
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,580
and we've been dealing with it for quite a while.

940
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,100
So if I have your permission,

941
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,820
I'd like to read something out loud.

942
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,580
Yeah, let's do it, let's do it.

943
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,460
You have to forgive me, I need my old man glasses

944
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,300
because I am old, this is gray, not blonde.

945
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,340
I'm an old timer.

946
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,100
I'm also a lot slower than I used to be.

947
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,100
Tell me about it.

948
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,980
I got my kid a trampoline.

949
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,500
I tried to burn some energy off.

950
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,860
I got on there thinking like,

951
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,900
oh yeah, this will be great.

952
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,220
It's terrifying, isn't it?

953
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,220
My knees and dislocated my shoulder again.

954
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,220
Exactly.

955
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,180
I'm like, oh, I don't remember.

956
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,980
I don't remember this happening.

957
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,940
So I'd like to read to you just briefly a very,

958
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,020
it's a two page official document

959
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,320
and it's the, when you look at the letterhead,

960
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,860
it's headquarters United States Air Force Washington DC.

961
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,380
With another header, the Inspector General US Air Force,

962
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,620
I think it's 17th District Office of Special Investigations.

963
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,780
Is this the, before you read,

964
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,460
is this the one you were telling me downstairs

965
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,100
that hasn't been released to the public yet?

966
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,980
It has, well, a lot of people don't know about it.

967
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,980
It has been officially released and downgraded

968
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,580
from its classified original form

969
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,820
through the Freedom of Information Act.

970
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,180
But it's been lost to a lot of people.

971
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,820
A lot of people don't even know where it exists

972
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,620
and I've got a whole bunch of these.

973
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,220
But let me just read you one if I can

974
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,300
to kind of emphasize what I'm saying.

975
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,980
The subject of this memorandum,

976
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,940
basically from the Pentagon, right?

977
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,940
Summary of operations of aerial phenomenon

978
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,420
in the New Mexico area.

979
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,900
And I'm not gonna tell you the date yet.

980
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,760
In the first paragraph, it was determined

981
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,260
that the frequency of unexplained aerial phenomenon

982
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,900
in the New Mexico area was such

983
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,420
that an organized plan of reporting these observations

984
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,800
should be undertaken, right?

985
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,120
So they're seeing so many of these,

986
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,920
they need to start an investigation.

987
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,320
The observers of those phenomena include scientists,

988
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,560
special agents of the Office of Special Investigations,

989
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,140
Air Force, OSI, airline pilots, so civilian pilots,

990
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:12,880
military pilots, Los Alamos security inspectors,

991
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,240
military personnel, and many other persons

992
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,000
of various occupations whose reliability is not questioned.

993
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,960
So these are the best of SB1 security clearances

994
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,880
and whatnot, trained observers.

995
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,840
And they talk about some of the morphology

996
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,840
of these phenomena to include disks or variations thereof.

997
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,720
And so in the conclusion sentence,

998
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,280
which is paragraph six,

999
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,960
this summary of observations of aerial phenomenon

1000
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,680
has been prepared for the purposes of re-emphasizing,

1001
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,280
so obviously they wrote reports before this one,

1002
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,360
and reiterating the fact that phenomenon

1003
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,560
have continuously occurred in the New Mexico skies

1004
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,080
during the past 18 months and are continuing to occur.

1005
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,120
And secondly, that these phenomenon are occurring

1006
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,840
in the vicinity of sensitive military

1007
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,000
and government installations.

1008
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,840
Interesting.

1009
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,520
Now, what's the date of this report?

1010
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,680
25 May, 1950.

1011
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,080
That's from 1950?

1012
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,720
It is from 1950.

1013
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,280
And there are a treasure trove of these things

1014
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,040
that anybody can look at now and see.

1015
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,840
And this is not world according to Lou Elizondo.

1016
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,320
I'm not telling you this.

1017
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,920
Your government's telling you this, not me.

1018
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,000
The same government that later on told people,

1019
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,600
oh, nothing to see here, folks.

1020
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,520
In secret, they're saying there's a lot of things

1021
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,480
to see here, folks, and we gotta pay attention.

1022
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,540
Yeah, yeah.

1023
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,700
So therein lies the phenomenon.

1024
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,700
I wish we had recordings of people's reactions

1025
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,700
instead of like these fucking typed up reports

1026
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,020
that have to sound.

1027
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,220
Well, you can see in that last paragraph where it says,

1028
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,140
the purpose of this is to re-emphasize and restate, right?

1029
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,340
So you can sense the frustration

1030
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,220
that that action isn't being done.

1031
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,740
There's CIA documents that talk about

1032
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,300
how we're gonna go ahead and collect information

1033
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,140
on these things.

1034
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,780
There's radar reports, track reports,

1035
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,180
multiple radar systems, tracking these things

1036
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,500
to 13,000 miles an hour

1037
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,580
in a low earth atmosphere environment

1038
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,660
where the friction of air is,

1039
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,220
so put it this way, the SR7,

1040
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,940
the Lockheed YF-12A SR-71 Blackbird.

1041
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,740
When that thing is doing about 3,200 miles an hour,

1042
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,820
the entire aircraft had to be made out of titanium

1043
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,660
to keep the plane from melting

1044
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:31,860
because it gets so hot because it's flying at that speed.

1045
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,620
And in fact, the coolest part of that engine on the SR-71

1046
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,300
is that it's not just the engine,

1047
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,900
on the SR-71, they played it in gold,

1048
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,180
is 800 degrees Fahrenheit, right?

1049
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,340
Those are the, that's the heat you're talking about.

1050
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,500
Now, that's at 3,400 miles an hour.

1051
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,580
Imagine 13,000 miles an hour.

1052
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,740
And by the way, by the way, no signature.

1053
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,100
No sonic boom, no acoustic signature,

1054
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,220
no contrail like you see with a jet plane

1055
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,380
when you're flying at 33,000 feet.

1056
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,620
No signature at all.

1057
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,020
I got a question for you, totally off.

1058
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,540
You know, I was just thinking about the recording stuff

1059
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,260
and you've obviously been involved

1060
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,220
with a lot of the stuff.

1061
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,820
I know you can't talk about everything,

1062
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,500
but why is it always these fucking reports

1063
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,540
that have been, you know, I mean,

1064
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,580
what about the initial interview?

1065
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,940
You know, somebody goes out there

1066
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,300
and does the initial fucking interview.

1067
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,580
Why, why don't we have, where are those recordings?

1068
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,300
Rather than some bullshit, you know, typed up thing.

1069
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,340
Hey, this came from the interviewer.

1070
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,300
They got passed to the analyst.

1071
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,700
They got passed to the, whoever reports to the, whoever.

1072
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,580
You know, where are those initial recordings?

1073
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,860
Are they recorded?

1074
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,940
Well, sometimes, sometimes they're auto recordings.

1075
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,700
Sometimes they're written reports.

1076
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,420
Sometimes, so in this particular case,

1077
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,260
as you probably already-

1078
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,300
Because that would be the most descriptive account.

1079
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,140
Right.

1080
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,380
Well, from one person, keep in mind,

1081
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,820
you want to get all the different perspectives, right?

1082
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,060
So the idea of a report like this

1083
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,580
isn't to just give you one compelling story.

1084
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,340
It's to take all those reports

1085
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,460
that you're getting from various different,

1086
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:14,340
remember, pilots, OSI agents, military personnel, right?

1087
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,380
It's in the report.

1088
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,980
So obviously there's a lot of people reporting these things.

1089
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,300
And so this type of report is really an amalgamation

1090
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,620
of all those reports to send up to headquarters.

1091
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,620
What you don't typically do,

1092
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,660
and I can tell you this as a former special agent myself,

1093
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,500
in the field, when you're taking notes

1094
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,220
and you're writing reports,

1095
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,100
you understand that the report that you're writing

1096
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,980
isn't necessarily the one that's going to go to headquarters.

1097
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,180
The one that's going to go to headquarters

1098
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,020
is usually by the senior person

1099
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,300
who's taking all the reports

1100
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,460
and creates a comprehensive single report

1101
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,900
and says, this is what we're doing.

1102
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,940
So that two-page memorandum

1103
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,460
that I just read portions of,

1104
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,300
there's probably hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages

1105
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,060
that are used to substantiate that one report.

1106
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,580
So where are those documents?

1107
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,660
Well, they're usually in the hands

1108
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,940
of the investigative agency.

1109
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,220
So for example, whether it's Army or Air Force OSI,

1110
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,500
Army Counterintelligence, Air Force OSI,

1111
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,860
or Navy NCIS, right?

1112
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,740
They don't typically share those reports

1113
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,780
because some of them are what they call

1114
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,940
law enforcement sensitive.

1115
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,780
Some of them are intelligence sensitive.

1116
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,820
And a lot of them are very, very classified

1117
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,740
because you're talking to people in key positions

1118
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,740
who have key jobs.

1119
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,180
Maybe they're working on special access programs.

1120
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,020
So you've got to compartmentalize that information.

1121
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,580
And then in order to distribute that information

1122
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,900
up to the highest level,

1123
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,500
you've got to start whittling away

1124
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,940
some of the more sensitive information

1125
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,140
and say, here's the salient facts, here you go.

1126
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:29,980
It's just like when you go to court.

1127
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,020
I mean, I'm aware of that, you know,

1128
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,420
because of what I used to do.

1129
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,260
Exactly.

1130
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,260
But what I'm asking is, where do those go?

1131
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,740
Most of them, I think that old are probably gone.

1132
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,820
They're supposed to be archived.

1133
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,340
I can tell you when I, and this is, you know,

1134
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,220
God, I can't believe I'm gonna say this is

1135
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:50,220
one of my greatest, greatest disappointments to myself,

1136
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,100
professionally speaking.

1137
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,060
So when I was a young, younger agent,

1138
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,660
one of my jobs was to go to a particular military base

1139
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,940
where they had all the old archives of classified reports

1140
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,340
back to Korean War, Vietnam.

1141
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,660
And there was this huge archive in the basement

1142
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,220
of a particular office on Fort Meade,

1143
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,620
I won't say where it is,

1144
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,660
where the army and some other elements

1145
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,420
kept all their old historical reports,

1146
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,060
intelligence reports, talking to sources.

1147
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,720
It became so big and so cumbersome

1148
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,080
that there was an effort to try to digitize

1149
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,920
all of that.

1150
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,000
It couldn't be done, and this was in the day and age

1151
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,840
where we didn't really have very good technology.

1152
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,680
Everything had to be hand jammed into a machine

1153
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,760
and scanned and cataloged and blah, blah, blah, blah.

1154
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,140
So very labor intensive.

1155
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,280
So the army decided, okay, anything over 25 years old,

1156
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,320
unless it's obvious we need to keep it,

1157
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,480
we want you to shred it.

1158
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,720
And so one of my jobs was to go in to this place,

1159
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,600
into this huge room and go through file after file

1160
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,960
after file and shred stuff.

1161
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,840
And now we look back and say, wait a minute,

1162
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,240
that could be considered evidence.

1163
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,080
You're right.

1164
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,880
But that was what we were told to do.

1165
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,280
And it wasn't that they're trying to cover their butts.

1166
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,120
It's just too much.

1167
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,960
You had room after room after room of file cabinet,

1168
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,440
file after file cabinet of classified information

1169
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,760
that's 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 years old.

1170
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,600
And so-

1171
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,440
All right, what the FBI's doing right now

1172
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,760
before cash gets in.

1173
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,600
Well.

1174
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,480
God, I hope not.

1175
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,280
I hope that they're not doing that.

1176
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,480
But that's what was going on.

1177
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,440
So I suspect a lot of this may have just been lost.

1178
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,880
A lot of it may have been chewed up,

1179
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,420
burned up over the years, shredded.

1180
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,480
People that come and go,

1181
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,520
they put something in a safe,

1182
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,600
a five drawer security container with an XO10 lock on it.

1183
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,000
Someone forgets a combination.

1184
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,840
They drill it out.

1185
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,680
Oh, there's some documents here.

1186
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,760
Go ahead and shred the documents.

1187
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,240
These are from 25 years ago.

1188
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,280
Nobody cares.

1189
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,480
They don't even bother to look at it.

1190
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,320
Some of it just may be that incompetence.

1191
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,620
Maybe some of it is not,

1192
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,500
pretty sure a lot of it's not deliberate.

1193
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,840
People just don't know what the hell they're looking at.

1194
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,200
I see a project code name, Blue Phoenix.

1195
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,000
Okay, so I don't know what that is.

1196
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,240
Obviously, it's not that important.

1197
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,040
It's 35 years old, shredded.

1198
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,560
I mean, you're an investigative guy, right?

1199
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,000
Well, they said I used to be.

1200
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,240
I don't know if I could support it.

1201
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,840
You had mentioned ancient Egypt earlier,

1202
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,840
and it was just an analogy.

1203
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,680
What if we wanted there,

1204
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,820
and there was a 747 in one of the fucking pyramids?

1205
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,960
Look, is any,

1206
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,640
a lot of people think that the Egyptians,

1207
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:26,000
the ancient, whatever the tribe was,

1208
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,300
or the Peruvians,

1209
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,140
all these Easter Island had some kind of,

1210
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,480
that they were way more advanced

1211
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,040
than what they've been made out to be.

1212
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,240
I mean, they still can't explain

1213
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,220
how the pyramids were made.

1214
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,360
They got these underground caves

1215
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,080
that Graham Hancock kind of brought to life.

1216
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,080
I think they're in Turkey.

1217
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,120
It's like entire cities under the underground.

1218
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,440
I mean, is anybody looking back at that

1219
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,440
and trying to piece any of this stuff together?

1220
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,080
Great question.

1221
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,320
I think there's a lot of people

1222
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,600
on the outside of the government,

1223
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,440
and there certainly are.

1224
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,760
They see, they see.

1225
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,880
Nobody within.

1226
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,240
Well, let me get to that.

1227
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,740
Okay. I can't say that.

1228
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:08,360
So, you know, there's a lot of people

1229
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,800
trying to find congruencies.

1230
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,640
Can we see things in the old world

1231
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,880
and make some sort of analysis

1232
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,640
based upon what we know now

1233
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,920
and make compare and contrast capabilities?

1234
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,520
I can tell you when I was in ATIP program,

1235
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,600
several of us spent a good deal of our time

1236
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,720
looking at ancient script of human beings,

1237
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,160
whether it's ancient Sumerian and Cuneiform

1238
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,240
or hieroglyphics or runes

1239
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,480
and looking at a lot of different things

1240
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,120
because several of the UAP that we were investigating

1241
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,360
were reported to have some sort of writing on the outside.

1242
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,920
Now, that's very significant.

1243
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,240
Writing, runes, some sort of symbols.

1244
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,960
And so the idea was, is there a way to decipher these

1245
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,920
by looking at ancient human writing

1246
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,280
and see if there was any overlap?

1247
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,840
Was there ever a time where maybe

1248
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,760
some of that ancient script that we have

1249
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,100
was actually influenced by an external source,

1250
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,380
meaning someone saw something in the sky that landed

1251
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,440
and it had these writing on it,

1252
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,760
and therefore that inspired for them to write stuff.

1253
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,080
Are there any stories like that?

1254
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,560
Are there any cave paintings that maybe ancient humans

1255
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,080
came into contact with something?

1256
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,080
And if you look at the indigenous people

1257
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,200
here in the United States,

1258
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,800
they talk about the ant people,

1259
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,200
and some of their Genesis stories

1260
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,960
talks about things from out of there.

1261
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,200
And same with the Aboriginal people in Australia,

1262
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,600
some even in Africa,

1263
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:35,360
a lot of them have very similar type Genesis stories.

1264
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,640
So one of our efforts in ATIP

1265
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,120
was to look at ancient human texts in all various forms

1266
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,920
to see if there was any correlation.

1267
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,520
Now, interestingly enough,

1268
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,200
what the scientists that I was working with came up with,

1269
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,340
which now looking back seems obvious,

1270
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,560
but it wasn't obvious at the time,

1271
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,880
the mere fact that there is writing

1272
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,560
on some of these vehicles, whatever they are,

1273
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,920
can allow you to formulate several conclusions.

1274
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,360
One is, let me ask you, John,

1275
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:08,880
what do we use as humans?

1276
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,720
What is writing for?

1277
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,920
What do we use writing to do?

1278
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,800
Communication, documentation.

1279
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,320
Non-verbal communication, right?

1280
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,120
A thought, an idea, an order, something.

1281
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,040
We give you an order, write it down, right?

1282
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:19,880
I'm going to tell you something.

1283
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,120
I'm going to write it down in a document

1284
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,960
and give it to you, and it's indelible, it's there always.

1285
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,360
What do we use, what are we communicating?

1286
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,200
Well, it depends.

1287
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,520
Sometimes we're communicating,

1288
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,440
like if you go to a Jeep Jamboree

1289
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,880
and you see a sign that says,

1290
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,240
if you can read this, flip me over.

1291
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,480
I've turned over, or if you can read this,

1292
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,080
something went wrong, call home.

1293
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,400
Or it could mean something else,

1294
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,120
but it also means that whoever is using the writing,

1295
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,720
that human eyes, the way we look at eyes

1296
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,680
and the electro-optical spectrum,

1297
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,800
the way we look at data, whether it's a magazine

1298
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,360
or a report or whatever it might be,

1299
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,360
dictionary or Bible, you have to have eyes.

1300
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,640
That's why blind people use Braille,

1301
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,640
because they can't see, they can't read.

1302
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,760
So whoever wrote that, A, is smart enough to know that

1303
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,000
they want to communicate a message,

1304
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,840
and two, that whoever is going to read it

1305
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,840
has to have eyes of some sort,

1306
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,360
some sort of eye that can differentiate

1307
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,480
and actually see that and then interpret that

1308
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,240
as an actual message.

1309
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,760
And so that's a huge deal, because that's fundamentally,

1310
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,680
you're talking about a higher functioning brain,

1311
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,640
because there is no animal right now on Earth

1312
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,560
other than humans that use writing

1313
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,800
to communicate information and knowledge.

1314
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,640
That's a distinctly human thing

1315
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,400
that's a very high brain functioning thing,

1316
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,680
or at least for most people,

1317
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,800
a high functioning brain capability.

1318
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,800
And then it also means that whoever's reading it,

1319
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,600
the audience has to have eyes.

1320
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,920
So two fundamental things, whatever is behind these things,

1321
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,680
they have eyes of some sort,

1322
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,880
some way to visually see something,

1323
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,240
recognize it and interpret that information,

1324
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,200
and that they have a higher functioning part of the brain

1325
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,680
that can take those symbols

1326
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,440
and those symbols have a meaning.

1327
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,440
And so that was kind of a pretty big moment for us in ATIP,

1328
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,160
because we realized, hey,

1329
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,760
there's maybe a lot more similarity here than we think, right?

1330
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,560
There's some things that we share with something

1331
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,120
that seem to be only humans can do,

1332
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,680
and now it turns out that maybe something else can do too,

1333
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,960
or someone else can do too.

1334
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,240
So we do look at ancient,

1335
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,600
I know your question is more like about ancient technology

1336
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,080
and capability.

1337
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,000
Not necessarily, I mean, there's even that other,

1338
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,160
I can't, man, I'm gonna butcher her last name, Diana.

1339
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,000
Pasulka.

1340
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,360
Yes, Pasulka.

1341
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,840
Just interviewed her not long ago,

1342
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,920
we haven't released it yet,

1343
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,760
but I mean, she talks about a lot of the stuff

1344
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,320
within the Vatican and some of the, I mean.

1345
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,280
I've seen some of it, yeah, it legit.

1346
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,560
I had a senior academic share some information with me,

1347
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,160
and it was in Latin and it was a communication

1348
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,760
over 2,000 years old between a Roman soldier

1349
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,240
and a Roman general.

1350
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,720
And the Roman shield at the time,

1351
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,320
they called eclipus, eclipus in Latin means like eclipse,

1352
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,680
the sun, like the sun.

1353
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,080
And they discussed there how these flaming Roman shields

1354
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,640
in the sky were following them

1355
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,240
from battle space to battle space, right?

1356
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,160
Saucers, lenticular objects,

1357
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,960
so think about that for a minute.

1358
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,720
Going back to your point about ancient Egypt,

1359
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,600
look, you're absolutely correct.

1360
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,680
There's ancient knowledge

1361
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,200
that we don't know how it was done.

1362
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,280
Baghdad Battery, what the hell in Iraq

1363
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,320
were they building ancient batteries for?

1364
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,280
But that's exactly what it was.

1365
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,600
What do you mean ancient batteries?

1366
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,440
I don't know about that.

1367
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,240
Oh yeah, using copper and stoneware

1368
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,320
filled with a solution, probably orange juice,

1369
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,760
they were creating electric currents.

1370
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,120
You can look it up on your phone,

1371
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:44,960
you look it up on your computer,

1372
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,640
it's called the Baghdad Battery.

1373
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,400
This is before electricity supposedly was invented

1374
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,640
before we ever discovered something

1375
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,520
called the electromagnetic spectrum, an electron.

1376
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,880
And millennia ago, they were using it for something.

1377
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,080
They were creating electricity.

1378
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,480
It's called the Baghdad Battery.

1379
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,760
That's a fact, right?

1380
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,320
You can go, I just came back from England.

1381
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,440
And in the museum there, the British Museum,

1382
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,960
there's an entire Sumerian art collection there

1383
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,360
and there's a wall and I have pictures of it

1384
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,400
that depicts ancient Sumerian warriors doing what?

1385
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,480
Being frogmen, scuba diving underwater.

1386
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,320
They had this sack that they would hold

1387
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,200
and there's actually depictions of these people

1388
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,840
swimming underwater, breathing with these sacks.

1389
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,520
So it's easy to look back and say,

1390
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,280
oh, the ancient people that were basic,

1391
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,720
but can you build a pyramid?

1392
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,560
I can't.

1393
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,800
How much resources would it take now to build a pyramid?

1394
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,800
Yeah, you can go to Las Vegas

1395
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,520
and see one that kind of looks like one,

1396
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,920
but it's not a pyramid.

1397
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,880
You're talking millions of stones

1398
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,880
that are placed in an exact position,

1399
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,360
cut precisely with tooling that even to this day,

1400
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,760
we have a hard time replicating.

1401
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,000
With all the tunnels inside of it.

1402
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,320
With all the tunnels inside of that.

1403
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,880
Look at some of the H blocks down in Latin America,

1404
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,400
South America, in Pumapunku.

1405
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,000
Look at, there is an ancient technology.

1406
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,280
Look, go to Greece and at the base of the Parthenon,

1407
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,160
you'll see these huge, huge, huge stones

1408
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,880
that even today, we're not quite sure

1409
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,120
even some of our largest cranes would have that capability.

1410
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:22,040
The infrastructure required is enormous

1411
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,080
and there's other places around the world

1412
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:24,920
that are just like that.

1413
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,800
So, we can turn around and say,

1414
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,520
oh, ancient societies, they were primitive.

1415
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,200
Well, don't be so quick.

1416
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,160
I'll give you another case in point.

1417
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,040
There was a discovery done talking about Egypt

1418
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,560
about ancient mummies where they found traces

1419
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,840
of what in their bodies?

1420
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,120
Cocaine.

1421
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,880
Now, cocaine doesn't grow on that continent.

1422
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,480
It only grew in South America, the coca leaf, right?

1423
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,880
How in the hell is our coca leaf and the derivative of,

1424
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,880
the processing of, to create cocaine

1425
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,880
found in some mummies thousands of years ago in Egypt?

1426
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,840
So, you're saying these ancient mummies

1427
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,840
were partying with cocaine?

1428
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,680
I'm just kidding.

1429
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,880
Yeah.

1430
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,320
Careful.

1431
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,240
I don't know if they were partying with it,

1432
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,760
but anyways, my point is whether it was used

1433
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,320
for medicinal purposes or whatnot, but yes.

1434
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,880
So, that is a fact.

1435
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,720
You can see it.

1436
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,320
They pulled the traces up.

1437
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,160
How did that happen if these ancient trade routes

1438
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,000
didn't exist, right?

1439
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,040
There was no crossing the Atlantic Ocean

1440
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,400
or the Pacific Ocean.

1441
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,800
So, there's a lot of mystery with our ancients

1442
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,640
and our ancestors that I think it's foolhardy for us

1443
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,760
to just be dismissive and say,

1444
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,240
oh, they were primitive, they were savages.

1445
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,400
No, they weren't.

1446
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,840
Look at what the Aztecs were able to do with a calendar

1447
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,880
to predict even lunar cycles and to include eclipses.

1448
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,960
I couldn't do that now, but yet they were able to do it.

1449
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,440
So, I am not as dismissive,

1450
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,680
and this is why going back to ATIP

1451
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,920
and looking for UFOs, it was important for us to see

1452
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,120
if there was any context in which we could see

1453
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:09,040
any similarity, any inspiration that might have existed

1454
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:13,400
between ancient man and perhaps something else.

1455
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,640
So, there is government officials

1456
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,560
that are looking back at this stuff.

1457
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,760
I'm pretty sure there still are.

1458
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,160
I don't know if, I know we did.

1459
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,800
I can't say they are right now,

1460
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,360
but they'd be foolhardy not to.

1461
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,680
You have to do proper research

1462
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,560
if you really wanna solve a mystery.

1463
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,200
Yeah, now keep in mind, let me also say though,

1464
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,200
also in defense of some of the other folks who said

1465
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,040
we weren't interested in that very much

1466
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,760
because it didn't apply to today.

1467
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,880
When you know as well as I do,

1468
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,280
you're talking to a three or four-story general,

1469
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,760
I can't show up and say, hey boss,

1470
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,840
you need to see this document from 1950.

1471
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,280
They don't care.

1472
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,640
They wanna know what happened yesterday

1473
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,800
and what's happening today.

1474
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,640
Yeah, that's great, Lou,

1475
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,200
but I don't really care what happened 70 years ago.

1476
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,880
What happened to our F-18 yesterday

1477
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,680
that came into contact with a bogey?

1478
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:05,640
That's what I wanna know.

1479
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,280
I don't give a crap about that stuff.

1480
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,360
I care about this.

1481
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:12,000
So there is also that, this sense of urgency

1482
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,160
from an operational perspective,

1483
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,160
to keep it full from a national security perspective,

1484
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,120
you're really not gonna spend a whole lot of resources

1485
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,560
looking in the past as you are gonna be looking

1486
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,440
into the present and trying to predict the future

1487
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,120
from a military and a national security perspective.

1488
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:30,000
I don't care about Japan's use of a Mitsubishi Zero

1489
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,240
back in World War II as much as I care about

1490
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,240
maybe Chinese stealth technology being used today.

1491
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:44,400
I mean, usually I wait till the end

1492
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,800
to ask these kinds of questions,

1493
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,360
but what is this stuff?

1494
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,000
Is this nuts and bolts?

1495
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,480
Is this, I mean, I didn't realize

1496
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,080
that you were connected to how I put off.

1497
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:00,400
I've talked to Skip Atwater, Joe McMonigle.

1498
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,840
I've done a handful of these guys.

1499
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:06,520
Edwin May, Angela Ford.

1500
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:11,160
You know, I mean, I did not realize you were involved

1501
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,360
or whatever your involvement was with that.

1502
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,160
I mean, could this be,

1503
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,840
and I don't know what you know that you can't say.

1504
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,840
Is it nuts and bolts?

1505
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,840
Or could this be some type of collective consciousness

1506
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:33,440
that all of these experiencers are experiencing?

1507
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,640
I mean, we got Neuralink coming online,

1508
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,880
probably very soon.

1509
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,160
And I interviewed Andrew Huberman

1510
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,520
about we had a little bit of a talk about that

1511
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,960
and how it would technically be possible

1512
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,960
for with Neuralink to create an entire false reality.

1513
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,320
An entire false reality.

1514
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:59,320
Emotions, all of your senses, touch, taste, feel, feelings,

1515
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,520
vision, you know what I mean?

1516
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,440
That's one of the things Neuralink is gonna do

1517
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,240
is hopefully help blind see.

1518
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,640
I mean, is that a possibility?

1519
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,760
Is that what this could be?

1520
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,600
Or?

1521
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,320
It can be everything and all of it together.

1522
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,360
Then we've got Grush who's coming out saying

1523
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,480
that they have crash retrievals where,

1524
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,160
I mean, in everything so vague

1525
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,680
where we've recovered non-human biologics,

1526
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,720
is that the terminology that he used?

1527
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,120
I mean, that could be a deer carcass

1528
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,160
next to an airplane crash.

1529
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,360
I mean, I'm not saying that's what it is,

1530
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,840
but put a fancy term behind it,

1531
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,040
behind non-human biologics.

1532
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,080
Okay, well, is that a dead mouse?

1533
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,200
I mean, that doesn't really mean it.

1534
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,200
They're using non-human intelligence, NHI.

1535
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,800
So it's not just non-human biologics.

1536
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,720
It's non-human intelligence.

1537
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,960
What does that mean?

1538
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,400
Well, intelligence infers

1539
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,200
that there's a higher functioning of the brain, right?

1540
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,880
And there may even be,

1541
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,040
so to answer your question thoroughly,

1542
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,160
we first need to break down

1543
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,120
and have an agreement on certain terminology.

1544
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,600
So let's talk about, for example, consciousness.

1545
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,400
You hear that term used a lot, human consciousness.

1546
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,240
But what does that mean?

1547
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,000
If you go to somewhere in California out by the beach,

1548
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,760
and you hear someone say,

1549
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,600
yeah, man, the world is about to,

1550
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,600
the world is a bud about to blossom,

1551
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,720
and, you know, human consciousness, we're all together.

1552
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,160
Then you talk to a neuroscientist and they say,

1553
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,480
no, it's actually a quantum process.

1554
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,560
It's actually probably based in quantum entanglement,

1555
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,520
and human consciousness is something

1556
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,560
that is distinctly different

1557
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,320
than human intellect and human physical sense.

1558
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,080
There's another part of the human being,

1559
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,800
another component that makes us human,

1560
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,880
the size of brain and a body.

1561
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,560
So we have to first agree what that means.

1562
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,000
Secondly, we also have to understand

1563
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,680
that the human being is an incredibly complex organism.

1564
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,440
My background is micro, I went to school professionally

1565
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,160
to be a microbiologist and an immunologist.

1566
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,960
So I am a disciple of science.

1567
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,480
Always have been, always will be.

1568
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,960
I was never a science fiction kid.

1569
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,000
I always tell people I was more of a GI Joe kid

1570
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,520
than I was a Star Wars kid.

1571
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,520
So I was trained in science and empirical data collection,

1572
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,280
the scientific methods and principles.

1573
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,840
And then I became an agent, right?

1574
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,480
Which is just the facts man kind of guy.

1575
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,320
Just give me the data.

1576
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,760
I don't care what you think, I don't care how you feel.

1577
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,160
Give me the data, let's see what the data suggests.

1578
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,520
But I think we need to understand

1579
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,720
the notion of human consciousness.

1580
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:26,320
Our taxpayer dollars have been used to explore that idea

1581
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,400
over and over and over again,

1582
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,840
because there's enough information there

1583
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,880
to suggest that there is something

1584
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,000
to this human consciousness.

1585
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,440
Like again, remote viewing program with Stargate, right?

1586
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,600
We actually did that against the Russians

1587
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,800
and they did it against us

1588
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,200
and we did it against other targets.

1589
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,120
And to some degree there was some real success there,

1590
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,960
despite what some people may tell you.

1591
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,720
It was successful, it may still be.

1592
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,000
But with that said, let's take a quick exercise

1593
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,040
on human consciousness and trying to decipher

1594
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:58,880
what that means.

1595
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,280
You said you have a daughter, right?

1596
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,240
Mm-hmm.

1597
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,640
Do you love your daughter?

1598
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,520
Very much.

1599
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,040
Absolutely, and so do I.

1600
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,840
But what if I said to you, prove it.

1601
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,160
Prove it to me you love your daughter.

1602
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,920
How do you know what it is and what is love?

1603
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:12,960
I mean we all feel it, right?

1604
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,200
But how do you know you really love your daughter?

1605
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,760
Well, you can't prove it,

1606
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:20,080
because it's something that we all recognize as being real,

1607
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,000
as part of us and our existence and our experience,

1608
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,360
but it's really hard to define.

1609
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,200
And you just know it.

1610
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,280
And of course I love my daughter.

1611
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,120
I'll do anything for my daughter.

1612
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,000
I'll die for my daughter.

1613
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:29,840
But prove it.

1614
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,280
Well, dying for my daughter isn't proving I love her,

1615
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,840
it's just proving that I'm dying.

1616
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,360
So how do you do that?

1617
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,360
How do you define something

1618
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,840
that is inherently so hard to define?

1619
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,560
And so right now, take that conversation

1620
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,880
and apply it to all of human consciousness.

1621
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,480
What is consciousness?

1622
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,400
What is it even, right?

1623
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,400
And is it possible that human beings

1624
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,560
have something indelible beyond the body and the mind?

1625
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,040
Something that lives beyond,

1626
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,240
something that is greater than the physical sense

1627
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,360
and the intellectual sense?

1628
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,760
Look, you and I are, if you compare us to a banana,

1629
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,440
I think we share like 75% of our DNA with a banana,

1630
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,920
and like 99% of it with a chimpanzee.

1631
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,760
But if you were to compare our DNA,

1632
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,680
yeah, there's some differences,

1633
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,520
but for the most part, we both have two arms, two legs,

1634
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,720
and fingers, and two eyes, and bilateral symmetry.

1635
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:23,120
So we're not really physically that different, you know?

1636
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,640
And then if I asked you about your brain,

1637
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,080
well, maybe it's a brain that makes Sean Ryan

1638
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,080
who Sean Ryan is, well, okay,

1639
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,480
but if you look at the neural pathways

1640
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,920
and you go to a neurosurgeon,

1641
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,040
they're kind of the same as mine,

1642
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,560
and medulla oblongata, and the frontal cortex,

1643
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,080
and the parts of the brain are pretty consistent

1644
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:38,960
throughout other humans.

1645
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,280
That's why we can do brain surgery.

1646
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,720
You know how things are wired for the most part.

1647
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,240
So that's not what separates us.

1648
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,120
What makes Sean Ryan Sean Ryan?

1649
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,600
What makes Sean Ryan willing to go to battle

1650
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,120
and go to war and potentially die for his country?

1651
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,800
Or Luis Elizondo to do what he does?

1652
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,360
Well, that's the question.

1653
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,240
Is that where human consciousness lies?

1654
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,760
Is that where human sentience is?

1655
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,040
And is that something that is shared

1656
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,280
with other higher life forms,

1657
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,880
or is it specifically humans?

1658
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,400
I have five German shepherds, love them,

1659
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,200
and they all have human names,

1660
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,040
but let's face it, they're not really humans.

1661
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,720
And I talk to them like babies,

1662
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,560
because that's what we do,

1663
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,320
oh, you such a cute little pie, right?

1664
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,080
But in reality, it's a dog.

1665
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,360
Now, it's not a human,

1666
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,800
but because we are anthropomorphic creatures,

1667
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,960
because everything we do,

1668
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,600
we judge our entire sense of reality

1669
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,560
based upon what we know and who we are.

1670
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,440
So we superimpose that on other things that are alive.

1671
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,080
And sometimes even not alive.

1672
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,760
Why people refer to their boats as a her, right?

1673
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,800
Oh, she's a beautiful boat.

1674
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,120
Because that's what we do innately.

1675
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,080
We are trying to ascribe something else

1676
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,200
with our own values and attributes.

1677
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,760
It's just what we do instinctually.

1678
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,160
So when you're dealing with something

1679
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,840
that is potentially truly non-human,

1680
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,620
true potentially non-human and not earthly,

1681
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,760
how do you deal with something like that?

1682
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,200
Well, the only way you know how

1683
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,280
is by ascribing human attributes to it.

1684
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,240
You say, well, they're maybe motivated like us

1685
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,360
and they're scared like us

1686
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,760
and they have whatever biases they have.

1687
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,600
We have those too.

1688
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,960
And it's a way for us to relate to something

1689
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:21,800
that is, it's a way for us to know the unknowable potentially.

1690
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,180
And so when we talk about human consciousness

1691
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,260
and is it possible that these things

1692
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:31,320
are also part of a larger consciousness network?

1693
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,600
Well, it's possible.

1694
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:36,160
It's possible everything sentient has that.

1695
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,000
You have societies that will refer to that

1696
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,720
as a soul or a chi or an id

1697
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,320
or whatever name you wanna put on a spirit.

1698
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,880
But is that what really needs to be human?

1699
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:51,400
Because this is not really any different than yours.

1700
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,080
There's something else that makes Sean Ryan

1701
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,120
who Sean Ryan is.

1702
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,440
And it's not your physical self

1703
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,800
and it's maybe not even your brain.

1704
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,720
So that's part of the discussion.

1705
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,760
And then, you talked about about

1706
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,160
the five fundamental senses

1707
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,600
in which we judge our environment in the universe.

1708
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,600
And for millennia, look, Homo sapiens sapien

1709
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,160
in modern format has been around,

1710
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,320
thought to most anthropologists,

1711
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,560
maybe the last two to 400,000 years.

1712
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,640
Earth has been around for four and a half billion years.

1713
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,120
So modern humans have only been here in a blink of an eye.

1714
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,240
Really just poof, just say, I popped in and here we are.

1715
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,240
We have five fundamental senses

1716
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,820
by which we judge our environment.

1717
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,040
And in fact, the way we process information.

1718
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,440
And if you can't touch it, taste it here,

1719
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,440
smell it, et cetera, we don't know it's there.

1720
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,400
In fact, it's one of the reasons

1721
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,280
why we use radio telescopes.

1722
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,040
Where I live in Wyoming, beautiful,

1723
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,320
unincluded night sky, so see all the stars in the heavens.

1724
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,160
And yet when you look at that same part of the night sky

1725
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,960
through a radio telescope, what do you see?

1726
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,320
Oh, you see all sorts of new stuff.

1727
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,280
You see Magellanic clouds and you see nebula,

1728
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,840
things that you can't pick up with the human eye.

1729
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:54,720
In fact, most of space lies beyond our ability

1730
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,600
to directly perceive it.

1731
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,800
If you look at the electro-optical spectrum

1732
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,240
between red and blue, the way we see the universe,

1733
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:06,680
that's only 0.0035% of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

1734
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:11,680
Again, 0.0035% of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

1735
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,040
That little narrow sliver of window,

1736
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,260
that's how we perceive our reality.

1737
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,840
So most of reality lies beyond that.

1738
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,400
Imagine if you had cell phone signal or your cell phone

1739
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,480
vision and now you could see in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

1740
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,320
and you could see in FM and AM and GPS,

1741
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,840
your perception of reality would be different,

1742
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,320
fundamentally different, and your awareness

1743
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,360
would be different than what it is right now.

1744
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,800
And then you have a scalability issue as human beings.

1745
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,800
If you look, I tell people, if you really wanna

1746
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,360
get your mind blown, type up on Google

1747
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:48,000
or any search engine the words pale blue dot.

1748
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,140
And what you're gonna see is this black inky blackness

1749
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,880
and right in the middle about maybe two pixels large,

1750
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,840
a little blue fuzzy dot.

1751
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,920
What that dot is, is when we sent out the Voyager spacecraft

1752
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,640
on one of its last commands, we told it,

1753
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,360
turn around and take a picture of home, of Earth.

1754
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,040
Everything you have ever known, you've ever learned,

1755
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,200
everything you ever loved, everything you ever feared,

1756
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,740
every person that ever lived in history,

1757
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,220
every person that ever died, ever,

1758
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:17,180
is all on that tiny little blue dot,

1759
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:20,220
hurling through the vacuum in inky blackness of space.

1760
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,900
Now, that's uncomfortable for some people to think about.

1761
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,780
And then when you think about the size of the universe,

1762
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:30,340
modern right now, most astrophysicists and cosmologists

1763
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:32,940
agree that the visible horizon,

1764
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,780
meaning as far as we can see in any direction,

1765
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,700
from one end to the end of the universe,

1766
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:40,220
is about 40 billion, B billion light years.

1767
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,060
Now what's a light year?

1768
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:44,240
It's the time it takes and the distance traveled

1769
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,980
by a photon of light in one year.

1770
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:49,020
So how fast does light actually travel?

1771
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:52,820
186,000 miles per second.

1772
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:55,300
That's seven and a half times around our planet

1773
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,400
in one second.

1774
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:00,540
Multiply that to a year and now multiply that

1775
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:03,740
to 40 billion years, right?

1776
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,020
That is an enormous distance.

1777
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:10,700
And that's only 10% of the actual size of the universe

1778
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,460
as predicted now by some scientists

1779
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,660
because most of the universe is too big,

1780
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:17,100
it's too far away, the light will never reach Earth.

1781
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,660
So now you're talking about a universe

1782
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:21,060
100 billion light years and human beings

1783
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,900
is infinitesimally small, right in the middle, right?

1784
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,940
As mind blowing as that is,

1785
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:29,140
if you take one hydrogen atom,

1786
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:33,620
Avogadro's number, 6.23 or 6.28 times 10

1787
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:37,160
to the negative 23 in size,

1788
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,780
that's roughly the same magnitude, order of magnitude

1789
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:44,220
that atom is to us as we are to the universe.

1790
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,220
Meaning we sit right in the middle

1791
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,100
of the scale of the universe.

1792
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,600
And mostly we can only interact as human beings

1793
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,060
with one order of magnitude

1794
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,100
or two orders of magnitude up or down.

1795
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,060
Otherwise, simply the universe is too big or too small.

1796
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,420
We will never know.

1797
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:01,820
And that's where most of reality actually lies.

1798
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:03,180
So for us to sit here and say,

1799
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:06,340
well, you know, these things and they can't possibly be this

1800
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,460
and we know nothing.

1801
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,620
Our perception of the universe is so limited.

1802
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,460
It's like trying to look at the Grand Canyon

1803
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,580
through a soda straw.

1804
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,740
It's incomprehensibly large and complex

1805
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:20,020
and we're always learning something new

1806
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:23,180
about our universe and our place in our universe.

1807
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,060
And so when you talk about human consciousness,

1808
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:26,420
I know this is a very long-winded way

1809
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,620
to have the conversation, but it's important

1810
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,540
because we don't understand consciousness.

1811
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:32,560
We don't understand how it works, right?

1812
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,900
If it's really part of quantum entanglement

1813
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,220
and where space and time is irrelevant,

1814
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:40,180
we live in a three-dimensional space with three axes, right?

1815
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:42,260
X, Y, Z and axis plus time

1816
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,500
as a function of the fourth dimension.

1817
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,620
Well, we experience time linearly,

1818
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:49,460
unlike space where we can experience it three-dimensionally.

1819
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:52,100
For the most part, human beings experience time linearly,

1820
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,300
meaning it's one way,

1821
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,660
but is that really the way time works?

1822
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,880
Well, we know time is relative

1823
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,900
because GPS satellites that have an atomic cesium clock

1824
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,920
on board, which is the exact same atomic cesium clock

1825
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,460
we have at the ground station,

1826
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,100
we started noticing something very weird.

1827
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,900
We had something called atomic drift,

1828
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,740
meaning depending how far the satellite was,

1829
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:14,340
the GPS satellite was from the surface of the earth,

1830
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:17,540
the more there was a deviation in the time

1831
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,860
on that atomic cesium clock.

1832
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:21,180
Now, how is that possible if the atomic decay,

1833
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:22,620
your half-life is exactly the same

1834
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,860
as the one on the ground?

1835
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,580
The reason is because time,

1836
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:28,100
the further you get away from a massive object,

1837
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,460
time gets, time runs at a different rate,

1838
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,220
literally at a different rate.

1839
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,500
And so we now know that the very notion of time

1840
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,420
isn't actually linear.

1841
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:40,900
And so I've often explained human consciousness,

1842
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,220
potentially, this is just, I don't know this for sure,

1843
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:47,380
this is kind of the way I've experienced it,

1844
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,780
and especially if you talk to some remote viewers.

1845
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:53,180
You can imagine, if I were to ask you a question, Sean,

1846
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:57,980
I say, Sean, give me your simplest and less than a sentence,

1847
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:58,980
few words as possible.

1848
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,620
If I were to ask you, Sean,

1849
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:02,700
what's your definition of the past?

1850
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,520
What would it be?

1851
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,460
And it's not a trick question,

1852
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,700
you can answer it any way you want.

1853
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:07,860
As simply as possible.

1854
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,340
Definition of the past.

1855
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:11,180
Definition of the past.

1856
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:12,860
What's your definition of the past?

1857
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:14,780
Prior experience.

1858
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:17,060
Right, something that already happened, right?

1859
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:17,900
It already happened.

1860
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,460
And by that same definition, if I ask you, Sean,

1861
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:21,740
what's your definition of the future?

1862
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:22,580
What would it be?

1863
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:23,420
What's going to happen?

1864
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:24,240
What's going to happen?

1865
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,080
It hasn't happened yet, right?

1866
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:28,140
So very simple, it already happened, it's going to happen.

1867
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,700
So by those definitions,

1868
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,080
if I say that I'll define for me the present, what is it?

1869
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,820
Well, the present isn't a moment of time.

1870
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,120
It's actually a transition process

1871
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,240
where the future becomes the past.

1872
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:42,360
And it happens so quickly and so fast

1873
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,440
that it's probably measured better in playing time

1874
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:47,260
than in actual human seconds.

1875
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:51,480
And it's not really a point, it's a process.

1876
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,280
And so if you look at, for example,

1877
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,240
let's look at a cigar, where the ashes,

1878
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,400
I've used this example before,

1879
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,360
where the ashes of a cigar is the past.

1880
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,680
It's already been burnt up, that's it.

1881
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,120
You can't put it back together.

1882
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,640
The future is that part of the cigar that hasn't burned yet.

1883
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:09,000
And the present is the cherry.

1884
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,840
It's that moment of ignition

1885
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,800
where the tobacco is being consumed and turned into ash.

1886
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,600
Now, if you had the ability to look very carefully

1887
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,120
at the cherry of that cigar burning,

1888
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,760
you'd notice something very strange.

1889
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,160
Once you remove the glare and really focused in,

1890
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:25,040
you'd notice that the cherry of that cigar, the cigarette,

1891
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,640
is burning unevenly,

1892
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,640
meaning if you could get in there and squeeze inside

1893
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,300
and look, you would see that there are parts of that cigar

1894
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,520
that are igniting and becoming ash before other parts.

1895
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,240
And you can actually have parts

1896
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,800
that have not yet been consumed

1897
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,000
behind parts that have been consumed.

1898
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,940
There's this weird fuzziness there,

1899
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:46,040
and it's why some now, some physicists theorize

1900
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,640
what they call the atomic,

1901
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,240
I'm sorry, the electron cloud.

1902
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,140
When you and I were in school,

1903
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:54,360
we learned that an electron orbits an atom.

1904
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,440
That's not actually what's happening.

1905
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,560
We now realize it's a cloud.

1906
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,500
It's the electron is both there

1907
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,880
and not all at the same time.

1908
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,800
It's this weird duality principle

1909
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,280
because scientists believe that at that small of a level,

1910
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,800
the electrons are so small

1911
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,580
that they're actually able to zip in and out of reality.

1912
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:11,920
The fabric itself of space-time,

1913
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,720
they're so small they can zip in and out of.

1914
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,160
And so they're everywhere and nowhere all at the same time.

1915
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,560
This is kind of more into the more quantum physics models

1916
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,200
of our understanding of the very, very small of our universe.

1917
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,000
It may even apply to the very, very large,

1918
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,960
but also may apply to human consciousness,

1919
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:29,680
which may explain why we invested so much time and money

1920
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,760
into things like remote viewing

1921
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:35,000
because if my brain is quantumly connected to your brain,

1922
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,960
then it doesn't matter how far away you are

1923
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,880
or what time it is, we can always connect.

1924
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:43,000
And maybe that is, as some neuroscientists have speculated

1925
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,080
that human consciousness is actually a quantum process.

1926
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,320
It's actually, your brain is like a quantum computer.

1927
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,360
And that's where, that's the realm, that's the domain

1928
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,720
in which human consciousness lives.

1929
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,800
And if that's the case,

1930
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,480
is it possible other higher forms of life

1931
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,560
also have that ability

1932
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,680
and that is actually not unique at all.

1933
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,480
In fact, when you see two dogs enter a room,

1934
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,720
as some have speculated,

1935
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:08,720
there's some sort of nonverbal communication going on.

1936
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,320
We don't understand it, but they do.

1937
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,960
And is it possible that human consciousness

1938
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,280
is really not that unique or special?

1939
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:21,160
In fact, many forms of life share that consciousness,

1940
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:24,360
a consciousness, and have the ability to communicate.

1941
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,800
Maybe things like remote viewing

1942
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,520
are actually vestigial capabilities,

1943
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,560
meaning it's nothing new,

1944
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,120
we're not evolving to become superhumans.

1945
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,280
We've always had this, in fact,

1946
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,240
before we had verbal communication

1947
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,760
that is now global and virtually any language

1948
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,840
I can look up and translate.

1949
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,320
Perhaps it was a survival technique.

1950
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,360
Perhaps we needed this type of ability to communicate

1951
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:48,920
and transmit information for our very survival.

1952
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:51,320
Well, Joe McMonigal talks about this a little bit

1953
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,280
when I interviewed him.

1954
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,400
He talks about before there was language,

1955
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,200
before there was pointing and grunting,

1956
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:00,400
that it was, that basically language

1957
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,120
has made us a lot more, we're not as efficient.

1958
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:05,840
As we used to be.

1959
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,680
Correct.

1960
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:10,160
And the communications, while there were no words,

1961
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,360
it was a lot more efficient.

1962
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,440
I knew what you were thinking, you knew what I was thinking.

1963
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,680
People say, well, that's a bunch of hooey.

1964
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:15,520
We're doing it now.

1965
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:19,040
We can put on helmets and you can have an Air Force pilot

1966
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,880
sitting in a room with his thoughts, be able to fly a drone.

1967
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,720
Talk about video games and these people

1968
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,680
that are really good gamers.

1969
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,360
It was only a few months ago that a gentleman,

1970
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,680
a quadriplegic, had a chip put in his brain

1971
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,320
and now he can play Call of Duty, of all games,

1972
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,840
better than most professional Call of Duty players.

1973
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:37,680
Why?

1974
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:40,480
Because it's a direct interface between thought to action.

1975
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,360
There's no neurons and neural pathways

1976
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:47,280
and having to translate electrical signals

1977
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,560
into motor signals, right, which is inefficient.

1978
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:52,860
It's just direct, boom, brain to the interface, to the game,

1979
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,280
which is arguably much more efficient, much faster.

1980
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,440
Would that not be the preferred way

1981
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,800
if you had an ability of seeing this wonderful portrait

1982
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,720
of you in a helicopter up there?

1983
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,080
Imagine being able to fly that helicopter

1984
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,320
without ever having to touch anything and it's instant.

1985
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,360
That helicopter goes exactly where you want it to go,

1986
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,320
when you want it to go and how you want it to go, right?

1987
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,880
All with this.

1988
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,520
Well, technology, don't look now,

1989
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,600
but we're getting close to that now.

1990
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,400
We can almost do that now.

1991
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:26,480
You have technical interfaces that are helping people

1992
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,640
do things now that were never even imaginable

1993
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:29,840
five years ago.

1994
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,600
So we're almost there now.

1995
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,980
Here's something I'd love to tell us Americans

1996
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:38,480
to get better at this year.

1997
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:42,440
Something that our international friends beat us at in spades,

1998
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,080
speaking more than one language.

1999
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:48,540
And you can get fluent sooner than you think with Babel.

2000
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:51,520
This year, find a whole new voice with Babel,

2001
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,600
the language learning app that gets you talking.

2002
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,880
Learning a new language is one of the best ways

2003
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,040
to understand the world around you.

2004
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,120
With a focus on conversation,

2005
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,720
you'll be ready to talk wherever you go.

2006
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,640
And if you watch my show,

2007
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,440
you'll know I've spent a lot of time in dangerous places

2008
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,840
all over the world.

2009
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,360
Being able to speak the language was a lifesaver

2010
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,860
more times than I can even begin to count.

2011
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:18,060

January's almost over, and so is your chance

2019
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,300
to save on a Helix mattress

2020
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:47,680
while getting the very best sleep of your life.

2021
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,960
If you're dealing with snoring, back pain, sleep apnea,

2022
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,280
or if you sleep too hot,

2023
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,400
Helix mattress can help with all of that.

2024
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,060

me included, with their Helix mattresses.

2027
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,240
You know, a good night's sleep is one of the best ways

2028
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,880
to have a better quality of life.

2029
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,020
I know that Helix helps me get plenty of rest every night.

2030
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,240
It's really been a game changer for me.

2031
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,920
Helix is dedicated to helping everyone sleep better

2032
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,240

2039
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:41,240
So to say, well, that's a bunch of hooey.

2040
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,360
That technology would never exist.

2041
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,200
Hey, buddy, have you seen the news lately, right?

2042
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:50,220
So I think you're right.

2043
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,240
And I think going back to the original question you had,

2044
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:56,200
which is, I know, forgive me, way, way, way around,

2045
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,400
but it's important because we're talking about,

2046
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,640
you asked me, is this technological?

2047
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:01,960
Is it consciousness?

2048
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,080
Could this all be related?

2049
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,120
What do I think about when people say that?

2050
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:08,000
You know, we have to, there's a lot we have to unpack here.

2051
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,300
We have to discuss what is consciousness?

2052
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:14,920
Is it something that is universal or is it just for humans?

2053
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:19,920
And is it the thing that is mainly makes life life?

2054
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,400
And those are all really relevant questions.

2055
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:27,040
I can't answer that because I simply don't know.

2056
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:31,560
All I can do is provide for you my own experiences

2057
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,120
and some of the work that we did in ATIP

2058
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,640
and some other efforts.

2059
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,840
But I think the jury is still out.

2060
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,480
And I think in order to have that conversation,

2061
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,320
we first of all have to agree what it means.

2062
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,480
Even terms like something like consciousness

2063
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,800
because different people will interpret that word

2064
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,200
to mean something else.

2065
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,320
It's like love, right?

2066
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:54,000
I love my job, I love my car.

2067
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,880
Well, I love my kids.

2068
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:55,960
Well, that's a different type of love.

2069
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,120
Well, wait a minute, love is love.

2070
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,280
No, it's not.

2071
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,320
Love isn't love.

2072
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,200
I love chocolate, but I don't love chocolate

2073
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,640
like I love my kids, right?

2074
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:06,960
And I love my wife differently than I love other folks

2075
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,080
and other things.

2076
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,040
So maybe consciousness is the same way.

2077
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,640
Maybe there's not a single definition

2078
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,520
for what consciousness is.

2079
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,320
And I think that's part of it

2080
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,800
because we're trying to talk the same language,

2081
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,880
but in there, some of those words

2082
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,280
don't have the same universal meaning for every one of us,

2083
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,280
if that makes sense.

2084
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:26,800
Does make sense.

2085
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,240
How involved were you with the Stargate program?

2086
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,120
What I'm comfortable to talk about

2087
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,960
is that early in my career,

2088
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:38,020
I was brought into a very interesting program.

2089
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,600
The gentleman's name was Eugene Lesman.

2090
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,120
He was probably the top, at the time,

2091
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,920
the top remote viewer for the United States Army.

2092
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:50,160
And that was my first experience.

2093
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,800
I was brought into a very strange program

2094
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:58,640
early in my career after getting out of the Army.

2095
01:31:58,640 --> 01:31:59,680
I didn't understand it.

2096
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:02,400
I didn't know what they wanted from me.

2097
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:07,400
Eugene had me do some things,

2098
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,840
I guess, to testify I was a good candidate.

2099
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,240
And then very shortly thereafter,

2100
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,200
the program had the plug pulled,

2101
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:19,240
the funding was pulled permanently,

2102
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,920
and I wound up having a regular, normal job.

2103
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,040
So you were gonna be a remote viewer?

2104
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,840
Well, I got trained to do some of it, yeah.

2105
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,040
I didn't say I was a good one.

2106
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,200
There's guys out there a lot better,

2107
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,240
and gals a lot better than I was,

2108
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,040
but I can tell you it works.

2109
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,840
And Hal Pudoff, I'm not gonna,

2110
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,720
if you ever interview Hal Pudoff,

2111
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,160
say, hey, Lou, wanted me to ask you

2112
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,240
about the whole DC Metro incident on the Red Line,

2113
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,920
and let him tell you the story.

2114
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,200
Maybe you can connect me with him.

2115
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,920
Absolutely, absolutely.

2116
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,080
Yeah, he's an incredible human being.

2117
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,800
Him, another person, if you ever could get,

2118
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,000
Dr. Kit Green, Christopher Green, we call him Kit.

2119
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,600
Kit worked with me, and Hal worked with me on A-Tip.

2120
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:03,800
The US government has had a long interest in remote viewing.

2121
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,200
I know some people find it funny,

2122
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,880
but we didn't stop that.

2123
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:13,160
I can't, I would not be able to elaborate

2124
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:16,280
if there's any programs that exist or don't exist anymore.

2125
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:20,120
But, look, it makes sense that if something works,

2126
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:20,960
you don't stop.

2127
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,200
I know, we didn't stop that.

2128
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,720
But, I mean, where I was going is,

2129
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:31,720
what do you make about, I mean, Edwin May said that,

2130
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,240
I believe, don't quote me on this,

2131
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:36,280
you can go back and look the interview up.

2132
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,000
I believe Edwin May told me that

2133
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:43,240
remote viewers are only correct less than 40% of the time.

2134
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,520
Well, what's correct, right?

2135
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,960
So, if you ask me to predict a lottery number.

2136
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,360
He says what's correct is what can be verified,

2137
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,920
which I would tend to agree with.

2138
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:52,760
Sure.

2139
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:56,240
You know, and Joe had two that stick out to me.

2140
01:33:56,240 --> 01:34:01,080
He remote viewed a mountain in Alaska.

2141
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:03,480
I believe it was in Alaska where they said that there,

2142
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:08,480
he remote viewed some kind of non-human beings

2143
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,040
inside of a mountain.

2144
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,400
Sounded like basically like some type of a space center.

2145
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,240
How about this?

2146
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,600
Let me ask you this, Sean, and we'll get back to that

2147
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:17,800
because Joe McMongol and those guys

2148
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,720
really know their shit, their stuff.

2149
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:23,120
Let me ask you, let's say someone remote viewed you

2150
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,440
and said, you got into a motorcycle accident

2151
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:27,600
when you were younger.

2152
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,640
It was a pretty bad motorcycle accident.

2153
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,080
Total your motorcycle.

2154
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:36,760
And it was an Enduro Yamaha motorcycle.

2155
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,720
And you turned around and said,

2156
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,040
no, actually it was a Honda or a Kawasaki.

2157
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,280
Is that person right or wrong?

2158
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,840
They didn't get Kawasaki right,

2159
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,160
but they got everything else right

2160
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:46,880
to include the injury that you sustained

2161
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,480
and the fact that you total your little Enduro motorcycle.

2162
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,400
So, this is my point when they say,

2163
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,200
well, they weren't accurate.

2164
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,680
Well, what's accurate?

2165
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:57,480
That they got 90% of it right and 10% wrong?

2166
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,480
So, again, it goes back to the metric

2167
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,120
that's being used to say something's right.

2168
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,200
I will tell you that in my experience,

2169
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,840
some of this stuff was off target,

2170
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,560
but some of the stuff was dead on.

2171
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,960
And I mean, dead on to the point

2172
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,680
where the United States actually successfully located

2173
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:16,080
a down Russian supersonic test plane that was being flown

2174
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,960
and it crashed over the Congo over in Africa.

2175
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,840
And no matter what, all the satellites we used

2176
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,120
and airplanes, we couldn't find it

2177
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,280
and neither could the Russians.

2178
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,100
Who found it?

2179
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:24,280
Remote viewers.

2180
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,920
Look at the story behind General Dozier

2181
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,040
and Brigada Rosa, Red Brigade,

2182
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,000
and the killing of Aldo Moro,

2183
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,800
who was at the time the president of Italy.

2184
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,460
And then they captured and they kidnapped General Dozier.

2185
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,020
And they were gonna kill him.

2186
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:41,900
And remote viewers got pretty close

2187
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:43,000
to being able to locate him.

2188
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,080
If you look at what they were doing,

2189
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,800
they got damn close and some actually say

2190
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,600
that's the reason why he was saved.

2191
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:52,000
Remote viewing can be very effective.

2192
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,800
But it's like any other collection data point.

2193
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,960
There's bias.

2194
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:56,960
There's collection bias.

2195
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,000
And then you also have other issues.

2196
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,200
You have interference.

2197
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,080
You know, the human being,

2198
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,880
that's why I say remote viewing should never be taken

2199
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:07,160
as a single source intelligence capability.

2200
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,200
It should be there as an additive capability, right?

2201
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,880
So just like when you're collecting intelligence now,

2202
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:13,800
you have a human source,

2203
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,400
but you never just go with human.

2204
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,080
You go with SIGINT, you go with ELINT,

2205
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:20,560
you go with whatever other ints you need,

2206
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,360
intelligence collection capabilities to bolster

2207
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,880
or to negate pieces of information that you're receiving.

2208
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,880
You never wanna take single source reporting.

2209
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,520
You always wanna have a comprehensive capability

2210
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:35,720
that has multiple sources of feeds of information.

2211
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,000
And then you base your conclusions off of that data.

2212
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,320
So what do you make of stuff like that mountain

2213
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,440
or which I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

2214
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,280
I do know what you're talking about.

2215
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,480
What do you make of that?

2216
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,800
You know, I find it interesting.

2217
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,520
There's people who remote viewed stuff in Antarctica.

2218
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,440
People that have remote viewed stuff.

2219
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,200
I mean, Joe remote viewed Mars.

2220
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,280
I can't remember the years.

2221
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:57,120
He's not the only one.

2222
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:01,640
3000 BC, the pyramid, you know what I'm talking about.

2223
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,040
Yeah, I mean, there's a book, really interesting book.

2224
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,200
This really all kinda blew up

2225
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,960
when there was a army captain, his ranger,

2226
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,520
sustained a TBI in an exercise.

2227
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,640
I think he went to a bright start in Egypt.

2228
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,040
And he had a wound to his head.

2229
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,680
I think it was caused by a graze bullet

2230
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,040
that caused some damage.

2231
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,760
And he was on his way to getting out of the army

2232
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,320
because he said he saw things

2233
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,200
and he thought there were hallucinations.

2234
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,880
And long story short, he got actually recruited

2235
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:37,040
into the Stargate program, into remote,

2236
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,720
because he's actually a very good remote viewer.

2237
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:44,040
And the name of the book is called Psychic Warrior.

2238
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,960
I don't believe the gentleman is practicing anymore.

2239
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,800
I think he had maybe had some complications

2240
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,640
as a result of it.

2241
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,320
But that was really the first book that came out

2242
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:57,520
that really kind of revealed the Stargate program

2243
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,200
and kind of the day-to-day operations

2244
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,720
of what they were doing and what we were trying to find

2245
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:04,440
and the type of things that were going on.

2246
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,120
So if you want an interesting book to read

2247
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,600
or anybody in your audience that listens,

2248
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,920
pick up the book, Psychic Warrior.

2249
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,480
I'm not promoting, by the way, let me just further.

2250
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:13,280
I'm not promoting it's a good book or it's a bad book,

2251
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,560
but it's an interesting way to kind of get a sneak peek

2252
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,920
behind what some of the people in the government,

2253
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,960
our government, our intelligence community were doing,

2254
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:24,520
both CIA and DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency,

2255
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:25,920
Central Intelligence Agency,

2256
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,560
and even the Bureau to some degree, believe it or not,

2257
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:32,120
were involved with regarding remote viewing.

2258
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,880
It can be very effective.

2259
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,480
I mean, the Mars thing, I mean, in the Alaska thing,

2260
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:41,320
it didn't sound like there was a lot of follow-up on that.

2261
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:42,160
So.

2262
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:44,960
Well, so now you have, because now we have technology, right?

2263
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,280
We can confirm by sending probes to the moon

2264
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,680
and to Mars and other things

2265
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:54,960
to substantiate if what the remote viewer is seeing

2266
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,520
is accurate.

2267
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:57,640
So again.

2268
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:58,840
Was there any follow-up?

2269
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,320
So that wasn't, if there was, I wasn't part of that.

2270
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,160
Okay.

2271
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,480
That was significantly before my time.

2272
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,400
My folks, now there was a very interesting,

2273
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,640
boy, how am I gonna get mad at me for this?

2274
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,240
No, I can talk about this.

2275
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,080
So as a result of remote viewing,

2276
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,160
some of these reports were very classified.

2277
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:24,240
There was one in particular incident with an individual,

2278
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:27,040
it might've been with Ingo Swann, actually,

2279
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,040
if I'm not mistaken.

2280
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,800
I might be mistaken, so let me just caveat.

2281
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,040
It was with a very good remote viewer,

2282
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:35,040
where their target was a Russian submarine.

2283
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:39,920
And they were providing the description on this new,

2284
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,160
might've been a Typhoon class submarine, I don't know,

2285
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,000
probably before that.

2286
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,520
But it was one of the latest new submarines

2287
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:46,640
that the Russians was deploying.

2288
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,680
And this was Joe.

2289
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,920
And you, well, did you find out

2290
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,440
what was following the nuclear submarine?

2291
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,760
No.

2292
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,080
UAP.

2293
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:56,920
No.

2294
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:57,760
And I said, well, that's it.

2295
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,760
They're like, well, what else do you see?

2296
01:39:58,760 --> 01:39:59,920
Well, that's interesting,

2297
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,200
but do you wanna know what's following it?

2298
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,120
They're like, yeah.

2299
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:06,400
And he goes, there's a UFO following the sub, yeah.

2300
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,000
So people like Hal Pudoff,

2301
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,560
who I consider national treasure, talk to him.

2302
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,400
Talk to him if you can,

2303
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,960
because he's not getting any younger.

2304
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:19,320
He really is an American patriot

2305
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:20,320
that did a lot for his country,

2306
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:23,120
took a lot of crap for what he was doing.

2307
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:26,080
He got accused of all sorts of nonsensical crap

2308
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,800
from his haters,

2309
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,440
something I think we both can appreciate quite a bit.

2310
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,840
But in reality, he did a lot for his country.

2311
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:39,040
And a lot of that was extremely, extremely successful.

2312
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,400
And the fidelity of the information was right on the money.

2313
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:45,400
Interesting.

2314
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,600
It's a fascinating subject.

2315
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,800
Quantum entanglement.

2316
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:54,880
Well, look, I'm not a quantum physicist.

2317
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,320
I didn't sleep at a Holiday Inn Express,

2318
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,400
but I'm not a quantum physicist.

2319
01:40:58,400 --> 01:40:59,960
I would talk to folks like that,

2320
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:02,960
talk to maybe Eric Davis, Dr. Eric Davis as well,

2321
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,720
Hal Pudoff, Kit Green.

2322
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,200
Kit Green is also a medical doctor

2323
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,800
who understands things very, very well

2324
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:12,400
from a biological and medical perspective.

2325
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,520
And I'm sure he has his opinions on that as well.

2326
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:15,960
What was Davis's name?

2327
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:20,280
Eric Davis, Dr. Hal Pudoff, Dr. Eric Davis,

2328
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,280
and Dr. Kit Green.

2329
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,000
By the way, all of them patriots,

2330
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,160
all of them great work for our country.

2331
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:39,120
All right, let's get a little sidetracked there.

2332
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,720
Maybe I'll actually hit this outline eventually.

2333
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:46,720
But let's talk about your involvement

2334
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:50,560
in Army Intelligence and how you got involved with ATIP.

2335
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:51,560
How did that happen?

2336
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:52,960
Well, they weren't the same.

2337
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:53,960
It wasn't the same journey.

2338
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:58,000
So I grew up, I think I kind of mentioned

2339
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I had a bit of a dysfunctional upbringing.

2340
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:05,360
To tell you about how I got here,

2341
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:10,360
I need to really tell you about who I was and how I started.

2342
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:15,200
So my father was a revolutionary.

2343
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:17,400
He was a revolutionary in Cuba.

2344
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:23,400
At the time there was this dictator named Batista,

2345
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:28,520
Batista in Cuba, and there was corruption issues.

2346
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:31,680
So my father, with some other people,

2347
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:35,280
people like Fidel Castro, Che Guevara,

2348
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,140
realized that Batista wasn't good for the country.

2349
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:40,560
So they trained in the mountains

2350
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:43,160
and they overthrew the country in a coup.

2351
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:47,600
And Castro had promised freedom and democracy in elections

2352
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,040
and had a little bit of support

2353
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,840
from the U.S. government to do that.

2354
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:53,160
And he took over, and when he took over,

2355
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:56,760
he very quickly turned and pronounced himself

2356
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,280
pretty much president for life,

2357
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:00,560
which is a dictator, not a president.

2358
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,040
And he sided with the Russians, and that was a problem.

2359
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:07,840
So my father basically telling his friends,

2360
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,560
hey, this is not what I signed up for.

2361
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,160
He said he was gonna offer freedom and democracy,

2362
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:15,240
and instead he's just as bad as Batista.

2363
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:17,800
So my father told his family

2364
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:21,040
that he was going to the United States to study English,

2365
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:24,160
instead went to Orlando, talked to some people in the CIA,

2366
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,360
joined the revolution, Brigade 2506.

2367
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,560
Brigada 2506.

2368
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,840
And so he went to Guatemala,

2369
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,020
trained in the jungles of Guatemala,

2370
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:36,500
and then was on the USS Houston boat

2371
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,680
that went from Guatemala for the invasion of Cuba.

2372
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,480
They landed on the beach,

2373
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,920
and my father was subsequently captured,

2374
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:47,200
and for about two years spent his time in Castro's prisons.

2375
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,960
The last one was called Isla de la Pinos, Isle of the Pines,

2376
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:54,720
where my father had, he had a tooth that had,

2377
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:59,720
I guess, become, it had erupted and he had an infection.

2378
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:03,560
So they did surgery on him without anesthesia.

2379
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:08,080
And for food, they ate boiled horse hoof, right?

2380
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,060
So really bad experience.

2381
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:11,480
Long story short, two years later,

2382
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,040
he comes to the United States.

2383
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:18,320
And my mom and him have what they call,

2384
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:21,160
my dad always called it the romance of the century.

2385
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:24,120
My mother was this beautiful bombshell model.

2386
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:26,600
She worked as a Playboy bunny.

2387
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,760
She was a model.

2388
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:28,800
Are you serious?

2389
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:29,640
Yeah.

2390
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:30,460
While you were alive?

2391
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:32,080
No, no, this is leading up to me.

2392
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:37,080
And so they were, my mother was this beautiful bombshell.

2393
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,640
Very free spirit.

2394
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:42,600
And she had a really troubled past herself.

2395
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,040
So never liked to talk about her family.

2396
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:49,240
Met this young dashing Cuban revolutionary,

2397
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:50,440
and they fell in love.

2398
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,560
And although interestingly,

2399
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,960
they never officially got married, I found out later.

2400
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,320
Even though they said they were married,

2401
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,400
they never were married.

2402
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:03,240
So as a young kid, I remember living in a wonderful,

2403
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,400
wonderful, loving family environment until it wasn't.

2404
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:09,600
My father, for 30 minutes of the day,

2405
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,420
they had, again, the romance of the century.

2406
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:15,440
The other 23 and a half hours were hell.

2407
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:19,380
My father and mother fought very violent.

2408
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:22,860
And then when the marriage finally ended and they divorced,

2409
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,320
my whole world went upside down.

2410
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:29,280
The bank repossessed the house my mother and I

2411
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:30,440
were living in.

2412
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,800
I had to sell my clothes at a flea market

2413
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,800
so my mom could pay rent.

2414
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:39,240
She had various male figures in and out of her life.

2415
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,320
She struggled, she struggled so much.

2416
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:43,760
My father went from being very successful

2417
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,880
entrepreneur and restaurateur

2418
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:48,480
to now working in a wood factory.

2419
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:52,000
And I was making more as a busboy at Red Lobster

2420
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,840
than my father was making at the wood factory.

2421
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,960
And they were living separately.

2422
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:57,880
And I was caught in the middle.

2423
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,680
I went to big public school.

2424
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:03,600
Really bad for me, bullied bad, bad, bad, bad.

2425
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,600
I was a pretty interesting kid.

2426
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:12,040
So because of that, I got angry.

2427
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:16,960
And one day I decided, if I'm gonna get beat up,

2428
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,960
I might as well grab one of these guys with me

2429
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,800
and take him down, I guess.

2430
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:26,800
And I did, and I got in trouble at school for it.

2431
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,920
But that was very empowering for me

2432
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,000
because I never liked bullies.

2433
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,580
I hated it, but I was too afraid to do anything about it.

2434
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:36,740
And so one day I fought back.

2435
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:38,460
And I fought back hard and I realized

2436
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:41,020
I was pretty good at it and I started fighting a lot.

2437
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,340
Too much.

2438
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:45,660
And in my public school, I wasn't very popular.

2439
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:49,300
Really rough, really dark times for me.

2440
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:51,700
Bounced around a lot, many different homes.

2441
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:56,180
I was angry and I joined JROTC.

2442
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:01,100
Now JROTC at the time isn't what it is now.

2443
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:03,020
I went to a big public school.

2444
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:05,140
I went to a school that was still engaged

2445
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:08,760
in the now controversial practice of called busing,

2446
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:11,260
where they would take kids from different parts

2447
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:15,300
of the social demographics and underprivileged kids

2448
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:16,740
and they would bus them into a different school

2449
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,500
to try to give them opportunities.

2450
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,340
So ROTC was kind of a last-ditch effort.

2451
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:23,060
If you were a bad kid getting in trouble all the time,

2452
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:25,020
you were kind of forced into ROTC,

2453
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:27,300
I guess for discipline reasons.

2454
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:30,740
And so most people, if you weren't a popular kid

2455
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:34,660
and you went to JROTC or you went to juvenile hall,

2456
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:36,220
really it was kind of that way.

2457
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:38,460
I had a different experience.

2458
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:42,020
I all of a sudden met people that felt just like me

2459
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:45,180
and we had this sense of comradery

2460
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:49,260
and I found strength in that and I loved it.

2461
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:54,260
And it was the military that I realized would save me

2462
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:58,020
and it would teach me how not to be.

2463
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:03,660
And so I went into college very poor.

2464
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:05,820
So I had to pay for it.

2465
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:10,780
So I became a bouncer at a lot of the various nightclubs.

2466
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:12,820
I convinced myself I would take those jobs

2467
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:14,900
because I could go to school during the day

2468
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:17,820
and then I could make money at night cash under the table

2469
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:20,440
and that was the way I was gonna support myself

2470
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:21,340
through college.

2471
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:24,540
The reality is it was an excuse to fight

2472
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:26,020
and I didn't realize until I got older

2473
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:27,980
and I got more mature and I realized

2474
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:29,140
why I was doing what I was doing.

2475
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:34,140
I was still very angry and I just wanted to teach bullies

2476
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:37,460
a lesson, I had a lot of hurt inside.

2477
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:39,620
So how did you come to that realization?

2478
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:44,620
Oh, fatherhood, marriage, time.

2479
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:49,420
I was an angry young man for a very good portion

2480
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:54,420
of my younger years and anger can be like rocket fuel

2481
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:59,020
it's very volatile and you can use it

2482
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:00,540
to really propel yourself.

2483
01:49:02,060 --> 01:49:05,260
But also it's like rocket fuel is very caustic.

2484
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:06,700
It can eat you up inside.

2485
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:11,700
It's like acid and over time it can destroy yourself.

2486
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:17,620
And I realized that that I needed to do so.

2487
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:19,740
I needed to figure this out

2488
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:21,740
because my motivation for doing things

2489
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:24,660
while I would tell myself one thing

2490
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:26,300
was really for some other reason.

2491
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:30,300
Self delusion can really be a powerful thing

2492
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:31,820
when you're younger.

2493
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:36,820
So I went to college, studied microbiology and immunology

2494
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,260
again, the wrong reasons.

2495
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:42,900
I was told by my family who had at that point

2496
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,100
kind of disowned me, extended family,

2497
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:46,580
like, oh, he'll never make it to college

2498
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:47,620
and if he does, he'll never make it

2499
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:49,140
past his first semester.

2500
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,860
So I chose the hardest major.

2501
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:52,660
I said fine, I'm gonna go to the medical program.

2502
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:54,740
They gave me a microbiologist and an immunologist.

2503
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:55,580
You?

2504
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:57,820
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

2505
01:49:57,820 --> 01:49:58,660
And so I did.

2506
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:00,700
Again, motivated for the wrong reasons.

2507
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:03,180
Fortunately it worked out to my benefit.

2508
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:05,020
I actually enjoyed it a lot

2509
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:07,860
and used some of that later on in my life and my career.

2510
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:11,300
So finishing college, I was in a lot of debt.

2511
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:15,580
Really not a whole lot of options.

2512
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:16,740
I didn't wanna spend the rest of my life

2513
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:19,380
looking through a Petri dish and a microscope.

2514
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:22,660
So I joined the army.

2515
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,020
Now, what I didn't say is early on

2516
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:25,980
when I was a young man in high school

2517
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:28,260
and before that as a young, even seven years old,

2518
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:32,860
my father had this idea that I would join the new revolution,

2519
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:34,780
Alpha 66 and retake Cuba.

2520
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:37,380
So me and myself and some other kids

2521
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:41,100
were always taught weird paramilitary skills,

2522
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:42,820
how to disassemble a Kalashnikov

2523
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:46,060
and what's the difference between a 223 or a 5.6

2524
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:49,220
and a 6.2 by 37 versus 39

2525
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:53,580
and my dad when I was eight taught me how to fly a plane.

2526
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:55,780
By 11, I was scuba diving.

2527
01:50:57,620 --> 01:51:01,300
How to build explosives and provide explosive devices

2528
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:03,020
in the kitchen using household products.

2529
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:04,580
Like really weird stuff

2530
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:06,700
that's not healthy for a kid to learn

2531
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:11,140
but my father had this desire, I guess,

2532
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:14,500
for me to accomplish the mission that was his mission.

2533
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,300
It was never really my mission

2534
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:17,980
but I think he felt that somehow

2535
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:21,340
that I would do it and help liberate Cuba.

2536
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:23,300
That was his number one prerogative

2537
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:25,180
for every syntactic member as a kid.

2538
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:27,380
He was volatile man, he was volcanic.

2539
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:29,940
When he blew up man, someone was going to jail

2540
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:31,140
and it was usually my dad.

2541
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:35,820
He was very intellectual and very smart

2542
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:38,140
but he was also exceedingly volatile

2543
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:41,980
and as a kid I was terrified of my father because of that,

2544
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:44,140
because he was unpredictable

2545
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,660
and I didn't wanna be like that.

2546
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:46,860
I wanted to be like my father

2547
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,540
but I didn't if that makes sense.

2548
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:51,660
I wanted to be like the good parts of my father

2549
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:55,100
but I didn't wanna be like that, like the anger

2550
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:56,980
and I was turning out to be that way.

2551
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:58,900
I was doing the same things.

2552
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:00,420
Finding excuses to get into fights

2553
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:04,500
and kick people's butts and it wasn't healthy

2554
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,820
and all for the wrong reasons.

2555
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:09,980
So after college, I went into the army,

2556
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:12,060
had an opportunity to go in as an officer

2557
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:13,300
because of my college degree

2558
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:15,620
and my father's words were always ringing

2559
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:17,620
in the back of my head and in my ears.

2560
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:19,220
He said, look son, if you wanna be a leader,

2561
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:22,660
you first must know what it means to follow.

2562
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:25,220
So I enlisted, enlisted in the army

2563
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:31,500
and had a chance to learn some stuff in the army.

2564
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:33,860
Very short period of time, people will always go back

2565
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:35,300
and say, oh, you're this hero.

2566
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:37,300
No, I'm not a hero, I know I'm not a hero

2567
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:38,900
because I know what a real hero is

2568
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:41,620
and most of those heroes aren't here to tell their story.

2569
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:45,380
I suffer from really bad imposter syndrome

2570
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:47,380
because people see you in uniform,

2571
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:50,820
they see the pictures of you in various situations

2572
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:53,380
and they're like, oh my God, you're so brave.

2573
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:55,940
No, there's people out there that had a hell of a lot worse

2574
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:58,020
that did a lot more than me.

2575
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:00,980
The real heroes are the guys and gals

2576
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:03,180
that aren't here to tell their story.

2577
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:05,980
It's the families that are left behind

2578
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:08,500
that have to have the Christmases and birthdays

2579
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:12,380
without the service member and going to PTA meetings

2580
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:14,660
and cooking dinners every night and doing homework.

2581
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:15,700
Those are the heroes.

2582
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:21,420
What I did was easy, comparatively speaking.

2583
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:23,540
The real hero is the female helicopter pilot

2584
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:25,740
who's low on fuel but she's not gonna leave

2585
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:28,220
her little ducklings behind so she continues to stay

2586
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:29,940
on the LZ and stay and stay and stay

2587
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:31,860
and takes round after round after round

2588
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:34,860
until finally the helicopter gets shot down out of the sky.

2589
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:35,820
Right?

2590
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:36,900
That's the hero.

2591
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,740
So all this other bullshit and people come by,

2592
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:40,980
oh, you're a hero, save that shit for somebody

2593
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:42,420
who actually believes it.

2594
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:43,420
I'm not a hero.

2595
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:45,220
I'm just a patriot doing his job.

2596
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:49,620
So long story short, in the army for a little bit

2597
01:53:49,620 --> 01:53:51,180
and then I got recruited out of there

2598
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:52,340
to a special program.

2599
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:55,180
They call it special.

2600
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:57,700
Maybe it was, but for different reasons.

2601
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:00,140
I am proof you do not have to be intelligent

2602
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:01,620
to be an intelligence.

2603
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:03,220
Let me just say that.

2604
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:05,780
But it was an opportunity that I relished.

2605
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:10,860
So I joined a special activities program.

2606
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:11,820
Did that for a while.

2607
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:13,500
During that process of the recruitment

2608
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,340
is when Gene Lesme came into my life

2609
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:19,580
and I learned a little bit about the remote viewing program

2610
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:20,420
you might say.

2611
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:24,300
And then spent my time early in my career

2612
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:27,740
doing counter insurgency, counter guerrilla operations

2613
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:29,700
and some counter narcotics support

2614
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:31,740
mostly against in Latin America

2615
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:33,540
because my language being Spanish.

2616
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:36,900
So think of FARC, right?

2617
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:41,220
And ELN and Tupac Amaruz and Indero Luminoso

2618
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,620
stuff like that.

2619
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:46,380
You're probably too young for this

2620
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,380
but we had something called Plan Colombia

2621
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:50,980
that was arguably probably not so effective.

2622
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:52,900
What was that?

2623
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:56,060
Plan Colombia was a US government effort

2624
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:58,700
usually with Charlie 3rd of the 7th Special Forces.

2625
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:03,020
There was a DMZ area, Demilitarized Zone between Colombia

2626
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:07,260
and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucion de Colombia FARC.

2627
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:09,180
It's terrorist organization.

2628
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:10,220
They call themselves guerrillas

2629
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:12,980
but they did bad stuff, kidnappings and dope

2630
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:13,820
and stuff like that.

2631
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:15,620
So there was this Demilitarized Zone

2632
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:16,540
and you had these three areas,

2633
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:19,300
Tres Esquinas, Apia y La Randia

2634
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:23,620
were these cities where we had SF and Intel people

2635
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:26,620
doing counter insurgency, counter narcotics missions

2636
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:31,260
where we were trying to pump in a lot of American resources

2637
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:34,700
and money and support to help the Colombian government

2638
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:36,540
get rid of the FARC.

2639
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:37,820
Again, this is back in the days.

2640
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:40,660
So this is late 90s, stuff like that.

2641
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:43,860
So we were involved in stuff like that.

2642
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:48,860
Then long story short, little later, 9-11 happened.

2643
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,180
And very shortly thereafter,

2644
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:55,020
I found myself in some weird place in the middle of nowhere

2645
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:58,860
in Uzbekistan called K2, Kashi Khanabad.

2646
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:01,660
And yeah, you probably remember that place a bit.

2647
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:04,820
It was crazy.

2648
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:06,220
Spent a little time there and then-

2649
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:07,700
What were you doing there?

2650
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:09,260
Prepped him to go down south.

2651
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:12,180
We were, I was only there for maybe four or five days

2652
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:14,420
and then I was making things smoking into Kandahar

2653
01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:17,740
back in 2001.

2654
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:19,660
Anyways, long story short, I digress.

2655
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:24,780
Spent the next years and years after that as-

2656
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:25,780
Who were you attached to back then?

2657
01:56:25,780 --> 01:56:26,620
Special agent.

2658
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:29,100
So we were with J. Sotif Dagger.

2659
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:29,940
Good.

2660
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:31,460
So we had a small Intel.

2661
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:35,340
That's where I met General Mattis for the first time.

2662
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:36,180
Incredible human being.

2663
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,020
Nice.

2664
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:40,860
Yeah, but anyways, long story short,

2665
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:44,100
found myself there in Middle East quite a bit

2666
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:49,100
and then Iraq cooked off and I did some work

2667
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:50,220
with that effort.

2668
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:54,620
And then I wound up promoting myself to a desk job.

2669
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:56,460
So I went from being a special agent in charge

2670
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:59,420
and running counterintelligence, counterespionage,

2671
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:01,340
counterterrorism operations,

2672
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:03,100
some cross-border operations stuff

2673
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:06,780
and to getting a job in D.C.

2674
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:08,700
Kind of what happens, you get promoted to a point

2675
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:10,260
where they pull you out of the field and it's like,

2676
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:12,300
okay, now you're gonna manage budgets, right?

2677
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:14,700
And stuff like that and personnel.

2678
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:17,980
So I did that and then it was in 2008.

2679
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:21,220
I was at the time with director of national intelligence

2680
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:24,300
as a senior Intel official there

2681
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:26,220
and the commute was killing me.

2682
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:28,820
I lived on this little tiny island called Kent Island

2683
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:30,700
in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay,

2684
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:32,060
which was great to raise a family, right?

2685
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:34,060
Having daughters, kind of give them the normal life.

2686
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:34,900
They can ride their bikes.

2687
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:38,580
You don't have to worry about crazy people in the town.

2688
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:39,700
But my commute was terrible.

2689
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:43,500
So if you know a little bit where the direct DNI is,

2690
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:46,260
it's actually past the CIA, it's right past Langley.

2691
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:48,660
And the commute was like three hours each way from me.

2692
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:52,020
And so I was sometimes in the car coming from work

2693
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:53,940
then I was actually at work.

2694
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:55,620
It was brutal.

2695
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:57,500
So I had an opportunity to come back to the Pentagon

2696
01:57:57,500 --> 01:58:00,820
for a one-year JDA joint duty assignment

2697
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:02,340
and that's when Clapper's like,

2698
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:05,940
I need somebody to run law enforcement

2699
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:07,220
and intelligence integration.

2700
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:09,860
We wanna get local law enforcement somehow figure

2701
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:12,140
how do we get national level intelligence,

2702
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:14,580
counter-terrorism information that's classified

2703
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,820
down to a level where people can do something with it,

2704
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:18,460
but they don't have a security clearance.

2705
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:19,700
So how do you do it, right?

2706
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:22,700
So you create this tear line and stuff like that.

2707
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:23,940
So I was brought back for that

2708
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:26,380
and very immediately there afterwards

2709
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:29,340
is two people came in to my office.

2710
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:32,780
I was in Crystal City at the time at a particular location.

2711
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:35,100
They still don't want me to talk about so I won't

2712
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,860
but beautiful corner office.

2713
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:40,700
And two people come in, talk to me and say,

2714
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:43,820
hey, you've got some background and this and that.

2715
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:46,180
And early in my career, I forgot to tell you this,

2716
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:50,220
I did some work on UASs, so unmanned aerial systems.

2717
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:54,100
So drones, all the different types of drones

2718
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:55,300
that we had at the time,

2719
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:57,300
which were fundamentally pretty basic actually,

2720
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:02,420
I did some advanced avionics protection and technology,

2721
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:07,020
high energy laser technology, first stage, second stage,

2722
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:10,660
solid and liquid rocket booster motor engines,

2723
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:12,380
some space platforms.

2724
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:14,580
So when they came and talked to me, they said,

2725
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:16,980
hey, we know you have a CI background

2726
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:19,460
and we'd like you to consider working with us

2727
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:20,660
in a special project.

2728
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:25,140
Didn't know at all what it was, had no idea.

2729
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:26,420
And after several of those meetings, I said,

2730
01:59:26,420 --> 01:59:28,220
look, our director would like to meet you.

2731
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:29,860
So I said, okay, sure, we set up a meeting

2732
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:31,780
and I went to another undisclosed location

2733
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:33,860
where they were, he was at.

2734
01:59:33,860 --> 01:59:37,780
I remember going up there and it was so bizarre.

2735
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:40,260
The epitome of a true, whatever you think

2736
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:43,980
a rocket scientist in your brain, that's who this guy was.

2737
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:47,620
Kind of disheveled hair, tie a little crooked, glasses.

2738
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:49,180
And he happened to be at the time,

2739
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:51,500
the US government's premier rocket scientist.

2740
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:54,500
Like for real, real, like the best rocket scientist

2741
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:57,700
in the US government, super, super, super smart.

2742
01:59:57,700 --> 02:00:01,020
And we had our conversation, then he looked at me

2743
02:00:01,020 --> 02:00:03,180
towards the very end, he says, so I gotta ask you.

2744
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:06,140
Yeah, he says, what do you think about UFOs?

2745
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:11,060
So I thought about him, I looked at him,

2746
02:00:11,060 --> 02:00:13,820
I told him the truth, I don't.

2747
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:16,620
He says, well, what do you mean, you don't believe in them?

2748
02:00:16,620 --> 02:00:18,080
I didn't say that.

2749
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:20,060
You asked me, what do I think about UFOs?

2750
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:21,540
My response is, I don't think about them

2751
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:23,180
because I don't have the time, I don't have the luxury.

2752
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:25,780
I'm too busy doing other stuff and chasing bad guys

2753
02:00:25,780 --> 02:00:27,900
and stuff like that, I don't think about them.

2754
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:29,860
And he looked at me and he said, that's fair enough.

2755
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:31,940
I said, but let me give you some advice.

2756
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:35,060
Actually, he might have even said, let me warn you.

2757
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:39,580
He says, don't let your analytic bias get the best of you

2758
02:00:39,580 --> 02:00:43,100
because what you learn here may challenge that.

2759
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:44,100
And at this point, I still didn't know

2760
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:45,620
what they were looking at, I had no idea.

2761
02:00:45,620 --> 02:00:48,540
But he just said UFO out of the blue, I'm like, what?

2762
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:50,420
And this whole time, the two people that had come

2763
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:52,620
to my office were telling me, this is very sensitive,

2764
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:55,940
we can't tell you what it's about, but our boss can.

2765
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:59,580
And they needed somebody with counterintelligence

2766
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:01,340
experience to run the counterintelligence

2767
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:02,940
and security aspect for their portfolio

2768
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:04,060
because they were worried that the Russians

2769
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:07,180
and Chinese were trying to expose them, which I get it.

2770
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:08,980
America's running a secret UFO program,

2771
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:10,860
yeah, the Russians would want to know.

2772
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:14,980
So very shortly thereafter,

2773
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:19,060
I realized the true focus of ATIP.

2774
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:22,060
And it was to look at, I realized at that point,

2775
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:24,780
the US government was taking very, very seriously

2776
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:29,500
encounters of UAP over controlled military airspace

2777
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,660
and over our sensitive facilities.

2778
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:33,980
And the more we looked into it, the more we realized

2779
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:36,380
not only was it real, but it's a real national security issue.

2780
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:39,180
Like we got real stuff happening where these,

2781
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:40,980
I've got another document here.

2782
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:42,940
These things actually interfered with our ability

2783
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:46,420
for nuclear strike capability.

2784
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:48,020
I mean, think about that, right?

2785
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:49,300
Restrict our ability to launch

2786
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:50,820
if we're attacked by the Russians.

2787
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:56,180
The UAP was able to turn off an entire flight of nukes.

2788
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:57,140
Now what's a flight of nukes?

2789
02:01:57,140 --> 02:01:58,700
Think of a Christmas tree light

2790
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:03,540
where each light is a military, is a nuclear silo

2791
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:05,460
and you've got this kind of central command post.

2792
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:09,460
Well, they were all taken offline by a UAP.

2793
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:12,220
And by the way, one of the intelligence reports I have,

2794
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:14,740
and I can say, I can read it to you.

2795
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:17,340
It's not conjecture, it's like, oh, well, maybe, no.

2796
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:20,260
They saw the UAP and all of a sudden, boom,

2797
02:02:20,260 --> 02:02:21,700
the entire flight goes down.

2798
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:25,380
And only when the UFO left did the nukes come back online.

2799
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:26,980
And if that's not scary enough,

2800
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:28,620
we had intelligence reports

2801
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:30,660
that the same thing happened in Russia,

2802
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:33,420
but there, they were turned onto a ready position.

2803
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:36,300
Like where ours were turned off, theirs were turned on.

2804
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:40,740
So yeah, so we had serious concerns.

2805
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:43,740
And while Alsop was looking at other stuff as well

2806
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:45,260
regarding the ranch,

2807
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:47,460
my focus was really the national security issue

2808
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:48,740
of look, it's very simple.

2809
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:50,580
We have a capability of technology

2810
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:53,260
that's been demonstrated that can enter our airspace

2811
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:56,580
completely unchallenged, of unknown origin,

2812
02:02:56,580 --> 02:02:59,380
and who seems to be interested in our military equities,

2813
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:01,980
our military capabilities, and oh, by the way,

2814
02:03:01,980 --> 02:03:03,060
has demonstrated an ability

2815
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:04,940
to interfere with our nuclear technologies.

2816
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:06,460
Now, if that's not a national security issue

2817
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:09,020
or a Department of Defense mission

2818
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:10,300
or an intelligence mission is,

2819
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:11,820
then I don't know what is, right?

2820
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:15,220
That's the very definition of a national security threat.

2821
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:18,820
So that was what, that was the impetus,

2822
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:20,500
I think, for a lot of my colleagues and mine.

2823
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:22,700
And now, being the new kid on the block,

2824
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:23,860
I'm kind of walking around with like,

2825
02:03:23,860 --> 02:03:25,860
oh my gosh, wow, wow, wow, that's real?

2826
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:27,980
Wait a minute, Roswell's real?

2827
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:31,860
And my scientists that have been there forever

2828
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:34,580
and part of other, or the efforts with the US government,

2829
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:35,780
kind of putting their hand on my shoulder,

2830
02:03:35,780 --> 02:03:39,220
be like, yeah, you're gonna learn a lot here, buddy.

2831
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:40,820
Buckle up, it's gonna be a wild ride.

2832
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:42,020
And boy, were they right.

2833
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:45,460
I worked with some of America's finest in that capacity,

2834
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:47,060
really, really good people.

2835
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:53,140
And then in 2017, on October 4th,

2836
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:57,820
I resigned from my beloved department.

2837
02:03:57,820 --> 02:03:59,740
Why did you resign?

2838
02:03:59,740 --> 02:04:04,740
So, boy, I have to backtrack here.

2839
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:10,260
There was an aerospace defense contractor

2840
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:12,300
that had agreed to surrender

2841
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,660
their crash retrieval material to us

2842
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:16,380
because we were the government, we're running the program.

2843
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:19,500
We had a facility specially built at a SAPF level,

2844
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:22,780
SAPF facility level.

2845
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:25,100
And so they said, here's a catch,

2846
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:27,380
you just need, because we have this existing memorandum

2847
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:29,260
from the Secretary of the Air Force saying we can't,

2848
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:31,380
we have to possess this stuff.

2849
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:32,620
If you can get another memo

2850
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:34,060
from the Secretary of the Air Force saying,

2851
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:35,860
we can give it to you, we'll give it to you.

2852
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:37,900
Because this is a lie, at this point,

2853
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:39,340
we're keeping the lights on, it's very expensive,

2854
02:04:39,460 --> 02:04:40,620
we don't want to deal with this anymore,

2855
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:41,540
you can have the material.

2856
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:44,540
We've exploited what we can exploit from it.

2857
02:04:44,540 --> 02:04:45,780
The problem is Secretary of the Air Force

2858
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:46,620
didn't want to play ball.

2859
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:50,060
So along comes Mattis and thank God Trump gets there,

2860
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:52,900
brings Mattis in, I'm like, man, my old friend's back.

2861
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:55,580
If we can't get a memorandum of approval

2862
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:57,060
from the Secretary of the Air Force,

2863
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:59,380
I'll just go above him and I'll just go straight to SecDef.

2864
02:04:59,380 --> 02:05:01,700
I'll just go to Daddy Mattis and say,

2865
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:04,020
hey, Jim, I need some help.

2866
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:07,300
But you know, too, how command and control works

2867
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:09,460
and we understand chain of command.

2868
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:11,420
So I was always very careful never to just

2869
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:12,820
intercept the boss and be like, hey, boss,

2870
02:05:12,820 --> 02:05:13,660
I need to talk to you.

2871
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:15,380
He's had many levels above me

2872
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:17,020
that I would have to go through.

2873
02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:20,380
The problem is one of my direct supervisors at the time,

2874
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:22,780
I knew this but nobody else did,

2875
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:25,060
had several IG investigations against him.

2876
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:26,540
So I couldn't trust him.

2877
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:28,420
And so what I did is I went around him

2878
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:30,940
and I was briefing with the concurrence

2879
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:32,860
of the Secretary's front office,

2880
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:35,740
I was briefing the Secretary's staff,

2881
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:39,260
his direct, the White House advisor,

2882
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:40,700
National Security Council advisor,

2883
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:43,180
and another advisor who I'm not allowed to say

2884
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:44,020
who they worked for.

2885
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:46,100
I say they worked for the CIA, I can't say who they were.

2886
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:49,140
There were the three head people for the Secretary.

2887
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:50,380
They're up in the Secretary's suite.

2888
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:52,180
If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about

2889
02:05:52,180 --> 02:05:56,180
right there on the E-ring and on the river entrance.

2890
02:05:56,180 --> 02:05:59,260
And so I was briefing them on a weekly basis.

2891
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:00,940
Weekly basis, yeah, this is important.

2892
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:01,780
I got the pilots coming in,

2893
02:06:01,780 --> 02:06:02,620
I have the radar operators coming in,

2894
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:04,340
I have the reports, I've got the documents,

2895
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:05,700
I've got the photographs, I've got the videos,

2896
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:07,900
I've got the briefings, I've got a stack of crap

2897
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:09,700
this big every time coming in.

2898
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:11,580
And they're like, yeah, this is important.

2899
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:13,860
The problem is we can't brief

2900
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:15,860
the Secretary of Defense just yet.

2901
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:17,900
Like, well, you can't wait, he has to know

2902
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:19,860
because if something happened, we were already getting,

2903
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:21,980
we have these ships, the Roosevelt,

2904
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:25,300
that's being literally stalked by UAP on a daily basis.

2905
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:27,220
I mean, I have these emails on CIPRNET saying,

2906
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:29,420
hey, Lou, I can't keep people below deck forever.

2907
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:30,860
What do you want me to do?

2908
02:06:30,860 --> 02:06:32,180
They're all over the ship, right?

2909
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:34,580
So I'm like, okay, don't worry, the Calvary's coming,

2910
02:06:34,580 --> 02:06:36,300
we're working this, we're gonna get you the relief

2911
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:38,500
you're looking for, I gotcha.

2912
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:41,860
The problem is that people in the head shed

2913
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:43,380
didn't wanna do anything until the boss,

2914
02:06:43,380 --> 02:06:46,300
until we had a, at the time, our Undersecretary of Defense

2915
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:47,980
for Intelligence, the USDAI,

2916
02:06:47,980 --> 02:06:50,900
the head senior principal staff assistant

2917
02:06:50,900 --> 02:06:53,500
for the secretary for all things intelligence,

2918
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:55,500
wasn't a Senate confirmed person.

2919
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:57,740
So they wanted to wait and wait and wait

2920
02:06:57,740 --> 02:06:59,860
until they got somebody in there, Senate confirmed,

2921
02:06:59,860 --> 02:07:03,860
brief the USDAI, who then we would brief Secretary Mattis.

2922
02:07:03,860 --> 02:07:05,620
I kept telling him, guys, don't let bureaucracy

2923
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:07,060
get in your way, don't do it.

2924
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:09,660
We cannot afford the weight, he needs to know now

2925
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:11,500
that what's happening in the field,

2926
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:14,060
I can't keep a lid on it anymore.

2927
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:16,780
I can't, it's gonna be, everybody's gonna know this.

2928
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:20,700
And I also think there may have been some,

2929
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:23,500
and to protect the boss, which I totally get,

2930
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:25,220
nobody wants to be the one to tell the boss,

2931
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:26,860
hey, look, we got a problem, boss.

2932
02:07:26,860 --> 02:07:28,580
There's something in our skies, we don't know what it is,

2933
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:30,140
we don't know how it works, we don't know where it's from,

2934
02:07:30,140 --> 02:07:31,180
we don't know who's buying the wheel,

2935
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:34,180
we don't know, by the way, it's interested in our stuff.

2936
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:36,260
It's not a great conversation to have with somebody,

2937
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:41,260
especially like mad dog Mattis, or others call him chaos.

2938
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:43,780
He wants answers, and if you ever worked with a guy

2939
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:46,340
in the field, General Mattis is a very serious guy,

2940
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:48,540
very learned, he's a guy who wants more information,

2941
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:50,420
not less, and then last but not least,

2942
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:52,180
I suspect what they didn't want to do

2943
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:54,300
is give the boss some information only to be asked

2944
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:56,820
a week later by the media, have you ever been briefed

2945
02:07:56,820 --> 02:07:59,300
on UFOs, and you would have to say for the record,

2946
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:00,740
yeah, I've been briefed on UFOs, right?

2947
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:03,540
There's many reasons for it, and looking back,

2948
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:04,820
I can understand it, but at the time,

2949
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:07,660
I was very frustrated, and so I knew that the only way

2950
02:08:07,660 --> 02:08:10,020
I'd be able to get the secretary's attention

2951
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:11,340
without breaking that chain of command,

2952
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:12,660
I could have walked in any time I wanted to

2953
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:14,340
into his front office, and I have,

2954
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:19,780
but you and I both know you don't break the chain of command,

2955
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:23,300
you can't break the rules to enforce the rules.

2956
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:24,380
You can't do it, it doesn't work that way.

2957
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:26,940
You can't break the law to enforce the law,

2958
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:28,220
and so I was very cognizant of that,

2959
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:31,300
and so I did what most people do in my situation.

2960
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:34,260
I resigned, and I knew that my resignation,

2961
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:36,580
I addressed my resignation memo directly to him,

2962
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:39,860
knowing that they would not be able to stop that,

2963
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:42,380
and they tried, by the way, even that they tried,

2964
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:47,340
but I told him very point blank in my resignation memo,

2965
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:49,260
I said, sir, you need to be aware, this is real,

2966
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:53,660
and this has the ability to impact our nuclear capabilities,

2967
02:08:53,660 --> 02:08:56,780
our military readiness, and it's a problem

2968
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:59,540
that we're gonna have to deal with, and-

2969
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:01,380
Had you been in touch with him since then?

2970
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:03,780
I have not, no, I think he lives overseas right now

2971
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:08,780
with his lady, but there's some back-channel discussions

2972
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:13,460
that occurred, it's for him to say, not me,

2973
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:17,380
I respect him tremendously, he was a great leader

2974
02:09:17,380 --> 02:09:19,380
in the military, politically, I don't know,

2975
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:22,900
I'm not talking politics, right, I'm not a politician,

2976
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:26,380
but he was a very effective leader, and let's not forget,

2977
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:29,540
almost a year later today, he resigned too, right,

2978
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:32,340
that's what you do, when you can't fix something internally,

2979
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:34,900
you don't become a problem inside, you leave,

2980
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:36,220
you do what you're supposed to do and say,

2981
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:38,380
okay, aye, aye, sir, and you roll out,

2982
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:42,860
and then if you wanna speak your piece outside, fine,

2983
02:09:42,860 --> 02:09:45,340
but don't cause problems inside the chain of command,

2984
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:49,040
that is unforgivable, and I agree with that,

2985
02:09:51,180 --> 02:09:53,500
I know some people differ with me on that perspective,

2986
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:54,940
but it's the way I feel.

2987
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:59,660
We keep talking about UFOs and UAPs

2988
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:02,660
interfering with our nuclear arsenal,

2989
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:06,060
what are we doing to combat that?

2990
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:08,540
Well, I think this new administration's gonna do a lot.

2991
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:09,380
Like what?

2992
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:12,900
Well, let me let the administration first get a handle

2993
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:15,300
on what's going on and decide what they wanna do,

2994
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:20,580
a nuclear facility isn't just Department of Defense,

2995
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:22,860
it's not just Air Force, you have Department of Energy there,

2996
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:25,260
you have all sorts of different organizations there

2997
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:27,280
that are part of the calculus, right?

2998
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:30,940
So you've got a lot of equities.

2999
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:32,740
First of all, they need to get a handle on what's going on,

3000
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:33,780
and by the way, for the record,

3001
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:37,580
I am extremely optimistic about this administration.

3002
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:39,340
I think this is the best thing

3003
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:41,300
that could have happened to this country.

3004
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,260
I get a lot of shit for it,

3005
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:49,100
but this is something I know several individuals

3006
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:51,340
on the cabinet, I'm not gonna say who,

3007
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:53,740
that are very interested in transparency

3008
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:55,700
for the American people, like sincerely,

3009
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:57,260
really want transparency,

3010
02:10:57,260 --> 02:10:58,300
while also understanding we have

3011
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:00,060
to protect national secrets, right?

3012
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:06,580
So I think there is going to be some things done

3013
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:09,780
that will prevent any type of,

3014
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:12,180
hopefully any type of interference

3015
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:13,580
in the future of our nuclear equities.

3016
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:15,540
Now, that's not to say,

3017
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:17,300
I mean, if something is super highly advanced

3018
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:19,220
and they're using a capability we don't understand,

3019
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:22,880
then how do you defend against that, right?

3020
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:25,800
Well, I mean, now they have this,

3021
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:27,680
I interviewed Joe Lonsdale,

3022
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:30,360
EPROS, the direct EMP weapon

3023
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:33,360
that can take out 100 drones plus at once.

3024
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:35,720
I mean, is that something we could implement?

3025
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:38,720
Yeah, and we already should have implemented it.

3026
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:40,520
This last administration dragged their feet,

3027
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:41,760
no, we can't do anything about it.

3028
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:45,160
Which, hell, you can't, yes, you can, and you should.

3029
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:49,440
This is my frustration.

3030
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:52,160
When we allow politics to drive

3031
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:55,280
national level decisions involving security

3032
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:58,840
without having the expertise in-house or resident,

3033
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:01,600
then everything becomes a political calculus.

3034
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:06,240
And that's fine until you talk about national security.

3035
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:08,400
There has to be an emphasis on national security,

3036
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,760
especially with our nuclear equities.

3037
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:12,920
I mean, what do you make of this,

3038
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:15,560
it was that video, the whistleblower, the saw,

3039
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:18,480
I think it was an Air Force special operations guy

3040
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:21,200
that came out recently, the whistleblower that came out

3041
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:25,280
about the egg-shaped craft that we picked up.

3042
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:26,680
There's a little video on night vision,

3043
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:28,520
we're gonna overlay it right now on the video,

3044
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:31,320
but I mean, what do you make of this?

3045
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:34,080
He says it's an alien craft or troll.

3046
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:36,480
First of all, any time a veteran comes out,

3047
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,360
I always give them deference.

3048
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:39,320
Why, because they earned it.

3049
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:40,560
I don't care if they're wrong or not,

3050
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:43,000
they earned that privilege to speak their mind.

3051
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,160
Secondly, he is who he says he is,

3052
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:47,000
he is a former special operator.

3053
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,760
That is fact.

3054
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:52,080
So whether you are a Navy SEAL, or you're an Air Force PJ,

3055
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:54,120
or you're an Army special operator,

3056
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:57,840
these are folks that are not just trained observers,

3057
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:00,840
as you know, but they're highly skilled, right?

3058
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:03,400
And you go through a battery of psychological evaluations

3059
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:05,080
and sometimes polygraphs and drug testing,

3060
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:06,760
and these are really representing

3061
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:08,600
the best of the best tip of the spear,

3062
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:09,880
and that's why they're the tip of the spear.

3063
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:11,120
Where was that retrieved?

3064
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:13,720
You know what, I'm gonna let him,

3065
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:15,120
I don't wanna talk too much about his story

3066
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:16,440
because it's really up to me.

3067
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:18,400
You asked me about him as a person.

3068
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:20,920
I believe he is speaking his truth.

3069
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:23,840
I believe he is doing what he believes is correct,

3070
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,520
and for that I support him.

3071
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:28,160
I was not there for that recovery.

3072
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:31,360
I was not there when he decided to come out.

3073
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:33,120
Did you see anything like that before?

3074
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:36,040
There's reports of a vehicle shaped exactly like,

3075
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:38,960
Lonnie Zamora, I mean, read the case.

3076
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:41,680
He was a cop, and he talked about an egg-shaped craft.

3077
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:43,960
Just like that, back in the 60s, right?

3078
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:48,880
So the morphology of this is not anything new.

3079
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,880
The question is, is that what it was,

3080
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:53,640
or was it something else?

3081
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:55,560
I don't know, but the fact that he's willing

3082
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:58,800
to come out publicly and tell this conversation,

3083
02:13:58,800 --> 02:13:59,880
I think is important,

3084
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:01,760
and I hope that other people do too,

3085
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:03,680
and people come out and start poo-pooing him.

3086
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:05,640
Well, you wonder why more whistleblowers don't come out.

3087
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:07,200
Look at the way I was treated.

3088
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:08,040
Look at the way he was treated.

3089
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:08,880
I'm not poo-pooing him, I'm just asking.

3090
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,360
No, no, no, no, no, of course,

3091
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:12,760
that'll mean you, I mean, I mean that rhetorically.

3092
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:14,600
People in general will say,

3093
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:16,880
well, how come we don't have more whistleblowers?

3094
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:18,240
Well, look when the whistleblowers come out,

3095
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:19,080
how they're treated.

3096
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:20,040
Look at poor Dave Grouch.

3097
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:21,480
Here's a guy who I served with.

3098
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:24,360
We were at Space Force together, working the UFO topic,

3099
02:14:24,360 --> 02:14:25,920
working for the UAP task force.

3100
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:28,040
That's what we were doing, that was our job, right?

3101
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:30,760
He comes out 24 hours after testifying at Congress.

3102
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:31,840
What happens?

3103
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:35,480
Two guys from the CIA apparently leak his information,

3104
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:38,680
medical information, and try to use his PTSD against him.

3105
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:39,840
You know what?

3106
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:40,680
F you.

3107
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:44,720
Low life piece of crap person

3108
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:49,720
that would use somebody's combat PTSD against him.

3109
02:14:50,080 --> 02:14:51,960
That is, you know, you who never done nothing,

3110
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:54,160
never popped nothing, never served nobody,

3111
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:56,000
you don't deserve, get your ass in the corner

3112
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,840
because that guy was a hero.

3113
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:58,840
He actually did the right thing.

3114
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:00,760
I saw him every day, and by the way,

3115
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:02,720
everything he said was absolutely,

3116
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:05,480
everything he told Congress was correct.

3117
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:07,400
And a lot more he knows that he hasn't said.

3118
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:10,720
And so what's his reward for speaking his truth?

3119
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:12,520
What happened?

3120
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:16,200
Oh, this guy, alcoholic, oh, this guy, PTSD.

3121
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:20,520
I mean, that is the reaction by certain elements

3122
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,000
within a corrupt system.

3123
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:25,960
And by the way, that's my real issue.

3124
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:28,520
That's what motivates me every single day to come out.

3125
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:30,520
It's not just the UAP topic.

3126
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:34,120
We've got a very significant issue on our hands right now.

3127
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:35,560
And it's been there for a while.

3128
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:38,040
It's become a cancer in our government.

3129
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:39,000
And that concerns me,

3130
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,080
because that threatens everything.

3131
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,600
That threatens everybody.

3132
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:47,320
And, you know, unless you ask me,

3133
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:48,320
I won't go down that road,

3134
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:51,880
but that to me is a much greater national security issue

3135
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:53,120
than UAPs ever were.

3136
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:57,440
What do you think he's opened by coming out with us?

3137
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:00,000
Do you think he's trying to force the government

3138
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,080
to reveal something?

3139
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:03,920
Yeah, he's trying to do what I did

3140
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:05,640
and other colleagues of mine.

3141
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:07,720
Let America know the truth without getting in trouble

3142
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:09,120
and without being thrown into jail

3143
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:11,320
and wearing an orange jumpsuit.

3144
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:12,440
You know, the problem is

3145
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:14,400
that there's a very sophisticated capability

3146
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:16,200
to try to smear people like that.

3147
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:18,640
I've been saying, wait till the real truth starts to hit.

3148
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:20,080
People are gonna go crazy.

3149
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:22,600
When people find out the length that some individuals

3150
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:25,640
in this system were willing to go to to keep us quiet,

3151
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:28,120
you wait till that shoe drops.

3152
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:29,920
That's coming out.

3153
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:30,760
You think it's gonna come out?

3154
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:32,320
Oh, I know it's coming out, absolutely.

3155
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:33,320
Yes, sir.

3156
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:35,320
Is there any relationship between that

3157
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:37,600
and, I mean, did you watch my interview

3158
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:40,320
with Sam Shoemate, the Matthews-Libelsberger?

3159
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:42,440
You have to forgive me, Chris.

3160
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:43,520
It's okay.

3161
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:46,000
You know about Matthews-Libelsberger

3162
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,640
is the cyber truck.

3163
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:48,880
He's former Green Beret.

3164
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:49,720
Yes.

3165
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:50,540
Blew up the cyber truck.

3166
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:51,880
I know the story very well.

3167
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:52,720
Okay.

3168
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:53,540
And I know what you did.

3169
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:54,380
I didn't see the interview.

3170
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:55,220
I apologize.

3171
02:16:55,220 --> 02:16:56,040
It's fine.

3172
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:57,560
But I know very well that scenario

3173
02:16:57,560 --> 02:17:00,280
and the email you received and the information you received.

3174
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:04,800
In the email, he talks about gravitic propulsion systems.

3175
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:06,680
Is there any relationship between that

3176
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:09,520
and what the soft veteran just revealed

3177
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:12,760
in the short night vision video?

3178
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:17,520
There is a relationship to the story.

3179
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:20,160
If it turns out that that video is authentic

3180
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:23,000
and legitimate, then the answer is an absolute yes.

3181
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,480
But first, that video, again,

3182
02:17:26,480 --> 02:17:28,360
I wasn't there to shoot the video.

3183
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:30,000
So I wanna be very careful.

3184
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:31,720
I know what I say.

3185
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:35,440
But anti-gravitics has always been the holy grail for us.

3186
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:37,600
And there's several reasons for it.

3187
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:39,800
But if you can understand

3188
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:44,800
and somehow control and master anti-gravitics,

3189
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:50,800
then that is going, whoever figures that out

3190
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:54,560
is gonna put you about 200 years ahead of everybody else.

3191
02:17:54,560 --> 02:17:56,760
And that's big.

3192
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:57,600
That's big.

3193
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:02,520
We kinda talked about this at the beginning.

3194
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:04,720
Yeah, yeah.

3195
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:07,840
Anti-gravitics is the holy grail.

3196
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:09,640
All sorts of, it's not just being able to fly

3197
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:11,480
without any obvious signs of propulsion

3198
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:14,320
or without wings and control surfaces.

3199
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:18,440
Again, space-time, if you understand anti-gravity

3200
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:19,920
and the warping of space-time,

3201
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:24,920
then distance doesn't mean so much to you.

3202
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:28,920
Time is a little more flexible.

3203
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:32,080
And so there's a reason why the US government

3204
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:33,720
doesn't even like to talk about it.

3205
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:34,880
Or any other government.

3206
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:37,160
Yeah, we looked into it.

3207
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:38,800
It's just a science fiction term.

3208
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:40,600
Is it?

3209
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:41,600
It's all we could find.

3210
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:42,800
Couldn't find anything.

3211
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:48,080
Yeah.

3212
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:50,960
It's an interesting world we live in.

3213
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:52,560
I mean, it sounds like you know about this.

3214
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:54,360
Do you know about this?

3215
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:56,880
You know, when it comes to certain capabilities,

3216
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:58,280
I'm not gonna go there.

3217
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:04,480
People just have to see.

3218
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:07,360
I don't wanna be,

3219
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:09,560
look, I'm trying to do this in a constructive way,

3220
02:19:09,560 --> 02:19:11,640
not a destructive way.

3221
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:12,960
I'm extremely loyal.

3222
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:14,920
People think I left the department out of disloyalty.

3223
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:17,000
No, I left the department out of loyalty.

3224
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:21,240
But I wanna do the right thing without,

3225
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:25,280
I wanna have the conversation without being destructive.

3226
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:28,360
And the reason why I left the Pentagon

3227
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:29,840
was really just to finish the mission

3228
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,520
they gave me in the first place.

3229
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:33,560
What about the New Jersey drones?

3230
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:34,400
Yeah.

3231
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:37,800
You know, that came out, what, about a month ago,

3232
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:38,640
whenever they had it.

3233
02:19:38,640 --> 02:19:39,560
No, it wasn't just New Jersey.

3234
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:42,440
It was New York, Massachusetts, Florida, California,

3235
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:45,080
Oregon, Washington, even in the UK,

3236
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:45,920
when I was there.

3237
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:46,960
And I think it kind of spun out of control.

3238
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:48,480
I mean, every asshole with a drone

3239
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:50,520
was throwing it up and taking videos of it.

3240
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:52,360
Sure, and I'm not worried about those.

3241
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:54,960
My concern is when you have some that have been reported

3242
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:57,480
to be the size of an SUV, or more importantly,

3243
02:19:57,480 --> 02:19:59,520
aren't blinking, first of all, they're not squawking.

3244
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:01,120
There's no transponder on them,

3245
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:03,360
which if there's a large enough commercial drone

3246
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:04,200
they're supposed to.

3247
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:07,440
Then secondly, the light patterns were not consistent

3248
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:10,280
with, in some cases, with navigational aviation lights.

3249
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:11,840
And then third, they were silent.

3250
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:13,840
And fourth, when we actually deployed drones

3251
02:20:13,840 --> 02:20:16,480
to try to intercept individuals trying to do that,

3252
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:19,520
there seemed to be an anti-drone capability on board,

3253
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:22,840
meaning some drones were disabled and fell out of the sky,

3254
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:24,840
the ones that were flown to try to intercept

3255
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:26,560
these other drones.

3256
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:29,400
Now, let's talk about drones for a second in New Jersey.

3257
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:33,560
Most people are familiar with the quadcopters.

3258
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:36,440
Commercially available hobbyists have quadcopters.

3259
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:39,160
They fly for about 15 minutes, maybe a mile or two,

3260
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:40,880
and then they have to be recovered.

3261
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:44,240
Now imagine what it takes to fly a drone

3262
02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:46,040
that's the size of an SUV.

3263
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:48,480
Let's look at it technologically just for a second.

3264
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:51,000
Most drones are line of sight, RF, radio frequency,

3265
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,680
line of sight, fly the drone, it sees me, I see it,

3266
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:55,920
and it's getting my signal, I can control it.

3267
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:59,480
If you wanna go beyond the horizon, beyond line of sight,

3268
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:01,960
you now need infrastructure to do that.

3269
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:03,640
You need a repeating capability,

3270
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:05,920
meaning an airborne capability

3271
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:08,840
or a land-based capability that will take that signal

3272
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:11,640
and then retransmit it out to your drone,

3273
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:13,120
because you're now over the horizon

3274
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:14,240
where these signals are gonna reach.

3275
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:15,840
So you need an artificial way,

3276
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:19,120
whether it's a balloon or a satellite or a tower,

3277
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:20,600
to relay that signal.

3278
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:22,640
Otherwise, the thing doesn't fly, the little crash.

3279
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:24,400
You gotta transmit that.

3280
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:25,360
That takes infrastructure.

3281
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:26,360
Then if you're gonna have a drone

3282
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:27,720
that flies more than 15 minutes,

3283
02:21:27,720 --> 02:21:30,800
in some case, five, six, seven hours,

3284
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:34,400
and not fly two miles, but fly over 100 miles,

3285
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,520
think about that.

3286
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:37,120
There's only two types of fuel we use for drones.

3287
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:39,360
One is internal combustion engine,

3288
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:42,240
like jetty fuel maybe you use,

3289
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:44,360
or gasoline for a propeller,

3290
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:46,600
internal combustion engine, or battery.

3291
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:47,880
Now batteries don't last that long,

3292
02:21:47,880 --> 02:21:49,680
and they're heavy as hell.

3293
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:51,840
And the fuel is even more expensive.

3294
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:53,880
One liquid fuel, that's even heavier.

3295
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:57,480
So loiter capabilities, the reason why our drones now,

3296
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:59,480
like a Reaper or something like that, are fixed wing,

3297
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:01,400
because they gotta stay flying for a long time.

3298
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:06,320
And so a helicopter, a rotary blade drone can't do that.

3299
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:07,760
You don't have that loiter capability,

3300
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:09,920
so you have a fixed wing capability.

3301
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:11,160
That's not what these were.

3302
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:12,520
They weren't fixed wing capabilities.

3303
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:16,320
And so if you wanna fly a drone, even one of those,

3304
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:18,040
you have to have someone to launch it,

3305
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:21,000
someone to control it, someone to recover it,

3306
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,440
someone to maintain it, someone to refuel it

3307
02:22:23,440 --> 02:22:24,600
or reenergize it, right?

3308
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:26,520
So now you're talking a group of individuals

3309
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:29,560
that have to be on flying just a single drone

3310
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:31,320
with that type of capability.

3311
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:32,560
Where are you gonna launch it from

3312
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:33,880
without being seen or detected?

3313
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:35,480
Where are you gonna recover it from

3314
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:37,800
not a single one being recovered, right?

3315
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:39,000
Completely in the dark.

3316
02:22:40,320 --> 02:22:41,760
Now you're talking about, okay,

3317
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:43,240
well, maybe I can launch it from a boat.

3318
02:22:43,240 --> 02:22:44,520
Okay, well, how far are you gonna be

3319
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:46,000
in international waters?

3320
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:47,720
And are you sure the coast guard's not gonna see you

3321
02:22:47,720 --> 02:22:50,200
and your ship identifier and all these other things?

3322
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:51,920
I mean, as some people reported having

3323
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:53,160
a quote unquote mothership,

3324
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:55,600
that's a big profile in the water.

3325
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:57,480
Okay, well, maybe they're launching some submarines.

3326
02:22:57,480 --> 02:22:58,320
Okay, great.

3327
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:00,000
But then there's another challenge with that too.

3328
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,280
Is a submarine surfacing to launch them?

3329
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:04,560
Or are these things being launched subsurface?

3330
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:07,600
Meaning like the old Polaris missile, right?

3331
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:09,160
Bows out of a tube and flies.

3332
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:10,760
Now what about when it lands?

3333
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:11,920
And what about if one crashes?

3334
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:13,520
Because it's technology, right?

3335
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:17,040
It could be interfered with electronic jamming capabilities.

3336
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:18,240
Are you willing to take that risk

3337
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:20,240
and all of a sudden now you've lost a drone

3338
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:21,720
and it's paraded like the Russians did

3339
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:23,480
with the U-2 back in the 1960s

3340
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:25,800
when we were flying the U-2 over Mother Russia?

3341
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:27,680
No, that's a PR disaster.

3342
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:30,320
So there's a lot of things that are inconsistent

3343
02:23:30,320 --> 02:23:34,120
with some of the descriptions of some of these UAP

3344
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:37,000
or some of these UASs or drones.

3345
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:41,300
And I think the fact that we don't know

3346
02:23:41,300 --> 02:23:44,280
is proof positive why we need to know.

3347
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:46,280
For the government to come out this last administration,

3348
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:50,840
I mean, this is embarrassing to say to the American people,

3349
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:52,000
yeah, y'all are seeing stuff.

3350
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,960
Every single one of these are being flown in a legal way.

3351
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:58,280
And they're all the heaviest drones or manned aircraft.

3352
02:23:58,280 --> 02:24:02,480
First of all, you don't shut down a military air base

3353
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:05,400
because something's being flown over your base legally.

3354
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:06,840
Get the hell out of town.

3355
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:08,560
We're not that stupid, right?

3356
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:10,920
And when you have all these people that are reporting

3357
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,640
to include members of Congress,

3358
02:24:13,640 --> 02:24:16,800
don't tell me that these are all legitimately,

3359
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:20,120
because if they were, then where's the paperwork from the FAA?

3360
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:24,120
Where's the squat code on this?

3361
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:27,000
How come they're not showing up on flight aware, right?

3362
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:27,840
Nothing.

3363
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:29,180
And then they'll say, oh, these are all being flown legally,

3364
02:24:29,180 --> 02:24:30,880
but we don't know whose they are.

3365
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:31,720
Wait a minute.

3366
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:33,280
Then how can you say they're being flown legally

3367
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:36,360
if you don't know who they belong to, right?

3368
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:39,480
It's even the statement itself is contradictory

3369
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:41,580
and saying, no, no, folks, just don't worry about it.

3370
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:42,620
Nothing to see here.

3371
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:45,100
That's the same kind of crap they tried to pull

3372
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:46,980
with other things, like with the Afghanistan withdrawal.

3373
02:24:46,980 --> 02:24:48,180
Don't get me started.

3374
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:52,020
I mean, you keep feeding a bunch of crap to people.

3375
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:54,300
You think that they're gonna get used to eating crap, no.

3376
02:24:54,300 --> 02:24:55,140
They're gonna get pissed off

3377
02:24:55,140 --> 02:24:57,300
and throw the plate in your face.

3378
02:24:57,300 --> 02:24:59,620
And that's what we saw with this last election.

3379
02:24:59,620 --> 02:25:01,300
The people got tired of being lied to

3380
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:03,300
and constantly being told something

3381
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:05,120
that was exact opposite of what was happening.

3382
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:06,860
Politics aside, I don't care if you're Democrat

3383
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:09,100
or Republican, nobody needs to do that.

3384
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:10,540
Just tell the American the truth.

3385
02:25:10,580 --> 02:25:13,460
And look, if you don't have an answer, say that too.

3386
02:25:13,460 --> 02:25:16,660
But don't lie, don't insult the American public.

3387
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:19,460
Come on, that's not why we put people in office.

3388
02:25:19,460 --> 02:25:20,980
I mean, what are they?

3389
02:25:20,980 --> 02:25:21,980
What are they?

3390
02:25:21,980 --> 02:25:23,460
What do you think they are?

3391
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:25,420
Well, I think there may be multiple things.

3392
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:27,460
It might be a combination of things.

3393
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:30,700
So in the old days, if you had like, for example,

3394
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:33,300
if you breach the perimeter of a military base,

3395
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:34,700
you would have some jeeps come out

3396
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:37,340
and maybe a helicopter to try to find what's going on.

3397
02:25:37,340 --> 02:25:38,820
But we're more sophisticated than that.

3398
02:25:38,820 --> 02:25:41,340
We now have drone capability ourselves.

3399
02:25:41,340 --> 02:25:43,620
And so if we detect something on the perimeter,

3400
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:46,060
breaking a perimeter, we can just launch drones like that.

3401
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:48,100
Automatic, we can geofence the whole place

3402
02:25:48,100 --> 02:25:50,400
and automatically have drones take off

3403
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:52,100
without even a human being involved

3404
02:25:52,100 --> 02:25:53,540
to figure out what's going on.

3405
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:54,900
And by the way, it's a lot cheaper.

3406
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:57,580
You can cover a lot more area using a drone

3407
02:25:57,580 --> 02:25:59,380
than you can with one or two helicopters.

3408
02:25:59,380 --> 02:26:04,380
So imagine a scenario where maybe some people reporting

3409
02:26:04,580 --> 02:26:07,980
some sort of really anomalous issue, a UAP perhaps.

3410
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:11,780
And then the response by us is to launch drones

3411
02:26:11,780 --> 02:26:12,980
to try to figure out what's going on.

3412
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:14,940
And so you have some people reporting something

3413
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:16,180
that doesn't look like a drone,

3414
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:19,500
size of an SUV that disappears,

3415
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:21,380
comes in and out of the water potentially,

3416
02:26:21,380 --> 02:26:25,420
stocks postcard boats in the middle of the ocean, right?

3417
02:26:25,420 --> 02:26:27,000
Up to 20 at a time.

3418
02:26:27,980 --> 02:26:30,040
And then our response is to launch drones

3419
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:32,020
to figure out what these are.

3420
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:33,860
And then people report, no, I was worrying.

3421
02:26:33,860 --> 02:26:35,100
I could hear it making sound.

3422
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:36,780
It was blinking lights like a plane.

3423
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:38,460
It was definitely a drone.

3424
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:39,940
They both could be right.

3425
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:41,740
Both could actually be happening.

3426
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:43,420
Now, I'm not saying for the record,

3427
02:26:43,420 --> 02:26:45,220
I'm not saying that's what's occurring,

3428
02:26:45,220 --> 02:26:48,880
but that could explain why you have this varying degrees

3429
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:51,060
of explanation between eyewitnesses.

3430
02:26:51,060 --> 02:26:52,060
Someone says it's huge.

3431
02:26:52,060 --> 02:26:53,840
It's been loiting for hours and hours.

3432
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:55,300
It doesn't look like anything I've ever seen before.

3433
02:26:55,300 --> 02:26:56,940
And then someone says, oh, no, a little tiny thing

3434
02:26:56,940 --> 02:26:59,300
with warring blades and blinking lights.

3435
02:26:59,300 --> 02:27:02,740
So to answer your question, what is it?

3436
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:03,900
And is it one or the other?

3437
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:05,380
It actually could be both.

3438
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:06,740
And it could also be other options.

3439
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:09,540
It's not something that we haven't yet considered.

3440
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:11,380
But again, this is why it's so important.

3441
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:13,420
This is why I've been trying to emphasize

3442
02:27:13,420 --> 02:27:15,780
with the new administration to get a handle on this,

3443
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:17,700
because this will be a PR disaster.

3444
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:19,780
It will be, it already has been,

3445
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:21,300
if we don't get a handle on it.

3446
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:23,060
So there's been several recommendations

3447
02:27:23,060 --> 02:27:25,380
that have been floated up to the new administration

3448
02:27:25,380 --> 02:27:27,900
to help President Trump get a handle on this

3449
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:30,380
and do exactly like he said he's going to do.

3450
02:27:30,380 --> 02:27:31,220
And I full faith in Congress.

3451
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:32,620
What are some of the other possibilities

3452
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:34,380
that we haven't considered?

3453
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:36,460
Foreign adversarial capability.

3454
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:38,540
Is there a new threat force technology

3455
02:27:38,540 --> 02:27:41,300
that's being used to assess our reaction to certain things?

3456
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:44,020
I mean, I think that was brought up.

3457
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:47,180
There was a lot of chatter that it might be Iranian drones.

3458
02:27:47,180 --> 02:27:48,660
I mean, there have been reports

3459
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:50,940
that that's why the inauguration was moved indoors

3460
02:27:50,940 --> 02:27:53,100
was an Iranian drone threat.

3461
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:55,500
Yeah, could be Chinese.

3462
02:27:55,500 --> 02:27:57,860
Then there's also the other alternative which you discussed.

3463
02:27:57,860 --> 02:28:00,900
Maybe it's a blue force response to a threat

3464
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:02,780
and we don't want to panic the public.

3465
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:04,500
We've got a broken arrow situation on our hands.

3466
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:06,340
We've got a lost nuke, right?

3467
02:28:07,180 --> 02:28:09,380
Maybe some bad guy figured out how to do something

3468
02:28:09,380 --> 02:28:12,060
and put something together under our noses.

3469
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:13,180
That's a scary thought.

3470
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:16,140
Or it could be someone trying to figure out,

3471
02:28:16,140 --> 02:28:18,060
look, let's see the response.

3472
02:28:18,060 --> 02:28:21,100
If I was a bad guy and I wanted to use a drone

3473
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:24,140
to spray some sort of chemical or biological agent, right?

3474
02:28:25,140 --> 02:28:26,700
How do we defend against that?

3475
02:28:26,700 --> 02:28:28,260
Could we detect it?

3476
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:30,220
An airborne aerosol attack.

3477
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:31,460
And so how do we detect it?

3478
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:34,860
Well, we'll send some drones out to spray something,

3479
02:28:34,900 --> 02:28:37,540
nothing bad, just something, a tracer,

3480
02:28:37,540 --> 02:28:39,060
that we can pick up with other drones

3481
02:28:39,060 --> 02:28:40,100
and send other drones out to say,

3482
02:28:40,100 --> 02:28:41,380
yeah, we can actually pick this up

3483
02:28:41,380 --> 02:28:43,340
and this technology works, right?

3484
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:48,340
So there's lots of different possibilities

3485
02:28:48,460 --> 02:28:50,020
and we really need to consider them all.

3486
02:28:50,020 --> 02:28:52,060
I don't understand why we wouldn't have used

3487
02:28:52,060 --> 02:28:54,140
one of those directed AMP weapons.

3488
02:28:54,140 --> 02:28:58,300
Rather, we could have and we should have and we did it.

3489
02:28:58,300 --> 02:29:01,780
And this is my point, it is so ridiculous

3490
02:29:01,780 --> 02:29:05,140
and all it takes is someone in the administration say,

3491
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:10,260
I will tell you, when I was in Pentagon,

3492
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:11,460
I was part of a working group,

3493
02:29:11,460 --> 02:29:13,060
the US Air Domain Working Group

3494
02:29:13,060 --> 02:29:14,980
and it was co-sponsored by the FAA

3495
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:17,140
and Department of Homeland Security, DHS.

3496
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:20,620
And even when I was there like 2013 and 2014,

3497
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:23,180
they were still arguing who was responsible for what?

3498
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:25,700
When you say, okay, who's responsible for drones?

3499
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:26,980
No one wanted to accept it.

3500
02:29:27,980 --> 02:29:32,620
It's ridiculous and this is why I think

3501
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:33,460
the president you're gonna see

3502
02:29:33,460 --> 02:29:35,820
is probably some maybe executive orders come out

3503
02:29:35,820 --> 02:29:38,140
saying from now on, okay, you're gonna do this.

3504
02:29:38,140 --> 02:29:40,420
And if there's a drone in the sky, the buck stops with you

3505
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:42,020
and yes, you can shoot it down.

3506
02:29:42,020 --> 02:29:43,940
Now, if it's not ours and we're not squawking,

3507
02:29:43,940 --> 02:29:45,460
then shame on you, zap it.

3508
02:29:46,420 --> 02:29:48,660
If it turns out to be a government contractor,

3509
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:51,100
well, you should have listed your flight path.

3510
02:29:51,100 --> 02:29:53,500
Sorry, your million dollar capability crash,

3511
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:55,060
that was your fault, not mine.

3512
02:29:57,100 --> 02:29:59,060
Yes, we do have the capability.

3513
02:29:59,060 --> 02:30:02,100
Very easy to do that, but we don't.

3514
02:30:02,100 --> 02:30:03,020
Yeah, yeah.

3515
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:05,140
Just like the Chinese spy balloon, right?

3516
02:30:05,140 --> 02:30:08,420
How many have went over the northern continental

3517
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:12,500
United States before we actually saw one and shot it down?

3518
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:14,700
Oh, I was really upset about that.

3519
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:16,540
It did turn out that we did extract

3520
02:30:16,540 --> 02:30:21,220
some type of intelligence out of that balloon.

3521
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:22,780
Well, you know, the story is now, right,

3522
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:25,020
that we've been known about these flights for a long time

3523
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:26,260
and it never got reported up.

3524
02:30:26,260 --> 02:30:27,660
So that's a break in the chain of command too.

3525
02:30:27,660 --> 02:30:30,940
And who had the unilateral authority to make that decision?

3526
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:31,780
Yeah.

3527
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:34,020
I guarantee you, they did not have that authority.

3528
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:35,140
Yeah, yeah.

3529
02:30:36,540 --> 02:30:40,740
How close are, I mean, what is,

3530
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:45,740
how concerned are you that China, Russia, Iran, name,

3531
02:30:45,980 --> 02:30:49,780
enemy of us has this type of technology?

3532
02:30:49,780 --> 02:30:53,420
This type, as in the drone technology or the UAP technology?

3533
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:54,300
The UAP.

3534
02:30:55,220 --> 02:30:59,060
Oh, Sean, I am worried.

3535
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:01,620
I'm worried particularly with the two big guys,

3536
02:31:01,620 --> 02:31:02,580
Russia and China.

3537
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:03,860
China has already announced

3538
02:31:03,860 --> 02:31:07,260
through the Five Continents Initiative

3539
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:09,780
to run the entire,

3540
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:12,260
be in charge of the entire United Nations effort

3541
02:31:13,180 --> 02:31:15,940
for UAP investigations.

3542
02:31:15,940 --> 02:31:17,060
They announced what?

3543
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:17,900
Can you say that again?

3544
02:31:17,900 --> 02:31:20,420
I think it was the South China Morning Sun.

3545
02:31:20,420 --> 02:31:22,420
They announced through what they call

3546
02:31:22,420 --> 02:31:24,220
the Five Continents Initiative,

3547
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:27,060
China has proposed to the United Nations

3548
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:32,060
that they set up and run

3549
02:31:32,300 --> 02:31:36,060
the UAP investigation for the United Nations.

3550
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:40,140
Russia has had a long history in this.

3551
02:31:40,140 --> 02:31:42,940
In fact, right after the Berlin Wall fell down

3552
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:45,100
and there was this brief romance period,

3553
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:46,420
this marriage kind of honeymoon

3554
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:47,780
between the United States and Russia.

3555
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:49,660
And when that happened, the ball came down.

3556
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:51,260
Actually, you might have been too young.

3557
02:31:51,260 --> 02:31:53,700
There was this brief period for a few years

3558
02:31:54,260 --> 02:31:56,100
where we were working with KGB.

3559
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:57,180
KGB was working with us

3560
02:31:57,180 --> 02:31:58,860
and they were giving us all their files.

3561
02:31:58,860 --> 02:32:02,060
And we gained a lot of insight into their UAP program

3562
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:07,060
into the, well, better not say it.

3563
02:32:07,060 --> 02:32:08,780
There's some names, program names

3564
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:13,780
that the Russians were involved with involving UAP

3565
02:32:13,940 --> 02:32:15,540
and it was very precise.

3566
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:17,100
They were sharing a lot of intel with us.

3567
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:18,420
There was a lot of it.

3568
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:21,060
And even at ATIP, we had a lot of that intel

3569
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:22,340
available to us.

3570
02:32:22,380 --> 02:32:25,860
So we know for a fact, Russia and China.

3571
02:32:25,860 --> 02:32:28,860
We also know for a fact that there were several key allies,

3572
02:32:28,860 --> 02:32:29,700
five eye partners.

3573
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:30,860
I won't say which ones they are

3574
02:32:30,860 --> 02:32:32,220
because they might get mad.

3575
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:35,020
But they were interested

3576
02:32:35,020 --> 02:32:36,380
and we had actually an information

3577
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:37,660
sharing agreement with them.

3578
02:32:37,660 --> 02:32:39,700
In fact, Japan two and a half, two years ago,

3579
02:32:39,700 --> 02:32:41,020
two and a half years ago,

3580
02:32:41,020 --> 02:32:44,020
came to the United States, two and a half years ago,

3581
02:32:44,020 --> 02:32:47,940
came to, actually about three years ago now,

3582
02:32:47,940 --> 02:32:50,460
came to the Pentagon and asked to enter

3583
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:54,780
into a bilateral intelligence information sharing agreement

3584
02:32:54,780 --> 02:32:57,540
with the United States for the sole purposes

3585
02:32:57,540 --> 02:32:59,420
of sharing UAP related information.

3586
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:00,380
Interesting.

3587
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:05,060
Is there any overlap with this information and intel?

3588
02:33:05,060 --> 02:33:08,100
When you say overlap, I'm trying to understand what.

3589
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:10,620
What I'm asking, are we seeing any similarities?

3590
02:33:10,620 --> 02:33:12,500
Oh yeah, all similarities.

3591
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:13,340
That's what ATIP did.

3592
02:33:13,340 --> 02:33:14,980
That's what the five observables were.

3593
02:33:14,980 --> 02:33:16,180
Yeah, there's similarities.

3594
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:18,780
They don't have totally different shit than we have.

3595
02:33:19,460 --> 02:33:20,740
It's a little bit different.

3596
02:33:20,740 --> 02:33:22,380
When you say they don't have different,

3597
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:23,620
are you talking about other nations?

3598
02:33:23,620 --> 02:33:25,340
I'm sorry, forgive me.

3599
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:28,460
When we're sharing files with Russia or Japan or China,

3600
02:33:28,460 --> 02:33:29,940
whoever the hell it is,

3601
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:32,100
are we seeing similarities in the intel?

3602
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:33,340
Absolutely, yes.

3603
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:34,940
The morphology, the velocity,

3604
02:33:34,940 --> 02:33:37,220
the performance characteristics, the capabilities,

3605
02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:38,620
absolutely we are.

3606
02:33:38,620 --> 02:33:40,300
Absolutely we are.

3607
02:33:40,300 --> 02:33:42,540
What the Italian fighter pilot saw

3608
02:33:42,540 --> 02:33:44,540
three weeks ago over the Adriatic Sea,

3609
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:47,260
we saw four years ago with a Navy Super Hornet pilot.

3610
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:48,180
Absolutely.

3611
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:49,700
Okay, okay.

3612
02:33:53,300 --> 02:33:54,140
Wow.

3613
02:33:56,980 --> 02:33:59,340
How much do you think they know that we don't know?

3614
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:01,060
That's my fear.

3615
02:34:01,060 --> 02:34:03,060
That's why this is a problem.

3616
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:06,180
I don't fear the UAP or the UAP technology.

3617
02:34:06,180 --> 02:34:09,180
I fear some other country having that technology

3618
02:34:10,380 --> 02:34:11,660
and using it against us.

3619
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:14,140
And here we are, we're not even willing

3620
02:34:14,140 --> 02:34:16,500
to have a conversation with our own people.

3621
02:34:16,580 --> 02:34:19,380
They're totally open about it, they don't give shit.

3622
02:34:19,380 --> 02:34:22,300
But they're spending lots of money into this topic.

3623
02:34:22,300 --> 02:34:24,060
So that is part of my concern.

3624
02:34:27,340 --> 02:34:28,180
Well, I hope you're right.

3625
02:34:28,180 --> 02:34:30,180
I hope we start getting some answers.

3626
02:34:30,180 --> 02:34:32,660
Well, the good news is I think we actually know

3627
02:34:32,660 --> 02:34:35,300
a lot more than we've admitted, fortunately.

3628
02:34:36,460 --> 02:34:38,300
Is that good news?

3629
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:39,540
I guess it probably is.

3630
02:34:39,540 --> 02:34:44,100
Well, what it is, it's at least I think encouraging

3631
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:48,940
that we've been looking at UFOs for a long time, brother.

3632
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:50,060
This is not new.

3633
02:34:50,060 --> 02:34:52,260
We have been involved in this topic

3634
02:34:52,260 --> 02:34:54,100
since well before Blue Book.

3635
02:34:54,100 --> 02:34:56,780
I just read you a document, they're from 1950.

3636
02:34:56,780 --> 02:34:58,500
There's stuff from the National Security Council,

3637
02:34:58,500 --> 02:35:00,500
the president, from J. Edgar Hoover,

3638
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:01,740
the director of the CIA.

3639
02:35:01,740 --> 02:35:03,820
It's all in writing, it's all there.

3640
02:35:03,820 --> 02:35:07,260
I just sent you a small little, tiny little snapshot

3641
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:08,260
of some of the reporting.

3642
02:35:08,260 --> 02:35:09,780
There's a bunch of it.

3643
02:35:09,780 --> 02:35:11,620
So when people say, well, our government doesn't know

3644
02:35:11,660 --> 02:35:14,220
anything, hello, yes, they do.

3645
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:15,900
That's just been a recent part of the narrative

3646
02:35:15,900 --> 02:35:17,180
so you don't look over there.

3647
02:35:17,180 --> 02:35:18,500
We've known about it for a long time.

3648
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:19,700
We've been investigating.

3649
02:35:19,700 --> 02:35:22,020
There's documents on official investigations

3650
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:24,620
all the way to the White House on this topic.

3651
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:26,980
We got it.

3652
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:31,180
So I would tell people, I think, look, here's the good news

3653
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:32,260
because I don't want to be all doom and gloom

3654
02:35:32,260 --> 02:35:33,740
and go, oh, you're fear-mongering

3655
02:35:33,740 --> 02:35:36,140
and you're trying to say that things are a threat.

3656
02:35:36,140 --> 02:35:36,980
No, I'm not.

3657
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:39,860
The threat is our lack of knowledge.

3658
02:35:40,380 --> 02:35:42,860
The threat is our lack of knowledge on this topic

3659
02:35:42,860 --> 02:35:44,980
and our threat is not being transparent

3660
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:46,900
with the American people.

3661
02:35:46,900 --> 02:35:48,220
You can't fix a problem, right?

3662
02:35:48,220 --> 02:35:49,860
You can't recover from a problem

3663
02:35:49,860 --> 02:35:52,060
if you don't identify it in the first place.

3664
02:35:54,700 --> 02:35:56,700
I think we're at the point now,

3665
02:35:56,700 --> 02:35:58,620
there was a fear for a very long time

3666
02:35:58,620 --> 02:36:01,020
why our government didn't share this information

3667
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:02,020
with the American public.

3668
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:04,620
And I understand, I don't agree with it, for the record,

3669
02:36:04,620 --> 02:36:06,860
but I can respect it and understand it.

3670
02:36:06,860 --> 02:36:09,620
At the height of the Cold War, what was going on?

3671
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:14,100
Well, you had this winner-takes-all approach

3672
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:17,300
to a chess match between then Soviet Union

3673
02:36:17,300 --> 02:36:19,060
and the United States.

3674
02:36:19,060 --> 02:36:21,180
And we had a lot of things going on.

3675
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:24,060
We had civil unrest and we had conflicts over here

3676
02:36:24,060 --> 02:36:26,860
in Vietnam and other places, and we had a nuke,

3677
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:27,700
real nuke issue.

3678
02:36:27,700 --> 02:36:28,860
Russians had nukes, we had nukes,

3679
02:36:28,860 --> 02:36:30,700
and we're building more and more and more and more

3680
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:31,940
and possibly go to war.

3681
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:36,380
And there was this concern that, you know,

3682
02:36:36,380 --> 02:36:37,820
here's this real threat from Russia

3683
02:36:37,820 --> 02:36:39,980
and then you've got this other thing going on here

3684
02:36:39,980 --> 02:36:43,060
that is interesting, but doesn't show any obvious signs

3685
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:44,900
of being a threat yet.

3686
02:36:44,900 --> 02:36:47,900
So why don't we focus on this issue here

3687
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:49,780
and then we'll kind of maybe at some point

3688
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:50,860
address that issue.

3689
02:36:52,620 --> 02:36:56,100
Then there's also the notion of you don't admit

3690
02:36:56,100 --> 02:36:57,820
there's a problem until you have a solution.

3691
02:36:57,820 --> 02:37:00,340
Look, governments are solution-oriented.

3692
02:37:00,340 --> 02:37:03,300
That's what we pay them to do, to have solutions.

3693
02:37:03,300 --> 02:37:06,100
And let me give you a real case in point to this.

3694
02:37:06,140 --> 02:37:09,540
In the 1960s, it's actually started in the 50s,

3695
02:37:09,540 --> 02:37:12,380
the CIA and Lockheed at the time

3696
02:37:12,380 --> 02:37:14,340
developed the U-2 spy plane.

3697
02:37:14,340 --> 02:37:16,540
And the idea of this plane was to fly faster and higher

3698
02:37:16,540 --> 02:37:17,940
than any other plane we ever had

3699
02:37:17,940 --> 02:37:20,500
and fly in contravention to what?

3700
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:23,620
The Russian agreement we had, the treaty with the Russians

3701
02:37:23,620 --> 02:37:26,140
that we would not fly manned reconnaissance missions

3702
02:37:26,140 --> 02:37:27,620
over mainland Russia.

3703
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:28,460
And what did we do?

3704
02:37:28,460 --> 02:37:29,620
We did the exact opposite.

3705
02:37:29,620 --> 02:37:31,500
We actually flew manned reconnaissance missions,

3706
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:32,940
but we did it in a way where we didn't think

3707
02:37:32,940 --> 02:37:34,340
they would ever, ever see it.

3708
02:37:34,380 --> 02:37:36,580
And what happened the first couple of missions?

3709
02:37:36,580 --> 02:37:37,420
We succeeded.

3710
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:39,980
They didn't, Russians didn't respond.

3711
02:37:39,980 --> 02:37:41,100
Mission success.

3712
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:45,220
They didn't even know we were there or did they?

3713
02:37:45,220 --> 02:37:47,980
It wasn't until the Russians were able to develop the

3714
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:51,700
and deploy the SA-2 surface to air missile

3715
02:37:51,700 --> 02:37:56,460
and successfully shoot one down and parade powers,

3716
02:37:56,460 --> 02:37:59,220
who was the pilot and show the wreckage

3717
02:37:59,220 --> 02:38:01,140
in front of the United Nations,

3718
02:38:01,140 --> 02:38:02,580
did the Russians ever admit

3719
02:38:02,580 --> 02:38:05,500
that they were tracking every single flight.

3720
02:38:05,500 --> 02:38:08,380
It wasn't until they could neutralize the threat

3721
02:38:08,380 --> 02:38:11,940
that they ever admit even to the Russian people

3722
02:38:11,940 --> 02:38:13,620
that there was a problem

3723
02:38:13,620 --> 02:38:15,500
because that's what governments do.

3724
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:18,660
And so is it possible that some people in our government

3725
02:38:18,660 --> 02:38:19,860
said, look, this is just too much

3726
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:21,420
for most people to absorb right now.

3727
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:22,700
We don't know how to deal with it.

3728
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:24,220
Let's not cause panic.

3729
02:38:24,220 --> 02:38:25,900
There were some studies that were done

3730
02:38:25,900 --> 02:38:27,180
by the United States government

3731
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:32,180
commissioned to some think tanks by the US government.

3732
02:38:32,380 --> 02:38:33,780
And in those studies, I said,

3733
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:35,340
what would happen with the American people

3734
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:38,700
if we disclose the presence of UFOs?

3735
02:38:38,700 --> 02:38:40,860
And the answer was, you can't.

3736
02:38:40,860 --> 02:38:45,860
You will cause civil unrest throughout our population.

3737
02:38:46,300 --> 02:38:47,980
And people say, no, that's silly.

3738
02:38:47,980 --> 02:38:49,660
You're not gonna cause panic and civil unrest.

3739
02:38:49,660 --> 02:38:51,260
Well, look, it's happened before

3740
02:38:51,260 --> 02:38:52,700
where people got freaked out

3741
02:38:52,700 --> 02:38:54,140
when the Dead Sea Scrolls were first,

3742
02:38:54,140 --> 02:38:55,460
I think it was 1947, right?

3743
02:38:55,460 --> 02:38:57,900
They were discovered, the Dead Sea Scrolls.

3744
02:38:57,900 --> 02:39:00,460
It was like years and years and years later

3745
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:02,340
before the translation of those Dead Sea Scrolls

3746
02:39:02,340 --> 02:39:03,820
were publicly released.

3747
02:39:03,820 --> 02:39:04,660
Now why is that?

3748
02:39:04,660 --> 02:39:06,620
Because they were afraid it was gonna contradict

3749
02:39:06,620 --> 02:39:07,620
the current understanding

3750
02:39:07,620 --> 02:39:09,860
of the Judeo-Christian belief system.

3751
02:39:09,860 --> 02:39:12,900
We don't want, this will upset people too much, right?

3752
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:17,580
Cause panic, cause anxiety, hysteria at a mass scale.

3753
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:24,260
I can understand that.

3754
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:25,380
I can understand that mentality,

3755
02:39:25,380 --> 02:39:29,540
but the reality is the American people can handle the truth.

3756
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:32,700
In fact, the American people deserve the truth.

3757
02:39:33,740 --> 02:39:36,980
This generation, new generation of young men and women

3758
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:38,580
are different than mine.

3759
02:39:38,580 --> 02:39:39,420
They are different.

3760
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:42,620
They have access to the entire world on their cell phones

3761
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:45,340
in virtually any language instantly.

3762
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:47,980
If I wanted to go learn something in school,

3763
02:39:47,980 --> 02:39:49,380
I had to go to the school library,

3764
02:39:49,380 --> 02:39:53,700
grab an encyclopedia that's probably 20 years old

3765
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:55,980
and read a paragraph on something, right?

3766
02:39:55,980 --> 02:39:57,100
If the page was even there

3767
02:39:57,100 --> 02:39:58,220
so that some kid didn't rip it out

3768
02:39:58,220 --> 02:40:00,340
and put it as part of his book report.

3769
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:03,260
Now, you've got the entire world history

3770
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:05,180
in the palm of your hands.

3771
02:40:05,180 --> 02:40:08,220
So I think this new generation is much more willing

3772
02:40:08,220 --> 02:40:13,220
and readily able to accept some of these more profound ideas

3773
02:40:13,340 --> 02:40:18,380
about humans and our existence and our place in this cosmos.

3774
02:40:18,380 --> 02:40:20,140
They're not causing panic.

3775
02:40:20,140 --> 02:40:21,420
Most of the people, young people I talk to,

3776
02:40:21,420 --> 02:40:23,980
they go, meh, yeah, we know aliens are real.

3777
02:40:24,900 --> 02:40:25,900
You do?

3778
02:40:25,900 --> 02:40:26,740
Yeah, why not?

3779
02:40:27,700 --> 02:40:28,540
Well, okay.

3780
02:40:28,540 --> 02:40:30,340
I mean, that's different than when I grew up

3781
02:40:30,340 --> 02:40:31,620
and people thought you were crazy.

3782
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:34,140
In fact, the American Psychological Association

3783
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:38,740
once considered the study or research or belief in UFOs

3784
02:40:38,740 --> 02:40:41,780
as being an extreme form of deviance.

3785
02:40:41,780 --> 02:40:42,620
Think about that.

3786
02:40:42,620 --> 02:40:44,500
Same with tattoos, by the way, right?

3787
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:49,500
So I think our mentality of our society is changing.

3788
02:40:50,140 --> 02:40:53,780
I think we're not, you know, the old saying,

3789
02:40:53,780 --> 02:40:56,340
I'm not your father, this is not your father's oldsmobile.

3790
02:40:56,860 --> 02:41:01,100
I don't think we're in the same place,

3791
02:41:01,100 --> 02:41:06,100
mentally, psychologically, sociologically, theologically

3792
02:41:07,260 --> 02:41:10,260
than we were in my generation.

3793
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:14,500
I think with where we are as a society,

3794
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:17,260
things have fundamentally changed, you know,

3795
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:20,460
the way we deal with new information and new ideas.

3796
02:41:20,460 --> 02:41:22,820
Let's not forget that in the words of Arthur C. Clarke,

3797
02:41:23,700 --> 02:41:27,820
any sufficient technology, advanced technology,

3798
02:41:27,820 --> 02:41:30,460
appears like magic, right?

3799
02:41:30,460 --> 02:41:33,780
But it's not, it's just technology.

3800
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:37,620
I often tell people, you know, a little exercise.

3801
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:40,700
I say, if I tell you the word parachute,

3802
02:41:40,700 --> 02:41:43,180
para being a prefix, Latin prefix,

3803
02:41:43,180 --> 02:41:44,100
meaning above or beside.

3804
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:45,780
So if I say parachute, what do you think of?

3805
02:41:45,780 --> 02:41:48,020
Well, I think of about a device that deploys over my head

3806
02:41:48,020 --> 02:41:50,100
and helps me get to ground with a thump

3807
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:51,620
and not a thud, hopefully, right?

3808
02:41:51,700 --> 02:41:54,020
And if I say parachute, I mean, paramedic,

3809
02:41:54,020 --> 02:41:54,860
what do you think?

3810
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:57,140
Well, I think of first responders, something positive,

3811
02:41:57,140 --> 02:41:59,260
people there to save a life, you know?

3812
02:41:59,260 --> 02:42:00,900
So paramedic, parachute.

3813
02:42:00,900 --> 02:42:03,860
But then when I say paranormal, what happens?

3814
02:42:04,860 --> 02:42:05,700
You just did it.

3815
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:09,020
You did exactly what most people do, they go, hmm, right?

3816
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:10,940
The reason why is because we have been conditioned

3817
02:42:10,940 --> 02:42:14,060
that word paranormal is spooky, it's weird.

3818
02:42:14,060 --> 02:42:17,220
When in reality, everything in science,

3819
02:42:17,220 --> 02:42:19,860
everything in science is paranormal

3820
02:42:19,860 --> 02:42:21,780
until it becomes normal.

3821
02:42:21,780 --> 02:42:24,380
The cell phones that we use and Wi-Fi signals

3822
02:42:24,380 --> 02:42:27,740
and the laptop computer and all that at one point

3823
02:42:27,740 --> 02:42:29,620
would have been considered paranormal.

3824
02:42:29,620 --> 02:42:31,540
And now it's routine, it's not normal.

3825
02:42:31,540 --> 02:42:33,300
It's just advanced technology.

3826
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:38,300
And so I think with this new generation of young people,

3827
02:42:39,980 --> 02:42:42,060
they realize that.

3828
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:43,380
They understand that a lot of things

3829
02:42:43,380 --> 02:42:46,660
that we grew up thinking strange and weird are,

3830
02:42:46,820 --> 02:42:49,820
I was at a time, you probably remember this probably,

3831
02:42:49,820 --> 02:42:52,220
well, yeah, you're in the military for this.

3832
02:42:52,220 --> 02:42:55,100
Do you remember the whole policy of don't ask, don't tell?

3833
02:42:55,100 --> 02:42:56,700
And people's lives were ruined,

3834
02:42:56,700 --> 02:42:59,740
and if they suspected you of being homosexual,

3835
02:42:59,740 --> 02:43:02,620
that you could lose your entire career and be discharged.

3836
02:43:02,620 --> 02:43:05,260
Oh, that's silly, who gives a crap if someone's gay?

3837
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:06,300
I mean, right?

3838
02:43:06,300 --> 02:43:07,900
But that was the mentality back then.

3839
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:11,380
And man, people were, you lose your career over that shit.

3840
02:43:11,380 --> 02:43:14,340
Now we look back and say being patriotic

3841
02:43:14,340 --> 02:43:16,180
has nothing to do with your sexual orientation.

3842
02:43:16,540 --> 02:43:17,580
Who gives a shit, right?

3843
02:43:19,140 --> 02:43:20,300
But that was real back then,

3844
02:43:20,300 --> 02:43:22,020
and it affected a lot of people's lives.

3845
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:24,100
This new generation, I think, realizes that.

3846
02:43:24,100 --> 02:43:26,140
They're like, hey, man, you guys are really kind of stuck

3847
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:28,540
in this old paradigm of doing things.

3848
02:43:30,500 --> 02:43:34,140
Maybe you should reconsider and reevaluate.

3849
02:43:35,340 --> 02:43:36,820
Because at the end of the day,

3850
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:39,140
the topic of UFOs and the UAP,

3851
02:43:39,140 --> 02:43:41,900
UAP aren't gonna change, it's here, whatever it is.

3852
02:43:41,900 --> 02:43:43,900
The only thing that changes the way that we deal with it,

3853
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:46,140
the way we look at it, the way we think about it,

3854
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:47,940
the way we handle it, right?

3855
02:43:47,940 --> 02:43:50,060
We can't change that fact that something exists.

3856
02:43:50,060 --> 02:43:52,820
I can't change the fact that there's a lion or a tiger

3857
02:43:52,820 --> 02:43:55,940
or a hippopotamus on that side of the wall.

3858
02:43:55,940 --> 02:43:58,860
What I can do is change the way that I view that.

3859
02:43:58,860 --> 02:44:01,620
Is it a threat or is it an opportunity?

3860
02:44:01,620 --> 02:44:02,460
Can it hurt me?

3861
02:44:02,460 --> 02:44:05,060
Well, yeah, but if it's behind the case, then probably not.

3862
02:44:05,060 --> 02:44:08,060
And can I learn something from it and things like that?

3863
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:11,260
That's my perspective.

3864
02:44:12,740 --> 02:44:14,460
I don't have all the answers.

3865
02:44:14,500 --> 02:44:18,540
I have some answers that hopefully will continue

3866
02:44:18,540 --> 02:44:23,540
to be developed and come out in a legal way.

3867
02:44:23,780 --> 02:44:25,340
I'm not a leaker.

3868
02:44:25,340 --> 02:44:27,540
I've never disclosed classified information.

3869
02:44:27,540 --> 02:44:30,460
I still maintain my top secret security clearance

3870
02:44:30,460 --> 02:44:31,620
with SCI eligibility.

3871
02:44:31,620 --> 02:44:32,620
I'm not gonna jeopardize it.

3872
02:44:32,620 --> 02:44:34,020
I took an oath to defend this country

3873
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:35,260
from all enemies, foreign and domestic,

3874
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:36,780
and that's what I'm gonna do.

3875
02:44:36,780 --> 02:44:39,780
And I don't think I need to compromise national security

3876
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:41,100
to have this conversation.

3877
02:44:42,300 --> 02:44:44,020
We've come a long way in the last seven years.

3878
02:44:44,580 --> 02:44:45,620
And I've said before to people,

3879
02:44:45,620 --> 02:44:47,580
there's a difference between doing things right

3880
02:44:47,580 --> 02:44:49,620
and doing things right now.

3881
02:44:49,620 --> 02:44:50,860
I prefer to do things right.

3882
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:53,660
We have one opportunity to do it right.

3883
02:44:53,660 --> 02:44:57,020
And I think we are making significant headway.

3884
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:59,300
If someone like me were to just come out full Monty

3885
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:01,700
and say everything I know, you'll know more information,

3886
02:45:01,700 --> 02:45:03,140
but you'll never get any more

3887
02:45:03,140 --> 02:45:05,180
because I'll go to jail and that's it.

3888
02:45:05,180 --> 02:45:07,940
And so I think there's a balance.

3889
02:45:07,940 --> 02:45:10,380
I think we can continue to have this conversation,

3890
02:45:10,380 --> 02:45:12,100
get the members of Congress engaged,

3891
02:45:12,140 --> 02:45:13,940
support our new administration

3892
02:45:13,940 --> 02:45:16,740
in their pursuit, dogged pursuit of the truth,

3893
02:45:16,740 --> 02:45:19,180
while increasing the aperture of transparency

3894
02:45:19,180 --> 02:45:21,220
and disclosure in a manner that is constructive,

3895
02:45:21,220 --> 02:45:22,460
not destructive.

3896
02:45:22,460 --> 02:45:24,820
In a manner that gives the American people

3897
02:45:24,820 --> 02:45:27,420
what they deserve, the information they deserve,

3898
02:45:27,420 --> 02:45:30,420
but without compromising any type of national security,

3899
02:45:30,420 --> 02:45:31,580
equity or capability.

3900
02:45:31,580 --> 02:45:32,420
We can do it.

3901
02:45:32,420 --> 02:45:33,260
Yeah, it's harder.

3902
02:45:33,260 --> 02:45:34,080
Yeah, it's a lot harder.

3903
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,180
I know, ask me how I know,

3904
02:45:35,180 --> 02:45:36,020
but we're succeeding.

3905
02:45:36,020 --> 02:45:36,860
We're doing it.

3906
02:45:36,860 --> 02:45:37,940
We're able to do it.

3907
02:45:37,940 --> 02:45:40,340
We just gotta have a little bit of patience

3908
02:45:40,340 --> 02:45:41,740
and a little bit of courage.

3909
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:43,220
I think we're doing it.

3910
02:45:43,220 --> 02:45:44,980
Look, the fact you and I are having this conversation,

3911
02:45:44,980 --> 02:45:49,860
you are one of the biggest media personalities

3912
02:45:49,860 --> 02:45:50,980
on the planet.

3913
02:45:50,980 --> 02:45:51,820
Now think about that.

3914
02:45:51,820 --> 02:45:55,220
You now have more people listening to you

3915
02:45:55,220 --> 02:45:56,900
and your voice on a weekly basis

3916
02:45:56,900 --> 02:45:59,260
than the major networks of our country

3917
02:45:59,260 --> 02:46:03,120
for the last 70 years, like ABC, the CBS, and NBC.

3918
02:46:05,180 --> 02:46:07,700
So your voice matters and we're having this conversation.

3919
02:46:07,700 --> 02:46:09,100
There was a time that people in the media

3920
02:46:09,100 --> 02:46:10,260
would never talk about this

3921
02:46:10,300 --> 02:46:12,940
because it was suicide, just like politicians.

3922
02:46:12,940 --> 02:46:16,060
This topic would be considered political suicide

3923
02:46:16,060 --> 02:46:17,260
because when you mention UFOs,

3924
02:46:17,260 --> 02:46:20,140
people think tinfoil hats and Elvis on the mothership

3925
02:46:20,140 --> 02:46:21,500
and nonsense like that.

3926
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:23,620
No, what we're talking about is national security.

3927
02:46:23,620 --> 02:46:25,300
And we're also talking about the human condition,

3928
02:46:25,300 --> 02:46:26,600
the way we process information,

3929
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:29,980
the way we handle new paradigms.

3930
02:46:29,980 --> 02:46:32,120
I've used this before.

3931
02:46:33,460 --> 02:46:34,540
And I think to its effect,

3932
02:46:34,540 --> 02:46:35,940
my wife will kill me for saying this

3933
02:46:35,940 --> 02:46:37,500
because she hates this analogy,

3934
02:46:37,500 --> 02:46:42,500
but I will submit to you that there are moments

3935
02:46:44,180 --> 02:46:45,900
in our evolution as a species

3936
02:46:47,020 --> 02:46:49,160
where these paradigm moments occur,

3937
02:46:49,160 --> 02:46:51,660
where we change fundamentally

3938
02:46:51,660 --> 02:46:53,860
our understanding of our reality.

3939
02:46:53,860 --> 02:46:57,100
And so one may argue that when we were first coming out

3940
02:46:57,100 --> 02:46:58,940
of the cave for the very first time

3941
02:46:58,940 --> 02:47:01,460
and gazing upon the heavens,

3942
02:47:01,460 --> 02:47:03,100
we realized at that moment

3943
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:05,100
that our world has got a lot bigger.

3944
02:47:05,100 --> 02:47:06,420
Another paradigm moment may be

3945
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:09,300
when two people were striking a rock together

3946
02:47:09,300 --> 02:47:11,860
and all of a sudden a spark flew and they created fire.

3947
02:47:11,860 --> 02:47:12,820
And for the first time,

3948
02:47:12,820 --> 02:47:15,620
mankind could illuminate the darkness.

3949
02:47:15,620 --> 02:47:17,580
And now the monsters hiding behind the trees,

3950
02:47:17,580 --> 02:47:20,080
well, they were just bushes, right?

3951
02:47:20,080 --> 02:47:21,540
Another paradigm moment may have been

3952
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:24,780
when mankind was standing on a stony beach

3953
02:47:24,780 --> 02:47:26,180
and one fisherman says to the other,

3954
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:28,180
you're not going to sail over the horizon.

3955
02:47:28,180 --> 02:47:29,540
And he says to him, you can't do that.

3956
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:30,460
You're going to fall off the edge.

3957
02:47:30,460 --> 02:47:31,980
You know, by the way, there's sea monsters out there,

3958
02:47:31,980 --> 02:47:34,220
giant cracking and you're going to get ripped apart.

3959
02:47:34,260 --> 02:47:36,460
And of course people laugh about it now,

3960
02:47:36,460 --> 02:47:38,460
but you know what, it turns out they were right.

3961
02:47:38,460 --> 02:47:39,560
There are sea monsters.

3962
02:47:39,560 --> 02:47:41,180
They're just called giant squid of the Pacific

3963
02:47:41,180 --> 02:47:42,900
and great white sharks and blue whales.

3964
02:47:42,900 --> 02:47:44,580
And they're really not monsters, really.

3965
02:47:44,580 --> 02:47:45,660
They're part of our nature.

3966
02:47:45,660 --> 02:47:47,100
They're part of our understanding.

3967
02:47:47,100 --> 02:47:50,820
And so maybe this topic of UAP,

3968
02:47:50,820 --> 02:47:52,760
this is just yet another stony beach

3969
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:54,380
we're about to sail over the horizon.

3970
02:47:54,380 --> 02:47:57,220
Yeah, but we already are with AI.

3971
02:47:57,220 --> 02:47:58,060
Oh, absolutely.

3972
02:47:58,060 --> 02:47:59,180
I could not agree more.

3973
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:01,420
I think you're absolutely correct.

3974
02:48:01,420 --> 02:48:02,640
Well, Lou.

3975
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:03,840
How have we got to any of the questions

3976
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:04,680
you wanted to ask?

3977
02:48:04,680 --> 02:48:05,520
I'm sorry.

3978
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:08,120
It's been a fascinating interview.

3979
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:11,920
And I just, it was a real pleasure to have you here

3980
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:13,480
and I hope to see you again.

3981
02:48:13,480 --> 02:48:14,960
Sean, it's my honor and privilege.

3982
02:48:14,960 --> 02:48:16,400
You always have a home out in Wyoming.

3983
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:17,720
I mean it sincerely.

3984
02:48:17,720 --> 02:48:20,280
Listen, you're doing great work for our country.

3985
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:21,200
You don't need to hear that from me.

3986
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:22,600
I know you hear it all the time,

3987
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:25,400
but truly, truly from somebody who's spent

3988
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:27,400
a little bit of time in the media,

3989
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:32,000
you are providing a great service to our nation.

3990
02:48:32,360 --> 02:48:34,320
And even if it has nothing to do with the UFO topic,

3991
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:36,760
the fact that you're willing to put yourself out there,

3992
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:39,080
have these meaningful conversations

3993
02:48:39,080 --> 02:48:41,800
and allow your audience to be part of that,

3994
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:43,800
history will remember you very kindly.

3995
02:48:43,800 --> 02:48:48,040
You are setting a new tone

3996
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:51,840
for how America gets its information

3997
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:53,000
without a filter by the way,

3998
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,320
before with the networks, remember,

3999
02:48:54,320 --> 02:48:56,340
you had all sorts of people coming up

4000
02:48:56,340 --> 02:48:57,520
and putting spins on things.

4001
02:48:57,520 --> 02:49:01,980
And what you are doing is a tremendous service

4002
02:49:02,620 --> 02:49:03,860
for our nation and humanity.

4003
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:05,500
So thank you sincerely.

4004
02:49:05,500 --> 02:49:07,060
My wife is a big fan of yours.

4005
02:49:08,220 --> 02:49:09,380
Really appreciate what you're doing.

4006
02:49:09,380 --> 02:49:11,940
And I appreciate all the guests you've had in the past

4007
02:49:11,940 --> 02:49:13,740
and all the guests you're having in the future.

4008
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:15,180
Even if some of those guests in the past

4009
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:16,900
don't like me very much,

4010
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:18,500
thank you for doing what you're doing.

4011
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:19,780
Thank you for saying that.

4012
02:49:19,780 --> 02:49:21,420
You got it.

4013
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:22,260
Honor and privilege.

4014
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:25,260
No matter where you're watching Sean Ryan show from,

4015
02:49:25,260 --> 02:49:26,780
if you get anything out of this,

4016
02:49:26,780 --> 02:49:29,420
please like, comment, subscribe,

4017
02:49:29,420 --> 02:49:33,380
and most importantly, share this everywhere you possibly can.

4018
02:49:33,380 --> 02:49:36,620
And if you're feeling extra generous,

4019
02:49:36,620 --> 02:49:41,620
please leave us a review on Apple and Spotify podcasts.

4020
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:53,100
Thank you.
