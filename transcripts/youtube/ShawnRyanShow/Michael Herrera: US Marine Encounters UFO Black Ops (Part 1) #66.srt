00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the UFO whistleblower marathon.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,480
This is a three part series.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,060
Each one of these three men have testified under oath in front of

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,900
Congress.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,520
Our first guest is Michael Herrera who witnessed a human trafficking

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,400
operation in Indonesia where UFOs were involved.

All we ask is just tag the show.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,280
Love you all.

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,960
Please enjoy the show.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,520
There's two more coming.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,160
Michael Herrera, Sean, welcome to the show, man.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,280
Thank you for having me here, brother.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,160
It's an honor.

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
No, no, the honor is mine, dude.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,280
I like seriously, there's so many people that are pivotal in this environment.

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,400
I should say that you've placed in this chair that have made other people

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,560
uncomfortable with what they've talked about.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,040
Um, a lot of people who understand not all is what it appears.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,440
So hopefully I get to add to that and share with the rest of the world, at least

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,880
in the sense of what you're doing, because like I told you, I'm not

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,520
talking to media about this.

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,840
Well, I appreciate it, brother.

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,120
Well, you're all about the truth these days, just as much as I am.

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,480
And it's ridiculous how much is being concealed for a narrative.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,440
And frankly, I'm disgusted with it.

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,760
I am too.

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,000
You know, we try to do a number of things here and the things that I really, I try

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,120
to do is document history from our military heroes because nobody else is

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,040
doing it, bring truth, uncover corruption and bring hope.

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,160
We bring a lot of hope, you know, a lot of guys that are struggling and women,

41
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,880
you know what I mean?

42
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,320
That are struggling and, uh, overcoming all that trauma.

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,920
That's, that's what we try to do here.

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,000
But, and with you are bringing truth.

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,560
Yes, we are.

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,440
So, and out of that, I want to bring hope too, you know, it's not just with what I'm

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,200
dealing with amongst the other people here that, you know, have amazing stories

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,440
too, as much as it sounds outlandish and don't get me wrong, I think, you know, I

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
can agree to that, at least with the outside perspective, because my, before my

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
event, I was actually very skeptical on it.

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm like, oh, that doesn't exist.

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,320
ETs don't exist.

53
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,080
Aliens don't exist.

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,240
It's only out of movies and stuff.

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,720
And it scared the shit out of me when I was a kid, you know, some of those movies,

56
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,880
but then this event, um, changed my life in that degree because it confirmed a lot

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,840
that day, it confirmed multiple facets, not just with, you know, the technology

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,360
aspect of it, but just the level of corruption and how deep this thing goes,

59
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,080
you know, and needless to say, it's something that was a catalyst for other

60
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,080
things to at least kind of change my life, to start not looking into it directly,

61
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,600
but just try to go deeper.

62
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,840
What actually makes things happen.

63
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,360
Yeah.

64
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,480
You know, so.

65
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,200
Well, let me give you a quick introduction here real quick.

66
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,800
Yeah, go for it.

67
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,080
So Michael Herrera, you were in Indonesia in 2009.

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,840
You had a UAP slash UFO encounter.

69
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,000
You're, you were a US Marine, second battalion, fifth Marines, and you

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
were at Operation Katsana, correct?

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,600
Yes.

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,360
And Katsana was in the Philippines and that's, we didn't participate in anything

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,600
that we actually got routed to go to Indonesia in that take.

74
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,360
We're the only ship.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,560
So a lot of people are getting confused with that.

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,640
The rest of the seven fleets stayed there and we were the only element to actually

77
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,960
go to Indonesia, far Western side of Sumatra.

78
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,160
We'll get into all that.

79
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,320
Yep.

80
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,760
Before we do, everybody that comes on the show gets a gift.

81
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,080
Yep.

82
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:02,880
Yep.

83
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,760
Any, any guesses?

84
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,720
Uh, as long as it's not an explosive device, I think we'll be fine.

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,520
You better listen, make sure it's not ticking.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, it's not ticking.

87
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Let's see what we got here.

88
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,720
So, uh, Ooh, Vigilance Elite Gummy Bears.

89
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,880
I got some stickers, man.

90
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,560
Nobody else has these stickers by the way, too.

91
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Nobody else does, but, uh, I don't know, fortunately or unfortunately for you.

92
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm not sure which those are legal in all 50 States.

93
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
So you don't have to worry about getting them through the

94
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,600
airport security or anything, but you live in Colorado.

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,120
So they got a little bit relaxed.

96
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,600
Lots of that.

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,000
Sean, thank you for the gift, brother.

98
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,600
You're welcome.

99
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,120
Appreciate it.

100
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,680
But, um, so we connected through Dr.

101
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,720
Greer at his conference in DC.

102
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
He brought in a handful of whistleblowers.

103
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,640
You were one of them.

104
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,040
Greer came on the show.

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,800
He wanted a military audience and, uh, I believe to get whistleblowers

106
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,400
after the new law got passed where there was protection for people to come out.

107
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,880
It's funny you say that because, um, 2017 Dr.

108
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
Greer actually came to Colorado.

109
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,960
Um, he was hosting an event in Boulder, kind of doing some disclosure, kind of

110
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,560
talking about some of the technology with the ATs, you know, um, UAPs and

111
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,960
just reversing their stuff, just kind of go like the whole grand scheme of things.

112
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,640
It was like a several hour presentation.

113
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,240
And I had my ex there at the time and, uh, I kind of hinted her that I needed

114
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,920
to talk about some things with him.

115
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,000
So he was doing a book signing.

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,120
So I go over to his table, I snag a book and I'm like, Hey, can you sign this?

117
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,760
And I was like, by the way, there's some things I need to talk to you about.

118
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,520
And he kind of looked at me weird and I said, it's very serious.

119
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,920
So he had me as card and he says, don't ever relay this information out to anybody.

120
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
And me knowing with what I knew at the time, you know, which obviously there

121
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,080
was some stuff that went in the works until they recently passed here last year.

122
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,240
Uh, two days either before or after Christmas when they put this law, which

123
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,240
I think that's the only good thing that administration's done so far

124
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,840
to be realistically speaking.

125
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,720
I don't care if that makes people uncomfortable to know, but it's

126
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,440
helped me out among other people.

127
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,200
It might be the only good thing he's ever done.

128
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,680
Um, fast forward to your show, he had him on the first time and my fiance and me

129
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,200
were watching it and that's when he started relaying the information.

130
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,360
I started talking about the law that was being passed and that's when I

131
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,760
decided to reach out to him and he knew exactly who I was, which was great.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,640
It was like having talking to a friend for a while and obviously they call

133
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,600
him out of the blue and it's just like, everything just resumes back to normal.

134
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,360
So, um, I expressed to him, told him my story, my encounter with this

135
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,440
and what happened.

136
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,840
So then we arranged everything to go, at least to go talk with the

137
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,400
Senate Intelligence Committee, Congress, Senate, Pentagon, all that fun stuff.

138
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,680
And, uh, it was a journey.

139
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,120
It was definitely something that opened my eyes to a lot more because here

140
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,480
I'm thinking my event was something that was more specific, but come to find out

141
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,680
I'm just a cog in the wheel with this whole big thing because there's other

142
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,760
facets that I'm also confirming these guys' stories to, to a degree.

143
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,880
The corruption secret organizations that have some pull in this and obviously

144
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,680
some of the nasty stuff that they're doing.

145
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,360
And, um, there's other people down the road who are going to corroborate

146
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,280
what I'm talking about too.

147
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,120
I don't know who they are.

148
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,560
Maybe some of the Marines that I, uh, I encountered this with too.

149
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,720
Um, so I'm hoping that that's what's, at least if the message gets put out there

150
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,400
from the show, I'm hoping that that's what it does is they can get people to

151
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,080
actually do something about it and not be afraid of it.

152
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,120
Like I was, it was 14 years, you know, a lot of, a lot of weight to carry, try to

153
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,080
sweep it under, but the more you try to do that, whatever you resist persists.

154
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,200
That's always a golden rule.

155
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,440
That's a good point.

156
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,760
That's a damn good point.

157
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,000
So just a quick, um, synopsis here.

158
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,560
You responded to a 7.6 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami hit in Western Indonesia.

159
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,560
Uh, only your crew was routed to that location and provide support.

160
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,960
Indonesia has a large terrorist population.

161
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,640
Marine crew was armed and tasked to provide security along with medical

162
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,120
equipment and food supplies, but it was just your unit, uh, which there was five

163
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,760
of you, correct?

164
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,440
Yes, there was.

165
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,520
And so, um, they ended up choosing the Marines out of my unit, at least

166
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,720
in the company to go out.

167
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,840
So it's not like every single Marine in the company was able to do this.

168
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,720
They just handpicked people to go on these sticks of six Marines.

169
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,960
So originally it was supposed to be more of like a deterrence, but also

170
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Overwatch protection.

171
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,880
So that way these Helios can drop the supplies, the logistics groups that were

172
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,760
part of it can then render aid or whatever it is to the local population there.

173
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,480
Was it volunteer or were you hand selected?

174
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,200
Hand selected.

175
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,720
Okay.

176
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,040
Or voluntold, I should say.

177
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,720
Okay, voluntold.

178
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,240
Good way to put it.

179
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,440
Yep.

180
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,800
And, uh, I'm just curious, you know, what, what are you hoping to

181
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,120
accomplish by coming out?

182
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,120
I want other people who have witnessed similar things or are part of certain

183
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,280
things are very controversial, but end up being true to come out and understand

184
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,040
that what's going on is not acceptable.

185
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,200
And it, this is just a fast of corruption.

186
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,000
It may not be the political corruption that's coming out now that people are

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
witnessing with their own eyes.

188
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
People come conspiracy theories.

189
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,840
What I'm hoping to achieve is to get other people on board to understand that

190
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,520
the government supports what we're doing because they were in the dark about this

191
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,200
too, and now they're coming out and they're actually putting the hammer down.

192
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,400
Uh, recent bills have been passing as far as the legislation through the

193
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,600
Senate Intelligence Committee saying that these corporations have to give the

194
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,720
goods here in six months or else there's going to be some, um, consequences they're

195
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,160
going to face either through the judicial system, which obviously the

196
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,440
government's got a lot of weight with that.

197
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,600
The other aspect of it too, is that they're going to ban these companies

198
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,240
from doing contracting work for the government, which means they're

199
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,520
going to lose billions of dollars.

200
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,760
They're going to go broke.

201
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,520
So I'm hoping that they actually comply with this measure because one, this

202
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,840
technology is going to help benefit humanity as a whole, not in a militaristic

203
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,000
sense, because that's just foolish.

204
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,960
It's more to help out humanity because now everybody's going to be on the

205
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,400
same level technology wise.

206
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,120
I think the common ground here and the narrative with that is you're hearing

207
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,720
people come out, at least in the mainstream media is trying to talk about

208
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,800
ETs being able, my event had nothing to do with ETs and there's some

209
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,360
misconstrued concepts are going about the technology may have came from

210
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,480
ETs at one point and that's what we witnessed, but we witnessed much more

211
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,960
of a sinister plot with this that they're using it.

212
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,840
For people who don't know, 2009 during this operation, that's why we're

213
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,600
responding obviously with the humanitarian nature of this because 31st

214
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,840
Marine Expeditionary Unit, that's mainly what the expertise is, at least as far

215
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,000
as Marines go, it's not really combat operations for the most part, even

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,040
though Indonesia among other parts in that world are large networks for

217
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,320
terrorists and insurgents.

218
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,000
So having that expertise of going in and try to help people, I think it's

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,640
also good to us because it teaches you the balance of instead of being a

220
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,280
war fighter, you actually get to help people instead of launching bullets

221
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,680
at people, you're still helping people in a different cause, you still get

222
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,480
to be heroes for people, which is great.

223
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,440
So totally incidental as far as our encounter, when we went onto the slub

224
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,800
because we had our LZ, it was a hasty LZ and they're dropping supplies, they

225
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,120
have a bunch of stuff and it's other helos too, there's kind of forming a

226
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,640
perimeter on the city, dropping Marines here, you could provide Overwatch.

227
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,720
Now the only thing that's unsettling with this is the fact that they never

228
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,520
gave us any comms, you know as well as I do how risky that is.

229
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,440
You didn't have any comms?

230
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,320
We didn't have any comms.

231
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,640
So the Marine that was with me, it was a higher rank than me, was very

232
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,920
pissed off about it because he was a Fallujah Marine, so he went through a

233
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,600
lot of shit and one of those things, I remember him kept telling me, he's

234
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:44,440
like, if everything ends up going to shit and you look at me and if I'm fine,

235
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,640
it means that you're going to be fine.

236
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,120
And I remember him telling us all that in the stick, you know, and he's a good

237
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,040
Marine, he's a very outstanding guy, learned a lot from him during my time in.

238
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,840
And I thought about that concept, but then he started picking things apart too.

239
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,520
He wasn't very comfortable with that.

240
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,280
But luckily the thing was, is that we were still relatively close enough to the LZ

241
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,200
because when the bird was supposed to land, because obviously they were

242
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,200
coming in, dropping the supplies and they'd bank off, the last one that would

243
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,720
come down would land, that's when we'd basically run to the Hilo, 300 meters,

244
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,280
you're in good shape and you have an average combat load, you know, 120

245
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,120
rounds, so to speak, with an M16A4 and a Camelback, not really much, you know,

246
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,040
so you can make that trek relatively quick.

247
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,200
But they also have security on those birds too, with the flight crew, with

248
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,120
the gunners on the sides, they had 50s on them, so if there is some opposition,

249
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,440
they're going to meet with those on top of us engaging them.

250
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,560
So we were positioned near the slope, you know, it wasn't like a steep grade or

251
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,160
anything, but it was enough to obscure what was going on on the other side that

252
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,360
we had no idea what was going on.

253
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,160
So we've got, you know, naturally you want to take the high ground, so you

254
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,680
have observation of everything.

255
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,960
And this is when we came across this operation.

256
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,360
And it was something that stuck out like a sore thumb because here you have

257
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,040
terrain that is a jungle terrain, very green vegetation, things like that.

258
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,760
And then you have something that's sticking out right in the middle of an

259
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,720
opening and it looks very odd.

260
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,520
It's something that's, you know, I'll remember to the rest of my life, to the

261
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,040
day that I leave this earth, I'm going to remember seeing that.

262
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,280
And it's just imprisoned up here.

263
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
I had a camera with me.

264
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,960
It was a Panasonic cheap camera, you know, it had kind of like, you know,

265
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,000
ancient compared to what you got set up in the studio, you know, but it was

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,560
enough at least because it was part of stuff that I would, I've never did a

267
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,880
humanitarian assistance before.

268
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,760
So it's taken videos of them dropping stuff off, things like that, until we

269
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,960
trekked up to this point was taking some pictures because it's a place you

270
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,840
would never really ever go to, at least the real part of Indonesia.

271
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,680
It's not like Bali or Surabaya where it's like a touristy stuff.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,600
You know, this is where it's actual culture, people you're actually seeing

273
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,720
reality here.

274
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,800
So it's stuff that I kind of wanted to document and just say, you know, I was a

275
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,280
part of this.

276
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,760
I can look back and say, you know, Oh, I remember that.

277
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,120
But then turning to looking north past that slope and seeing that down, and I

278
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,640
took some video and some pictures of that.

279
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,000
And I had, you know, I stuck it in my dump pouch and I was a saw gunner

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,560
naturally, you know, so I had M249, that was my favorite weapon.

281
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,440
I liked having a belt fed machine gun as much as a pin in the ass.

282
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,600
I liked having that compared to an M16 or M4.

283
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,680
So because we're in humanitarian, all they did was give us M16A4s, you know,

284
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,800
they had RCOs at that time.

285
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,000
They weren't the ACOGs, they had the mills on the sides for windage and stuff

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,680
like that, as well as the PEC 15s.

287
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,120
You know, so if we were doing any kind of night range or night operation, we'd

288
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,000
have those with our PBS 14s.

289
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,800
So it was just a very basic loadout that we were doing, you know, nothing

290
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,520
really crazy.

291
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,680
And when we saw this happen, saw this, and I want to say unidentified because

292
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,920
right now it's identified.

293
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,200
Everybody knows what they are now.

294
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,880
They're either manmade or they're not.

295
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,720
And if they're not, the government's coming out and telling people, admitting

296
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,240
it, not directly, but they're still admitting it to a degree that it exists

297
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
because why would they spend time with this legislation coming out?

298
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,120
That's a good point.

299
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,840
Why would they do that?

300
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,920
If it doesn't exist, why were they going through these measures to basically

301
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,440
hold a gun up to these guys' heads and say, you better relinquish this

302
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,400
technology or else.

303
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,360
They're not just doing it knowing and seeing this unfold, even being in this

304
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,640
position of having to brief the Senate intelligence among the special

305
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,720
intelligence service, too, which oversees the letter agencies, because

306
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,840
they had no idea what's going on either.

307
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,880
But the fact that all of us coming together and making this loud amount of

308
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,960
noise to get something done about it is just astounding.

309
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,880
And now they're finally, for the first time in history, they're going through

310
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,240
with this and actually trying to do something about it for their own

311
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,360
understanding, but also know the corruption that comes from this.

312
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,000
It's multiple different facets.

313
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,920
I mean, you guys already, all five of you, already testified in front of Congress.

314
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,800
So we testified to people at the Senate Intelligence Committee, which where

315
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,720
there's some Congress people there, some senators.

316
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,440
So in front of the Intelligence Committee by the Senate?

317
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Yeah, and you know, as well as I do, in any kind of setting like that, whether

318
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,200
you're in a skiff, it's all under oath still, because they're signing, having

319
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,760
you sign NDAs and things like that.

320
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
So you're expected to be truthful with this.

321
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,640
And seeing the reaction, it is a very big deal.

322
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,400
It was nerve-racking at first because I'm not used to talking to government

323
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,880
officials in that nature and having the support that they've been giving me as

324
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,640
well as a protection is just something that I'm very thankful for.

325
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm very thankful that they all have open minds of this subject.

326
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,520
I want to tell you all about this new meat delivery service I found called Moink.

327
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,760
What I really, really like about Moink is they are from a small rural farm

328
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,360
town in Missouri, LaBelle, Missouri, right by where I grew up.

329
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,280
And I love supporting small town business USA.

330
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,480
Now, when I started looking into Moink, they educated me on the meat industry.

331
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,400
And I want to share with you all a couple of facts, according to Moinked magazine.

332
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,160
60% of all pork is produced by one company in the U.S.

333
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,520
and that is 100% owned by the Chinese.

334
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Four companies control over 80% of the meat industry in the United States,

335
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,720
more than 10,000 different additives are allowed in the U.S. food supply.

336
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,680
99% of chicken, 95% of hogs, 78% of cattle in the U.S.

337
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,440
are raised in confinement buildings or feed lots.

338
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,560
Means they're not moving around freely.

339
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,520
80% of the antibiotics consumed in the U.S. are fed to animals.

340
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,960
Here's a stat. In 2016, 18.4 million

341
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,280
pounds of antibiotics were sold for livestock.

342
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,600
And that's what you're eating.

343
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,840
Suicide rates amongst farmers are the highest

344
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,600
than any other profession, and that includes veterans, believe it or not.

345
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,040
I found that alarming.

346
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,760
Now, here's what Moink is doing to combat some of this stuff,

347
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,840
which I really appreciate.

348
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,640
Their livestock is 100% born and raised and harvested

349
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,280
humanely in the United States of America.

350
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,840
Their farms practice regenerative agricultural methods.

351
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,960
They are free of GMOs, antibiotics and all hormones.

352
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,520
Their Alaska salmon is wild caught.

353
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,080
Their beef and lamb are grass fed and grass finished.

354
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,160
Their boxes ship from rural America, right in small town Missouri.

355
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,880
Love it. Their chicken and pork are pasture raised.

356
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,560
So, guys, check them out. Moink.

Right now, listeners on this show get free bacon in your first box.

359
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,800
It will be the best bacon you will ever taste, but it's only for a limited time.

360
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:01,440
It's spelled Moink, M-O-I-N-K, Box.com slash SRS.

That's MoinkBox.com slash SRS.

362
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,400
Even though there, you know, for years, there's been a stigma to it.

363
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,080
For years, there's been a giggle effect because of little green men

364
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,840
and flying saucers and all that.

365
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,920
I myself never thought to this day that I'd ever see anything like this.

366
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,640
So going back to the event, we decided to get in the tactical column

367
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,160
and approach this, right?

368
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,600
And we got down the slope and it's just like a clearing and just has this big opening.

369
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,160
It's almost a little bit more than the football field

370
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,560
because this craft took up a majority of that.

371
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,880
So let's just back up for a minute.

372
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,120
Let's describe the setting because at first you said there were Hilo's going,

373
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,520
doing racetracks around.

374
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,440
Is this the same opening that you described earlier

375
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,040
that you were watching Hilo's drop supplies?

376
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
No, no, no, no, no.

377
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,560
OK.

378
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,160
So where this was happening was Southwest, at least,

379
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,120
where the Hilo insertion points were with the LZs that they were setting up.

380
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,200
And they were flying very low in consideration, right?

381
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,480
So and the reason why I know this is because I asked the pilots after this

382
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,040
because I was in the officer's mess and I knew their call signs

383
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,200
and I approached them and they were like, OK, we're going to do this.

384
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,200
And I knew their call signs and I approached them and asked them very respectfully

385
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,920
if they noticed anything strange.

386
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,120
None of them said anything.

387
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,680
OK.

388
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,240
So I was trying to see if they could get a view of a top side

389
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,680
because this is just something that's crazy.

390
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Right.

391
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,760
So also, their call signs all stuck out, too, you know,

392
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,080
because pilots like to do crazy stuff with their call signs.

393
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,240
So it was very easy to track them down.

394
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,240
But having this happen on the north part of the slope and it goes down

395
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,640
and obviously, you know, the way it was transitioning colors,

396
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,240
which was kind of the way that it appealed because it was transitioning

397
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,440
for a light matte black or no, sorry, a light matte gray to a dark matte black

398
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,840
and just kind of ranging in between. Right.

399
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,960
Let's let's let's let's rewind a little bit before we get into the description.

400
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,800
OK. How far so what was the activity with all the other helicopters?

401
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,640
Were they active at the time that you saw the honestly?

402
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,880
When we started going down there? No.

403
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,480
And I don't know, because obviously, we're occupied with this.

404
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,200
How far do you think it was?

405
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,240
So from us, from the LZ where we were at was 300 meters, roughly.

406
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,080
OK. Plus the slope that was concealing plus vegetation down the slope.

407
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
It was like three, four hundred meters, maybe.

408
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,640
So we got close. We trucked down quite a bit. OK.

409
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,160
About one hundred and fifty meters outside.

410
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,600
One hundred and fifty, two hundred. Right. Halfway.

411
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,440
And so maybe about a click away. Possibly. Yeah.

412
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,480
The craft itself might have been a click up. OK. Yeah.

413
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,280
And as I said, the reason why I know how big this thing was, because

414
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,080
did you see it as you crested the yes, the hill?

415
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,280
Yes, I did. And that's so that's where I took videos and pictures of this thing.

416
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,440
That's how I was able to see it, because, you know, taking pictures

417
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,080
of the chaos going behind and everything, you seen the rubble of burning buildings,

418
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,520
flooding and all that kind of stuff.

419
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,400
And then you turn around and like.

420
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,880
So you you you crest this hill. Yep.

421
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,200
You look down into into the valley. Yep.

422
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,640
And there's a clearing, there's a clearing with a UAP.

423
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,040
Yes. Just sitting there, sitting there, rotating clockwise. Yep.

424
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,000
And that's in transition, this color spectrum, I was telling you, too.

425
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,000
And that's why it's kind of something that stuck out.

426
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,920
It's not a building.

427
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,160
You know, it's not something that you're used to seeing.

428
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,920
Maybe topside, it could have looked like a building or something that, you know,

429
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,880
I don't know. I'm not I don't have that perspective.

430
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,520
I wasn't a pilot or anything.

431
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,720
But I can tell you, from our point of view, it's something that just

432
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,240
it looked very unnatural and abnormal.

433
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,600
And that's what got our curiosity to go investigate this.

434
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,920
Now, normally, because we we would have had coms,

435
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,440
you're damn right, we would have called it in.

436
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,000
Report something suspicious, maybe get some eyes on a helo,

437
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,800
get a hold of their call signs and try to do them fly around.

438
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,720
And they never did.

439
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,840
And obviously, we didn't have comes to do it, but they were more occupied

440
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,360
with what was going on behind us.

441
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,920
So when we tracked down and got around 150 to 200 meters from it,

442
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,520
you know, and this is an opening, by the way,

443
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,320
there's no tactical advantage being in this situation

444
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,080
because you don't have cover.

445
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,480
It's jungle. You have concealment.

446
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,040
But this kind of concealment with vegetation is not bulletproof.

447
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,520
So when we trekked up close and we were at TACCOM,

448
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,000
so obviously you have points here, right?

449
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,200
At each Marine, so you have visuals of the sides.

450
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,600
Somebody has point and somebody has the rear.

451
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,880
And all of a sudden, we're involved by this military force of I still,

452
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,040
to this day, don't know who they are.

453
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,880
And how close did you get to the craft, to the craft, roughly 200 meters, 150, 200.

454
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,920
How did you get to the bottom of the hill? Yes.

455
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,640
So you could see.

456
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
So you saw the top of it and then you could see underneath of it.

457
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,560
And underneath of it had this platform that was on the ground

458
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,880
that was separate from this craft hovering.

459
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,680
And it was it was very weird to see.

460
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,200
And I was like, OK, I don't know if that's kind of like a cement

461
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,080
pad or something.

462
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,480
I don't know if it was like a helo pad or anything like that at first.

463
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,160
But then start seeing how the material would kind of look very similar

464
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,560
to what the craft was. It's like, well, that's separate.

465
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,160
So you have something that's on the ground stationary,

466
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,400
and then you have something that's up top and it's just rotating

467
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,520
in a clockwise position.

468
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,520
So right when we got close to it, at least, you know, 150, 200 meters out,

469
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,920
then all of a sudden we were engaged, at least not in a hostile manner,

470
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,000
at least, you know, not gunfire or firefight or anything like that.

471
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,960
But the way that these guys moved was so fluid, so still is very, very, very smooth.

472
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,400
And it kind of indicated to me after thinking about it for several years

473
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,240
is that these guys have done it for a while

474
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
because of how smooth this operation was.

475
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,280
So when we were in a tactical column going towards the center of this thing,

476
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,320
they actually came from the flanks, but it was more of a diagonal,

477
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,560
like a corner of the room, so to speak. Right.

478
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,760
For them, in a tactical advantage, they have interlocking fields of fire

479
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,360
on every single person, and they had a team of eight. Right.

480
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,280
And the gear that they had was black OTV vests.

481
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,920
They had black camouflage utilities.

482
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,720
So what you're saying is there was there would have been no Mexican.

483
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,720
They were professionals.

484
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,520
There would have been no Mexican standoff or if they fired,

485
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,360
they're shooting into their other squad.

486
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,560
They had they had perfect angles.

487
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,360
Yes, they did. To where both sides could engage you.

488
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,040
Yes. Team of four, team of four.

489
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,000
So it's like a fire team element without worrying about a blue on blue situation.

490
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,960
Exactly. OK.

491
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,240
So, you know, with that being said,

492
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,280
because as they as they approached us, you hear the safety's flip off.

493
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,240
Now, your attention to detail, when you're seeing this kind of stuff,

494
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,680
your sensors are very heightened so you can pick up.

495
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,000
I know you've been a combat veteran and you know all about that.

496
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,760
Your heightened sense of awareness is going through

497
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,160
astronomical changes to a provisional.

498
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,720
Yes. So you can hear stuff a lot clearer.

499
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,920
And that's where you kind of picked up the hum that this object was doing,

500
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,920
along with these guys flipping their safeties off, especially in fours.

501
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,120
You know, it's very distinct sound.

502
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,240
Anybody in this room who's held in fours and has shot them and 16 things like that.

503
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,120
It's very distinct sound to flipping it off.

504
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,960
So we kind of knew and they started yelling at us.

505
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,760
You know, they were like, you know, you're not supposed to fucking be here.

506
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,200
What the fuck are you guys doing here? Who the fuck are you with?

507
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,800
You know, so they knew they were using the kind of lingo

508
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,000
that we were used to, especially in the military.

509
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,920
So it made me think that at some point, these guys actually were uniformed

510
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,520
military at one point. Any accents?

511
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,640
Not accents. It's just like American dialects, how you and I were talking.

512
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,680
Very, you know, at one point, they said they were going to smoke us.

513
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,000
They could throw us out of a helicopter.

514
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,600
They could. It's very easy to get lost in the jungle out here.

515
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,280
You know, they kept saying stuff like that.

516
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,400
So after they enveloped us,

517
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,920
they all pretty much got online.

518
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,240
They told us to put our weapons, so we all got online as well.

519
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,720
And we had our hands up. We had a weapon slung.

520
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,600
And they're having two guys

521
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,120
watch while there's a guy basically taking our magazines out of our vest.

522
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,960
And they're throwing them on a deck and they're kicking them away

523
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,040
so we don't have time to react.

524
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,760
They also at the same time, the first thing they did was obviously

525
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,120
take our weapon and clear it.

526
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,200
But they took the magazine out and they actually held it in a way

527
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
to where they could pull a charging handle and collect around

528
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,400
and have it not hit the deck.

529
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,000
So they the way that these guys operate is very smooth.

530
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,480
It's very calculated, very precise.

531
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,640
You could tell they've done this a lot of they rehearsed a lot,

532
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,480
you know, especially combat operations.

533
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,120
You're doing terrain model rehearsals.

534
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,720
You're doing rehearsals, whether you're clearing rooms,

535
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,280
trying to figure all that kind of stuff out.

536
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,360
These guys kind of did the same thing, I'm assuming,

537
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,120
because of how smooth it was.

538
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,440
And because, you know, as well as I do, you get, you know,

539
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,240
you have new guys that join a unit and they're not that fresh.

540
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,640
You know, they're very choppy because of the basic understanding.

541
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,840
You've either had to stack up and do room clearing

542
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,000
and the guys that have done it and been through combat deployments

543
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,720
and all that, they're very kind of methodical, very smooth

544
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,120
because you know what to expect.

545
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,480
These new guys, it's not the same thing.

546
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,240
You can tell these guys were seasoned.

547
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,760
So as they did that, they actually

548
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,040
each Marine had two guys on plus one that was taking the stuff off of them.

549
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,680
They actually knew where our military ideas were, because in Marine Corps

550
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,400
order, you have to have in your left breast pocket.

551
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,960
So there were 15 of these guys, three on each Marine.

552
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,240
No, no. So they had other guys right here and they had three

553
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,400
that were just going through each Marine.

554
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,760
Other people were holding each Marine at gunpoint.

555
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,920
And they're not like they're not like super close to us range wise with,

556
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,000
you know, because if you get a muzzle close, I mean, it's easy to grab it

557
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,640
and, you know, kind of fend off, especially with a rifle.

558
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,440
But these guys were off at a standoff distance.

559
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,360
And even if you try to move, they could they could they could smoke you.

560
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,280
One search team of three guys. Yes.

561
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,280
And then the rest of the squad was aimed at us. Yes.

562
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,720
Oh, OK. Yeah.

563
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,840
So and again, you know, they're not anywhere where they could actually

564
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,800
there was people behind us, because obviously if they had to engage,

565
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,720
they're going to hit one of their own guys, probably.

566
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,360
So it's more like they were kind of moving the same way

567
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,760
through all of us, all six of us taking our stuff,

568
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,440
taking pictures of our military ideas.

569
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,280
You know, so they had like these devices that kind of look like a very thin.

570
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,520
It looked like a smartphone modern day right now,

571
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,160
because in 2009, it wasn't the case.

572
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,120
I think the most high tech thing they had at that time were maybe blackberries,

573
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,560
but they're bulky at that point with the ball.

574
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,960
And then they had their flip phone razors and things like that.

575
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
But these look like something you'd see today.

576
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,760
And they were taking pictures of military ideas and they had something

577
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,080
some other device that was like a mind me of a bat system.

578
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,960
I don't know if you're familiar with that. Describe it.

579
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,960
It's like a biometrics tracking system.

580
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,240
So what it does is when you come across with insurgent,

581
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,040
you can take pictures of their face, their retinas, fingerprints.

582
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,400
Something like that.

583
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,040
But they were trying to have they were trying to scan our ideas with this thing.

584
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,520
And it wasn't working.

585
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,640
So they're kind of getting frustrated with it.

586
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,160
So as this is going on, did they collect biometrics for me?

587
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,360
No. OK. No.

588
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,800
Which I mean, it took pictures of us.

589
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,760
But that may be enough.

590
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,640
And then they took our ideas, you know, because some people I talked to

591
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,800
that are in the special operations community with that, they said,

592
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,760
yeah, we have the ability to scan ideas and it tells us everything about you.

593
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,440
Military ideas, driver license, things like that.

594
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,240
So it's very high speed stuff.

595
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,880
I mean, and considering this was in 2009 compared to now,

596
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,840
I mean, of course, they had this thing that they were using to load up stuff.

597
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,520
It's very advanced physics, you know, something hovering off the ground,

598
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,720
not making any sound, but an audible hum like a guitar amp

599
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,880
or something that's like a transformer.

600
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
So it wasn't like it didn't sound like a jet.

601
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,960
No, it didn't sound like a helicopter.

602
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,280
There was no engine noise.

603
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,800
No, just a hum, just an audible hum.

604
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,160
Very it's very creepy to see because it's not normal.

605
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,920
Was it like a bassy hum?

606
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,240
Yeah, yeah, like a guitar.

607
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,120
Like if you were to unplug it, I mean, it wasn't the same pitch,

608
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,560
but it was like the same,

609
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,880
same kind of sound, same kind of noise that emitted.

610
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,880
And so as they're searching us, we're watching this thing happen.

611
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
And that's when we started seeing trucks come from our left

612
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,040
and go onto this platform.

613
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,800
And they were up armored 350s.

614
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,920
I know exactly what 350s are.

615
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,080
They're kind of beefier trucks.

616
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,120
They were matte black when they were coming at us and they go left.

617
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,360
And I was glancing between what was going on in front of us

618
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,560
with these guys and then all of a sudden glancing over

619
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,040
to what was going on behind them.

620
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,360
And that's when I started seeing the key details of this thing.

621
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,360
Like it had like a scale pattern on it, kind of like an octagonal

622
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,320
because it was craft itself was like an octagonal shape.

623
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,160
We could see points had a pyramid structure on top that was black.

624
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,280
And you can see the shadowing of it as it rotated,

625
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,200
but it was rotating very slow.

626
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,720
And then every it had like these vents on every single corner

627
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,080
on the middle part of these on this the panels anyway.

628
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,960
There was like a Vanta black.

629
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,480
It was like a dark black that would like absorb light.

630
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,920
Very weird.

631
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,000
What do you mean by that?

632
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,040
A dark black that would absorb light.

633
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,120
So if you're ever familiar with the BMW, they painted Vanta black.

634
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,320
It was like a very super dark black.

635
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,640
It's not like a reflective material and the matte black.

636
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,320
Yeah, but very, very, very even darker than matte black.

637
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,280
OK, like you can shine a light at it and it won't even illuminate

638
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,920
like the Batmobile, kind of something like that.

639
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,040
But even it was like very dark.

640
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,960
So we can describe was like the Vanta black. OK.

641
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,560
And so as you when you mean absorb light, you're saying.

642
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,080
If I shine a laser on it, you probably you might not even see the laser.

643
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,840
It would be very dull. Correct. OK, something like that.

644
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,200
So we're watching these vehicles, right?

645
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,880
These trucks now, the thing I would say on the front of them,

646
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,080
because, you know, Humvees, the military has they have the I.R.

647
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,880
lights on the front near the headlights that you can drive at night time

648
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,960
with your knots.

649
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,640
So they had the same thing because they had the same kind of slits

650
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,520
that had the I.R. lights, but they had weapon cases

651
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,200
in the back of each truck bed.

652
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,560
And, you know, you could store like a couple hundred weapons,

653
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,680
maybe a hundred weapons, maybe a platoon, a company size element.

654
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,720
And it was the same Pelican cases that we would use to store stuff

655
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,280
when they were transporting, you know, so very big cases on two of them

656
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,920
in each truck bed.

657
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,360
And then they had a shipping container thing.

658
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,240
I mean, it looked like a shipping container, but smaller and half the size.

659
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,040
And the thing that was different about this is I had a cylinder

660
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,800
on the front of it that was towards the truck.

661
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,840
It was like parallel to the ground, just a cylinder right on the top of this thing.

662
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,040
And for years, I thought, OK, you know, like

663
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,960
it's got to be Austrian supplier or like a vacuum sealing thing

664
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,360
that you would, you know, because obviously I'm thinking it's drugs.

665
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
It was like, OK, so it's a very advanced way to do that.

666
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,600
Just the years of thinking of this.

667
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,560
And come to find out when I gave my speech in D.C.

668
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,640
on that Saturday for the disclosure project with Dr. Greer,

669
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,000
he's got a lot of people come out of the work would work, by the way.

670
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,080
And this gentleman, I'm not going to give any detail.

671
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,120
I know a little bit about him,

672
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,720
but he works in some of these projects, the very some

673
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,280
very controversial facilities.

674
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,120
He's aware of what was going on.

675
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,080
After I gave my presentation of this.

676
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,720
He confirmed he says, no, he's like, I don't want to leave Michael

677
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,720
hanging out there, but I was not expecting to come and talk to you about this.

678
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,120
And he went explaining what the operations do, why they do it

679
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,600
and what they were using them for.

680
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,280
And he says there's not drugs that they're putting in the shipping containers.

681
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,880
Says it's humans, human traffic.

682
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,960
Yes. His own words.

683
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,520
And, you know, of course.

684
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,400
And he also wants to come forward, at least with him and 30 other people

685
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,520
that are involved with that part of the work.

686
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,040
But it was very disheartening to actually get that information relayed to me

687
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,800
because here I'm thinking for years it's drugs and it's a much sinister thing.

688
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,760
But it makes sense because they use natural disasters

689
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,200
that people are going to be missing anyway.

690
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,520
Yeah. Scoop up people.

691
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,960
I mean, I just I've been covering human trafficking this year. Right. And.

692
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,760
That's, you know, a lot of the human trafficking comes from third world

693
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,920
countries in distress.

694
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,640
You're in a third world area in distress right after her.

695
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,160
Right after an earthquake would be.

696
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,000
I mean, it's prime prime time to do a human trafficking operation. Right.

697
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,360
How big were the containers?

698
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,280
I would say probably eight feet and 10 feet, eight feet tall, 10 feet with him.

699
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,200
So like maybe half a Connex box. Yeah, about that. OK.

700
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,040
And they were kind of like on the trailer that was underneath

701
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,920
was kind of like a regular Humbrey trailer that you would see kind of pull stuff,

702
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,200
something like that.

703
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,520
How were they being lifted into the craft?

704
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,160
So they were driving onto this platform that was angled so it hit

705
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,160
and it just raise up and they're just driving on this ramp.

706
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,200
Oh, the whole thing.

707
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,280
Yeah, but the whole thing was a ramp.

708
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,640
OK, like a circular ramp.

709
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,040
And I mean, obviously, I can't see what's on, excuse me, the other side of it.

710
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,720
But I'm assuming because it's a circular pattern that it's going to be the same

711
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,680
on the other side because they would drive on this platform.

712
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,200
And at that point, I saw all the doors open.

713
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,320
Four guys would come out.

714
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,440
And then I'd go back to what we're facing here with these guys

715
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,000
searching our stuff, asking us questions, taking our IDs,

716
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,640
trying to intimidate the crap out of us.

717
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,920
And so I can see the guys come out of the truck.

718
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,800
And that was making me think, too, like at a tactical advantage,

719
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,480
we didn't have that.

720
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,200
There's only six of us basically trained infantry marines.

721
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,560
And there's these guys here that are doing this operation and very skilled,

722
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,440
very methodical, very calculated, very precise.

723
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,280
And if there's eight of them and then all of a sudden

724
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,400
every single truck has four of these guys, I know that it's not just these guys

725
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,960
are running a perimeter.

726
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,200
They could have been 40 or 30 or 40 people.

727
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,560
They've been platoon size element.

728
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,400
And the fact that we have no concealment, barely have any concealment,

729
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,080
because if we were to run and bank off the sides here to go to our flanks,

730
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,120
they could just engage us.

731
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,960
There's nothing to hide behind.

732
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,320
Yeah. Vegetation ain't going to stop bullets, you know.

733
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,320
But so there's a lot of questions I have, too, because it's, you know,

734
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,080
obviously, if we would have engaged them,

735
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,240
then the whole rest of the force behind us would know about it

736
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,040
because they'd heard the commotion. Yeah.

737
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,360
How many containers do you estimate were put into the craft?

738
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,480
Four, because I saw four trucks. Four containers.

739
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,200
Yes. And there could have been more.

740
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,080
But at that point where we saw we could have, you know,

741
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,360
because we stumbled onto this thing, we ruined their operations, so to speak,

742
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,880
because we weren't allowed to see that.

743
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,280
Let's talk about the craft.

744
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
OK. How big was it?

745
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,800
300 feet is what I'm estimating about a football field.

746
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,680
And the reason why I say this is because we flew on CH-53 Super Stallions.

747
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,080
I'm sure you're familiar with those.

748
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,960
Your time is sealed.

749
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
They're roughly 100 feet. All right.

750
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,400
So from nose to tail, if you lined up three of them and fit three of them

751
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,160
under this craft, because I can see, you know, especially the operation behind us,

752
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,360
you kind of see them off in the distance.

753
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,320
So you try to gauge, you know, as a Marine, you're always trying to judge

754
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,400
distance, you know what I mean, because if you're having to engage,

755
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,480
but lo and behold, we end up having a surprise right here happen with these guys.

756
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,440
But that's how I know it was around 300 feet.

757
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,240
Oh, good. That's a that's a and it was circular. Circular.

758
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,480
It's like an octagon because it had like corners on it.

759
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
That was like an octagon shape, but still circular.

760
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,280
Could you see was it one smooth piece of metal?

761
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,400
No. Was it panels? Panels.

762
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,200
Yep. How are they?

763
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,080
How just describe more, were there windows?

764
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,400
Were there? There were not windows.

765
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,040
Nothing I could see like that.

766
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,360
They just had that Vantablack vent looking things on each corner.

767
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,720
That's all I saw with that.

768
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,600
And it had like an octagonal scale pattern that went through it.

769
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,320
It honestly reminded me kind of like a design for an F-22 Raptor.

770
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,440
You know, I like the top of it kind of looks like that.

771
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,440
That's what it kind of reminded me of with because it would transition those colors.

772
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,280
So it's suspect, you know, I've had people I've talked to about this to say,

773
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,000
well, you know, Lockheed Martin has reverse engineer stuff that's circular.

774
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,720
Raytheon, they have triangular craft.

775
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,600
And he said it might have been Lockheed because Lockheed also made the F-22.

776
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,400
Similar design concept.

777
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,160
Now I think about it, right, because at this time, you're not really thinking about it.

778
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,840
You're like, I'm more concerned with these guys and who the hell they are.

779
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,280
So after we witnessed the last truck going on there

780
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,360
and we're still dealing with that, I got searched already, of course,

781
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,280
and I'm just paying attention to what's going on and making sure my guys are good, too.

782
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,280
And all of a sudden, the trucks, we never saw them again.

783
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,440
They were not on that platform.

784
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,680
There was like boxes and stuff that were on that platform.

785
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,440
And so I'm assuming they either drove off on the other side

786
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,880
or disappear or where they went, I don't know.

787
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,720
But all of a sudden, we notice that this platform raises off the ground by itself

788
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,000
and doesn't make any noise, by the way, doesn't disturb anything.

789
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,520
Before it started gaining elevation, how high off the ground was this?

790
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,560
The actual craft?

791
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,200
Yes.

792
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,800
I would say probably 20 feet.

793
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,280
OK.

794
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,560
Yeah, good distance.

795
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,280
And the platform rose up, but I would say like the platform was up several feet, right?

796
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,440
Probably maybe five, six feet, because it was from the distance,

797
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,000
probably about a half an inch.

798
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,880
I mean, I'm just envisioning, I'm envisioning a, the way you're describing this,

799
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,840
I'm envisioning an octagon rotating clockwise with a drop ramp,

800
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:19,640
similar to maybe something you would see on the back of a C-130, C-17, but circular.

801
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,560
But circular and separate.

802
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,840
There's no cables.

803
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,400
There's no.

804
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,200
OK.

805
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Was the ramp attached to the craft?

806
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,560
No.

807
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,800
So there was just an opening?

808
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,600
There was just an opening.

809
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,840
Like the bottom part of the craft, I was, what I'm assuming,

810
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,200
because that's where I saw it lift up and go into, was like the bottom part.

811
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,960
It was like the floor itself was like the platform and they were just rolled up, right?

812
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,240
But at the same time, the top part leveled a little bit and went down to meet with this.

813
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,280
And as that happened, you start to see it rise up past the treeline.

814
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,040
It's not like a super fast and just rapid, it's just like kind of slow.

815
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,560
As that's going on, the rotations has not changed.

816
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,000
The audible hum has not changed.

817
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,720
It's not like somebody hit the gas and you hear a different noise.

818
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,800
It's just constant.

819
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,300
OK.

820
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:14,680
Each point on that octagonal shape started to illuminate colors.

821
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,280
It was just one color per point.

822
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,600
It was red, it was green, it was yellow, and it was blue.

823
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,280
It was the only colors I saw and it was rotating, right?

824
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,480
As soon as it got to the top of the treeline, like cleared the trees,

825
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,680
this thing shot off to the left.

826
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,760
And to the left was the ocean, by the way.

827
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,520
It was just going west.

828
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,120
How far to the left was the ocean?

829
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,200
Probably a good mile and a half, maybe.

830
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,840
That's it?

831
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,080
Yeah.

832
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,280
So you're right on the coastline.

833
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,760
Yeah.

834
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,260
OK.

835
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,200
Probably, I would say me, it could be a mile and a half to three miles, I'd estimate,

836
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,600
because I mean, that's just estimation I don't really know,

837
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,000
because it took us a little bit when we landed into the near Padding City,

838
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,040
because we landed the airstrip and then we took like a several minute flight

839
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,000
going from southwest to like northeast part, roughly.

840
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,200
So I'd say probably a couple miles to kind of estimate.

841
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,520
And like I said, it didn't change pitches of noise or anything,

842
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,760
and it just completely shot off.

843
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,640
I mean, it's just like a blur that went left.

844
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,480
Didn't make a sonic boom.

845
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,440
Like you'd see a fighter jet when you see the pressure, the way that that happens.

846
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,400
It didn't disturb any of the trees,

847
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,160
like what rotor wash would do on a helo or a jet flying the map of the Earth

848
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,320
and leaving exhaust and blowing the, you know,

849
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,000
you kind of see top gun movies without.

850
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,040
No propulsion.

851
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,540
Nothing.

852
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,440
There were even coconuts that you could visibly see on these trees.

853
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,000
None of them were disturbed.

854
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,520
Oh, shit.

855
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,020
Yeah.

856
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,940
And me, I like, I like aircraft.

857
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,820
You know, that was my thing.

858
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,740
You know, I wanted to be a pilot, but that didn't happen.

859
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,860
I wanted to fly the Harrier.

860
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,340
And I know about aircraft.

861
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,300
I know everything that we've got.

862
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,180
I know everything about them.

863
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,260
You know, from a little kid, that's all I wanted to do, you know,

864
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,540
but obviously then being infantry was the next best thing.

865
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,060
So it wasn't something I've never seen before,

866
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,940
something I know that we didn't have, at least in the conventional wise,

867
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,620
on top of the military force that was there.

868
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:13,260
Ladies and gentlemen, it has been a minute since I've done a Bubbs Naturals commercial,

869
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:21,500
but it has not been a minute since I've taken the best shit of my entire life.

870
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,900
Actually, just knocked one out this morning.

871
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,260
It was amazing.

872
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,700
And I'm going to give you the secret.

873
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,340
You ready?

874
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,380
Here's the secret.

875
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,780
You want the secret for the best shit of your entire life that you could do,

876
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,140
I don't know, every day?

877
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,020
Of your entire life that you could do, I don't know, every day?

878
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,780
Maybe multiple times a day.

879
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,660
Here's the secret.

880
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,060
Bubbs Naturals Calogen Peptide.

881
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,540
Says it's good for joints, hair, skin, and nails.

882
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,980
I'm surprised they don't put on there.

883
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,820
It'll give you the best shit of your entire life.

884
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,060
But hey, I get it, right?

885
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:59,180
And you mix that with the halo creamer that's MCT oil.

886
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,300
Put these two together.

887
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,780
You're going to have an explosive hell of a day.

888
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:13,420
These things are both Whole30 approved, NSF certified, and USDA approved.

889
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,940
So there's that.

890
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,100
On top of that, hold on, wait.

891
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,140
There's more.

892
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,900
If that doesn't get you going, which I guarantee you it will,

893
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,780
you've got Bubbs new coffee.

894
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,700
Bubbs new coffee.

895
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:33,100
So this is the first ever coffee bean Whole30 approved, if you can believe that.

896
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,980
And we all know coffee can speed things up a little bit in the morning.

897
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,940
But hold on, wait.

898
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,380
There's more.

899
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,900
Apple cider vinegar gummies.

900
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,060
Guys, I'm going to be honest.

901
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,340
I don't know exactly what these things do for you.

902
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,380
But here it says, promotes energy, immune support,

903
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,580
promotes healthy digestion, and supports healthy metabolism.

904
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,620
I can tell you one thing.

905
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,820
Good luck just eating one of these things, because at the end of the night,

906
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,820
I will crush an entire bottle of these.

907
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,100
That will not give you the best shit of your life.

908
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,380
I wouldn't recommend it.

909
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,300
It will speed things up, but you may not like the final outcome.

910
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,260
And hold on, wait.

911
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,860
There's more.

912
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,420
There's more.

913
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,660
Bubbs came out with a lot of new products.

914
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:27,420
They have these hydrate or dihydration packets.

915
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,180
Great for post-workout.

916
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,820
All this stuff is great for post-workout, especially the collagen protein.

917
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,060
Guys, here's another thing about Bubbs.

918
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,140
Bubbs is a tribute company.

919
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,820
It's named after Glenn Bubbs-Doherty, who was a Navy SEAL and a CIA contractor.

920
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,660
He died defending our freedom in Benghazi.

921
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:53,340
And Bubbs donates a portion of every order to the Glenn Doherty Foundation,

922
00:44:53,340 --> 00:45:01,020
and they donate 100% of the proceeds from their products on Veterans Day every year.

923
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,180
I love this company.

924
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,740
They are just solid people with a solid product,

925
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:14,940
and they just want everybody to experience the best shit of your life.

926
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:23,580
Go to bubsnaturals.com, use the promo code Sean for 20% off, and let's get it going.

927
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,020
We're all hooked up and ready to go.

928
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,940
The jump master's got his arm up, getting ready to hit me in the back,

929
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,820
and then we see Shufflin, and I'm only one of 12 guys that I jump with every time.

930
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,980
He filed a classified complaint under oath,

931
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,940
and the intelligence community inspector general said that he found the complaint urgent and credible.

932
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,860
That guy from the back shuffles his way to the front and is one of the escorts.

933
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,100
He is unmistakable.

934
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,420
I get a knock at the door.

935
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,140
It's that same guy who cut me out of the door, hands me a note,

936
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,500
instead of thinking of you, he's like, hey, sorry about your loss, buddy.

937
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:17,420
I think it gives weight to a lot of the people that have come forward and talked about having direct first-hand experience.

938
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,700
To me, it just felt like somebody looking you dead in the eye and said, I can touch you anytime I want.

939
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,580
Well, when was the assassination attempt?

940
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:32,540
So we go inside, meet another escort in there, take us to this freight elevator.

941
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:37,340
One of the guys looks at my dad as saying to both of us,

942
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,900
keep your head down, your eyes on the heels of the man in front of you, or you'll be shot.

943
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:47,100
What could somebody threaten you with to make you turn your back on your own child?

944
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,860
So as that took off, we're also in order to face that slope that we came down,

945
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,620
and like I said, it's not very high up.

946
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,340
I mean, it's high enough to obscure everything to kind of go down in the valley.

947
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:12,540
And so as we turn around, I'm like, fuck, they're going to do it.

948
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,700
I think they were just going to fucking rip us right there.

949
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,780
You're worried they're going to kill you.

950
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:18,940
Yeah.

951
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,100
Does that mean it's like...

952
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,980
When you, before we get to that, when you saw this thing take off,

953
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,220
I mean, do you have any estimation of speed?

954
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,260
Have you seen anything?

955
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,260
I mean, was it faster than anything you've seen before?

956
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,420
Was it a normal speed?

957
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,620
No, it was faster.

958
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,220
It was the fastest thing I've ever seen.

959
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,380
I would say probably four or 5,000 miles an hour.

960
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,460
I mean, it was instantaneous.

961
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,740
It was just like a left of blur.

962
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,500
Like a jet-screened bike going as fast as it possibly could,

963
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,180
you can still make the shape of it and still lock your eyes onto it as it's going.

964
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,540
There's no way in hell you could lock your eyes onto this thing as it's moving.

965
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,500
That's how fast it was.

966
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,060
And eyesight, you know, something moving,

967
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,980
your eyes are naturally going to pick up that motion.

968
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,660
And this didn't do that.

969
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,620
I mean, it was just like, it just left a very fast blur.

970
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,980
And like I said, I've never seen anything like that.

971
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:13,660
The way that it moved, the way that it didn't make any sound completely,

972
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,980
you know, didn't change pitch of the hum or anything like that.

973
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,580
Did it go at an upward angle?

974
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,700
Was it a straight line?

975
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,860
It just looked like a straight line from what I couldn't see.

976
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,420
You know what I mean?

977
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,380
It just, it wasn't like it went up in the sky or anything.

978
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,700
It was just like, went over the trees and was gone.

979
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,260
Okay.

980
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:31,180
So yeah, I mean, you know, knowing aircraft and things like that,

981
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,100
it's just wasn't something normal.

982
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,580
Something completely faster.

983
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,860
Something doesn't make any sound.

984
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,660
I mean, radar sensor, I have no idea, you know,

985
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:44,220
but there's theories that maybe the design of it could not reflect radar signals.

986
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,100
I mean, I don't know how that go.

987
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,420
I'm not, you know, I don't work in that project or anything like that,

988
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,500
but it's just something that's very odd to see.

989
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,540
Very, very alarming.

990
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:53,500
Did the lights stay on as it took off?

991
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,060
Yeah, but you can't even see the blurs of lights even.

992
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,700
It was just this black blur that just left.

993
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,300
Damn.

994
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:00,800
Yeah.

995
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,460
I mean, it was creepy.

996
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,700
It was, it was fucking creepy to see.

997
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,900
And, you know, of course we're like dumbfounded

998
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,660
because you've never seen anything like this.

999
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,660
And this is like some Hollywood shit, you know,

1000
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,300
make the ships from Independence Day look like a joke, you know,

1001
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,420
how fast this thing was.

1002
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,660
So it was, it was very, very, very weird to see that.

1003
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,180
And like I said, as we were ordered to turn towards the slope that we came down

1004
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,820
and that's when I thought it was it.

1005
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,300
I thought they were going to smoke us, you know, and they kept saying that,

1006
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,820
you know, we're just, we can kill you right now.

1007
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,540
You know, they're as, as this is going on, they're talking shit.

1008
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,460
They're looking at us or taking pictures.

1009
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,860
They're doing, you know, everything that they're trying to clear us.

1010
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:49,980
So as we turn this and all of a sudden I see a sling pass over my head.

1011
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,740
I'm like, oh fuck, they're going to strangle me.

1012
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,820
And that wasn't the case.

1013
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,100
They actually tightened it so well that when they placed it and you know,

1014
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,900
it's cross body and obviously the buttstock of the rifle is up on the right shoulder

1015
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,060
and the muzzle is kind of more towards your left.

1016
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,260
And they tighten the sling so well that if you try to get it off, it's going to struggle.

1017
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,400
Right.

1018
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,540
And they started putting the magazines in and they put all six of them in our vests,

1019
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,900
but they put in a way that wasn't tactile.

1020
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,300
They put them like right side up where you can see the brass, right?

1021
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,260
Because brass to the grass is usually what we always train our Marines to do.

1022
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,940
So you just take it out, pop it in, boom.

1023
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,440
Right.

1024
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:27,260
And they did in the case of be tactical.

1025
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,860
It wouldn't be a tactical advantage to do that.

1026
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,380
So by the time you get your weapon off, try to put a magazine in and charge it.

1027
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,140
You're already going to get smoked.

1028
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:35,680
Yeah.

1029
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,380
Were you standing up when they did this?

1030
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:38,880
Yes.

1031
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,080
Yep.

1032
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,300
And when I saw that sling come over, I mean, I was like, fuck, I thought they're going to strangle me.

1033
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,980
Were they talking to you as they were doing this?

1034
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:46,540
Yes.

1035
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,460
That's when I was saying they're going to, you know, smoke us.

1036
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,180
They're going to kill us.

1037
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,780
They could shoot us, you know, leave us here to die, stuff like that.

1038
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,820
Why do you think they were doing, I mean, it sounds like they were taunting on you.

1039
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:56,620
They were.

1040
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,180
And I think, you know, my personal opinion is I think they wanted,

1041
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,540
I think they really wanted to kill us.

1042
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,380
But if they made any, I mean, because they didn't have suppressors, you know,

1043
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,740
they had M4A4s.

1044
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,100
They had like the high speed set out.

1045
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,540
They had actual ACOGs.

1046
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,620
They had the honeycombs on them.

1047
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,820
They had PEC16s, which is a step up from what we had.

1048
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,860
They had steel magazines.

1049
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,700
Their weapons are like they were brand new.

1050
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,900
Do they have nods?

1051
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,460
No.

1052
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,820
They have ball caps, though.

1053
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,380
Ball caps?

1054
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:22,620
Yep.

1055
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:27,180
They had no insignias, nothing that would signify what their rank was,

1056
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,460
nothing that would signify what branch if they were.

1057
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,660
There's nothing to identify.

1058
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:37,020
And, you know, law enforcement agencies typically try to be uniform with all blacks.

1059
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,660
You can't really identify who they are specifically.

1060
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,740
And it's like how these guys were doing the same thing.

1061
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,900
Because I know in AO's, at least where you have friendlies,

1062
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,340
you want to identify who's what because that's how you're going to coordinate

1063
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,820
between everybody, you know, who's friendly and who's not.

1064
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,700
So if you're having to do anything like airstrikes, close air support,

1065
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,340
CASEVACs, you know what to say and what they look like.

1066
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:59,340
Paint the picture for what you're getting into to provide other people that intel.

1067
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,100
And these guys were just uniform black.

1068
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:02,780
Ball caps.

1069
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,860
And it's just, you know, it's very obvious that these guys didn't want to be identified,

1070
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,220
but they had American dialects.

1071
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:12,540
They had American lingo similar to what Marines would use or at least military.

1072
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,140
So that's why my suspicion is I think that these guys at one point were

1073
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,100
uniform military.

1074
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,820
Maybe they got swept in this program, whatever it is.

1075
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,380
Could you see their faces?

1076
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,100
I did.

1077
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,100
Yeah, three of the guys had facial hair, right?

1078
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,780
Kind of stubble, some of them kind of not really long beards,

1079
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,780
but like an operator look, you know what I mean?

1080
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,380
Rest of the guys didn't.

1081
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,700
Some of them had kind of blonde hair, at least you can see from right here.

1082
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,380
Some of them had like black hair and then just regular white complexion.

1083
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,460
Some of them have blue eyes, some of them have brown eyes.

1084
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:49,500
And I think one guy that I saw had, he was the one that was mainly focused in on us

1085
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,700
as we were getting searched.

1086
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,420
And you can see he had kind of like grayish blue eyes.

1087
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,540
So I don't, you know, I don't know what military force.

1088
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,220
I mean, obviously it's not conventional.

1089
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:00,540
Yeah.

1090
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,900
Because, you know, the question if they ever come out

1091
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,580
and they decide to, if they decide to ever do this

1092
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,660
and say, yeah, I was there with these guys, I would have a question.

1093
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,900
The question would be, why did you let us go?

1094
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,260
Or what were you guys thinking?

1095
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,900
Or why were you guys doing this for the matter?

1096
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,420
Because this isn't something that, you know, me consciously,

1097
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,620
there's a lot of things, especially finding out

1098
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,460
that this happens to do with human trafficking.

1099
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,820
Morally, I could never do that.

1100
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:30,700
Yeah.

1101
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,620
That's a touchy subject for me.

1102
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,660
They might not know.

1103
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,220
Yeah.

1104
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,340
And that's just it too.

1105
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,740
I mean, they could have, I mean, maybe the guys in the trucks

1106
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,940
were more of the darker side of things that were doing the hands-on

1107
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,980
and these guys were securities.

1108
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,260
I mean, there's so many theories with this.

1109
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,340
You know, I've seen some flack on Reddit about this.

1110
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,820
And you got all these armchair quarterbacks like,

1111
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,500
oh, I wouldn't have surrendered my weapon.

1112
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:51,980
Oh, yeah?

1113
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,460
So you get pulled over by a cop

1114
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,060
and he's got his gun drawn in because, you know,

1115
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,980
there's some people that that's their interaction with police

1116
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,820
because they're known to be violent people.

1117
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,340
The cop is not going to take any chances.

1118
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,460
They're going to pull out their sidearm

1119
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,300
and they're going to approach the vehicle like this,

1120
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,300
tell you to get the fuck out, right?

1121
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,300
Are you going to chance anything this guy is shooting you

1122
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,500
if he's holding you at gunpoint?

1123
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:14,940
No.

1124
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,740
No, you got kids.

1125
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,780
You got a wife.

1126
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,380
You know, you got a bunch of stuff to live for.

1127
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,060
I know these Marines had the same thing,

1128
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,980
but it's always these people who are going to talk this shit

1129
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:22,620
who are not there.

1130
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,140
Because I know for a fact that I'm here today

1131
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,260
talking to you about this.

1132
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,820
I was here, you know, talking to the Pentagon

1133
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,980
and talking to all these other people about this

1134
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,580
to testify to them and tell them what happened.

1135
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,620
And I'm glad that, you know, I'd rather get the flack

1136
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,060
than to have to sit there and actually,

1137
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,020
whatever story they would have spun up

1138
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,300
to say that, you know, maybe one Marine got PTSD or something,

1139
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,780
decided to kill his own squad and then kill himself.

1140
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,220
I mean, whatever they would have spun it to be.

1141
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,820
If these guys have this kind of technology

1142
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,580
and these resources, they can do anything.

1143
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,340
They're above the law, clearly.

1144
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:01,900
So as they gave us our stuff back

1145
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,980
and we're going up the slope, they're still talking shit.

1146
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,540
They're still saying, you know, we could kill you.

1147
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,220
Don't fucking look back and we're going to smoke you.

1148
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,060
So as soon as we went over the top

1149
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,980
and all of a sudden we didn't, you know, they weren't pursuing us

1150
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,660
and we fucking high tailed it.

1151
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:17,020
We ran down this fucking slope, trying not to trip over shit,

1152
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,820
go to the LZ and there were still helicopters flying.

1153
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,260
You know, they were flying relatively low

1154
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,940
with the shipments that they had that were attached

1155
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,100
and then they were landing, dropping the stuff off

1156
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,780
and then they were taken off, right?

1157
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,460
And they were just coming and going back and forth.

1158
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,900
There was a gunnery sergeant there that was not in my unit.

1159
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,300
I think he was attached to the ship.

1160
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,340
It might've been kind of like their logistical support unit

1161
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,780
or whatever it is for, because I know each ship

1162
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,500
has a logistical support for Marines, right?

1163
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,740
That are on the ship, either act of security, whatever it is.

1164
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,780
There was a gunnery sergeant there and he was like fucking pissed

1165
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,900
because we showed back up and we weren't supposed to.

1166
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,020
And then we had our weapons, you know, so why were we conditioned for?

1167
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,700
You know, and we try to play dumb.

1168
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,860
So obviously we kind of like set up a perimeter

1169
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,460
and then we adjusted ourselves.

1170
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,940
Some of my guys, you know, they'd help us get our stuff unslung

1171
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,940
and then we'd load it back up and, you know,

1172
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,220
act like everything was normal.

1173
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,940
But I can tell everybody's faces were like, what the fuck?

1174
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,980
Very, very concerning stuff.

1175
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,100
And here's the thing though.

1176
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,940
If stuff is still going on to this day, which I'm sure it is,

1177
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,100
because if they're, you know, come to find out,

1178
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,860
and I know you probably know this,

1179
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,260
human trafficking is the biggest revenue generator for these guys,

1180
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,700
for these organizations, second's drugs, third's weapons.

1181
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,580
So if they're hitting all three and obviously they're not going

1182
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,220
to want to give up their operations being known for that because it's illegal.

1183
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,980
It's not going to sit very well in the public eye.

1184
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,140
A lot of people have children.

1185
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,220
I don't have, I personally don't have kids,

1186
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,180
but I know you as a dad would not fucking stand for that kind of shit.

1187
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,540
Because then you have the thought in your head

1188
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,780
that it's going to be my kids are going to end up like this,

1189
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,460
that potentially could.

1190
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,020
It's not a very comfortable thing people realize.

1191
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,340
And having them known to see this happen, it sucks.

1192
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,220
And this is kind of more why I'm pressing towards

1193
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,460
to getting the resolution done with this,

1194
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,700
to make the government aware of it.

1195
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,140
Because if that's going on, it's got to be stopped.

1196
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,540
That's some evil, that's some evil nature right there.

1197
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,340
And I can't believe that there are actually people participating in this.

1198
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,660
And if they know about it, fucking shame on them.

1199
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:16,940
Yeah, you know, it's very interesting.

1200
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,180
There are two subjects that I really wanted to dive into this year

1201
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:27,100
is fascinated with the UFO, UAP genre.

1202
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:27,740
Right.

1203
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,020
And I want to expose as much as possible

1204
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:37,020
the stuff about human trafficking and everything that goes into it.

1205
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,060
We've already started that.

1206
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:44,140
And to see these two arenas start to intertwine is,

1207
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,820
I mean, it's very alarming.

1208
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,740
It tells you how much money is being spent.

1209
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,860
And it tells you that there's companies here

1210
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:55,420
that the government doesn't know about that are participating in this.

1211
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:55,900
Yeah.

1212
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,220
And it's not even something that happens in the United States.

1213
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,980
It may, it definitely does.

1214
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,060
But to see the operation, because think about it, it's a perfect cover.

1215
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,700
Because let's say if you're hiking somewhere out here

1216
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,380
and you see that unfold and you try to call the police

1217
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,940
and try to call federal, state, local agencies,

1218
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,740
or even the military for that matter, try to report this.

1219
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,180
Are they going to take you serious?

1220
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,420
No.

1221
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:18,940
They wouldn't.

1222
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:25,020
I mean, it's becoming more and more common as time goes on.

1223
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:30,860
But yeah, you know, what sucks about this is we're in this time period

1224
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:35,740
where everybody knows, I guess not everybody,

1225
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:41,420
but it seems everybody that I know knows that the media is false.

1226
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,460
It's fake.

1227
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,700
They don't report everything.

1228
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,580
They lie.

1229
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,140
No, they don't.

1230
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:56,780
But at the same time, a lot of people won't put any validation or trust

1231
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,580
in anything that hasn't been covered by the mainstream media.

1232
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:05,980
So we're in like this time period where there's a transition happening.

1233
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,460
There is.

1234
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,220
And it's thanks to people like you.

1235
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,620
And I'm glad that there's people with me doing this too,

1236
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:15,180
that it's easy for people to sit there and try to judge

1237
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,020
what they would have done in those situations.

1238
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:20,940
And the bottom line is we have gotten a point in our life,

1239
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,740
and I don't mean us specifically, but I mean the rest of the world,

1240
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,380
where they get so disturbed with things, but they don't do anything about it.

1241
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,500
They want other people to do it.

1242
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,300
Well, I'm unhappy with the situation.

1243
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,220
Well, fucking change it or help change it.

1244
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,580
That's what we're trying to do.

1245
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,780
We're trying to get the word out there.

1246
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,500
We're trying to get the government, at least the right parts of the government,

1247
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,620
to do something about this.

1248
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,740
And among other things that you see with corruption,

1249
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,380
for example, you can talk about the media.

1250
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:50,060
Like I was a security, at least for my private security firm,

1251
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,620
for the America's Frontline Doctors in Washington, DC.

1252
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:56,700
They came to talk to President Trump about COVID not being as serious

1253
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,020
as what the media is trying to say it is.

1254
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,700
They said that vaccinations are not something required to beat this.

1255
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,380
They were talking about natural immunity.

1256
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,300
They were talking about all the things that we already knew.

1257
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,860
Well, people are getting silenced for it.

1258
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,820
And I'm seeing these doctors, especially Dr. Simone Gold,

1259
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,860
so they try to wrap her up because she was part of the January 6 thing.

1260
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,300
But she's actually a really nice lady.

1261
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,020
But she's explaining to us how everything worked

1262
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,580
because they took us out to dinner to try to thank us.

1263
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,580
And it was very cool to network with these people.

1264
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,460
And then all of a sudden, you go after the event

1265
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,740
and you start seeing the news articles pop up about these people.

1266
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,700
And it's completely defamation.

1267
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,940
It's completely stuff that's not even related.

1268
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:40,140
It's one of those things that it sucks to see

1269
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,420
because their lives were ultimately ruined for speaking out about the truth.

1270
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,100
But here's the thing, there comes great risk to stuff.

1271
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,740
My life doesn't get lavish because of what I'm doing today

1272
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,020
and what I've been doing.

1273
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:53,820
It becomes hell.

1274
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:58,540
I've had numerous encounters with fucking helicopters

1275
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,580
hovering over my house.

1276
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,580
They were hovering over my dad's house.

1277
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,340
They get so low where they rattle the walls,

1278
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,660
scare the shit out of the animals that we've got.

1279
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,540
His dogs were going fucking crazy at that point.

1280
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,140
And he was concerned because he was home

1281
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,660
and he was like, I've never heard anything like that.

1282
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,380
I take him videos of this too, but seeing Blackhawks,

1283
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,460
seeing regular black helicopters that don't even have insignias on them, nothing.

1284
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,900
And they're just sitting there.

1285
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:26,860
But the thing about it that is at least noticeable about this,

1286
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,660
and there's a hysterical factor to this,

1287
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,660
how much money they're fucking spending on this to happen,

1288
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:37,020
to try to either intimidate me or anybody else for that matter.

1289
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,180
There's some elected officials and even some government officials.

1290
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,180
I know they're having the same thing happen to them

1291
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,940
because they've told me about it personally

1292
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,700
through our encrypted source of what we talk about.

1293
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,740
So they instructed me that anytime that something like this happens,

1294
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,500
that I could record it, take pictures,

1295
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,580
because they'll see the timestamps of everything taken.

1296
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,140
And let them know the time and they'll investigate it.

1297
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:56,140
Because they can have access to the FAA systems

1298
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,620
and among other systems that can actually relay

1299
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,660
where these people are going.

1300
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,100
They can listen into their comms

1301
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:04,700
because they have to guide through the FAA air traffic where they're going.

1302
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,220
I live by the airport in Denver.

1303
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,700
And the airspace there is restricted

1304
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,420
because they have airplanes that are flying every directions

1305
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,740
to try to passenger airliners or whatnot.

1306
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,740
So it's not a normal flight path for helicopters.

1307
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,700
That's what stuck out to me.

1308
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,460
They were doing it at my place of business where they'd fly over,

1309
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,940
they'd stop, and then they would bank off.

1310
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,740
My dad's house, they get low enough.

1311
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:31,900
It doesn't become glamorous by speaking about this.

1312
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,740
And you have people maybe that you've met through

1313
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,980
when you testified in front of the intelligence committee

1314
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,900
that are helping you, they're telling you,

1315
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,460
hey, record this shit, timestamp it,

1316
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:45,660
let us know any information you can possibly get reported.

1317
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,420
Because they said they'll look into it because they know,

1318
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:50,140
I mean, and several of them are having to deal with this personally.

1319
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:54,780
Is this happening to any of the other whistleblowers that you know?

1320
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,380
I know what happens to Dr. Greer all the time.

1321
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,820
Other whistleblowers, I'm not sure.

1322
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:03,660
It's not something that maybe they do notice

1323
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,420
because they're hypervigilant with what's going on.

1324
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,980
Because I mean, with what we're doing, it's putting us in the spotlight,

1325
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:11,100
but it's also putting the fucking crosshairs onto us.

1326
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,860
And the only thing I'm thankful is coming public with this information,

1327
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,060
at least if something does happen.

1328
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,060
And I'm not going to rule that out.

1329
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,220
But if anything does happen,

1330
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,700
and it kind of proves what we're talking about be true.

1331
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,180
And the reason being is because they would not be going

1332
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,980
through these measures to try to intimidate for no reason.

1333
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,740
We're keeping people up at night because of what we're talking about,

1334
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:34,700
and that needs to happen.

1335
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,900
And I've even told these government officials

1336
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,940
when I have my meetings, I'm like,

1337
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,780
first and foremost, you guys need to understand something.

1338
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:43,420
I am in the right state of mind to do this.

1339
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,700
I don't feel like harming myself.

1340
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,100
I don't feel like, because everybody makes the joke

1341
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,300
that Epstein didn't kill himself.

1342
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,980
No way and shape or form related to that, right?

1343
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,620
And so the same goes here.

1344
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:57,420
Like, I have no means to harm myself.

1345
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,140
So if anything happens, it's not from me.

1346
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,900
Well, thanks for saying that.

1347
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,500
Well, yeah, I mean, that needs to be on record,

1348
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,740
and people need to understand that because if something does,

1349
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:12,300
it's not because I turn a gun on myself or anything like this.

1350
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,740
Specifically, I'm going to talk about something.

1351
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,980
El Toro, Marine Corps Air Station El Toro.

1352
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,900
I'm sure you're familiar with what that was on California.

1353
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,500
There was a colonel there that was,

1354
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,460
they didn't even know that this was going on on his base.

1355
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,500
But they were flying flights in that had drugs on them.

1356
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,620
And they were unloading it on his base, and he found out about it.

1357
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:33,740
So he went to question them.

1358
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,620
Two days later, they find him dead.

1359
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,220
Really?

1360
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:38,720
Yep.

1361
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,540
Is this on record anywhere?

1362
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,020
Yes, it is.

1363
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,380
You can Google this information.

1364
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,820
Put Marine Corps Colonel Suicide El Toro.

1365
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:47,820
You can pull this out.

1366
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,260
Anybody of these viewers can do that too.

1367
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:54,780
The family thought it was very alarming because the circumstances.

1368
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,260
So they did a second opinion for an autopsy.

1369
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:02,220
And they said that there was extreme blunt force trauma to his head, which killed him.

1370
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,580
But then they had a gunshot wound.

1371
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:08,060
So there's a shotgun that was supposed to stage look like a suicide.

1372
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:12,220
And so I'm glad that the family actually got the second opinion to say, no,

1373
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,460
it was blunt force trauma to the back of the head is what killed him.

1374
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,980
And they tried to make it look like a suicide.

1375
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,020
And this is a colonel.

1376
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,700
And the thing that sucks about this is the Marine Corps itself actually tried to use

1377
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,980
this as a tool to say, you know what?

1378
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,780
Suicide awareness is such a big thing, and it happens with every rank.

1379
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,540
And they were using this guy for this purpose.

1380
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:29,820
But then all of a sudden, you start delving into this information and seeing that the

1381
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:34,460
reports that he was making about these illegal flights coming in, and they were unloading drugs.

1382
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,140
I mean, clearly, these guys, it doesn't matter what rank you are, it doesn't matter what

1383
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:41,340
position in government you have, it doesn't matter what you do for a living.

1384
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:46,700
If you're going against what they're exposing, what they're doing, they're going to get you.

1385
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:51,740
So if something does happen, I'm just putting it out there that it's not from my own doing.

1386
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:55,740
I don't fucking piss anybody, you know, maybe in the business world to a degree,

1387
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:58,620
but it's not enough for them to sit there and do something like that.

1388
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:02,620
And I'm glad that I have a private security firm where I've got some guides that I can

1389
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:06,940
look out for my best interests, and they know what I'm doing.

1390
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,860
So they've got my back, realistically speaking.

1391
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:13,820
And that's the thing, too, is any other whistleblowers, because I urge other people

1392
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:19,020
to come out. If they're needing protection out of the way, I'll help with that. I'll orchestrate.

1393
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,980
But the other thing is, too, coming out in the fashion that we did

1394
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,340
was the best because now the right people in the government know.

1395
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:29,660
So it's almost like having a pit bull that's one to rip you to fucking shreds,

1396
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:32,300
but you have this fence that's between you and this pit bull.

1397
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:36,060
I feel like the government's going to be that fence along with the

1398
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,540
spotlight that this put me in.

1399
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,900
Because it's unsettling to sit there and see these helicopters, man.

1400
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:46,460
It's hysterical if you sit there and wave them, but it's like, keep wasting your fucking money.

1401
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,780
Let's talk about the debrief that happened afterwards.

1402
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:49,180
Yes.

1403
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,940
What happened when you got back to your command?

1404
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:56,700
So when we got back onto the ship, we ended up returning our weapons to the armory,

1405
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,580
went to our berthing, put our gear away, went back to the flight deck.

1406
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:02,860
There was this admiral there. I've never seen him before. I don't know who he is,

1407
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:06,300
but it's just very out of place. You give a debrief saying, hey, this was good that you guys are doing

1408
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:10,940
for these people, which I agree with. But I have no idea who he was. But I've been on six ships,

1409
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:15,020
did several humanitarian operations, and not once have I ever seen an admiral on any of them.

1410
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:21,580
And this was minor compared to the one in 2011 we did with Fukushima and that natural disaster.

1411
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:30,140
Never seen an admiral with that. It's just very out of place. After we concluded this operation,

1412
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:33,980
we ended up docking in Subic Bay for some liberty. It was like four days.

1413
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:41,180
The people that we encountered during that event didn't even bother to take my camera or anything.

1414
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:44,220
It was in my dump pouch, but it was small enough. So I don't know why they wouldn't have searched

1415
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:49,500
it, but they missed it. So here I am the whole time thinking, like, fucking A, I've got something.

1416
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,260
I'm not fucking crazy, and neither of us are crazy. We've got something that actually backs

1417
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:57,580
up if we were to tell anybody about this, and we can show them pictures of it off of a camera

1418
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:02,780
and not something like a computer screen where they can doctor it. Well, I spoke too soon,

1419
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:07,900
because when we ended up going out that first day, we came back to report back to the ship,

1420
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:13,260
and I saw my camera on my rack. And the memory card was out of it, and it was a big memory card.

1421
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,940
And the battery was out of it. And I just see the camera sitting like, what the fuck?

1422
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:20,140
So I checked my locker. It was secure, because that's where I had it. And I had some stuff on

1423
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:23,500
top of the camera in there, you know, in my locker that were on top of the camera.

1424
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,780
And I had another battery in there. So I took that battery, and I put it in there,

1425
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:30,940
and it wouldn't even turn the fuck on. And I had some people reach out to me that said,

1426
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,860
you know, if you had that camera still to this day, that they could do some data retrieval and

1427
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:40,380
maybe be able to pick it up. I'm like, but I don't have that camera. You know, I tossed it because

1428
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:43,740
the fact that it wouldn't even turn on, it wouldn't do anything. I'm like, fuck, it's just a paperweight.

1429
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:49,660
And then, of course, 2009, you're not thinking of anything with forensics, you know, where they

1430
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:54,460
could do something. There was people actually willing to do that, which is great. So somewhere

1431
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:58,540
out there, somebody's got this footage. Somebody's got that tape, because that's the reason why they

1432
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:03,660
took it. And fun fact is that the other five Marines that were with me, they had their phones taken.

1433
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:08,140
Did you look at the pictures before? Did you have a chance?

1434
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,740
I know I took pictures and videos of it, because I saw the record thing, and I actually can snap

1435
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:16,780
the photos, and you can see like a blink. That's how we describe it. So I knew for a fact.

1436
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:19,740
But you didn't go back and review them? Okay.

1437
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,740
No. Why not?

1438
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,140
One, I didn't see it. One, anybody has seen.

1439
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:24,780
Okay.

1440
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:28,140
Just for that reason. You know, it was just something to keep, you know, if anybody doesn't

1441
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:32,460
know about it, then if I start telling people, then obviously there's things that may happen.

1442
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:37,740
And of course, it did happen regardless, because as soon as we're out in town, all these people,

1443
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:41,180
you know, I don't know who it was who did this, by the way, but they didn't even cut my lock. They

1444
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:47,420
popped it off somehow, because they read, you know, my lock was still intact. So these guys are

1445
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:51,420
obviously know how to do it. And I don't know who it was. But all of a sudden, the other Marines

1446
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:55,740
had their stuff taken too. And anybody in the platoon, they didn't have any other stuff touched.

1447
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,860
It was only us that were there.

1448
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,300
Did they take anything else?

1449
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:05,100
No. Nope. So after we get done with that, we end up going back to Okinawa, right?

1450
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,140
And I'm, you know, this was a regular normal day is probably fast forward a month after we

1451
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:16,300
end up getting back. All of a sudden, a duty Marine knocks on my door and says,

1452
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,140
do you need to report up to the CP? Like Roger that. So I get my cover run downstairs,

1453
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:24,700
run over and there's nobody there. I'm like, this is fucking weird.

1454
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:29,020
And all of a sudden, like I go inside and there's like this big open his office and then have like

1455
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:33,820
these little offices that have these doors he can walk into. So all of a sudden, I'm greeted by

1456
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:39,020
somebody in Air Force dress blues and he didn't have a cover on but he had salt and pepper hair,

1457
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:44,860
white complexion, older gentleman. He didn't have a name tag on his uniform, which come to find out

1458
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:48,620
Air Force regulation states that you have to have a name tag on your uniforms.

1459
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:52,460
You know, Marine Corps, we don't do that unless it's our camouflage or if you're a drill instructor

1460
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:55,580
or some kind of instructor or some sort of bill that requires you to do that.

1461
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,820
So he calls me over and I go over, give him the proper greeting of the day.

1462
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:03,900
And then he tells me, go ahead and sit down over here in this office. So I sit down

1463
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:07,260
and he's just, he doesn't even bother to sit down.

1464
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,340
Just you though, wasn't the other five Marines?

1465
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,900
No, they ended up having the same thing happen, but this guy did it separately.

1466
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:12,780
It's all individual?

1467
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:13,100
Yes.

1468
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:13,900
Okay.

1469
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:20,780
It wasn't all together. So he told us again, with what you guys saw, you were not allowed to report

1470
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:24,220
this, you're not allowed to talk about to your family, not to your chain of command. I don't

1471
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:29,260
care if a general even asks you, you can go to prison for this, you can be executed. And if you

1472
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:34,940
want a chance at that by all means, but you need to sign this. So I take the paper and I look at

1473
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:39,340
it and it's not a disclosure agreement. The only two things I can recall to this day is that it said

1474
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:46,220
TSSCI and it said Indonesia. There's only things I could recall, but I skim through and I fucking

1475
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:49,340
signed it because here I am thinking that, okay, we're just going to forget about this whole fucking

1476
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:54,380
ordeal. And yet this is getting thrown in our face and here's somebody threatening our fucking

1477
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:58,780
lives here with, you know, prison and death, things like that. If we're to talk about this.

1478
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,300
Did you ask him any questions?

1479
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:05,660
I tried to ask him who he was and he didn't say anything. There's some speculation going on about

1480
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:09,740
this because people who know about this, whether it's other whistleblowers and other people who

1481
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:17,580
have came forward previously have said that these guys have the ability to impersonate or even play

1482
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:22,700
off as their military officials or anybody for that matter in the government to try to extract

1483
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:27,500
information to see what you know. So I'm not, you know, because it's odd that he didn't have a name

1484
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,700
tag. He had the only thing I could tell is that he had a stack of ribbons. You know,

1485
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:35,820
Air Force gives ribbons amounts for just about anything, but he had silver jump wings is the

1486
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:40,300
only thing I can recall. So other people I've talked to in the military community are still active,

1487
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,420
just trying to get information. And now they know because I've came out,

1488
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:48,300
they were saying that it had that if it was an Air Force officer that has to do with some Air

1489
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,060
Force intelligence, because a lot of them had jump wings and that's kind of the thing that they like

1490
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:55,900
to do. He says it's because he didn't have any pilot wings or nothing that would signify he was

1491
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:00,460
a pilot. It was just those silver jump wings. Just with the parachute and had the reed that

1492
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,900
come up like this. That's the only thing. And obviously he had the silver oak leaves on his

1493
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:12,860
shoulders. So after dealing with that, it's like, okay, signed it. I'm like, great, you know,

1494
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:18,540
just fucking leave it behind. The rest of my career, don't tell anybody about it. You know,

1495
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:22,060
didn't tell my family. I told my dad before I ended up going and getting out of active doing

1496
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:28,220
the reserves. I said, you know, there's some something I got to tell you. And he even told

1497
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,340
me this, you know, when I started coming out publicly about it, and after I hadn't gotten

1498
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:36,140
through the right part of the government to go ahead and proceed with this. And now he understands

1499
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:39,580
what I was trying to tell him because I said, I just have to wait for the right time to do this

1500
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:45,900
because I don't know, I'm kind of freaked out, you know, something. And at that point, 2017,

1501
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:51,820
that's when I met Dr. Greer. And then fast forward to recently in April, making this happen with the

1502
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:57,660
government and telling them and testifying and briefing them what's going on, you know.

1503
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:01,420
So the flat that I'm seeing with this is, you know, there was a guy, apparently it was a marine

1504
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:05,500
that came out with Dr. Greer that was like more than 10 years ago. I think his name was Joshua

1505
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:10,620
or something like that. And he was a stinger operator. So he was like an anti-air gunner,

1506
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:15,740
if you want to call it that, I don't know, the MOS. But apparently, he was in South America and

1507
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:24,300
he witnessed a crash retrieval. And so he stated the same thing. This paramilitary organization

1508
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:30,300
kind of looked very similar. Obviously, this was in the 90s, so they didn't look that dissimilar

1509
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,660
to what I saw. But he talked to a paramilitary organization. He talked about the noise that this

1510
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:40,460
craft made that he saw that was shot down, had a hole in it. So it was a guitar amp because that's

1511
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:44,860
the only way to describe it. If it's reverse engineered, it's going to mimic the same kind

1512
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:50,620
of technology that these actual crafts have. This paramilitarization, well, yes, that's how

1513
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:54,220
they operate. They're not going to be identified in any kind of way. It's going to be a generic

1514
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:59,500
black uniforms and gear. So of course, and everybody's like, oh, at least they read it

1515
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:03,740
that I'm seeing. And they said, oh, the Air Force Lieutenant Colonel. That's another thing. And it

1516
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:09,100
probably wasn't the same guy, but the same method. There's only one word that comes to that. It's

1517
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:14,780
called corroboration. And it's not the first time that this guy's saying it. It's not the first time

1518
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,740
that other people have said this. But the thing is, people want to pay attention to them when

1519
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:21,420
stuff's thrown in their face, such as what I'm doing and what these other people are doing.

1520
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:25,900
There's going to be people who are going to come out after me who are going to talk about

1521
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:31,980
the same thing. I know I'm not the only one. And maybe I can get one of my Marines that were there

1522
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:37,740
to actually come forward. And maybe ideally it'd be all of them, but I know how this goes.

1523
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:42,300
And one guy responded when I had these government officials and Dr. Greer trying to bring one of

1524
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:47,500
them forward. And he said, absolutely not. He sent a text message saying, it's not worth the

1525
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,660
risk to my family, my life, my career, because he's still in the military. He's a commission officer

1526
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:58,300
now. And he was very repetitive about that. And he says, don't ever ask me to do this shit again.

1527
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:03,500
And you need to get the fuck out of whatever you're in. But it's the response. And when I asked him

1528
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:09,100
to do this, and that's what he responded to, what else could it be? So in a sense, that kind of

1529
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:13,260
corroborates it. But it corroborates the seriousness of how they're in fear of their

1530
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:17,900
life. The other guy, I didn't hear from anything. And even taking my social media down, because

1531
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:21,420
after I started coming forward, I just don't want people blowing up my fucking inboxes,

1532
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:25,580
trying to ask me details or questions or trying to get interviews. I'm not about that.

1533
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:30,860
The fact that our lives are kind of coming to hell to a degree because of being pursued with

1534
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:34,620
these helicopters and things like that, there's other ramifications that may happen that I'm

1535
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:38,140
not aware of. But you know what? There's a risk to things. And that's how this is going to happen.

1536
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:42,060
And if that's what's chosen, then I just got to figure out how to mitigate that as well.

1537
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:46,620
Well, let's talk about, we had spoken offline a little earlier about all the media that's

1538
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,020
reached out. I know you had an article in the Daily Mail.

1539
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:53,180
Daily Mail. And then obviously, the other facets of related Daily Mail publish this.

1540
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:56,940
Williams construed a lot of that. And then they ended up going in from David Grush to Bash and

1541
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:01,420
Dr. Greer about it. So it was something that they're trying to use to get people's attention. And

1542
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:07,500
they go into this fucking narrative. I've had News Nation. I've had CNN. I've had MSNBC that reached

1543
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:12,700
out through LinkedIn, through other emails because my email gets blasted all over the place

1544
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:17,740
these days. And I've got four emails. So I get the fucking shitty one I hand out to people

1545
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:20,540
because I don't want to get spammed through my business emails because that's money that's

1546
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:26,940
sitting on a table if need be. And I declined every single one of them because I know that

1547
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:30,540
they're going to push this false narrative. And false narratives that there are evil ETs.

1548
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:35,180
And this is what David Grush is pushing now, saying that they're malevolent and they seem

1549
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:39,900
ETs die or ETs kill people and things like that. Well, first and foremost,

1550
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:45,740
if there is a species of extraterrestrial that's out there and they happen to be fucking malevolent,

1551
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:49,740
it's not wise to shoot their shit down or kill any of them because guess what? They're highly

1552
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:53,260
advanced. If they can make this kind of stuff, imagine what they can do if they weaponize it.

1553
01:17:54,700 --> 01:18:00,060
So it's something that this needs to stop because all it's doing is it's just

1554
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:05,900
portraying fear out to people. They did this with COVID. You see the response of that.

1555
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,780
If people are still living like COVID exists to this day, which it probably does, but it's not

1556
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:16,060
nearly as damaging as what people are saying. It wasn't as bad as it was hyped up to be.

1557
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:20,060
No, it wasn't. And you still have people fucking afraid of their lives. And this is the thing that

1558
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:25,980
is sad to see that. So this whole, now that people are thinking about this going on, now that all of

1559
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:32,220
some worst case is going to happen. It's just this whole fear being portrayed in the media to

1560
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:35,820
try to scare the shit out of people, either get ratings or try to get people tuned in their

1561
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:40,700
networks, it's just ridiculous. It's more of a personal game for them because they get money

1562
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:46,780
off of views. Now that you've set the record straight, do you think you'll go on any of these

1563
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:52,060
media outlets? No. No? I'm not looking to get fucking famous from this, dude. I just want to

1564
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:57,660
get this information out. People try to approach me with book deals and shit like that. I'm like,

1565
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:02,300
get the fuck out of here. This has nothing to do with trying to get money. This is trying to make

1566
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:06,780
sure that... I'm not trying to convince the public here. And I'm getting that on record too. This

1567
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:10,620
isn't trying to convince the fucking public that this is real. I'm trying to convince the government

1568
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:14,700
and thankfully they are convinced enough to actually do something about it. That's my main

1569
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:19,020
objective with this. Because when they come out and they start talking about the bills that they're

1570
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:23,900
talking about, legislations, because people like me standing up, among other whistleblowers coming

1571
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:27,500
out and talking about the same kind of corroboration, that there's man-made stuff going on,

1572
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,860
that there's nefarious activities going on behind the scenes that nobody knows about,

1573
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:34,060
and they're making money illegally and they're murdering or killing people doing it.

1574
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:39,420
I'm glad you're doing it. I'm glad too, man. It takes a lot of courage. It scares the shit out of me.

1575
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:42,700
I wake up every day unsure like what the fuck's going to happen, but that's why you had to take

1576
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:47,420
it day by day. And at the end of the day, there's people looking out for me, which is great in the

1577
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:52,380
government and spiritually as well. And that's where I'm going to thrive with this, because guess

1578
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:56,540
what? If they can silence me, but they can't silence the fucking truth. And they've been trying to

1579
01:19:56,540 --> 01:20:02,300
silence the truth for far too long. And it needs to stop. And there's anybody, whistleblowers too,

1580
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:06,220
this is the thing I'm going to urge. Anybody who has any information with this, whether they

1581
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:11,100
witnessed similar things with this, whether, you're on the opposite spectrum. If you're anybody who's

1582
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,300
working in these programs, I know there's people who are listening to your show about this, by the

1583
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:20,700
way, who are probably on that side of the coin. Fucking man up and come the fuck out. You got to

1584
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:24,460
stop the bullshit. And anybody who knows about this, well, guess what? If you know the truth

1585
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:32,060
and you're not revealing it, then you're complicit to it too. So I'm urging, get ahold of me. I mean,

1586
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,980
I'll throw my email if you can put that link in and most of all, get ahold of Dr. Greer.

1587
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,020
I'll put that link in there.

1588
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:41,260
Okay. But yeah, Dr. Greer, I mean, he's been a good resource and people need to understand,

1589
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:45,500
just like you understand with this. He is basically a sounding board for all of us who

1590
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:49,500
have coming forward and all he's doing is relaying information that he knows from people.

1591
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:53,020
He's got a strict vetting process with this. I know people are going to attest to that as

1592
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:56,700
whistleblowers. The fact is he's not just going to take anybody's word because yeah,

1593
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,140
somebody said something, right?

1594
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:03,020
I talked to him. I just interviewed him, as you know, and I asked him, how did he decipher who

1595
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:09,420
the bullshitters are from the real ones? And we went into that because I think that's extremely

1596
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:09,900
important.

1597
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:16,460
Yes, it is. He's just not taking anybody's word for it. I mean, he asked me repeatedly,

1598
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:20,540
in law enforcement especially, the tactics they use is they ask the similar questions,

1599
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:23,980
and especially the meeting I had with the Pentagon and all these other agencies.

1600
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:29,260
It's like they ask the same thing because they do interrogations on a daily basis.

1601
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:34,780
But the fact is my story is not going to fucking change. The way that I'm doing details is not

1602
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:40,700
going to change. My simple task with this is just to tell people what happened. That's it.

1603
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:44,620
I'm not trying to gain profit. I don't want to be fucking famous. The only thing,

1604
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:47,900
if I'm going to be famous for this, the only thing I want to be famous for is,

1605
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:52,060
oh, that's a guy that fucking stood up and wasn't afraid to do it. And he got the truth out there.

1606
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:52,620
Good for you.

1607
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,780
If I can fucking live with that, perfect by all means.

1608
01:21:55,980 --> 01:22:00,860
Well, Michael, I know it takes a lot of courage to do what you're doing, man. And I just,

1609
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:04,220
I commend you for it. And it's an honor to have you in here.

1610
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:09,980
Sean, thank you, man. And what you're doing on your networks, your podcasts, your YouTube,

1611
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:15,580
I mean, you have a big, big audience. And I hope, you know, I got people trying to poke holes. Go

1612
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:18,940
for it. I don't give a fuck what they think. They weren't fucking there with me. They weren't there

1613
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:21,500
with my Marines. They want to talk shit. Go for it.

1614
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,700
I got one last question.

1615
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,200
Yeah.

1616
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:29,100
If you could say anything to the other five Marines that were on the ground with you that day,

1617
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,620
because they might be watching, what would you say to them?

1618
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:38,780
Don't fucking leave me hanging, guys. Don't leave me hanging. You know, we're family.

1619
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:44,140
We're fucking brothers. We went through this shit. You know, and I get that you got family.

1620
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:49,820
I get that you got kids. I got, you know, moving on. But fuck, man. I mean, you see what I'm trying

1621
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:54,220
to do with this. And I'm just trying to get the truth. You know, I hope that they do. And if I

1622
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:58,300
can't get them to come out and at least understand that, you know, yeah, there may be some aspects

1623
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:03,020
that are uncomfortable, you know, with what I'm having to deal with, but it's just the reality

1624
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,020
of things. It's not pretty. But if you got the fucking balls to do it, you know, I don't have

1625
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:11,740
kids, you know, me, I still got a lot to lose at the end of the day. And I know they do too.

1626
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:15,980
But the fact is, I'm just sick and tired of people bitching about things and not doing

1627
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:16,940
anything about it.

1628
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:17,740
Me too.

1629
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:21,020
And it's all a bunch of talk in this fucking world. It's all a bunch of talk.

1630
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:24,940
That's all I see on social media. That's why I'm glad I'm off of that. You know what I mean?

1631
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:29,260
That's why I'm glad I'm off. Because guess what? I don't get to see that anymore. I get to focus

1632
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:33,340
on what I'm trying to do. And for me, having people reach out to me that have open minds and

1633
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:36,460
are like, you know what, I actually heard about something like this happening in Vietnam,

1634
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:40,220
or they're like, I heard about this happening in 2004. And then there's people who are coming out

1635
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:44,300
that are participating on the operations unknowingly, because they think the

1636
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:49,020
constitutionality of it's legal. And it's not. And that's why this is happening. Because these

1637
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:52,620
people think that at the end of the day, they're doing something that's oversaw. And they don't

1638
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:57,660
know that degree. It's very compartmentalized, as you know, being a CIA. They only know what

1639
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:00,380
they're told. And they won't know what they're briefed on and what they're allowed to have

1640
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:04,060
access to. It depends on what they're doing. That's how they keep it secret.

1641
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:09,260
Yes, they do. And not everybody's going to know that. So I hope that anybody who's in those

1642
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:15,740
industries understands that if there's anything that seems off, don't approach it how the guy

1643
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:20,620
that was at the Pentagon that talked about US forces being involved in Ukraine. I'm sure you

1644
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:25,020
heard about that because you saw FBI HRT raid his house and took him into custody. And he's

1645
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:29,100
probably going to sit in prison for the rest of his life because of revealing classified information

1646
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:34,220
on these platforms. I'm not doing that. And these guys that are with me that are doing this, they're

1647
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:39,260
not doing it either. And the thing is, is because he did in that way means it's illegal because it's

1648
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:44,860
classified material to a degree. It may be illegal, but he screwed that up. Now, the way that we

1649
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:50,140
approached it was because we contacted the government and said, hey, this is what I know.

1650
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:54,540
This is what I was subject to. And they were, of course, because I approached in the right way,

1651
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:59,100
they're going to reward you with the protection, with the law that they passed to make sure that

1652
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:05,340
you are well protected, regardless of what happens in their legal fashion. So these other whistleblowers

1653
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:10,700
need to understand that. So they can come forward. They're going to have the same protections. That's

1654
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:14,380
why I can paint them a picture and tell them what to expect. I can point them in the direction of

1655
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:21,180
who they need to talk to. And just the humanity needs to understand that this false narrative

1656
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:25,180
that's going to be portrayed in the media, such as alien invasions and stuff like that, it's been

1657
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:30,700
planned since the 50s. There's documentations talking about this as far as SAIC or Science

1658
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:37,020
Applications International Corporation talks about the stagecraft. Honestly, if you're somebody who's

1659
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:43,580
such a high developed species or something like that, it's like walking by ants. Are you going to

1660
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:46,700
fuck with them? No, you're just like, there's fucking ants. They just walk by. I think like the

1661
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:51,180
same thing that they do with us. Why are they going to fucking try to fuck with us? But the same thing,

1662
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,780
we all of a sudden start shooting them down and then reverse engineering their stuff and then

1663
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:59,980
trying to weaponize it. And then we're using it against each other for nefarious activities,

1664
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:06,620
trying to use these advanced projects to do very illegal, very dangerous stuff. It blows my mind

1665
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:11,980
how much this goes down. My goal is just to hopefully get this fucking changed.

1666
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:16,380
Well, I hope it does. Me too, buddy. We'll be praying for it. Thank you. Cheers.

1667
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:49,580
All the previous SRS episodes. So they're easy to find. You can find that right here.
