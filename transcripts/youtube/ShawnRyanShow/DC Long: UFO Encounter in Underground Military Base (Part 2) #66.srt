UFO whistleblower series. This is part two. Today we have DC Long, an Army combat veteran

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:22,240
who witnessed a hovering monolithic structure in an underground facility on an Army base.

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:14,000
DC Long. Welcome to the show, brother. Pleasure to meet you. So we met also at Dr. Greer's

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,280
conference in DC with the whistleblower conference. And I just want to say it's an

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,640
honor to have you here. I know it takes a lot of courage to come out and talk about

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,600
what you're talking about after so long. And we're here to get your testimony of what you saw

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,400
out to the public. What are your goals? It's an honor to be here. First of all,

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,080
we spoke earlier downstairs. It can't be pushed further. I mean, you have to give yourself more

16
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,720
credit because I wouldn't be alive. I wouldn't be sitting in this chair if it wasn't for you.

17
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,360
If it wasn't for the people that you've had on before. When I had no strength left,

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,320
I just happened to come across it. And you're the reason I'm here just as much. So

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,000
my goals reflect your goals. I'm glad you are here. And I'm glad the show helped you. It's

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,480
helped a lot of people. And I said it before. I'll say it again. You know, one of the main

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,600
things we do here is we want to bring hope, especially to vets, overcoming all the trauma

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:31,440
that has gone on for the past 20 years. And it will come again and document history, tell truth,

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,960
expose corruption, and again, bring hope. And you're a perfect example of that hope. So thank

24
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,200
you for saying that. I appreciate it. But now, before we get too sentimental here, I want to

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,840
give you an introduction. So DC Long, you're in a New York, excuse me, DC Long, you're in the US

26
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:00,080
Army Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 1997 to 2013 was your service, medically retired from injuries

27
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,280
received from a combat jump. Your father was a government contractor also at Fort Bragg.

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:13,280
And you had a encounter with a what we call monolithic slab hovering

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,520
off the ground at Range 19 at a secret underground bunker. And so we're here to document that

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:32,800
testimony. Before we get started, everybody gets a gift, even you. And here you go.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,640
The only thing I brought you was me. That's all right. That's more than enough.

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,360
You're what it's all about. Thank you so much, man. That means a lot. You're welcome. You're

33
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,200
welcome. So those are Vigilance League gummy bears. Is it legal? They are legal in all 50 states.

34
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,320
We actually got an email once. And somebody sent me a somebody sent us an email. And they said,

35
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,600
man, I'm on my third bag and I still don't feel anything.

36
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,360
I was like, dude, you're not supposed to feel anything. They just taste good.

37
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,560
But that's awesome. Yeah. But so we're here to get your eyewitness account on what happened

38
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:25,440
on that day. When was that? When did this happen? That happened in 2011. At the end of 2010,

39
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,320
beginning of 2011 when I was still in Fort Benning, Georgia. Were you still active?

40
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,600
Yes, I was. And incidentally, it had nothing to do with my military career. Anything that I did

41
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,120
in service had absolutely nothing to do with it in the sense that, as you said, my father

42
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:54,400
was a government contractor. And on occasion, I had a 30% stake in the business. So he would ask

43
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,120
me to help him out whenever I could. So I took leave. I came back down to Carolina to help him

44
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:09,440
out. That day, the day in question, he was in the 18th Airborne Headquarters G5 war room.

45
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,720
What he was doing there, I didn't ask. He didn't tell me. But that's where I met him.

46
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,160
He told me that we were going to get an escort from JFK Warfare to take us over to a place called

47
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,520
Range 19. Is it Thundering Outside? It is.

48
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,400
Okay. I didn't know if you'd set me up. But where was I? I apologize.

49
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:43,360
You got selected to go to Range 19. Yes, sir. Yes. He called me up, said that we had an escort

50
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,760
coming from JFK Warfare to meet us and take us to a place called Range 19.

51
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,760
Just real quick, what was your dad's business as a contractor?

52
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,640
It was Turnkey. Originally, it started out doing residential and commercial construction

53
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,440
from the monolithic slab to Turnkey. Everything was subcontracted in-house.

54
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,680
So it's whatever you needed. As long as you had plans.

55
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,200
It was construction. Right. That was the main purview.

56
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,760
Why do you think you guys got selected to do this?

57
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,680
Well, as long as my dad was there, he's always had hunting land in North Carolina.

58
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,080
A lot of the guys from group that he met there would come down to his land, go hunting with him.

59
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,560
A couple of the Delta Cats that he knew take us on their planes would go down to Arkansas

60
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:45,920
and do some duck hunting. It's all over the U.S. Montana, Colorado, Mesa, elk hunts, bear hunts.

61
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,880
The guys who were into it, that's how they got tied in. He did submit everything that he did

62
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,800
through the Army Corps of Engineers. That's where he would submit all of his bid submittals

63
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,840
for the contracts, like the FORSCOM building that they built on Fort Bragg. He was responsible

64
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:17,120
for the top three levels of it. But as far as how he got tied in to do the work around the Keller's

65
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:27,440
Lodge during the SF Compounds, I have no idea. We didn't talk about that in that sense. I just

66
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,160
assumed it was the guys that he had met. They got the bids into where it needed to go.

67
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
They got the bids into where it needed to go?

68
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,680
Right. It's not like it was a public bid. Not everyone could. I imagine there were things

69
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,400
that they weren't supposed to see and we just weren't naturally curious people.

70
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:58,720
It's not like they had to worry about us saying anything. The day that I met him up there,

71
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,640
like I said, the escort comes to meet us. It's one of the guys that he knew that he had hunted with.

72
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:15,200
I didn't know about this gentleman, but they pick us up in a van. We get in the back of it.

73
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,040
They take us out about 15 minutes. I could tell it was going towards the direction.

74
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,200
I don't know if you're familiar with Fort Bragg.

75
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,560
I'm not.

76
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,920
Okay. There's only one direction you can go to get to the live fire ranges to get to the drop

77
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,360
zones and things like that. I assume we were headed towards Sicily or Normandy drop zone

78
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,720
because that was the direction we were going. The van that they had us in, it didn't have

79
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,360
any windows. You couldn't see to the front. It was just a cattle car.

80
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,560
We were joking they were going to take us away, ask him what he did. We're going to

81
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,600
head to Livingworth for a little while, but we get there. As soon as the door opened,

82
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,600
it looked like a literal dump. There was just trash everywhere, not like people just leaving

83
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,400
stuff out. It was an actual dump. There was a 45-degree concrete door setting out of one of

84
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,800
these hills that was directly in front of us, no further than you and I are to each other now.

85
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:26,000
We go inside, meet another escort in there, take us to this freight elevator. We get in there.

86
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,120
There's two series of buttons. Didn't have any writing on it.

87
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,720
One of the guys looks at my dad and is saying to both of us, keep your head down,

88
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,720
your eyes on the heels of the man in front of you or you'll be shot. We started giggling

89
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,480
because at least I knew one of the guys was one of his buddies, people that he used to hang out

90
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,600
with. The other guy, I recognized him as the guy who we went hunting with before.

91
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,480
I knew later on that they were both Delta operators. If they were still active,

92
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,200
I have no clue. Do you know their names?

93
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,000
I do. Do you want to say their names?

94
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,880
Absolutely not. I'll tell you later why, but hell no.

95
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,200
You're seeing familiar faces, which makes you comfortable, and you don't realize how...

96
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,800
The shit storm I just stepped into? Absolutely not.

97
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,480
What exactly were you guys there to do? What he told me was that we were going down below

98
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,560
ground to set up a shoot house, an indoor live fire range that was going to be underground.

99
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,880
Nothing new. Again, I didn't think anything of it. We had done other shoot houses before with the

100
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,520
open tops that can be viewed from above. With a catwalk?

101
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:00,320
Yeah. It didn't even faze you? It was just another day at work. I was

102
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,200
just there to help him out. We get down, the doors open, and the first thing I see are these

103
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,800
personnel connexes off to my right, the smaller ones, not the large ones that you see scattered

104
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,040
around, or the ones you'd see on a big rig carrying around. These were the small ones.

105
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,760
You would throw your personal gear in to go before you get shipped overseas.

106
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:34,960
As soon as I looked past them, I could see this giant monolithic slab just setting there.

107
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,320
At first, once again, it didn't set off any alarms. I didn't think much of it,

108
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,600
but the closer we got to it, I could feel this intense vibration. You couldn't hear anything.

109
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,760
It was dead silent in there. The loudest thing was the footsteps that I could hear.

110
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,760
What did the vibration feel like? It felt like being at a concert,

111
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,120
standing next to one of the speakers, and the bass permeating through your body without the noise.

112
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,920
There was zero noise. Zero, absolute zero. I could still hear myself breathing over this,

113
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,120
but inside, it was such a strange feeling to have. The closer I got, I was like,

114
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,560
I've got to check this out. I go down to one knee. I've got to tie my boots,

115
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,640
and then I glance up underneath it, and there's absolutely nothing underneath this damn thing,

116
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,640
nothing holding it up whatsoever. What did the slab look like?

117
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,520
It just looked like a granite slab, but the sheen on it is what caught my attention the most.

118
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:52,080
It was kind of in between being polished or just completely translucent. There was something behind

119
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,760
it, but you could tell it had a smooth surface to it. The only lights that were on in that

120
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,040
hangar that we were in were directly over our head, where we were walking through that walkway.

121
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,400
How big was the slab? Oh, God. It was about 20 foot long,

122
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,080
about seven foot tall, and I couldn't tell how wide it was. By that point, I was already

123
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,680
directly in front of it. It would be impossible for a human to even

124
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,640
think about picking something like this up. Oh, there's no way. Even with the construction

125
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,600
that we've done, if you had to pick up something like that to move it anywhere,

126
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,280
you would need at least three, four cranes. Herrera could tell you better.

127
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,240
Okay. The scope of equipment that it would take just to get it off the ground,

128
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:51,600
not even to transport it to another location. At this point, I'm still down on my knee,

129
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,400
and I'm looking, and behind it, I can see two people standing. The only thing I can see is

130
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,640
their feet because there's this boulder directly behind it, and it's on the ground. I glance over

131
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,360
my shoulder, and there's a guy with his back turned to me standing in front of another boulder

132
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,160
identical to the other one that I could see up underneath the monolithic slab. He's just

133
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,320
pushing it with one hand, and then I assume he's pushing it in the other direction because it's

134
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,280
just freely spinning, no wobble. It's like it was attached to the top and the bottom,

135
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,760
and it was papier-mache. That's how easily this guy was just spinning it around.

136
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,400
At this point, the escort behind me kicks me in the back and says, let's go. We get up,

137
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,160
keep going, go down a flight of stairs. That's when we get to what we call the shoot house.

138
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,800
You could see old lanes where they had actually used it before as a live fire range underground.

139
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We'd probably only been down there 15 minutes, 15, 20 minutes, maybe. Father was taking notes

140
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,480
on the dimensions, what we needed. I guess he understood what they wanted. I know that we had

141
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,560
to replace the walls. It's inconsequential to the story, but we had to replace the rubber on the

142
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:14,160
walls for the shoot house. In that amount of time, we go back upstairs, exact same route that we

143
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,240
took on the way down, and everything's empty when we get to the hangar again. Everything,

144
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,160
the two boulders in the back, the monolithic slab, all of it is absolutely gone.

145
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,720
And it was, we weren't, you know, hundreds yards below these guys. We were just one flight below

146
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:40,560
them. So whatever it was they were taking out, we would have heard it. Even the people making

147
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,320
noise around it, you would have still been able to hear, but it was dead silent. Like I said before,

148
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,520
there was nothing in there, just our feet. But coming back through, it was absolutely gone.

149
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,920
Everything in there just vacated.

150
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,320
And at that point, it's- How much time had passed?

151
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,320
Less than 30 minutes. Less than 30 minutes. Because it didn't take us long

152
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
to do what we had to do downstairs.

153
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,840
And this was just an assessment. You guys weren't actually, you weren't doing any construction or

154
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,080
repairing the walls. None whatsoever. It was just, hey, this is what we need to do. So there was no

155
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,680
equipment that you were operating that would have muffled any sound that was going on above the-

156
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,720
Right. Take measurements, layouts. The loudest thing was the tape measure we were using.

157
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,280
That, a roll tape, and a notebook. That was it. That was the only thing that,

158
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
that was the only thing we had down there.

159
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:50,480
I don't know if I've ever been this excited to represent a brand. I'm talking about FirstForm.

160
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,440
I just align so well with what they've got. FirstForm is a supplement company. They have

161
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,960
just about every supplement you can possibly imagine. All grade A stuff. Let's go through

162
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,880
some of the stuff that, some of my favorites. All right, here we go. One, Enduro Performance.

163
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:20,000
This is a non-stimulant pre-workout mix. Guess what? Made in the USA. Protein sticks and

164
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,880
the protein bar. Look, I'm an entrepreneur. I'm super busy. I don't have time to go to lunch.

165
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,520
In fact, I don't even know what a lunch break is. This is my lunch for the most part. Then we got

166
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,960
Opta Reds 50. Guess what? Also made in the USA. So is the protein bar and the beef sticks actually,

167
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,080
but Opta Reds 50. Guess what, guys? Beets. Super healthy for you. Guess what? They taste like shit.

168
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,720
This doesn't. Two scoops, throw it in there. You get all the benefits of having Beets

169
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,360
with Opta Reds 50. Then we've got protein. Everybody needs protein. If you're not taking

170
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,520
protein, you should be, especially if you work out my favorite, chocolate banana.

171
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:13,120
Guys, let me tell you something else about First Form. The owner, CEO, Andy Frazella,

172
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,360
guy has made a phenomenal company. True American Dream story started from absolutely nothing,

173
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:28,720
sleeping on a mattress in the back room of a very small shop. Now he's built an empire.

174
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,440
Check it out. Go to firstform.com slash SRS. He's also put a culture into his company that this entire

175
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,840
country could use right now. Gave me a ton of inspiration. I used to listen to his podcast,

176
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,680
Real as Fuck, when I was building my first studio in the attic of my house three and a half years

177
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,160
ago, right when the show started. Can you believe that? Now I'm repping the brand. And if you haven't

178
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,120
checked out their podcast, you might want to, like I said, Real as Fuck, check it out. I'm

179
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,240
actually on there. I do a pretty decent job, but let me know what you think. Anyways, once again,

180
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,520
go to firstform.com slash SRS. And when you get there, if you order $75 or more worth of product,

181
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,320
guess what? You're getting free shipping, but you're only getting that if you go to firstform.com

182
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:33,200
slash SRS. That's one S-T-P-H-O-R-M slash SRS. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a real American

183
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,040
company that aligns with all the values that America stands for. Check them out.

184
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,040
Why are people investing in emergency food supply kits all over the country right now?

185
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:55,120
The answer is because as tensions continue to escalate in our country, our very fragile

186
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,680
food supply chain is going to wind up failing again. That means you really need a proper supply

187
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:07,680
of emergency food on hand before the disaster strikes. You'll breathe easier knowing you can

188
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:14,640
feed your family in a crisis. Go to preparewithshawn.com for your one week emergency food supply.

193
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:53,360
preparewithshawn.com. How far away from the slab did you feel the vibration?

194
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,560
Did you feel it before you saw it? No, no. Whenever the doors of the freight elevator open

195
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,520
and I looked in, I could see it. I mean, it was no farther than from here to that camera pod.

196
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,360
Six, seven feet away from me whenever we were walking in, but what made me stop.

197
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,320
It was that close.

198
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Right. What made me stop was as close as we got. I noticed it in front of me with my dad and the

199
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,480
other escort in front of him. It was almost like hopping a tripwire. When you're on the trail,

200
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,600
you just get it and go. That was the first thing I noticed. Then the closer I got to it,

201
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,640
that intense vibration. I was just too curious. I couldn't stand it. I had to figure out what it was

202
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,480
and I really shouldn't have.

203
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,320
When did the vibration stop?

204
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,560
It didn't stop until I walked away. In the center, looking at the top of it,

205
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,160
you could see this black box. I've tried to describe it before and it was extremely

206
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:05,520
difficult. It just looked like a small black GMTK toolbox that a military mechanic would

207
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,320
have carrying around. It wasn't very big and it just had two leads that came off of it.

208
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,680
It looked like it was wrapped in a casing that you could almost see something inside of it,

209
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,480
but it wasn't mechanical. It wasn't moving. It didn't have lights. It was just

210
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,040
opaque. It didn't really seem to serve any purpose, but the other boulder had the same

211
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,920
thing on top of it.

212
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,160
Hold on. I'm sorry. Are you saying you saw two boulders and a slab?

213
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,360
Yeah.

214
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,680
And they were all three of them at the same time?

215
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,600
The slab itself, the monolithic slab, it was about 12 to 15 inches off the ground.

216
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,960
And whenever I knelt down to tie my shoes, I could look through it and I saw the first boulder that

217
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,800
I noticed and it was just sitting on the ground. And then I'll glance back and that's when I saw

218
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,360
the other boulder that had the same black box on top that was being moved around.

219
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,480
And that was levitating?

220
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,980
Yes.

221
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,000
One slab levitating, one boulder on the ground.

222
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,640
Correct.

223
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,480
Okay. Did the slab have a black box anywhere near it?

224
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,160
The monolithic slab?

225
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,560
Yeah.

226
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,360
It did.

227
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,520
It did? Where was that located?

228
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,280
It was on the top near the center where I was feeling most of the vibration.

229
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,640
It was like the closer I got to it, that's where it was the most intense at the center of the slab,

230
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,160
where that box was on top of it.

231
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,460
Okay.

232
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,680
Keep going.

233
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,000
And after that, we go back upstairs the way we came, like I said.

234
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,840
We get out of the door to leave. Fans still in the same place. We hop back in.

235
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,040
We take that same 15 minute drive back to 18th Airborne Headquarters.

236
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:10,560
They gave us our phone back. I got my ID and then my dad said something to one of the other guys

237
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,080
that I had recognized that he knew that I didn't know his name.

238
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,600
That guy took everything that my dad had, minus his phones.

239
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,040
He took the notes. He took the tapes, everything from him there.

240
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,520
I didn't think much of it at that point. I didn't know if that was

241
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,720
something he was going to submit to the Army Corp of Engineer rep that he had,

242
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,080
whoever was going to coordinate or give him the go ahead to submit a bid to do this project.

243
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,280
To me, again, that didn't set off any bells.

244
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,720
We're getting ready to leave, as I said. Let me back that up.

245
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,120
Before we go and get our phones and our identifications,

246
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,360
the second guy that I recognized, the one that I do know, he was upstairs.

247
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:17,440
In the G5 war room in the 18th HHC. It's just him sitting at the desk as soon as you go into

248
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:25,120
the vault. He's got two pieces of paper. He's like, I need you to sign this. It was an NDA.

249
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,080
I was like, fuck that. I'm not going to sign that. Come on, man. Really?

250
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,480
You know me. I don't give a shit. My dad just played it off to the same thing. He's like,

251
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,160
I'm not signing that shit. That's whenever we leave. At that point, I'm getting ready to go back

252
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:50,400
to Georgia. This is roughly 24 hours later. I get a phone call. It was one of my dad's employees.

253
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,560
He's like, hey, man, what's going on? Not much. Just headed back to work.

254
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,800
He said, well, we can't get to work. What do you mean? He's like, well,

255
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,520
everything. They called it the barn where we had all of our equipment station,

256
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,720
where they would meet before they would go to Fort Bragg. He said, the barn's locked up and

257
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,480
everything's gone. This is the same day? No, this is 24 hours later. Whenever I'm getting ready to

258
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:22,080
go back home. I said, well, what do you mean? He's like, everything's gone. I tried to call my dad.

259
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,200
I can't get up with him. I was like, just stand fast. I'm coming down there. I get down there.

260
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,680
Like you said, barn's locked up, everything down there that I could see. I mean, you can still go

261
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,080
there to this day. You could see our staging area and how big it was and all the equipment that we

262
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,040
had there. It's absolutely barren. There's nothing there. It's all gone. My dad at the time lived

263
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,920
just around the corner from there. I go up there to his house and the doors kicked in.

264
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:58,320
And like the video I showed you earlier downstairs, I did that to illustrate how close

265
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,240
me and my father were because just telling the story from this point on, it sounds

266
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,240
inconsequential. We'll be like, oh, well, sons and fathers have problems all the time. It's no big

267
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,280
deal for bad blood to take over and just people can be too much like each other, bullheaded and not

268
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:22,880
be able to communicate. That's why I showed you that so you could see what kind of, I mean,

269
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:30,880
I've called the damn guy my hero because he was, but I get in there and my dad's sitting at his

270
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,040
couch and his office is just to the left of his living room and everything is torn out. Everything

271
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:44,720
is gone. And I was like, what's going on, man? He's like, it's all gone. I was like, do you think

272
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:52,640
this has something to do with Range 19? And he stood up, that man you saw, and he said, don't

273
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:01,760
you ever fucking mention that name to me again. And that was the last time that I got to spend any time

274
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,240
face to face with my daddy.

275
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:29,680
I'm sorry. It's a life, a business, everything that we built together and I got no answers.

276
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:38,080
I had no excuses, no reasons, no answers whatsoever. Just unreturned phone calls.

277
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:46,240
The few times I ever did get a chance to speak to him, it was only my voice being heard. He'd just

278
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,840
hang up on me. He'd hang up on you. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't, my God, it wasn't until

279
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:04,960
2021 that I got to see him again. I didn't get to-

280
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,880
He would just refuse to see you?

281
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,480
Yeah, absolutely. And it made me wonder,

282
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,520
what could somebody threaten you with to make you turn your back on your own child?

283
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,720
I don't know how many children you have, but I killed for my country. What in the hell do

284
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:38,240
you think I would do for my babies? And I'm his only son. I'm his legacy. Every loan from the

285
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,000
beginning of time to me is, if it stops with me, then that's where it stops, but I'm his only son.

286
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,280
If it stops with me, then that's where it stops, but he gave me that. To us, that was important.

287
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:05,200
I cut my ties. I let it go where it's so hard to talk about, man.

288
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:15,840
Yeah. But let's get back to my part of the, that affects my career and why I was retired.

289
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:19,840
It was-

290
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,480
Is your dad still alive?

291
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,360
No. He's not.

292
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,360
When did he pass?

293
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,280
November 10th, 2021.

294
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,440
How?

295
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:48,160
Well, they said that he had aggressive cancer that they found late, that he was just ravaged.

296
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:59,120
It was all over. I know shit happens. I'm no stranger to that.

297
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,200
With our careers and all the guys in this room, none of us were strangers to things happening.

298
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,400
We have a better way of accepting it than most people do, I think. Not him, not like that.

299
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,520
I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I don't get into that part of life. Even some of it, to me,

300
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,480
that I'm aware of, irrefutably makes me feel like it's just absolutely insane.

301
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,600
But I will never believe that my father died of cancer or natural causes. A man is as big

302
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,840
and as powerful as him, not because he couldn't have been taken. We're all measured. It was just,

303
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:48,240
he was healthy. And then in two months, he went from being 240 pounds to 105.

304
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,840
Wow.

305
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,280
Just, I mean, when they called me and told me that he was in the hospital,

306
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:05,760
and I went to go see him, I walked by his room twice. Honestly, the first thought that crossed

307
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,960
my mind is, man, I feel bad for that guy. That sucks. And then when they told me that's who it

308
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:23,520
was, I went in and he still couldn't even look at me. And I don't know why. And I just,

309
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:33,120
now I took his hand, I said, look, man, I don't even know if you can talk. He had the chemo scores

310
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,400
or something, looked like, I assume, were chemo burns on his mouth. It was just these gnarly burns

311
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:47,920
on his face. And his eyes were just cracked with jaundice. And I was like, man, we're square. I

312
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,840
don't care what happened. I love you. And a tear went down his cheek and I was asked to leave.

313
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,960
He started to code. And that was the last time I saw him.

314
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Now, it's

315
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:15,440
shortly after the incident. It was in late 2011, early 2012.

316
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:23,920
I've already been JMPI, kitted out for a combat jump. Got the full pack,

317
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,320
the 1950s weapons case dangling. And I was the first man in the stick.

318
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,520
They gave us, you know, told us the 30 second sign. We're all hooked up and ready to go.

319
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,040
The jump master's got his arm up, getting ready to hit me in the back. And then we see shuffling.

320
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:53,680
And I'm only one of 12 guys that I jump with every time. It never deviated, no change. That

321
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,400
was my team. It didn't matter if it was Conus, O'Conus, those were my guys, only 12. And a guy

322
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:06,080
from the back shuffles his way to the front and it's one of the escorts. He is unmistakable.

323
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,520
You can't. Really? You know. Yeah.

324
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:22,240
Good evening. This is Frank Knight. May I introduce our co-editors for this edition of

325
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,400
the Longines Chronoscope. Larry Lassere, CBS News Correspondent and Kenneth Crawford,

326
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,080
National Affairs Editor of Newsweek Magazine. Our very distinguished guest for this evening

327
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,760
is Admiral Richard E. Byrne.

328
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,320
Antarctica Treaty of 1959, an agreement signed by 12 nations in which the

329
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,240
Antarctic continent was made demilitarized to be preserved for scientific research.

330
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,320
What do you think about that? I must say that Admiral Byrne, our guest tonight,

331
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,120
is not only our greatest living explorer, but he's been an inspiration to countless Americans.

332
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,240
Admiral Byrne, you've been to both the North Pole and the South Pole.

333
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,960
Is there any unexplored land left on this earth that might appeal to adventurous young Americans?

334
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,560
Yes, there is.

335
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,040
He was also previously contracted by Raytheon Polar Services as a cook to work on a cat train

336
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,160
that went across the ice and he said the express purpose for him, I should say, for that team

337
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,560
working for Raytheon was they were searching for missile site locations.

338
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,680
They find out it's really usable not only to live in, but militarily.

339
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:53,200
And at first, it didn't, it just didn't connect with me. It just,

340
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,280
you know, I just gave him a, hey, how you doing? And he just winked at me.

341
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,160
As soon as that junkyard master's arm came up and the green lights getting ready to go off,

342
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,120
no sooner than it hit and I felt his arm coming down, I feel something slap me on the side of the

343
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,720
face and it was a static line and that man took off out of the aircraft and when he did,

344
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,440
it snapped my neck and it pulled me out upside down, deployed my combat gear, long story short,

345
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,520
at a complete oscillation and I just smacked the ground and I woke up a month later, career's over.

346
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,120
And I'll tell you something else.

347
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,320
Do you mean you burned in?

348
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:31,940
Yeah.

349
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,360
Your chute didn't?

350
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,640
Oh, my chute.

351
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,280
What happened?

352
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,960
My chute deployed, but whenever I fell out of the aircraft and I think maybe we were

353
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,400
jumping from 800 feet, if I had to guess, that's what it looked like from the horizon,

354
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,160
but whenever he hit me going out of the aircraft and the static line went taut and it snapped my

355
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,200
neck and I fell out of the craft. I'm not even sure how I fell out, but it deployed my lowering

356
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,520
line on the way out. So whenever my canopy did open, it just started a complete oscillation.

357
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:10,080
I remember looking down and seeing daylight and just smack and it was over.

358
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,520
You think that was an assassination attempt?

359
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,520
I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was. And the only reason I tell you that is because

360
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:30,400
when my father died, not even a week after I buried that man, I met at my new house at the beach.

361
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,560
Nobody knew I'd been there. I hadn't even changed my driver's license over.

362
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,880
I hadn't even told the VA that's where I'm living. Not even a week after that man was buried,

363
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,800
I get a knock at the door. It's that same guy who cut me out of the door, hands me a note.

364
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,160
It said, thinking of you, he's like, hey, sorry about your loss, buddy.

365
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,440
What would you do?

366
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Dude. And Dr. Greer asked me, he said, well, did you feel like they were trying to intimidate

367
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,880
you or they're trying to hurt you? Absolutely not. If that was the case, I would have never

368
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,680
seen it coming. To me, it just felt like somebody looking you dead in the eye and said, I can touch

369
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:17,680
you anytime I want. And then everything started flooding back and that's what led us to here.

370
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,160
I wrote out that entire story to Dr. Greer.

371
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:30,000
You fell out and it was a week after you buried your old man, you said? Or the day after? I'm sorry.

372
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,040
Whenever he showed up?

373
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,520
Yes.

374
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,240
That was a week after I buried my father. Rudy Merritt's cemetery in Dublin, North Carolina.

375
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,120
Nobody knew I was there. Nobody.

376
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,400
So this is 2021.

377
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:46,720
Yes.

378
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,760
Just a couple of years ago.

379
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,120
Yes.

380
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,320
And you still, and this happened, when was the accident?

381
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,120
When was, well, when was the assassination attempt?

382
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,880
2011, 2012.

383
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,160
Did you recognize him immediately?

384
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,280
I've got it written down everywhere. It's so hard to remember. That's when I got this.

385
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,480
And ever since then, it's just been fuzzy.

386
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:18,240
And that's what led us to this. That scared me so damn bad that I had decided I wasn't suicidal.

387
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,120
Please don't get me wrong. I was not depressed. I wasn't.

388
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,760
I just felt like at that point that it's not about me. I've got my children.

389
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,680
If something happens to them, it's my fault. So I figured if I quietly were accusing myself,

390
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,720
who's going to know better? What's it going to matter? My story's over.

391
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,040
I get to see my dad again and hopefully save my kids from this bullshit

392
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,240
because everything changes. It's one thing when you lose your brothers.

393
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,400
It's one thing when you lose your family. But if you're

394
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,720
worried about losing your children, that's taking it to a whole other level.

395
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,280
Just because we choose to be peaceful at this point in our lives does not mean that we forgot

396
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,440
how to be violent. I'll take the whole damn world down to protect those kids.

397
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:25,840
And I know you would do the same for yours. But what stopped me was you.

398
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,920
Are you in contact with your mom? Is she alive?

399
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,560
She's alive.

400
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,840
Was she still married to your dad when he passed?

401
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,560
No.

402
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:48,480
Was she still married to your dad in 2011 when you witnessed the monolithic slab?

403
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:48,720
No.

404
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,120
No? No contact?

405
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:57,120
No. And unfortunately, I remind her a lot of my father. And it's nothing against her.

406
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,840
We still have a great rapport. I mean, I'm 43 years old with everything I've been through.

407
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,200
I still blow my mom a kiss whenever I leave her. It's not like we did the same thing my dad did.

408
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:14,720
It's just I know how painful it was for her to lose him and hearing me speak.

409
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,920
We have the same eyes.

410
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,360
Do you guys ever talk about this?

411
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,880
No. No.

412
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,960
Was there any communication from your dad to your mother that you're aware of?

413
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,400
The only way she's going to know about any of this is by watching the podcast.

414
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,320
Okay. All right.

415
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:48,400
I'm ashamed, absolutely ashamed from being too afraid to keep going.

416
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,880
I didn't even bring up the homeless bit because I did it to myself.

417
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,600
It wasn't some crazy circumstance that I could blame on anybody else.

418
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,360
It was my fault because I was afraid.

419
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,480
So this destroyed your life?

420
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,160
You're damn right it did. I'm still trying to rebuild,

421
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:17,200
but I don't ask anybody for anything. It's not about that to me.

422
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,640
I lost all familial contact whenever I lost him in that sense.

423
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:32,240
I mean, the war is bad enough watching your brothers go through what you feel like you

424
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,880
should have went through. I can't speak for everybody, but survivor's guilt tears me up

425
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:44,400
every day. If there's one thing I hate myself for isn't not trying, it's just not giving enough.

426
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,520
The names I say at night when I go to sleep, the men that I think about,

427
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,240
I miss them so damn bad because those guys, I knew that they would die for me. Some of them did.

428
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,080
And the one safety net that I had here was him.

429
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,760
When you went to, it was just you and your old man that went to Range 19 that day,

430
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,800
or were there any other, did you guys have any workers with you?

431
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,520
No.

432
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,400
Just you and your dad?

433
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,120
Just he and I.

434
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,480
What do you, why are you coming forward?

435
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,720
Why are you coming forward to educate the public about what you saw that day?

436
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,160
Same thing I said at the press conference. I'm damn tired of doing nothing.

437
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:45,840
I couldn't take losing my career. I'm fine with that. I didn't think I was going to do it forever.

438
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:52,640
I'm fine with losing material possessions, but one thing I will not stand for to watch people in

439
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,440
this country just hand their freedoms over and think that the government's doing them a favor.

440
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,920
Watching my brothers who would rather be homeless than have to deal with the bullshit that got us

441
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,520
there in the first place. And it's not because we're afraid. It's because we don't feel like

442
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,200
we did enough. We feel like we're just putting our burden on other people. And that's something that

443
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,200
they don't deserve. You're willing to die for people who don't even damn like you. To me,

444
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,040
that's absolutely fucking insane. But that's just the kind of people that we are. And it wasn't

445
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:37,920
until I heard something that Herrera said, our oath didn't expire. Good damn luck taking this

446
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,240
shit off my neck. Right now somewhere there's a little kid sitting somewhere across this world

447
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,480
and he's got his grandpa's combat boots and one day he's going to be old enough to fit in them.

448
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:57,200
And if we sit back and do nothing, if we do not lead by example, they're going to think that

449
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,440
it's okay just to be quiet. I think for two damn long good Americans, it doesn't matter if you're

450
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,160
a combat vet to me. It doesn't matter if you didn't shed the same blood that I did.

451
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:16,000
And what matters the most to me is good people who believe in the flag. That one sitting over

452
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,400
there that so many people died for, the one that was flying over ground zero, the sacrifice,

453
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,160
whether it was a false flag or not, that flag is important to me. And I'd be damned if whatever

454
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,480
life I've got left, I'm going to sit there and be quiet about it because there's a big fight.

455
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,080
And if we do nothing, the bad boys are going to prevail. They're going to take over. And I

456
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,200
don't think we want that. This world could be so much easier if they would just let it out,

457
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
but somebody wants to make money off of it.

458
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:56,160
Well, I commend you for your courage, man. That means a ton to everybody that's listening.

459
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:04,640
And I know what that takes. And I just, I want to say, man, I'm sorry about your old man.

460
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,400
I'm really sorry to hear about that. Yeah, but he'd be damn glad that you wouldn't let

461
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,880
me go all the way. I appreciate that. That means a lot to me.

462
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,560
I'm glad you did. I'm glad you're here, buddy.

463
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,240
But do you have anything you want to say before we end it?

464
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,600
Appreciate you. Appreciate you. Thank you.
