1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the UFO whistleblower marathon.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,660
This is part three of the three-part series.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:14,360
Remember, all of these gentlemen have testified in front of Congress under oath.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,180
Today we have Eric Hecker, who is a firefighter contractor for Raytheon, which

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,320
is a military industrial complex company.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,240
And he was in Antarctica at a Raytheon facility and says that Raytheon has

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,720
the technology to produce earthquakes all throughout the planet.

8

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Go to Spotify, go to Apple podcasts, leave us a review and you

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
content creators out there.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,320
We've seen you all taking our content, making your own stuff,

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,960
putting it out on the internet.

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,640
Most people probably don't like that.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,240
We love it.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,160
So we made it easy for you.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,680
Go down, there's a link in the description has lots, hundreds of

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,760
free downloadable raw reels that you can download for free, make them

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,120
into whatever you want, monetize it, make money off of it, put it on TikTok,

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
put it on all the social media channels.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,560
We appreciate it.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,880
All we ask is that you tag the show.

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,800
I love you all.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,920
Enjoy the last part of this series.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,600
It was a really good one and we'll see you soon.

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
Eric Hecker.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,000
Sean.

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,440
Welcome to the show, brother.

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,840
Thank you very much for having me, sir.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,920
My pleasure.

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:51,080
So you are the only testimony that I did not get to hear at the conference.

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,800
I had a flight and the conference went way over time.

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,880
And so this is totally fresh to me right now.

33
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,320
And definitely fresh to the audience, but just a little intro on you.

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,720
So you were a contractor for Raytheon, which Raytheon, how would you describe Raytheon?

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,480
I would say that Raytheon is a military industrial contractor that

36
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,520
normally is making weapons and targeting systems for the military.

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,960
And oddly enough, had a contract to provide general services

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,040
at the South Pole station.

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,120
Interesting.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,320
From 2010 to 2011, you were a tradesman and firefighter in the South

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,880
Pole, Antarctica is a contractor for Raytheon.

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,560
You spent 366 continuous days at the South Pole.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,320
You were experimented on as a child and trained to be a remote viewer.

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,480
Correct.

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,320
Through a program called Stargate Project, a submarine service in the Navy,

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,560
plumber for the wealthy elite on Long Island prior to Raytheon and

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,560
experience with UFOs.

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,200
Yes.

49
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,040
You're a whistleblower for the benefit of humanity.

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,760
Why are you blowing the whistle now?

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,400
I am blowing the whistle because I'm obliged to.

52
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,840
I don't know anybody that's walked a similar path to me in life.

53
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,440
So it's necessary information that gets out there.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,360
I wish that I could be relieved of the task, but until I can find someone that

55
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,160
can properly handle this information, I have to be on point for it.

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,840
Roger that.

57
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,560
Well, just like everybody else, we always start off with a gift.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,520
If you don't guess this, what's in there?

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,160
Pull them out.

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,840
You got it.

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,960
We have genuine vigilance elite gummies.

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,840
Nice.

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,320
Illegal in all 50 states.

64
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,760
They are.

65
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,200
They're illegal in all 50 states, believe it or not.

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,480
Thank you very much.

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,360
You're welcome.

68
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,080
I think they're still legal in all 50 states.

69
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,560
I don't know.

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,920
Laws change very fast nowadays.

71
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,440
Tyranny might start coming after candy next.

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:56,960
Who knows?

73
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,880
But today we're here to talk about Raytheon Technologies Corporation.

74
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,760
Raytheon is an aerospace company that provides advanced systems and

75
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,160
services for commercial, military, and government customers worldwide.

76
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,600
Probed for corruption in government contracting since 1980s.

77
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,480
You were in the South Pole from 2010 to 2011.

78
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,880
Let's talk about what you were doing down there.

79
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,440
You got it.

80
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,280
What were you doing down there?

81
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,960
I was contracted for the summer season as a plumber.

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,480
I did well enough in my summer season to garner a winter contract as well,

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,080
which got me my full year's stay.

84
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,600
I was also tasked with being a firefighter.

85
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,440
I was a lead on the firefighting team.

86
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,920
And because of that dual role capacity, I physically held a key that opened

87
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,320
every single door in the facility.

88
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,360
I had complete access to every compartment they manufactured.

89
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,880
That was a rare position to be in.

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,440
What are you blowing the whistle on?

91
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,680
That there are technologies at the South Pole station that people can't even

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,840
consider that exist on this planet.

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,760
Like what?

94
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,880
Directed energy weapons systems is something that people need to get in

95
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,320
their vocabulary fast.

96
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,080
The ice cube neutrino detector is not simply a passive listening device as

97
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,920
presented for the science that they're claiming it to do.

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,600
It also has the capacity to transmit.

99
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,280
There are embedded in the ice, what are called digital optical modules, doms.

100
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,920
They're about the size of a basketball.

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,480
The array embedded in the ice is one kilometer by one kilometer by one kilometer.

102
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,960
It is the world's largest telescope.

103
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,200
And now because we have proven that it can transmit, it's the world's

104
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,160
largest directed energy weapons system.

105
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,960
It is responsible for the earthquakes in Christchurch, New

106
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,080
Zealand in 2011 on the front end of the year.

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,280
How do you know for a fact that that was responsible for that?

108
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,800
Because I was present and I have gone over this with the pertinent people

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,080
that I will not be releasing their names.

110
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,840
Okay.

111
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,960
But I was on the team, let's just say, and I've confirmed this.

112
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,360
Well, I've provided documentation from the actual manufacturer specs.

113
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,480
So this unit was constructed, operated and maintained by the

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
University of Wisconsin.

115
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,960
And just like every other device on the planet, whether you're driving an

116
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,760
M1 Abrams tank or operating the ice cube neutrino detector, there's

117
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,960
operator's manuals that tell you how things work right there in that

118
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,960
information free for everybody to find.

119
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,400
I found it myself.

120
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,640
I was directed to find it.

121
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,480
I'll put it that way and release this information.

122
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,720
And it states very clearly that each one of these domes can transmit

123
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,040
at 2047 volts each.

124
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,760
So these are currently the facts of life.

125
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,440
How do you know?

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,760
I mean, how do you, I guess what I'm asking is how did it even come to your

127
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,440
attention that this triggered an earthquake?

128
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,520
If you're at the South Pole and New Zealand had an earthquake, I mean, how

129
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,600
did you know it came from the South Pole?

130
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,160
Without divulging names.

131
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,520
Without divulging names.

132
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,600
I could only say that it was communicated to me from team members that were

133
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,680
present and fully read in at the time that they were aware.

134
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,880
And since that time.

135
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,040
At the immediate medical, like the same day.

136
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,760
Oh, absolutely.

137
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
It was understood.

138
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,080
Well, what was said?

139
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,600
That we accidentally hit Christ Church, New Zealand twice when they were trying

140
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,640
to fire up this weapon for the first time.

141
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,240
That it was, it was friendly fire.

142
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,120
It was not on purpose, but it occurred that the system is designed for that.

143
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,880
And it was just friendly fire.

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,720
So this is a, so this is a telescope.

145
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,680
That sounds like a, is it a telescope?

146
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,160
Absolutely.

147
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,600
It is, it is a neutrino detector for sure.

148
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,520
It can accomplish its primary purpose.

149
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,360
It can also transmit and then provide a multifaceted platform for

150
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,000
directed energy weapons systems.

151
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,400
Do you have any idea how the earthquake was initiated?

152
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,200
From misfiring the system.

153
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Where did, I mean.

154
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,600
Where were they targeting?

155
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,560
I don't know.

157
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,000
Is it going to the earth?

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,400
Does it go into the atmosphere?

159
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,360
It can definitely go through the earth.

160
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,800
I would consider that it might be able to do stuff in the atmosphere.

161
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,040
I haven't heard that statement laid at its feet, but I wouldn't put it past it.

162
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:49,120
I don't want to try to limit the functions of this device by my imagination or experience.

163
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,280
I believe that's one of the problems with directed energy weapons is they are

164
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,760
not like standard weapons of old where you have a gun and a particular caliber

165
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
bullet, you pull the trigger and it does one thing.

166
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,120
These platforms are way more complex than that.

167
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,720
They do a lot of things.

168
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,320
They do a lot of things.

169
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,600
What else do they do?

170
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,120
Excuse me.

171
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,000
This system, additionally in regards to the neutrinos, it detects the

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
neutrinos that are apparently coming off of the new exotic propulsion systems

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,040
for either off-world UFOs or reverse engineered stuff on our planet.

174
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,240
What is neutrino?

175
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,960
Neutrino is a near massless particle that goes at, close or beyond the speed of light.

176
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,120
It is so small that it can pass between the electron shell and the nucleus of

177
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,880
pretty much every atom on the planet.

178
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,280
And the capacity of being detected at the South Pole station, when the

179
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,080
neutrino impacts the nucleus of the water molecule of the ice in the

180
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,240
glaciers at the pole, a reaction occurs.

181
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,160
The nucleus and the neutrino become destroyed.

182
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,120
A muon is created and ejected in a blue flash of light known as Cherenkov

183
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,480
radiation flashes in the ice.

184
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,000
And that's what the domes, the digital optical modules are detecting.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's their primary purpose as presented.

186
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,000
Now, whether that neutrino comes from a quasar out in space or a exotic

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,080
propelled engine off of vehicles that aren't being discussed

188
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,640
contemporarily, it detects it.

189
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,480
Thus making it basically an air traffic control center for all non-discussed

190
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,720
vehicles on this planet.

191
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,520
So just like we have all the other air traffic on the planet and it's being

192
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,080
completely observed and attended to, there's just another level of craft on

193
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,360
this planet and another level of air traffic control tower that exists.

194
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,680
This is that facility.

195
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,720
Back to tracking neutrinos.

196
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280
What is that?

197
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,560
Why are they tracking those?

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,800
Oh, for the purposes of science, they're claiming that there's a lot to be

199
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,440
ascertained by understanding the difference between low power and high

200
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,480
power neutrino ejections from cosmic occurrences.

201
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,680
It's about that vague.

202
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,440
This is what they spend our tax dollars on.

203
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,480
Let's talk about the, well, what else do they do?

204
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:21,040
The device is also for faster than light communications, quantum entangled

205
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,320
communications at great distance.

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,120
And I guess it was the late eighties or early nineties, Gary McKinnon hacked

207
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,600
NASA and he found that we, he found the list of the off world space fleet and

208
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,800
the captains of the ships respectively.

209
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,920
We have a fleet out there.

210
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,040
If we have a fleet out there, we need to communicate with them.

211
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,760
This is that facility.

212
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,320
Can you explain quantum entanglement communications?

213
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,280
Yes, I don't think most people understand what I'm about to say anyway.

214
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,440
But I will.

215
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,520
The way quantum entanglement works is that you can take, you can take two

216
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,280
particles, quantum entangle them, and then take those two particles and move them

217
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,880
at any distance in the cosmos.

218
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,560
And let's just say, for example, if you quantum entangle two electrons and you

219
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,120
have them spinning in the same direction, and then you take one of those electrons

220
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,680
and you shoot that thing out a hundred thousand light years from the original.

221
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,680
If you then rotate the spin on the one electron, if you, if you modify it so

222
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:29,320
that it's spin changes, the quantum entangled electron at any distance will

223
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,680
simultaneously in no time, switch its rotation also because they're quantum

224
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,200
entangled.

225
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:42,440
So these communication systems are taking advantage of this aspect of quantum

226
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,880
mechanics that most people can't wrap their heads around.

227
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,920
And this is what they're utilizing.

228
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,600
It's just the new level of science that affords us the ability to communicate at

229
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,520
any distance instantaneously.

230
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,680
I've heard about this.

231
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,160
I've tried to dig into it and it's hard to understand.

232
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,640
It is hard to understand.

233
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,400
It would be my, my best way to put it is that when electricity first came out, it

234
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,040
was very hard for a lot of people to understand what Nikola Tesla was getting

235
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,320
at, but we can, we'd still, everyone was using it before they even understood it.

236
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,680
And this is just where we are right now.

237
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,880
It's just a new technology.

238
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a new conversation.

239
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,080
People don't have to understand it yet.

240
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,480
They just have to realize it's real.

241
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:36,640
What other kinds of things can this, Oh boy, um, voice to skull technology.

242
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,920
This is also in the foray of directed energy weapons.

243
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,520
What is that?

244
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,520
Uh, the ability to, let's just say, throw your voice into your head or my voice

245
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,000
into my head or allowing algorithms that now they can blanket a whole

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,280
geographical area and they can make everybody change their thoughts.

247
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,160
They can, I use the term intrusive thoughts, um, back to that

248
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,520
fork in the road analogy.

249
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,440
If you find yourself where you have to make a decision about something, next

250
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,320
thing you know, you catch yourself kind of having an argument in your

251
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,520
head with your own voices.

252
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,120
Well, the ability to, um, add another one of your voices in there, but have it

253
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,400
controlled by somebody else's microphone, so to say, is a very powerful tool.

254
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,880
And I think this is a weapon of war that we are seeing happen to everyone around us.

255
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,000
The department of defense recently started initiating protocols for their

256
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,440
employees, their agents to discuss Havana syndrome, Havana syndrome like symptoms.

257
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,200
And on that list is that their agents are hearing voices in their head.

258
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
And this is what they're getting at.

259
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,240
This is that technology that, you know, next thing you know, you're trying to

260
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,600
make its decision, but there's another Sean in your head that now is actually

261
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,120
somebody else's control and through the manipulation of that voice, they can

262
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,360
now push you just like we have, you know, the cell phones are weaponized now, the

263
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,040
social media platforms, and they can engage with an algorithm and they know

264
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,240
that they can push you in a direction by repetitive information being displayed

265
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,040
in front of you, uh, similar to the tachistoscope and grammar school, that

266
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,280
they can learn your system and they can learn to manipulate it on a personalized

267
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,240
level by just assessing you what the things are that you're interested in.

268
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,360
What are your weak points?

269
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,400
What's the crack on the dam?

270
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,520
What's the angle of attack?

271
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
And it's through repetition and access.

272
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,320
These are simply electromagnetic impulses in your head.

273
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,760
It's not that they can't be read.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,320
It's not that they can't be copied.

275
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,760
And it's not that they can't be just, um, replayed with somebody else's, um, control.

276
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,200
I mean, I could get a voice changing thing and I could sound like you.

277
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
If I wanted to, I could call you on the phone.

278
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,640
I could call your loved ones and I could pretend I'm Sean.

279
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
They can do that for you in your own head.

280
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,480
If you're a business owner and you're hiring right now, you are also

281
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,720
dealing with economic uncertainty.

282
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,800
Now is the time more than any other time that you need to hire the right

283
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,400
people faster and more efficiently than ever before to keep your costs down.

284
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,040

ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.

302
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,920
I want to start my comments with looking at the causation of this

303
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,280
crisis at our Southern border.

304
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,960
You know, it wasn't more than a couple of years ago during the

305
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,200
Democratic primary that your boss, now president Biden, said during a

306
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,240
debate, we're a nation that says you want to flee your fleeing oppression.

307
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,040
You should come.

308
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,080
What's with the open borders?

309
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,400
What are they hoping to accomplish?

310
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,400
Well, I think, I don't think it's, you know, one simple answer.

311
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Like a lot of things, I think it's complicated.

312
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,360
Like human beings are complicated, but I think there's a couple of

313
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,040
different buckets there in my opinion.

314
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,640
I think there are globalists around the world and within our own country

315
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,160
that don't want to see, you know, they don't want to see borders anymore.

316
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,280
This is an historic moment.

317
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,840
We have in this past year made great progress in ending the long

318
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,000
era of conflict and cold war.

319
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,160
We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future

320
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,640
generations, a new world order.

321
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,960
A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle,

322
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,440
governs the conduct of nations.

323
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,800
How are you finding all of this out?

324
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,480
Years of research.

325
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,640
The McDonald's corporation just had an ad come out a few months ago that

326
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,680
they're looking into research and development in a technology that will

327
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,400
afford them the ability to pump their commercials into your brain while

328
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,120
you're sleeping.

329
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,600
You think that they figured this out or some other company figured it out first.

330
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,480
You think if they're going to have this available to them next year, you

331
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,480
think that there weren't agencies that have been wielding this for a decade or

332
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:13,840
so?

333
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,640
Is there any, where can I read about this?

334
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,560
It's immediately available on the internet that McDonald's put this out there.

335
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,560
McDonald's.

336
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,760
McDonald's corporation is looking into putting commercials into our brains

337
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,440
while we're sleeping.

338
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,480
And that's, we can look that up.

339
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,080
Absolutely.

340
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,960
I got to look that up.

341
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,920
Understood, understood.

342
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,320
But now imagine when, if they can do that next year, who's, who's been doing it

343
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,600
for the last decade or so.

344
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,280
I'm with you.

345
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:40,880
Right.

346
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,800
A hundred percent with you.

347
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,680
So now when we look around the world and we see everybody acting the way that

348
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,640
they are acting, let's consider that these intrusive thoughts have already

349
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,320
been present.

350
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,120
What do we do about this?

351
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,920
This is the, these are the weapons of war contemporarily.

352
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,280
It's very unfortunate, but it used to be that war was a bit more noble.

353
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,040
When we selected people, we put them in uniforms, we sent them over there to the

354
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
battlefield and we said, fight for us.

355
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,400
And effectively that would have been an, an act of attrition of each nation's

356
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,040
resources until there was a victor.

357
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,000
Now, unfortunately they've circumnavigated the battlefield.

358
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,440
Nobody's dressed in uniforms anymore.

359
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,000
And the frontline is every neighborhood that we're in and the infrastructure is

360
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,880
still under attack.

361
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,160
It's just that now the average mortgage payer is in the line of fire.

362
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,800
The list of Havana syndrome like symptoms, which my South Pole crew and many

363
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,240
South Pole crews are suffering that other agencies are suffering.

364
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,960
If people pay really close attention, they're going to notice that these

365
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,760
symptoms are prevalent in the general population as well.

366
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,280
Interesting.

367
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:49,680
I interviewed a former CIA agent about this.

368
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,520
Who has Havana syndrome and has been speaking out on it quite a bit.

369
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:03,600
His name's Mark Polypornopoulos, but what, I mean, is there anything

370
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,960
else going on down there?

371
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,000
I mean, we just went through a lot of stuff here.

372
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,920
Yes, actually.

373
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,800
There's a system known as ELF extra low frequency.

374
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,120
It's also a massive antenna that's embedded in the ice there.

375
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,840
When I arrived to the facility as a tradesman and firefighter, I was read

376
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,000
into how everything worked because I needed for the safety of my crew to be

377
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,080
able to battle fires and engage things appropriately.

378
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,160
And at the onset, I was told that the ELF system is off.

379
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
It's defunct, it's disabled.

380
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,720
It is just sitting dead in the ice.

381
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,600
But through my need to make an additional repair on something else and tracing

382
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,880
back to a sub panel, I was finding the circuit that I needed to lock out, tag

383
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,080
out and do all the safer pairs, but then I noticed that this other breaker that

384
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,120
was supposed to be off was in the on position and it was listed as the ELF.

385
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,040
And I ran it up my chain.

386
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,960
I said, what's going on here?

387
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,640
I said, this is supposed to be off.

388
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,920
I was told it's off now.

389
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,800
And I was just given a hard, it's on.

390
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
That was the end of my need to know.

391
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,360
They didn't want to tell me anything else.

392
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
You, you have identified the circuit that you need to work on.

393
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,800
You have been informed that you can safely do your job, carry on.

394
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
So I did my job.

395
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,600
I made the repair that I needed to on the circuit next to the circuit that

396
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,720
I was now informed is duly on and operating.

397
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,320
So the ELF is up and running.

398
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,840
And that again, is a multifaceted directed energy weapons platform.

399
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,200
Do you have pictures of any of this stuff?

400
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,640
I have a lot of pictures of me in these facilities.

401
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,000
They mostly just prove my presence.

402
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,040
Can, if you hand those over, I'll display them on screen right now.

403
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,040
If I can get them, I can get you pictures before you present this to the world.

404
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,360
I would appreciate that.

405
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,920
Let's talk about the clear air system called Aero.

406
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,720
Yes.

407
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,720
Commonly referred to as the no fly zone.

408
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,520
Yes.

409
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,040
Yes.

410
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,960
The Aero building ARO is the atmospheric research observatory.

411
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,280
It is listed on the charge, the one that I gave you as well, um, as a no

412
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,600
fly zone in the Vegas sense of the term at first glance, but as any pilot knows,

413
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,160
there's always, you know, fine print.

414
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,000
So the no fly zone as listed at the South Pole station because of Aero simply

415
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
provides a limit to the ability for a plane to fly too low.

416
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,800
It sets the floor at 8,000 feet.

417
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,920
You can't fly below 8,000 feet.

418
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,840
A lot of people like to try to claim that there's a hole at South Pole station

419
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,960
and there's a no fly zone that protects from you flying in an area that'll see

420
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,000
the hole and that's just total shenanigans.

421
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,160
The no fly zone limits your ability to fly low, not high.

422
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,240
So with that height available, you will see everything available to see, which

423
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,200
is ice as far as the eye can see.

424
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,680
There is no hole in the ice at the South Pole station.

425
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,760
There may be one somewhere else.

426
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,800
I can't testify to the entirety of the continent.

427
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,720
It's huge.

428
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,640
All I can say is that when people are talking about there being a hole at

429
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,600
the South Pole, they're full of crap.

430
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,560
They don't know what they're talking about.

431
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,560
They're taking something that they know very little about and just running with it.

432
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,000
They say in other ways that, you know, a little information is a dangerous thing.

433
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,080
And that's what these people are doing is they're operating off of very little

434
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,760
information.

435
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,640
The Atmospheric Research Observatory, as I testified in DC, I witnessed myself in

436
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,760
doing my standard rounds in the winter season at South Pole station, that that

437
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,840
building would, with great regularity, have a very powerful green laser beam

438
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,280
shooting out of it into the cosmos.

439
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,200
I believe through other things that I've located there, which is the, um, the

440
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:16,080
chilled helium in a massive amount, it is chilled down to four degrees Kelvin in

441
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,440
storage, which my understanding, this is something new that I'm learning about.

442
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,640
It's called super fluids.

443
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,360
Super fluids act very differently than other things in our scientific

444
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,120
spectrum and are used for things called chemical lasers.

445
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,600
Well, we had a super fluid and we had a laser.

446
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,480
So I believe that what I'm learning on this is that it was probably a secondary

447
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,400
means of long range communication and or another weapons platform.

448
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,880
June 18th was my birthday right after Dr.

449
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,800
Greer's event of June 12th.

450
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,000
On June 18th, the National Science Foundation website could have posted

451
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,440
anything they wanted for a photograph, but on my birthday, I would say I got a

452
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,560
gift from someone in the program because they posted a picture of the arrow

453
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,640
building's green laser blasting into the cosmos, which verifies exactly what I saw.

454
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,320
Interesting.

455
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,720
And you think that might be a communication device?

456
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,680
How would they be communicating with the laser?

457
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,280
I don't understand the science of it.

458
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,480
I just know that it exists.

459
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:21,920
Okay.

460
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,520
Laser laser beam communication, direct line of sight, laser beam

461
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,200
comms, microwave type comms.

462
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,360
It exists.

463
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,240
You say a lot of the crew members from the South Pole are experiencing Havana

464
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,120
syndrome symptoms.

465
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,440
What are some of those symptoms?

466
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,000
They have mental degradation, troubles with their memory, fatigue, stuff like that.

467
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,920
Skin issues.

468
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,520
Headaches?

469
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,240
Yes.

470
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:56,680
The Antarctica Treaty of 1950-59, an agreement signed by 12 nations in which

471
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:04,920
the Antarctic continent was made demilitarized to be preserved for scientific research.

472
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,520
What do you think about that?

473
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,960
I think it's a load of malarkey, and I'm going to throw a gentleman's name out

474
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,000
there that I have worked with.

475
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,160
He told me very specifically that the Antarctic continent was made

476
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,320
specifically at the time that we communicated.

477
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,960
He's going to die when he sees this video.

478
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,280
I worked with a gentleman by the name of Aaron Bontrager, and he was also

479
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,320
previously contracted by Raytheon Polar Services as a cook to work on a cat

480
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,240
train that went across the ice.

481
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,240
And he said the express purpose for him, I should say, for that team, working

482
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,360
for Raytheon was they were searching for missile site locations.

483
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,800
Okay.

484
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,760
Correct.

485
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,440
The whole idea of this being demilitarized is a load of baloney.

486
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,680
How do you think they're getting, how are they powering this facility?

487
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,840
I believe there's a secondary power source inside of the old

488
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,640
pole that was built in 1957.

489
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,600
What do you mean the old pole?

490
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,080
The original pole, I should say, built in 1957, we referred to as old pole.

491
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,520
There was other facilities that were manufactured, different stages of

492
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,120
inhabitation of crew.

493
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,320
So 1957 was the first one.

494
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,520
It predates the Antarctic treaty, which means that they could

495
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,200
have had nuclear power there.

496
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,280
I believe they did have nuclear power there and that since then they may have

497
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,360
maintained it almost like a grandfather clause or that they may have new, more

498
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,440
exotic systems that are not in the legalese of the treaty.

499
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Why do you think Antarctica is a no-fly zone?

500
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,960
Antarctica is not a no-fly zone.

501
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,880
Arrow, commonly referred to as a no-fly zone.

502
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,240
Why?

503
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,840
It's, it's a misnomer.

504
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,160
You can fly right over the no-fly zone.

505
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,280
You just have to be higher than 8,000 feet.

506
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,920
Well, I'm asking why do you have to be higher than 8,000 feet?

507
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,480
Oh, because it's because of the, they're doing science on the, the

508
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,960
cleanliness of the air, so they just don't want it tainted.

509
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,640
Similarly, there's no land traffic allowed in that area.

510
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,760
So you can take a snow machine.

511
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,000
If I wanted to go visit the building to do my rounds, I could take a snow

512
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,920
machine up to a certain point and then I had to stop the snow machine and walk

513
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,640
because simply the exhaust gases from the machine would taint their sensors.

514
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,040
So it all said the only reason they're trying to block out vehicular activity is

515
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,120
to keep the exhaust gases out of their sensors.

516
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,200
How do you get there?

517
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,200
How do you get to Arrow?

518
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:39,720
Yeah.

519
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,960
It's within walking distance of the elevated station.

520
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,080
How do you, how do you fly into Antarctica?

521
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,120
Uh, you fly in with a, a Herc, LC 130, Herc on skis, and you just come

522
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,680
in from outside of that quadrant or, or, or above 8,000 feet.

523
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,760
Okay.

524
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,080
How much air traffic is going around there?

525
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,280
Uh, during the summer seasons, 24 hours of operation.

526
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,600
They typically have a few, a few Hercs on deck idling.

527
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,480
Um, most of the time, and a lot of, uh, a lot of fuel is brought in by Herc.

528
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,680
Uh, our waste is brought out by Herc when the airmen will allow themselves

529
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,600
to be a flying garbage can, as they claim.

530
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:25,000
But, um, yeah, basically almost, almost all operations and logistics were done

531
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,920
by Herc while we were there in my 2010 season, they had brought in their first

532
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,680
fuel haul over land as kind of an experiment to the process.

533
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,440
And it's my understanding that they call this a traverse that they have

534
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,160
since increased traverse activity to drag large fuel bladders across the

535
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,280
ice, to resupply the fuel that way.

536
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,000
Being more economic than doing it by Herc and then affording that, um, volume

537
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,960
of Herc space that's not being utilized for fuel now can of course do other things.

538
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,560
The flight operations are almost 24 hours a day during the summer season

539
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,840
because nothing moves in the winter season.

540
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,320
So everything has to occur in a certain window.

541
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,400
Okay.

542
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,160
And back to the putting voices in people's heads.

543
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,920
Um, are you aware of any ways to defend against that?

544
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,000
Know thyself.

545
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,600
It's an ancient practice and it's an ancient practice for a reason.

546
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,360
These modern technologies are bastardizations of ancient techniques.

547
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,320
Way back in the day, they would call someone a magician who was adept at this skill.

548
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,760
I could walk into the room and I would potentially have that skill set to

549
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,040
put my thought in your head.

550
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,480
It's just a technique.

551
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,160
It's completely doable.

552
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,360
But now we have people that are no longer going through these schools of

553
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,640
nobility to learn to practice these things nicely.

554
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:53,000
And we have evil people that are taking technologies and utilizing them.

555
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,800
Because again, it's just simply electromagnetic impulses.

556
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,920
They can be read, they can be used, they can be hijacked.

557
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,240
Eric, is there anything that I'm missing that you want to bring to the public?

558
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,080
Hmm.

559
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,920
That's a great question.

560
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,920
I want to emphasize that we are currently in a state of war that

561
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,120
people aren't realizing.

562
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,480
What is that?

563
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,880
These weapons are being wielded around us, against us.

564
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,640
Uh, there are power players that are above nation states, geographical

565
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,720
boundaries and political parties mean very little to the wealthy elite on this planet.

566
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,520
We're, we're pawns.

567
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,320
We're chattel.

568
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,040
I am a person for the people.

569
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,800
We, the people of this planet deserve a better future than the

570
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,520
one we are being presented.

571
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,200
We've, we've all through our blood, sweat and tears, we've invested here in

572
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,680
the United States, we've invested our taxpayer dollars for these people to

573
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,960
create weapons systems that they're using against us.

574
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,000
This is, it's a sin.

575
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,280
It's illegal.

576
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,320
It's a sin.

577
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,840
It's immoral.

578
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,560
And we have to do better for the future generations.

579
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,280
Are you worried for your safety?

580
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,000
No.

581
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,200
Why not?

582
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm, I'm just simply beyond that.

583
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't, um, I don't really care what happens to me.

584
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,400
I care about doing the right thing.

585
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,920
Do you think you're in danger?

586
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,720
I guess theoretically people don't like me doing what I'm doing.

587
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,520
I would say probably not.

588
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,480
Fair enough.

589
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:29,280
But, um, work, if, if you're in danger, you're in danger, you're in danger.

590
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,200
That's it.

591
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,640
That's a lot of info in a short amount of time.

592
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,200
And I really appreciate you coming here and, um, and inform us all.

593
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,640
So have you been approached by any BD outlets?

594
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,960
I've been approached by a lot of people.

595
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,800
Really?

596
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,960
And I pretty much tell them to go scratch.

597
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,000
Why do you tell them that?

598
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,320
Because I can tell from the way that they approach me, they're not looking

599
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,440
to do justice by what I'm saying.

600
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,400
Um, they're what I refer to as dissipators, people that are looking to waste my energy,

601
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,120
diverted into the wrong direction.

602
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,120
Um, I'm very fortunate and I would say blessed to have met someone like yourself

603
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,520
who seems to be on the up and up and going, um, to fight the good fight on this stuff,

604
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,800
to get to the actual brass tacks truth and presented to the world in an untainted capacity.

605
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,800
There's, there's a lot of bad things going on on this planet.

606
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,560
I'm sure that you've experienced it yourself firsthand and you're aware that a lot of

607
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,200
people don't know that these things are happening in the shadows.

608
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,240
I want people to know what's really going on on this planet so they can make educated

609
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,800
decisions about what they have to do, uh, to protect themselves and their children.

610
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,160
Well, that's very noble of you, man.

611
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,080
I really appreciate it.

612
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:46,320
I, I have, uh, I have, I don't, that's a lot of info to process.

613
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,880
I understand.

614
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,640
Take me a minute to come up with questions and would you be willing to come back?

615
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,720
I would love to come back.

616
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,200
Let me digest this.

617
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,160
And then we'll come up with a date and do a longer form interview.

618
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,920
I don't have my head around this stuff.

619
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,440
Understood.

620
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,640
In the meantime, be safe.

621
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,880
Thank you for coming out here and, um, it's an honor to meet you.

622
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,280
Thanks.

623
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,280
