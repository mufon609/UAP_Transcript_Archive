00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Skip Atwater, welcome to the show.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,880
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,000
I have heard a lot about you from several of the previous guests.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,240
I've read about you.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,280
I've seen documentaries about you.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,000
You're a hard band to reach.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Been trying to make contact for quite a while and Joe and Scooter finally, they were they

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,620
were the ones that made the connection.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,740
So I just want to say thank you to Joe and Scooter.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,200
I'm glad to be here.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,140
It's an honor to have you here.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,920
But everybody gets an introduction here.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,660
So we'll knock that out first.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:52,500
Frederick Holmes, Skip Atwater, you are a counter spy during the Cold War era where

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,580
you used your natural psychic aptitude as a US Army counterintelligence special agent.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,060
You played a key role in the remote viewing intelligence program now known to the world

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,460
by the code name Stargate.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,620
For 10 years, you were the operations and training officer of this secret remote viewing

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,620
program.

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,700
You recruited and trained an elite cadre of professional intelligence officers to do remote

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,420
viewing for the Department of Defense and various members of the national intelligence

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,040
community.

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,760
After retiring from the army, you became president of the Monroe Institute in Virginia.

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:39,320
In your book Project 8200, UFO UAP Bases and Activities, the original remote viewing transcripts,

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,920
you show us the results of Pat Price's famous exploration of four mountains around the world

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,400
where Price believed UFO bases were located.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,920
You're the author of Captain of My Ship, Master of My Soul, Living with Guidance.

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,840
You have been featured in several film documentaries including Ghosts in the Afterlife, A Scientific

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,680
Investigation and Third Eye Spies.

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,280
I'm sure I'm missing quite a bit there, but that's quite...

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
That's a big pile.

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
That's what you're guessing.

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
That is.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
That is.

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
That is.

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,320
But, you know, I'm just...

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:23,120
I have been fascinated with this subject for many years now.

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,480
And with every person that I interview, I just get more intrigued.

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:36,640
And you have been involved in this almost since the very beginning, from what I understand.

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,320
And so some of the things that I would just...

41
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
I would like...

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,160
Two main things I would like to do in this interview is one, to cover your life story

43
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,600
and how you kind of got involved in this.

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,840
And I would also like to go over, you know, the history of the Stargate program and kind

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,360
of how it came on the map for United States intelligence.

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Yes.

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Perfect.

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,560
I can talk about all that.

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Perfect.

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,840
So, but before we get too in the weeds, I have a Patreon account.

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,000
Patreon, it's a subscription account.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,480
There are top supporters.

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,480
A lot of these folks have been with us since the very beginning.

54
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,960
And they're the reason I get to sit here and you're here as well.

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,600
And so one of the things I do is I offer them the opportunity to ask every guest a question.

56
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,560
And so this question is from Jay.

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,920
What neurological structures in the brain are responsible for these altered states of

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,000
consciousness?

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,160
Is it simply dreaming?

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,160
That is an interesting question because we've been thinking about the brain for a long time.

61
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,920
And the brain is this and the brain is that.

62
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,240
And it used to be thought of hundreds of years ago of that's just to keep your head warm.

63
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,880
They don't know what the brain is and what's going on up there.

64
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:17,640
But it's something that, you know, over the past 50, 100 years has become the answer to

65
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
everything.

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,080
If it's this is, oh, it's in the brain, you have to fix this part of the brain right here.

67
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,680
That's what's wrong with it.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:31,680
And so him asking this question is a reasonable one, given the education we have now.

69
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm not so sure that 50 years from now, that will be much of a question because it seems

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,960
that all these things that people do, whether it's remote viewing or whatever they call

71
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:51,480
it, seems to have something to do with quantum nonlocality or the everywhere, every win of

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,400
all information.

73
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,000
What was the what did you call it first?

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,940
The quantum quantum nonlocality is a technical term for it.

75
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,180
They had to invent that 60 years ago because they didn't know what was going on.

76
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,900
There's lots of science on saying that there's no space and there's no time.

77
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:21,220
And these people will just call them remote viewers because it's a good thing to use as

78
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,140
a name.

79
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,500
Not that I like it so much, but that's okay.

80
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,900
Everybody calls it remote viewing.

81
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,340
What do you call it?

82
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:38,460
I attempt to list out several different things.

83
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,460
Are you psychic?

84
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,380
Is that the word that one should use?

85
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,240
It's a word that people toss around a lot.

86
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,660
Are you clairvoyant?

87
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,980
Are those words that you toss and pass around?

88
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:58,060
But Ingo Swann kind of coined the word remote viewing because when he went to work with

89
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,460
Stanford Research Institute, they didn't want to say, well, we're training psychics here.

90
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,660
No, let's just call it, you know, remote viewing.

91
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,460
That would probably be better, which I've gotten sidetracked in talking a lot here,

92
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:21,940
but it's not really remote viewing because there's nothing that's remote.

93
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,260
Everything is all one thing.

94
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,780
That's the quantum nonlocality.

95
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,540
So these people that are doing the remote viewing have the ability to perceive everywhere

96
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,580
and every when.

97
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,140
And some of them decide to call it this and call it that and call it this, but it looks

98
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,780
an awful lot, at least for the next 50 years, to be quantum nonlocality.

99
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:56,560
And I limit that 50 year thing because each unit of time, like there is no time, right?

100
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,880
Each unit of time we go through, suddenly things are different.

101
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,440
I mean, wasn't the earth flat at one time and wasn't everything orbiting around us?

102
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,400
No, it's us going around the sun.

103
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,280
That's an interesting idea.

104
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:20,360
And those kinds of large breakthroughs in science takes a while for us to figure them

105
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,780
out and generations to figure them out.

106
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,620
So I can only think that maybe in the future generations, it won't be what we think it

107
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,620
is now.

108
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,020
Makes a lot of sense.

109
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,560
Makes a lot of sense.

110
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,800
So back to the original question.

111
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,300
So it's not a dream?

112
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,100
Well then we've defined something called a dream.

113
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,420
And by using the word dream, we all tell ourselves, oh, that wasn't really real.

114
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,220
It was just a dream.

115
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,780
Perhaps it's a different kind of knowing and it's coded when you have a dream about this,

116
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
this and this.

117
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:15,460
So you know what that really was is how important things are to me when I think about this and

118
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,020
I had a dream about it and it reminded me when this happened and that happened.

119
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,220
I don't think there's anybody who really knows what a dream is except that they go, oh, it's

120
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,300
just a dream.

121
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,740
Don't worry about it.

122
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,380
So do you, this is interesting.

123
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:37,540
Do you, and I know this is going to tie into your childhood too, I think, but do you think

124
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:43,820
that every dream needs to be deciphered and dissected and decoded?

125
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,500
If you mean just tell my wife what my dream was, yeah, I think that's a good thing to

126
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
talk about.

127
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:55,380
No, I don't think that it's a thing to be decoded and figured out and you should go

128
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,820
see your psychiatrist and say, I need help understanding this dream.

129
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,060
I don't think that.

130
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,260
It's a matter of, obviously there are people who have real problems with that and they

131
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:15,540
should see the proper help things, but it's not, it's just, it's a passing thing.

132
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,780
Can you talk, what was, I'm sorry, what was the terminology again, quantum?

133
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,620
Quantum non-locality.

134
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,620
Quantum non-locality.

135
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:30,620
And that comes from quantum physics, which is a brand new thing, only 60 years old, and

136
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,420
making it simpler.

137
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
There's no space, no time.

138
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:42,260
Everything is everywhere, every wind and I'm going to go too far on this.

139
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,500
People turn the channel off.

140
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,660
That guy's like, oh no, they're not going to turn the channel off.

141
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:53,420
Because the reason I'm asking is I don't understand, I've tried to talk about this so many times

142
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,100
and it's just over my head.

143
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,340
And so when we say there's no space and no time and everything's happening all at once

144
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,060
in the now, correct?

145
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,060
Yes.

146
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,100
What does that mean?

147
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,420
So what was yesterday?

148
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,380
If there's no space, no time, there's no yesterday.

149
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,420
But it's past.

150
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,860
There's no past and no future because it's all happening at once.

151
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,820
What about how?

152
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,140
Because that's the way it is.

153
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:29,060
It's a very interesting thing to ask those questions because many, many, many different

154
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:37,300
people, thousands, millions of people and different cultures have come along and tried

155
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,420
to answer all those questions.

156
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,300
So I think what that means is that's the right question.

157
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,740
The fact that they can't answer it.

158
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:54,020
But in what I've been doing for a number of years says that this information we get can

159
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,700
only have come to this person one way.

160
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,700
And that's the fact that they know this because they didn't read it in a book.

161
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,340
They know this because they didn't get a phone call saying, you ought to watch out for

162
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
this.

163
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:18,900
They got a message from beyond space and time and came up with some information that proved

164
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,620
to be true.

165
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:35,300
So if everything's happening all at once, all the time, and there is no time, then that

166
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,400
means every...

167
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,280
You could break it down into, you could break a millisecond down into a what, a nanosecond

168
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,120
and break that down and it just continuously, it never ends.

169
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:58,180
You can just keep dissecting and so does that mean where is all this happening all at once?

170
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,440
That means everything's happening all at once.

171
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,360
So that means what I just said two seconds ago is happening again, correct?

172
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,040
There's no again if it's all at once.

173
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,160
Help me understand this.

174
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,120
I just thought of a joke in my head when you were talking, it's like, you know, he's trying

175
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,560
a second chance and I snipped the word second.

176
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:37,360
Yeah, I'm glad to be of help, but I am as confused about it too, except for things happen

177
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:45,060
in my life and other people too that say, it's funny you brought that up because I was

178
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,320
just thinking about that too.

179
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,380
And do you think that means this and this is like, well, how could you have thought

180
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:58,860
about it yesterday morning and I think about it two days later and it's the same thing.

181
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:10,580
Doesn't that mean there's a little hint that we are all one together?

182
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:21,220
And I use a gesture that you might want to cut out, but I always say, God.

183
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:32,380
I don't, yes, God is a religious word and we're getting off track here, but it's in

184
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,380
my head.

185
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:45,580
There is, I saw interesting street scene done with Muslims and guy was driving up in a taxi

186
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,100
or a car and all the little kids came around and said, give me, give me, give me, give

187
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
me.

188
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:58,620
And the guy got out of the car and went like that and they walked away from him because

189
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:06,180
everything that comes to you comes from what we believe in, not by me giving you quarters

190
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,820
or whatever out the window.

191
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,420
And it was an interesting, in the movie, it was an interesting lesson he was teaching

192
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,220
those kids.

193
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,900
They're used to trying to find something to eat and run down the street and chase anybody

194
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:28,180
that looks a foreigner or whoever to give them some money and make their life better.

195
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:35,220
And this guy got out and he just went like that and all the kids are like, interesting.

196
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:43,020
So if no time, so I'm trying to understand the concept of no time, everything's happening

197
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,980
at once, but what is the space when you say there's no space, what does that mean?

198
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:58,620
Well, we, if in my mind, if I back up hundreds of years and watch the way people have organized

199
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,300
what they thought was space, like we talked about a minute ago in terms of the earth is

200
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,500
the center of everything and everything else goes around the earth.

201
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,300
And then you think, well, no, look at it, we've measured out over the years and we found

202
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,660
out that not everything is the center of the earth.

203
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,620
As a matter of fact, if you look, there's things out there, they're really strange and

204
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,700
there's a bunch of things out there and we're calling those planets.

205
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,100
Well, how do you know it's doing that?

206
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:37,180
Well, it took a long time for guys to figure it out and watch it happen.

207
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:49,020
So we are beginning to think now that this thing we call space is infinite.

208
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:56,540
There isn't a place where, well, when do we stop having planets and suns and stars?

209
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:02,060
And it's a good question because some of them say everything was supposed to collapse back

210
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,140
billion years from now and start all over again with a big bang.

211
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:14,380
And then time went by and the scientists looked it out and said, all of those things aren't

212
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,380
coming back.

213
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:26,380
They just keep going further and further and further away until as time passes, like there

214
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:35,420
really is time, it will be so far away we can't see it anymore.

215
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,900
Well, then are we alone in the universe?

216
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,300
What's space all about?

217
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,660
That's interesting because the universe is expanding.

218
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,980
So we will hit up and they can see the beginning, they can see the big bang from what I understand

219
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,460
is supposedly correct.

220
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,060
They happened, however many, you know.

221
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,660
And I will challenge that statement, not that it's a big deal.

222
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,540
Yes, the big bang is the thing.

223
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,740
Well, how much longer, will that stick?

224
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,460
Will that always be, that's the way it is?

225
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:23,240
Or 100 years from now, 200, 500 years from now, they will say, you know, that big bang

226
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
thing just doesn't work.

227
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Yeah.

228
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Yeah.

229
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,240
I mean, Pluto is no longer a planet.

230
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,800
Lots of things change, but I'm just always fascinated in the subject.

231
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,600
I'm trying to wrap my head around it and I don't, I just don't have the IQ level to comprehend

232
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
it.

233
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:49,200
No, I think you're the one that's supposed to ask those questions and share those answers

234
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
with the world around you, that's who you are.

235
00:17:53,240 --> 00:18:00,760
While we may have won this election, the fight to restore a great nation has just begun.

236
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,520
Now is the time to take a stand and Patriot Mobile is leading the charge.

237
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,040

255
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,880
I know everybody out there has to be just as frustrated as I am when it comes to the

256
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,440
BS and the rhetoric that the mainstream media continuously tries to force feed us.

257
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,840
I also know how frustrating it can be to try to find some type of a reliable news source.

258
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,720
It's getting really hard to find the truth and what's going on in the country and in

259
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
the world.

260
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:49,400
And so one thing we've done here at The Sean Ryan Show is we are developing our newsletter

261
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,320
and the first contributor to the newsletter that we have is a woman, former CIA targeter.

262
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,920
Some of you may know her as Sarah Adams, call sign super bad.

263
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,720
She's made two different appearances here on The Sean Ryan Show and some of the stuff

264
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:13,400
that she has uncovered and broke on this show is just absolutely mind blowing.

265
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,680
And so I've asked her if she would contribute to the newsletter and give us a weekly intelligence

266
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,680
brief.

267
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,040
So it's going to be all things terrorists, how terrorists are coming up through the southern

268
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,780
border, how they're entering the country, how they're traveling, what these different

269
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,280
terrorist organizations throughout the world are up to.

270
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Here's the best part.

271
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,640
The newsletter is actually free.

272
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,800
We're not going to spam you.

273
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,560
It's about one newsletter a week, maybe two if we release two shows.

274
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,840
The only other thing that's going to be in there besides the Intel brief is if we have

275
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,240
a new product or something like that.

276
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,600
But like I said, it's a free CIA intelligence brief.

277
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Sign up.

278
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,720
Links in the description or in the comments.

279
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,840
We'll see you in the newsletter.

280
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Thank you.

281
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,000
Well, Skip, let's get into your story real quick.

282
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,920
Before we do, everybody gets a everybody gets a gift here.

283
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,160
Oh, yeah.

284
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Nothing crazy.

285
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,760
Just a little something for the ride home.

286
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,200
Those are Vigilance Elite gummy bears.

287
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Oh, boy.

288
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Yeah.

289
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
I hope you like candy.

290
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Yeah.

291
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,000
Made here in the USA, Michigan, but.

292
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Thank you.

293
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,960
I will bring that home to my family and I'll say, really, oh, those look really good.

294
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Right on.

295
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Right on.

296
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Skip, like I had mentioned at the beginning, you're a massive part played a massive role

297
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,040
in the Stargate program and and remote viewing and in and in U.S. intelligence.

298
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,680
And so I want to talk about your journey on on how that all came about.

299
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,400
And so let's kind of start with let's start in childhood.

300
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,360
Where did you grow up?

301
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,600
I grew up in Southern California.

302
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:16,240
And my dad was a dentist and my mother's father was a dentist.

303
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,920
So the family business was dentistry for them.

304
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:30,280
And there were a couple of kind of childhood things that were interesting to me because

305
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,680
they seemed normal to me because they were happening in the family.

306
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:41,880
And then as I got older, I would say, well, you know, I got kind of a weird family and

307
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,400
it was it sounds like I didn't like them because they were weird.

308
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,060
It was more of a casual comment about that.

309
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:59,640
My mom used to talk to animals that died, a cat or a dog or everything, and they'd tell

310
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,600
us kids and said, but they're fine.

311
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,240
And I talked to them and they're going to be OK and so forth.

312
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,960
And I was like, OK, mom, I'm going to school.

313
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:17,120
And I guess one of the stories is an interesting bedwetting story.

314
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,640
When I was 10 or a little bit younger than 10, I was still wetting my bed.

315
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,000
But I wasn't teased about it.

316
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,320
It was just a thing that I had to pull the sheets off the bed and run them through the

317
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,880
washer and then make the bed again.

318
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:38,000
And it was but it wasn't teasing or anything else because I felt a little of that at school.

319
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,080
But people would talk about that.

320
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,840
And one night I woke up in bed and the bed was all wet.

321
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,080
And I was screaming and mad at what had happened because there was no reason for this.

322
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,120
It was an embarrassing thing for me with two older sisters and school kids talking

323
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,600
about it.

324
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,400
So my mother came in.

325
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Are you all right?

326
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
You fell out of bed.

327
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Did you get hurt?

328
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Why are you screaming?

329
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
What's it all about?

330
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:17,040
And I said, I went into the bathroom and I sat on the toilet.

331
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,140
And when I began to pee, I woke up here in bed.

332
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,840
And now my bed's all wet.

333
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:32,760
And you know, very angry, very really outspoken about it.

334
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
There's a joke in the end.

335
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,160
It really pissed me off.

336
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,480
At any rate, my mom put her arm around me and she said, oh, it's okay.

337
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
It's okay.

338
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
It'll be okay.

339
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,020
And I was like, why are you so cool about it and say anything?

340
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:58,740
She says, you know, sometimes you're in your body and sometimes you're not in your body.

341
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:08,660
So when you go into the bathroom, you have to make really sure that you went to the bathroom

342
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,380
because it's obvious you didn't.

343
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,780
And we go back to the discussion of dreams.

344
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:24,720
Maybe you dreamed you went into the bathroom and you didn't and you peed your bed again.

345
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,760
Well, that left a idea in my head.

346
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,580
As the days rolled by and weeks rolled by, it was like, what does she mean by you're

347
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,560
not in your body?

348
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:45,320
And so I would kind of practice at night and found that I could get up and look out the

349
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,820
window and then look back and I was in bed and I said, that's pretty weird.

350
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:59,660
And as time went on, I would jump out the window and my out of body state would jump

351
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:05,520
out the window and I learned to trust that.

352
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,860
So when you say, let's rewind for just a second.

353
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,240
When you say you would get out of bed and look out the window and then you would look

354
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,660
back and you would be in bed, I mean, how old were you when this started to happen?

355
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,340
Right around 10?

356
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,800
It would be over 10.

357
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,500
So maybe in the next year or two, those things started to happen.

358
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,980
Do you remember the first time that happened?

359
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,200
Yes.

360
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
What were you thinking?

361
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Made an impression.

362
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,700
Well, I want to go out and play with my friends.

363
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:44,420
I found the first thing that I ran into when I'd go away from my sleeping self in bed,

364
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:50,420
that I was in some sort of school situation like night school or something.

365
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,200
I was in something called night school.

366
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,640
But then when I got a little bit older, I started to go find my friends, where's Mikey

367
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
down the road?

368
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,240
Hey, what if I go over here and find this and they were out of their bodies too, although

369
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,000
they didn't realize it like I did.

370
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,680
And so that became part of my life growing up.

371
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,720
So does that mean when you interact with somebody in a dream, you believe they are also out

372
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,420
of body?

373
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,200
I can't answer that question.

374
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,960
I can only say what my experience was.

375
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,440
And the question is, are they out of body?

376
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,040
And I'm not so sure that we use the term out of body.

377
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,560
It happens in hospitals and dying events and everything else.

378
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:55,480
And so we've classified that as, oh, you were out of your body.

379
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,600
And then I say, wait a minute, Skip, wait a minute.

380
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,840
You're everywhere, every when.

381
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,680
There's not a being in the body or being out of the body.

382
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:12,120
So I had to just, well, I shouldn't talk so much because I don't know what the heck's

383
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,400
going on anyways.

384
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:23,360
The next thing that was kind of like that, telling the story of the weird family I grew

385
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,520
up with, which contributes to my eventual career.

386
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:39,880
When I was older and was into high school and cars and stuff like that, I got a car

387
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,440
from my dad's nurse.

388
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,560
She gave me a car and I crawled underneath and started taking it apart and everything.

389
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,120
My dad was really liberal.

390
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,840
It was okay if I took stuff apart and the garage got dirty and he'd look under the car

391
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,640
and say, how you doing down there?

392
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,280
You making any progress?

393
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:07,840
And he would very much, and let me find out for myself and let me figure it out for myself.

394
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,800
And got that taken care of.

395
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,960
And then later I bought my uncle's car for $100, a 54 Ford.

396
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,760
And immediately I went to the other uncle who gave me a 292 engine, which I had punched

397
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,280
out 60,000s with a racing cam in it and so forth and so on.

398
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,200
But there was something else going on.

399
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:44,040
I could look at the car, laying underneath it and look at it and say, oh, I see what's

400
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
wrong.

401
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:52,160
The exhaust pipe bracket is loose and it wasn't something that I could see physically.

402
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,120
It was like I could see through it.

403
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:03,120
And later in life, I learned they had a name for that called remote viewing.

404
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,720
And I was like, well, that's pretty weird.

405
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,760
I guess when you go to a mechanic to get your car fixed, that's why our mechanics know what's

406
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,120
wrong with your car, because they can do that, just like I was doing with my car.

407
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:21,040
Later I found out that isn't what they were doing.

408
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:29,400
That's part of this development thing that's happening in my weird family, again, that

409
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
does it.

410
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,580
And one more short story.

411
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:39,440
When I was going to elementary school, my mom sometimes would pick me up from school.

412
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:47,840
She drove an Osmobile station wagon that had the fake wood on the sides and the little

413
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,680
hood over the top of the windshield.

414
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,380
And she picked me up on this side of the street over here.

415
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,260
And then she'd look up and down and then she'd throw a big Ui to turn around and go up to

416
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,760
where our house was.

417
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:12,360
Well, one day when she turned the Ui, the door swung open and I went floating out.

418
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,840
And she turned to me and looked at me.

419
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,200
And I floated back in.

420
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,040
And then I reached over and got the door and closed it.

421
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,800
And she said, you're always going to have to close that, you know, because it can open

422
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,160
up any time you want.

423
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,080
We didn't talk about it later.

424
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,880
I didn't say, what was that floaty thing all about?

425
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
How did you do that?

426
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,440
And it was like, that wasn't up for discussion.

427
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,760
It just, things happened.

428
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,000
Wow.

429
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,040
So that's the weird family I grew up in.

430
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:59,720
And when it came time to get drafted, I'd gone to college and

431
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
everything.

432
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,000
And then finally, I got out of college and got jobs and I want to just go make a career

433
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:13,800
out of it and so forth and so on until that came, what's the expression that comes through?

434
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:20,240
And they said, greetings, you are classified 1A and we have a draft and so forth and so

435
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
on.

436
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,760
And the minute that happened, when I was going around to different department stores looking

437
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,560
for jobs, they said, and so what's your draft status?

438
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,360
Oh, they just got me in 1A here.

439
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,560
And they said, well, we can't hire you.

440
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,320
And I said, what do you mean you can't hire me?

441
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,480
He says, well, if you get a job here and say you work up a little bit in management, you

442
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:49,280
know, become a cashier and then you become a section of the store manager and then you

443
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:56,040
finally become the assistant store manager and you get drafted.

444
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,680
They have to keep that position open for you.

445
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,600
You have to be able to walk out of the army afterwards and go into that same position,

446
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,380
even if you're in the army three years or whatever.

447
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,600
So we don't hire people that are 1A.

448
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,360
And I said, well, I know how to straighten that out.

449
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,660
I walked down the street and found the recruiter and I said, I have to join the army because

450
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,960
I have to get rid of this thing hanging over my head.

451
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,840
I'm never going to get anywhere if I don't get rid of this thing.

452
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,160
And he says, well, what do you want to do?

453
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,680
And I said, well, I don't know what's there to do.

454
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,400
And he said, well, look at those brochures over there and spend some time looking at

455
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
that.

456
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,880
See if you see something there that you'd really like to do.

457
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,280
And so I went over and looked at the brochures and I saw this one, a blue one, a trifold

458
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,520
blue one, and it said Army Intelligence.

459
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,120
And I said, what about this one?

460
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
This looks really interesting.

461
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,160
Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't interview you about that.

462
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,360
That's not what I do here in the recruiter's office.

463
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,800
And I said, but this looks really interesting to me.

464
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,040
You know, I have some college behind me and speak Spanish and so forth.

465
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,080
And I, what do you mean you can't talk to me?

466
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,760
She says, he said, if you really want to know about that, I have to make an appointment

467
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,160
for you down in Los Angeles to see some agents down there.

468
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:26,080
Because they're the ones that have to decide whether they can accept you.

469
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,680
What was the brochure?

470
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:35,080
It was just a trifold brochure that said Military Intelligence and it was blue on the outside

471
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:43,440
and I opened and read it and that sounded better than being a medic or being a rifleman

472
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,880
and getting shot or anything.

473
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,560
So I said, well, let me go talk to them.

474
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:59,960
What this is all about is in my book, it says living with guidance and we define guidance.

475
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:07,120
There seems to be something moving me through my life that I'm not entirely aware of.

476
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,600
It's just like, okay, that looks okay.

477
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:18,520
Now at my age, I say, oh, that's what that was.

478
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,800
Anyway, I got into Military Intelligence.

479
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,240
What was it?

480
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,560
What was Military Intelligence?

481
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,360
No, what was the thing?

482
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
I'm sorry.

483
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
I lost.

484
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,720
What was the thing guiding you through life?

485
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,760
Oh, God.

486
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,880
If you use the word God.

487
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,640
What do you use personally?

488
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
You just use a hand's motion.

489
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,400
No, I only remember that and my wife share it back and forth because we know where it

490
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,840
comes from.

491
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,280
It means we are all one.

492
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:07,440
We are all there already and we have souls there that help us and souls that can split

493
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:15,320
and go help other people and they can be here and still helping you over there.

494
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:21,520
We are the oneness.

495
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:30,040
I went off to school and my mom has always told me, you're going to be okay, but I don't

496
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
want to go to Vietnam.

497
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,280
You're all going to be okay.

498
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,040
I go through the school, learn how to interview people and be a counterintelligence agent

499
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,600
and so forth and so on.

500
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
You like that?

501
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,120
I say so forth and so on just to fill in the blank there.

502
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,600
There's another one, this, that and the other thing.

503
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,320
When it came down and the assignments in the classes where they were graduating people

504
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:04,740
in classes out of there trying to make a lot of counterintelligence people, every other

505
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,860
class went to Vietnam and then the next class went everywhere else, Europe, around the US

506
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,860
and so forth and so on.

507
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:23,140
It was something to worry about as you were coming up to graduation and I got sent to

508
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,980
another strange place called Alabama.

509
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:33,660
My first assignment was, isn't this interesting?

510
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,980
My mom used to say, somebody's always going to take care of you.

511
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,580
Yeah, mom, whatever you say.

512
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:50,020
I went to Alabama and I know six months later Vietnam was over with.

513
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:54,580
That began, what am I going to do now?

514
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:02,780
As a corporal or a sergeant by then, I guess every now and then I got the duty of the teletype.

515
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:08,380
They didn't have other things besides teletypes at that time and so they'd call me over the

516
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,540
headquarters building and say, okay, this is your week on the teletype and learn how

517
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,620
to use it and everything.

518
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,420
Everybody here does that so we all know how to use it.

519
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,500
What that meant is I got invitations to, how would you like to go to language school?

520
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,800
How would you like to go to technical school and learn how to bug things?

521
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,740
How would you like to do this?

522
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,340
I would take the ribbon out of the teletype and say, we have a volunteer for that right

523
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:45,100
now and so that's how I created making all of those particular things for me and went

524
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:53,020
to language school and so forth and so on, went down and spent some time in Panama.

525
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,860
Let's rewind real quick.

526
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,020
So it sounds like your mom had some type of ability as well.

527
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
Yes.

528
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
Did your father?

529
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,940
Yes, but it was much more subtle.

530
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:17,380
My dad was a quiet guy and he was subtle but he was tuned in to what was going on.

531
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:27,220
He was raised as, in the religion where they don't believe about going to doctors, I don't

532
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:34,860
remember what the name of that is right now, but when he had a broken shoulder bone, his

533
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:42,100
mom tied a red ribbon around it and that was supposed to heal it up and yet he became a

534
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,180
dentist but they didn't call that a doctor.

535
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,340
I mean that's a dentist for goodness sake, that's not a doctor.

536
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:58,500
So he was very gentle about things but he was aware and I was very sensitive with him

537
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,680
and I think part of one of those things as I said, he always encouraged me to try things

538
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,060
out and he let me paint a car in the garage and all I did was hang up sheets all around

539
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,380
it and I painted the car and he said, how did it turn out?

540
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:22,940
And I said, oh it's pretty good, painted uncle's car blue, no I had a 40 Chevy and I sprayed

541
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:31,780
it taxi yellow and wrote taxi on the side of it and they didn't like that driving around

542
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:38,100
Glendale, California and finally a cop came by and he said, we want to talk to you about

543
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,780
your car and the word taxi on the side.

544
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,620
I said, yeah, what's wrong with that and he said, there is no law that says you can't

545
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:52,460
do that, there's no problem with it, however, all the people that are in the taxi business

546
00:40:52,460 --> 00:41:01,020
can't stand it because they think it downgrades their feelings about their own car and I said,

547
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,140
okay, I don't have a problem with that.

548
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,340
So I took taxi off the side and I think I sold the car for $75 to somebody or something

549
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
so.

550
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,100
Did you have brothers and sisters?

551
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Two older sisters, yes.

552
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,340
What about them?

553
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,260
They were girls.

554
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:29,740
They weren't as tuned in as I was to this whole thing but they certainly understood

555
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:38,900
it and as we got older, we'd talk about these things, they're both dead and we'd talk about

556
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:44,340
these things and them going through their deaths and I was there with them and so forth

557
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:49,540
and so on and they respected, is that an expression?

558
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,900
They respected me down.

559
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,980
They knew something was different about me.

560
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:00,220
It was four years to one sister and another four years to the other sister so I was the

561
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:08,740
youngest of the family but as we all grew older as people, there was a different arrangement

562
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:15,580
of the kinds of things Skip did and the kinds of things Sonny did and the kind of things

563
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:22,380
that Sue did and so forth and so on but yeah, they were different.

564
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,380
What was different?

565
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,020
What was different?

566
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:34,380
They liked chasing boys and ditching school and getting in trouble for it.

567
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:41,900
Did you ever hear any conversations between your parents about some of these abilities?

568
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,900
No.

569
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,980
There's a sidebar to that.

570
00:42:49,980 --> 00:43:01,460
When I got out of OCS and was on my way to go to the Pentagon because I told somebody

571
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,820
I wanted to do stuff with remote viewing because I thought it was a threat, he said we'll assign

572
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,300
you to the Pentagon and you go find it.

573
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:18,180
As a lieutenant, you'll be somebody in the Pentagon that's on the night security voice

574
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,460
and you have the access to everything and make sure people lock doors and don't leave

575
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,460
class away documents out and so forth.

576
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,620
I never actually made it there because somebody intervened.

577
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:41,300
But the story about did your parents ever ask you about things?

578
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:49,060
When I told my parents I was moving out to the east and I would be in and around Washington

579
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,420
and so forth and so on and in the Pentagon and so forth and she said, oh, well, if you're

580
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,980
moving out east, you should look up Bob Monroe and first of all, I didn't know what a Bob

581
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,980
Monroe was.

582
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:08,460
I had no idea and so my thinking in my head was, do you know how many millions of people

583
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,660
are on the east coast?

584
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:16,700
I don't know somebody named Bob Monroe and what is she talking about anyway?

585
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:22,940
And so I'm nodding to my mom, yeah, sounds like an interesting idea.

586
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,940
Who was this guy?

587
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,380
I didn't know.

588
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,640
So I drive out there and just before I left Fort Whatchuk, Arizona, which is where I was

589
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:43,380
teaching at the time, got a call from up at Fort Meade and INSCOM had just moved half

590
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:50,340
of their outfit to Fort Meade and the assignments officer called me up and said, we're changing

591
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:56,820
your orders of going to the Pentagon and I'm like, man, this guy arranged for me to

592
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:03,220
go to the Pentagon so he could help me find out about remote viewing and now these orders

593
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:10,820
have been changed and well, I guess I'll just have to forget about all that stuff called

594
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,500
remote viewing and what I wanted to do and help the intelligence community and so forth

595
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,980
and so on.

596
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:26,860
And so I got reassigned up to Fort Meade and went behind the green door, as they say.

597
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:32,440
Real quick, before we get into Fort Meade, how did you find out about remote viewing

598
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,380
through the Army and the side of Army intelligence?

599
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,220
Thank you.

600
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:47,420
I was teaching at Fort Whatchuk, Arizona and a friend of mine, Rob Cowart and I found

601
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:58,500
Putoff's book, Mind Reach, where they published all of their remote viewing studies, as much

602
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:05,180
as the CIA would let them publish that and I got a hold of that book and Rob and I would

603
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,700
Look what they say in here about this.

604
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,900
Both of us were counterintelligence specialists and doing inspections in different countries

605
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,860
and so forth and so on.

606
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,760
We don't check for this.

607
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,580
We don't see if anybody is remote viewing our Army units.

608
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,940
Ding!

609
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,100
Something happened.

610
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:34,060
And so I went to the Colonel down there just before I went to OCS and he said, well, you

611
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,740
keep your nose clean, you come on back here, Sergeant Atwater, I'll see if I can get you

612
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,860
any assignments you want.

613
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:47,460
When you come back here as a lieutenant, you be ready to tell me what you want to do.

614
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:58,060
And so, meanwhile, months ago, Rob Cowart and I were talking about this book from Putoff

615
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:06,180
and we were like, we're counterintelligence specialists and we're not doing anything about

616
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,180
this.

617
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,020
We're not climbing in people's attics or whatever we do.

618
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:21,260
So when I got back as a lieutenant, I went into Colonel's office and he said, well, Lieutenant,

619
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,820
you're coming to me to tell me where you want to get assigned and I said, well, sir, it's

620
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,620
a little bit different than that.

621
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,260
He said, well, what's that?

622
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:34,860
And I said, there's a book here by some scientists called MindReach out at Stanford Research

623
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:40,900
Institute and they're studying something called remote viewing and he said, well, what's that?

624
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,780
I said, that's why I'm bringing you this book, sir.

625
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:50,620
I think this is very dangerous and a threat to the counterintelligence work we do.

626
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:55,300
And he said, well, leave the book with me, Lieutenant, and come on back tomorrow and

627
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,540
we'll talk about this.

628
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,260
Come back tomorrow and he said, Lieutenant, I think you're right.

629
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:08,340
And that's when he reassigned me to the Pentagon, which I never got to.

630
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:13,820
So that's the beginning of it, of how I got into remote viewing.

631
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:18,540
Started back at Fort Huachuca with Rob Cowart deciding this isn't right.

632
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,900
We should be doing something.

633
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,860
This is our job to watch this.

634
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:31,380
And then things switched back and forth from the idea of not getting to the Pentagon.

635
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:36,180
That wasn't the place I should be because arrangements were made.

636
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:48,620
And wound up at Fort Meade behind the green door and I was given a room behind the green

637
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:54,580
door after I passed all my security clearance and everything, and dug through the safes

638
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,780
in the room and I reached down into this one, picked it up.

639
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:05,780
Those are three classified documents on remote viewing.

640
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,100
Wait a minute.

641
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:11,380
I thought all this remote viewing stuff was done since I didn't go to the Pentagon like

642
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,380
it was planned that I was going to go do that.

643
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,520
What is this stuff anyway?

644
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,340
So I read through it.

645
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:25,540
Major Keenan, my boss then, was down the hallway and I came out and said, what is it, Lieutenant?

646
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:30,820
I wasn't the regular lieutenant because I'd been in the Army 10 years as an enlisted man.

647
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,620
So they had a little more respect for me.

648
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:43,420
And I took these in and I said, sir, I found these three documents here and they're all

649
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,420
about remote viewing.

650
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,820
And he said, oh yeah, Lieutenant Colonel Skotsko was over there and he was very interested

651
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,820
in that.

652
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,900
General Thompson was the one that was looking after that.

653
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,460
What was that all about?

654
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:06,100
And General Thompson, and this story becomes Major General Thompson later, and there's

655
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:14,200
a term in the military called getting a grandfather, meaning there's somebody who's going to take

656
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,880
care of you, make sure you do the right thing.

657
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:24,840
Turns out General Thompson was my grandfather because Keenan, Major Keenan, who I went to

658
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,400
with these documents, knew General Thompson.

659
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,200
And he said, I've got a guy in here that knows about this, what's his name, Atwater?

660
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,120
He said, you let Atwater do whatever he wants to do.

661
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,800
And I didn't know that was happening.

662
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,800
Interesting.

663
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:50,360
I knew General Thompson, knew Kit Green and the CIA, and they'd been working together

664
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,800
and he knew all about this stuff that the CIA was doing.

665
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:02,680
So General Thompson had his finger on me through Major Keenan, and he said, well, what should

666
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,680
we do about this?

667
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,360
Well, we should recruit some people to do this, and how are you going to do that, Lieutenant?

668
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:15,560
Well, I think we ought to interview some people that have security clearances so that they

669
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,920
can do the kind of work we do at looking at the counterintelligence problem.

670
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:27,960
That was the beginning, before it was called Stargate, that was the beginning of doing

671
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,640
this and working through this situation to get these people trained.

672
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,580
Wow, very interesting.

673
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:41,180
So how did you guys...

674
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,180
Where did you start?

675
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:45,060
I mean, a lot of people have security clearances.

676
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:50,700
There's a lot of people in the intelligence world.

677
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,700
It sounds out there.

678
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,700
It is what it is.

679
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:10,580
First, what we decided to do, my south Major Keenan got another officer in and was going

680
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:16,400
to be my boss because I was just a lieutenant and we needed somebody that was a lieutenant

681
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:24,000
colonel to do this, and someone who'd been around in SCOM so that he could go talk to

682
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,000
Keenan, but he wanted and had lots of clearances and stuff.

683
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,900
And so he was going to be my boss and I was going to be the remote viewing expert, which

684
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,380
I had to invent, but that's okay.

685
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:43,860
And we decided that we should survey the people around the greater Washington, D.C. area that

686
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:48,300
were in INSCOM, and we thought, well, they have to be assignable.

687
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:56,560
There's a lot of people in the Army that say, I need to do this job now so I can get promoted

688
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,720
then and I need to do that job here and we need to do that job there.

689
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:05,880
And they build up a career pattern of jobs that they have to work out promotion.

690
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,500
We had to find somebody that didn't think that way.

691
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:20,440
So we looked at a pool of about 200 people around the greater Washington, D.C. area that

692
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:25,380
were Army people and civilians, male, female.

693
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:32,380
And we took newspaper clippings that talked about people who had a near-death experience

694
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:41,460
and people who had this happen to them, newspaper-type reporting of psychic stuff.

695
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:49,220
And we'd take it to them and say, the boss has asked us to come around and see whether

696
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:56,920
or not people would think some of these people could help us in the Army some way.

697
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:02,460
If they can do what they say, maybe they could help us in the Army some way.

698
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:14,460
And we would both ask questions, my major and myself, that time just a lieutenant, and

699
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:22,460
we would, this one would ask and then this one would ask and we'd see if they would agree

700
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:27,080
and then we would say, well, let's talk to them a little bit further.

701
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:35,620
And then when we finished that process, we told SRI what we're doing and they made an

702
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:46,000
arrangement to do an exposure of these people and we were going to pick three people.

703
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,160
And I tried to use the word to train, he said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, we don't train people.

704
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,200
We evaluate people, but we don't train people.

705
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Okay.

706
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:03,560
Don't use the word train when you talk to Stanford Research Institute.

707
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,880
That's what I learned as a little lieutenant.

708
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,880
And so I said, so for our orientation, we want to do three people.

709
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:17,720
And meanwhile, we recruited these people by the method I told you of showing them the

710
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,400
newspapers and some of them weren't the right people.

711
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:34,800
And when we told them we had six people selected that, it was like six or eight at that time

712
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,640
that we brought in, they didn't all stay.

713
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:43,400
They said, well, I thought I wanted to do this, but my wife wants to move and I can't

714
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,400
do it.

715
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:51,200
And so I put off and Targ heard about it and they said, well, we want to interview them.

716
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,780
We don't want you to select which ones we want to do the interview with them to see

717
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,700
if they're suitable for our evaluation.

718
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:07,280
So they came to Fort Meade and we brought all these people in and put off and Targ and

719
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,520
talk to them about it and like the people and shook their hands and everything.

720
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:20,320
And then we went out to lunch, but often Targ and Scotty Watt and me went out to lunch and

721
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:24,320
they were whispering at each other and whispering at each other.

722
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:33,320
And finally, Buddha said, well, I don't think we want to take three people.

723
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,720
He says, I want those six guys.

724
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:43,220
Well, how about the agreement we had on how much money we had to pay you to evaluate the

725
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,220
three people?

726
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,520
He says, we'll do it for the same price.

727
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,560
Those people sound good to us and we'll deal with them.

728
00:56:51,560 --> 00:57:00,040
So they eventually took the six people out there and then later on found the best three

729
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:06,440
of those and had the three of them go back again, for example, Joe McMonigle.

730
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:15,440
What are some of the evaluations that you guys were conducting to find the best candidates?

731
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:22,480
Okay, there's SRI situation, we'll continue with that and what they did.

732
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:31,000
What they did is they had people, somebody would drive away from SRI and then someone

733
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,680
would sit back at SRI and get interviewed and say, describe to me where Dr. Pradhas

734
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:44,640
gone and then later they would bring that back and they would have, this is the true

735
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,080
place he was and then there were six, one out of six.

736
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:57,080
And so they scored them, another person, a judge would look at what the remote viewer

737
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,080
tried.

738
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:04,080
I can't make 10 into six, can I?

739
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:12,720
And he would score them, no, it's not that one, this wasn't the racetrack.

740
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:20,040
It might be that one, that's kind of a museum like thing and so they would rate these things.

741
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:34,480
And they got 80% correct matches, for example, on Joe McMonigle, no, it was on the six altogether,

742
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:41,240
meaning that the judge who didn't know where they'd gone or what was the actual thing about

743
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:49,240
and that is how we scored and decided who we were going to choose and chose the ones

744
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,920
that had the best to start out.

745
00:58:52,920 --> 00:59:01,600
Were any of these people, were any of these six people surprised that they were chosen?

746
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:07,040
Were they, I mean, how do I describe this?

747
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:16,640
Was anybody surprised at the program and surprised in the reasons you're evaluating them for?

748
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:24,880
No, they already signed up for the program when they came in and they signed secret certificates

749
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,240
that don't tell anybody about this.

750
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:34,640
Your boss doesn't know what you're doing, but he knows that the boss tells him he has

751
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,480
to go to Fort Meade today to do something and he's doing it for me.

752
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:48,200
So, they were on board with the program and they heard about going out to SRI and we had

753
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:54,380
those classified documents, for example, and they looked at those and they were interested

754
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,520
in going out there and doing that.

755
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:03,820
What was in the classified documents?

756
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:08,780
There were a couple of them on Project ScanAid.

757
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:16,980
They were things that had been done before, things that the Soviets were doing and was

758
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:23,500
the first beginning published evidence that, not the stuff that the CIA knew, but it was

759
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:29,180
the beginning of Department of Defense stuff that was published that they had been looking

760
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:37,020
at lots of people around the world that are doing this thing and why aren't we doing this?

761
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:45,100
Do you know how we found out other intelligence agencies and countries were doing this?

762
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,340
Spies.

763
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:53,620
Who was the first one to adopt us?

764
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,800
I don't know the answer to that.

765
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:01,880
I don't know the answer to that and I probably would have to say I can neither confirm nor

766
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:06,640
deny if I knew.

767
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:13,480
I'm the lieutenant that discovered the scuff and the safe, went and talked to Dale Graff

768
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,560
and so forth and so on.

769
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:22,080
What were they, can you tell me what they were remote viewing inside the US?

770
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:29,280
I don't know that, but it grew into something else.

771
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,680
I mean Joe's gone over there and been with the Russians and talked to them and played

772
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:39,680
with them and they played with him and so forth.

773
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:50,280
So six guys, six people you guys took in, what happens then?

774
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:58,040
After they finished this evaluation, we had started working at Fort Meade with doing little

775
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,920
outbounder things and practicing and so forth and so on of what was going on.

776
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:09,640
So Scotty Watt would drive out in a car to someplace and then I'd sit over in the operations

777
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:16,980
building and interview them about, describe where Scotty is now and they would sometimes

778
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:22,300
get hits and sometimes not get hits, which was good for Scotty because when they'd get

779
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:28,460
a hit he would say, I wasn't so sure this stuff worked, but I was the one that went

780
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:35,500
out there and they described the tower I was on and it was fun for him.

781
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:42,380
I'll bet that would be a very unique experience.

782
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:51,780
So I just want to tell you, we were working with the people and some of them came and

783
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:56,960
lived in our offices there at Fort Meade and others would come from some place and we'd

784
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,840
make an appointment for them to come.

785
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:08,480
One of those was Joe McGonigal, he was working down in the Washington area and we'd say,

786
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,460
can you come up on Tuesday and Friday?

787
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:18,140
And so he would say, well, if you arrange for my boss to tell me where I have to be.

788
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:24,540
And so he was part of that same thing, testing it out for himself and us testing how to run

789
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:28,980
this thing.

790
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:35,940
And three others, SRI wanted them back and they had some things that they wanted to try

791
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,940
out.

792
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,740
Can you read with a remote viewing?

793
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,100
How about if this happens or how about if that happens?

794
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,820
What about if it's underwater?

795
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,900
Would underwater stop it?

796
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:53,100
And none of those things mattered.

797
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,100
Interesting.

798
01:03:55,100 --> 01:04:00,540
And distance and everything.

799
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:10,940
One of the interesting things that happened as time passed, that price was remote viewing

800
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:14,000
for them at SRI.

801
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:22,080
And he had one target that he talked about, which was water tanks and there's tall tanks

802
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:33,080
and there's two water pools down here and it's a sewage processing plant.

803
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:41,920
And so when they went down to look at the sewage processing plant, hopefully so the

804
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,920
remote viewer could learn things he missed, well, how come you didn't talk about the Red

805
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,840
Building or whatever?

806
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:57,880
Turns out that it was a swimming pool and it was like, well, you did get the water and

807
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:04,560
but there's these big towers of the sewage processing plant, so forth and so on.

808
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,760
No space, no time.

809
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:20,000
75 years later, long after Pat Price himself died, the Menlo Park local government published

810
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,080
a book of all the things that had been going on for years and years and years.

811
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:34,260
And Russell Targ got ahold of one and opened it up and he was like, 75 years ago, that

812
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:42,300
was not a swimming pool, but a sewage processing plant.

813
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:45,460
And there was the pictures of the towers and everything.

814
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:51,460
And so they started thinking about this differently.

815
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:56,020
First they were like, oh, that remote viewing was 20 blocks away.

816
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,380
That remote viewing was when you went on vacation.

817
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:02,340
That remote viewing was 3000 miles away.

818
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:14,380
And then this thing came up and it was remote viewing is outside of time.

819
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:25,420
Pat Price never knew because he died, 75, that that was a sewage treatment plant.

820
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,420
Wow.

821
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:33,220
So it was an awakening to the scientists to say, there's something more here that's going

822
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:37,300
on than what we think we're doing at SRI.

823
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,340
Very, very interesting.

824
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:43,660
I mean, what is time then?

825
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,660
What is it?

826
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:50,740
It's that word that just came out of your mouth.

827
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,420
What is it?

828
01:06:54,420 --> 01:07:04,100
It's a thing that we have invented to organize our lives on earth.

829
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:08,460
My cat doesn't know time and the birds don't know time, except when the weather changes

830
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:11,460
they're supposed to fly south and so forth and so on.

831
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,460
But they don't think of time.

832
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:25,540
And if I knew more about the history of cultures, different societies over time that have come

833
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:31,380
up over the hundreds and thousands of years, they probably have lots of differences.

834
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:37,900
I imagine weather and when you plant things and when you harvest things is a much more

835
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:42,300
crude kind of interface with that.

836
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:47,740
And you're not so concerned about, let's see, it's about.

837
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,700
So that's a really good question.

838
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,900
What is time?

839
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,700
And my answer is, well, it depends.

840
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:04,020
Who is keeping track of something and decides to say, you know, that's spaced out this way.

841
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:08,500
The seasons of the year, except if you live at the North Pole and the South Pole, they're

842
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:13,180
pretty much always the same season, you know, kind of thing.

843
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:19,300
But it sounds like humans are the ones that are more concerned about time.

844
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:23,180
OK.

845
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:29,460
Let's talk about some of your career in remote viewing.

846
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,900
Right.

847
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:39,340
I am not a remote viewer.

848
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:47,940
I was the guy who taught other people how to do this thing called remote viewing and

849
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:53,700
used my education in psychology to understand how people behave and how to reward them and

850
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,980
encourage them and so forth.

851
01:08:56,980 --> 01:09:05,420
But I am not, by the definition of what a remote viewer is, I'm not a remote viewer.

852
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:07,380
But you do have abilities.

853
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,380
Yes.

854
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:16,860
But I don't generally, and I wouldn't say those remote view, my abilities are remote

855
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,380
viewing.

856
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:24,700
And I generally try to stay away from that topic because I want to present myself, this

857
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,220
is the way it was done.

858
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:28,820
This is the way it was monitored.

859
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:36,460
This is the way that it was validated, given to the Pentagon, these answers and this much

860
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:39,500
was right that they told us about.

861
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:48,820
I like playing that role as opposed to I do remote viewing too.

862
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:52,620
Interesting, understandable as well.

863
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:57,580
How was Joe when you met him?

864
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:03,860
Joe was kind of a complainer about, I can never get this right and they're not promoting

865
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:07,740
me fast enough and they should do this and they should do that.

866
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:13,460
And that was bitching was his forte.

867
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:26,460
Have a marriage that was breaking up, boy could he remote view.

868
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:31,620
So I loved Joe, I mean I really loved that.

869
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:37,580
He made the day, he would tell me things and I'd be sitting there, how in the world did

870
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:38,580
he know that?

871
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:48,460
All I did was from Major Watt across the way he said, okay well here's what we're going

872
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:49,660
to start on today.

873
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:56,660
So one of the things we did was, not always, but one of the things we did is I wouldn't

874
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:01,420
know what the target was and it might be in an envelope or it might be a coordinate or

875
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,420
whatever.

876
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:06,980
And I would take it over to Joe, so I don't know.

877
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:12,780
Most of the time, I don't know, and Joe didn't know either.

878
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:16,860
And then I would take it back after doing one short session, you know, Joe would say,

879
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:23,620
well this is a cold area and there's, this is really cold, there's snow on the ground

880
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:30,300
and it's northern somewhere, but it's a industrial area.

881
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:35,020
There are smokestacks there and there are many buildings and so forth and so on.

882
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,620
So I'd stop.

883
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,300
That would be the end of the session.

884
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:44,380
I hadn't sketched some stuff and I'd go over to Scotty Watt and I'd say, sir, this is what

885
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,340
we got today.

886
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:51,620
And he'd open it up and he'd say, schedule your second session, because he could tell

887
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:59,940
me you're on track, there's something going on here.

888
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,900
So it's an interesting situation.

889
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,460
I have to diverge a little bit.

890
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:10,540
So we're talking about, oh, it's coordinates you use, oh, it's a picture you use, oh, well

891
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:14,340
let me say you can't use coordinates anymore, you got to scramble the numbers and make up

892
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,700
a number and say that's the number.

893
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:17,700
Still works.

894
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,700
And how about this?

895
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,660
And how about that?

896
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:28,020
What I really think right now, maybe tomorrow will be something else, but there was a trust

897
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,020
between Joe and I.

898
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:34,660
When he and I were in that room, I didn't fool around with him.

899
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:45,180
He knew that I knew the questions that the Pentagon needed to know.

900
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:50,700
So I'd say, Joe, do you want to hold the envelope, Joe, do you want to hear the coordinates?

901
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:56,020
No, because over the years there was a trust buildup.

902
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:01,060
I'm in that room with him to do one thing and that's answer some questions from the

903
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,060
Pentagon.

904
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:05,860
What kind of questions was the Pentagon interested in?

905
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:11,340
Oh, lots of different things.

906
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:20,860
Can you tell us, we've watched in Europe as the Soviets are moving their tanks forward,

907
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:24,400
like they're going to go past the folder gap and so forth and so on.

908
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:32,440
When you ask where this is right now, and Joe would be able to say, well, yes, I see

909
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,880
them moving, but they're all parked in garages.

910
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,440
And so they would fly another satellite over, yeah, they're all parked in garages.

911
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,800
I don't think we have anything to worry about.

912
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,840
There were many, many things that the Pentagon wanted to know.

913
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:53,560
Somebody would have a particular problem that they're trying to resolve.

914
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,720
Is it this?

915
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,720
Is it that?

916
01:13:55,720 --> 01:14:03,400
I mean, you saw some of those things in a third eye video about things that they were

917
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:08,680
asked and our satellites, it would go over every now and then.

918
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,320
And then they said, we never knew that was there.

919
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:19,760
Or remote viewer told it was kind of a thing.

920
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,240
That grew too.

921
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,880
Because of Scotty Watt, Scotty Watt knew a lot of people and he could go to the Pentagon

922
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,920
and go out to lunch with a guy and play golf with a guy and everything.

923
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:37,000
And got to know that you could tell Scotty something that you needed to know and he would

924
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
bring home the envelope, hand it to me and I'd do sessions with people and then we'd

925
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,240
send it back to him.

926
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:50,240
So that built up for a while.

927
01:14:54,240 --> 01:15:00,240
Let's take a quick break and when we come back we'll get into Project 8200.

928
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,240
Okay, that's great.

929
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,240
Perfect.

930
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:10,240

Thank you.

940
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:24,240
Alright Skip, we're back from the break and right before we left we're getting ready to

941
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:31,240
get into Project 8200 but you had mentioned an important point that you wanted to bring

942
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:39,240
up about how the remote viewer knows what to focus on it sounded like in the middle

943
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:42,240
of their journey or experience.

944
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,240
What do you call it?

945
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,240
Yes.

946
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,240
Is it an experience?

947
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:54,240
I think it's the only words we can use for it in our mind, in our vocabulary I think

948
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:58,240
is probably an experience.

949
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,240
I don't think intellectually they think they're going anywhere.

950
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:08,240
They know they're sitting in the room with me but they're having an experience in some

951
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,240
way.

952
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,240
Okay.

953
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,240
Now they sometimes may describe, well I'm going to go over there now and I'm going to

954
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:18,240
look at that but we shouldn't take that too strongly, they're still sitting there next

955
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,240
to you.

956
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,240
Okay.

957
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:33,240
Did you see that video about three eye spies or whatever that was, third eye spies?

958
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,240
I did not.

959
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:40,240
So that's perfectly okay but it has to do with the way I would tell a story because

960
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:44,240
otherwise I would say these things and you would say oh yeah but you're not going to

961
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,240
do that.

962
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,240
Okay.

963
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,240
Excellent.

964
01:17:47,240 --> 01:18:02,240
So I discovered recently something that I had not given a great deal of thought about

965
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:10,240
and I've been in this business a long time and I was like whoa, this means something.

966
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:15,240
Regardless of what happened, this means something.

967
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:23,240
So the background to this is that in the days of put off and target Stanford Research Institute,

968
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:31,240
they obviously had a contract with CIA and Kit Green was the guy in CIA who was kind

969
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:37,240
of watching them and was in charge of what they did and then he would take the results

970
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:46,240
that they would get in their evaluating and testing and studying under protocol this idea

971
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:54,240
of remote viewing and he would take and show some of the results to his people at the CIA

972
01:18:54,240 --> 01:19:06,240
and they started to think, both Kit Green and other people at CIA was starting to think

973
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:13,240
how do we know that they're sticking with protocol and how do we know that they don't

974
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:20,240
that they don't have some other access to the targets that their remote viewers are

975
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,240
getting.

976
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:32,240
So he decided he was, him, Kit Green was going to come up with something that would prove

977
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:38,240
to the other people that were questioning him, you know this stuff is garbage, it doesn't

978
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,240
work, it doesn't make any sense to us.

979
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,240
And he keeps telling them about it and everything.

980
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:49,240
So he decided what he was going to do is he was going to go to another friend of his in

981
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:59,240
the CIA and go to him and say, I want you to give me a set of coordinates, geographic

982
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:05,240
coordinates, that I have no knowledge of it, I know nothing about it, I don't know what

983
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:14,240
And he said okay and he gave him the coordinates and he said, so I don't know what this is,

984
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:20,240
that means nothing to me, I don't recognize it as being the Eiffel Tower or anything and

985
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:25,240
he says, that's right, you won't know what this is.

986
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:34,240
So he passes that out to SRI and SRI comes back with this, it's a very elaborate description

987
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:44,240
of this place, he says it's very secret and guards and fences around it and I went inside

988
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:54,240
and I looked through safes and on the wall this was written and opened up the safes and

989
01:20:54,240 --> 01:21:06,240
read what the words and names of the files were and end of session.

990
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:15,240
And so when he gets that back from SRI he takes it over to his friend whose name, by

991
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:22,240
the way, was Dave in the CIA at that time and he started laughing, he says, this nonsense

992
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:28,240
that you're doing kid is just nonsense, it's ridiculous and he said, what do you mean?

993
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:34,240
He said, I built a cabin last year and fixed it and I gave you the coordinates to the cabin

994
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:44,240
and he went to his other friends and said, this is what SRI told me and they're all like,

995
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:53,240
you got to be kidding and he says, no, this is, yes, he says, that's a real place and

996
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:58,240
nobody knows about it.

997
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:06,240
So he got in his car and he drove physically to the coordinates up in the mountains, found

998
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:10,240
this guy's cabin and said, what is going on here?

999
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:20,240
This makes no sense at all and he turned around and went down a hundred yards down the road

1000
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:29,240
and there was a well cut, well groomed road and he turned up there and came over a ridge

1001
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,240
and there was Sugar Grove.

1002
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:43,240
It was in the late 60s and 70s, the Navy's installation for monitoring Soviet satellites.

1003
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,240
Interesting.

1004
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,240
Which actually physically doesn't exist anymore.

1005
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:54,240
Never mind, that wasn't ever there, but we have pictures of it and you can look up Sugar

1006
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,240
Grove online.

1007
01:22:55,240 --> 01:23:00,240
So I need to try to add here.

1008
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:09,240
When he went in, he said everything had to do with the names on things and the files

1009
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:13,240
and so forth had to do with playing pool.

1010
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:17,240
There was a cue ball and an eyeball and an eight ball and this and different kinds of

1011
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,240
shots and everything.

1012
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:29,240
And when he showed that to his other CIA friends, he said all those are top secret classified

1013
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:34,240
LEMDIS names.

1014
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:41,240
Those are real names of a real project of Sugar Grove.

1015
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:46,240
And it was like, how did that happen?

1016
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:53,240
Well, because he had given, this is where it twists up a little bit, but I'll get back

1017
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,240
to it straight.

1018
01:23:54,240 --> 01:24:04,240
He had given that to SRI and it was expecting that either Halle Hammett or Ingo Swann would

1019
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:10,240
do the job and they were going to look at it with one person and so forth and so on.

1020
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,240
Turns out the Pat Price was hanging around.

1021
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,240
He said, you guys got something going on here?

1022
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,240
Here, I'll help.

1023
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:20,240
And he was that kind of a guy.

1024
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:28,240
And it was Pat Price's work that wound up at Sugar Grove and read those names that were

1025
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:36,240
top secret password names for everything that that Navy installation did.

1026
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:41,240
And they immediately showed up in Kit Green's office, angry and mad.

1027
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,240
And what did you do?

1028
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,240
We're going to have to investigate this.

1029
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:49,240
There's a leak in your department here and this and that and the other thing.

1030
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,240
And he said, SRI did it.

1031
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,240
I'm in California.

1032
01:24:54,240 --> 01:25:07,240
And then as sort of a joke and an enthusiasm when put off describes this thing going on,

1033
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:12,240
he says, I'm trying to remember exactly what he says.

1034
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:21,240
Every law enforcement person in California showed up at SRI because they were really angry

1035
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,240
about all this information leaking out.

1036
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:29,240
Well, the point of this whole thing is all that stuff happened.

1037
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,240
It's very well documented.

1038
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:43,240
And what is it that when here was the target assigned by the coordinate and over here was

1039
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:51,240
Sugar Grove, when he got sent here, supposedly, here's your coordinates, describe what's

1040
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:58,240
there and, you know, put off into harder trying to do their best and get good protocols and

1041
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,240
everything.

1042
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:05,240
And it's a boring I'm going to make up some words because I don't know what to say.

1043
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,240
It's boring.

1044
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:11,240
But they say, I wonder what the hell that is over there.

1045
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:17,240
And so Pat Price goes over here and finds Sugar Grove.

1046
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:26,240
So I started thinking about this situation in remote viewing and everywhere, every when.

1047
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:30,240
How do you know that that is a thing of interest?

1048
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:37,240
What is it that attracts you to that as opposed to following the rules?

1049
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:40,240
I want you to describe that cabin in the forest.

1050
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,240
That's what your job is.

1051
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,240
Here are your coordinates.

1052
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:53,240
And yet he goes to Sugar Grove and pretty much scares the bejesus about CIA and the Navy

1053
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,240
at that point in time.

1054
01:26:55,240 --> 01:27:01,240
So I started thinking about that in terms of all the remote viewing I've done and many

1055
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:06,240
others.

1056
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:17,240
If the theory of quantum nonlocality is true that there is no time and there is no space.

1057
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,240
What is that next?

1058
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:24,240
I'm using this skull of mine, which makes no sense, but it's a good graphic.

1059
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:33,240
What is the next twist to that that gets the remote viewer to describe that interesting

1060
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:37,240
thing?

1061
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:42,240
And how many times has that happened in the hundreds of thousands of remote viewings that

1062
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:45,240
are going on in the world?

1063
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:48,240
And somebody says, that doesn't make sense.

1064
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:50,240
We asked you to do such and such.

1065
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:53,240
And you did so and so.

1066
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,240
Did they give any thought to, why in the heck did he do so and so?

1067
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,240
He usually does really good work.

1068
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:02,240
Why did he describe that?

1069
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,240
I'm still chewing on that.

1070
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:15,240
This is less than a month in my head about this particular interesting thing.

1071
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:21,240
How does that happen?

1072
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:31,240
When you wanted to go over to Project 8200, how did Pat Price go and look at those things?

1073
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,240
Nobody told him to go look at that.

1074
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:38,240
He just was that kind of a guy that was attracted to go look at those things.

1075
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:43,240
He says when you talk to him, we used to have policemen down in Burbank.

1076
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:49,240
He said, oh, the detectives would come in and they would say this, that, and everything.

1077
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:58,240
And he said, I'd kind of roll my head back and say, well, you know, you really ought to check out this.

1078
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:01,240
You didn't tell me you guys checked on that.

1079
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,240
He said, OK.

1080
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:08,240
And he said he'd be unusually right about those every now and then.

1081
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:15,240
And so he kept headed in that direction.

1082
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:30,240
This Project 8200 thing was something that I did because Pat Price walked into SRI and his normal working there in the early 70s,

1083
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:36,240
having come up from originally down in Burbank.

1084
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,240
He then lived in Northern California.

1085
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:46,240
But he would come down to do sessions because Pudoff and Targ checked him out.

1086
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,240
And so he would go in and he would do things.

1087
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:57,240
But they had to control him because he was a gregarious wild cat.

1088
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:04,240
He was just uncontrollable in terms of what he would do.

1089
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:11,240
And he came in on Pudoff's desk.

1090
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,240
He said, you might be interested in this.

1091
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:21,240
I've been interested in this for a while and I've found four UFO bases around the globe.

1092
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:24,240
And so you really ought to look at it.

1093
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,240
Four UFO bases.

1094
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,240
Yes.

1095
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:30,240
And this just came in just completely random one day.

1096
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:33,240
And Pat comes in and there it is.

1097
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:36,240
Four UFO bases around the world.

1098
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,240
Where were they?

1099
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,240
Or where are they?

1100
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,240
Yes.

1101
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,240
They're still there.

1102
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:45,240
This all happened 50 years ago.

1103
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:49,240
A little bit more than that now.

1104
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:56,240
Mount Inyan, Ghana, which is a country in Africa, isolated country.

1105
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:00,240
Mount Hayes is up in Australia.

1106
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:05,240
Mount Perdido is on the border of Spain and France.

1107
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:12,240
And then there's one in Australia, which I can't quite remember the name of that up in Australia.

1108
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,240
Hayes is in Alaska, correct?

1109
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,240
Hayes is in Alaska, yes.

1110
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:19,240
Zeal, I think, might be the one down in Australia.

1111
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:25,240
So this was an interesting problem for Pudoff to deal with.

1112
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:38,240
He says, yeah, actually, you know, we're watching Pat in our program here and testing and evaluating our program here at SRI.

1113
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,240
These look interesting.

1114
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:45,240
What is it about this that, you know, pulls me to it?

1115
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:59,240
So it turns out that he calls up a friend of his called Ken Kress and says, I'm sorry, Kit Green, and calls Kit Green.

1116
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:05,240
And they're friends from a long time ago when they were junior officers.

1117
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:11,240
Now, he's, Kit Green is in the CIA.

1118
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:21,240
He went that way and Pudoff went into being a research scientist, but they're really good friends.

1119
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:28,240
So he calls up Kit and says, could you do me a favor?

1120
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,240
And what's that?

1121
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:34,240
Well, I was wondering how things are going down in Australia.

1122
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:39,240
Do you know who the case officer is down in Australia, the station chief or whatever you call him?

1123
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:42,240
And he says, oh, yeah.

1124
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:51,240
He said, well, I'm just kind of interested in what things are like in Australia now.

1125
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,240
I'd like to maybe go down there someday.

1126
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:56,240
And so he says, well, let me give him a call.

1127
01:32:56,240 --> 01:33:02,240
And so a couple of days later, he calls back and says, yeah, I talked to the station chief down there.

1128
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,240
And he said, they really like it.

1129
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:08,240
They get along with the Australians just fine.

1130
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:12,240
They share things and work together on things.

1131
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,240
And I really like it here, too.

1132
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,240
I hope I don't get reassigned or anything.

1133
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,240
Well, there is that one thing.

1134
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,240
It's all those UFOs up north.

1135
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:25,240
And Pudoff is like, oh, well, that's kind of an interesting thing.

1136
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:27,240
But otherwise, you really like it down there.

1137
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:30,240
And Pudoff wasn't going to say anything.

1138
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,240
He says, you know, we ought to get together next time you're back on the stage here.

1139
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,240
We'll go out and have a beer again.

1140
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:39,240
Remember how a good time we had when we were young officers together?

1141
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,240
He said, yeah, let's do that.

1142
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,240
Let's get together again.

1143
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:58,240
And so then Pudoff had had those on his desk and told Pat, don't ever do this again.

1144
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:01,240
Go get working, not to do things alone.

1145
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:03,240
You have to follow protocol.

1146
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:09,240
We're being paid by an outside agency, and we have to follow our protocol,

1147
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,240
else we'll get fired.

1148
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:14,240
So you need to not ever do this again.

1149
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:20,240
Only do the things that Targ is working with you in the interview room next door.

1150
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:25,240
You do what things we're telling you to do so that we're in control

1151
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:30,240
and we can tell the CIA what we're doing.

1152
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:36,240
You know, that's a very interesting demand considering it's all done in your brain.

1153
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:41,240
That's telling you, I mean, essentially the same thing is telling you,

1154
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,240
don't think about these things.

1155
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:44,240
I'm your boss.

1156
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:47,240
I tell you what to think and how to think.

1157
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:49,240
How did Pat respond to that?

1158
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:57,240
Well, I don't think I know the answer to that question, but he shrugged his shoulders

1159
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:05,240
and I'm sure because of the maverick that he was, he didn't much care about what he said.

1160
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,240
Probably motivated him to do more.

1161
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,240
Right, who knows?

1162
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,240
My kind of guy.

1163
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:20,240
So anyway, Pudoff keeps it in the drawer and then he waits

1164
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:25,240
because this is a big hullabaloo and people whispering to other people in the office

1165
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:29,240
and all of that, and so he waits and he waits and he waits.

1166
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:34,240
Meanwhile, Pudoff and I are becoming good friends.

1167
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:40,240
He, you know, I would go out there and check on the training and check on this and everything

1168
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:43,240
and they'd always take me out to dinner and do this and do this.

1169
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:46,240
And finally I said, you don't have to do this.

1170
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,240
I'm with you guys, you know.

1171
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,240
I know I sign your checks now.

1172
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:55,240
That's what I'm doing for a while because my boss left and now I'm the boss of you.

1173
01:35:55,240 --> 01:36:02,240
I forget what you call that when you're the person, case control officer.

1174
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,240
I don't know.

1175
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:09,240
Anyways, so we became more friends after a while and could visit and talk about things

1176
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:14,240
without him doing his job of taking care of the guy that came from Washington

1177
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:18,240
and making sure we take care of that guy because he's the guy who bays us.

1178
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:21,240
I said, don't do that.

1179
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:27,240
And time passed and he called me.

1180
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:33,240
I have a different program that I run back at Fort Meade,

1181
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:36,240
which I think I've explained in some of the papers I sent.

1182
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:41,240
What I said is if you're not doing something because you're at war

1183
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:46,240
or having some thing you have to do, you're practicing on that.

1184
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:53,240
You're doing mock things that keep you in good training.

1185
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,240
You don't just lay around on the ground.

1186
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,240
You do PT and you do all those sorts of things.

1187
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:03,240
So I had what I called a challenge program that I did when I had remote viewers

1188
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:07,240
that weren't too busy and they didn't have something immediately to do.

1189
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:11,240
I would come up with challenge targets,

1190
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:16,240
like send them to a very confusing museum that went around the circle like that

1191
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:22,240
and see if they could figure that out because you'd be looking at this direction,

1192
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,240
then you turn around and look that direction,

1193
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:30,240
and it would pass 50 years in time because you're supposed to walk through the museum

1194
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:32,240
and look at the things.

1195
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:36,240
So those were challenge-type targets that I did, several different kinds.

1196
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:42,240
So I took...

1197
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:51,240
Putoff gave me all of Pat Price's transcripts on the things.

1198
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:58,240
He said, do you think you could use this in a challenge target training?

1199
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:01,240
I didn't need the Pentagon to tell me to do it.

1200
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:07,240
I was the operations and training officer, and that's what I did, operations and training.

1201
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:11,240
On the training side, it was challenge targets.

1202
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:24,240
So I worked up a set of plans for taking the transcript

1203
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:35,240
and creating the names of the mountains where these underground UFO bases were

1204
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:41,240
and then did a series of challenge targets,

1205
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:48,240
four of them with Joe who does an ERV thing, he just lays down and talks.

1206
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:51,240
The other people trained by Ingo Swann,

1207
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:57,240
and they have this very complicated structure to do their remote viewing.

1208
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:02,240
And so I had six of those, I think maybe five.

1209
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:05,240
And then we had a couple of people who kind of did their own thing.

1210
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:12,240
And this was 10 years after, that's why I call it Project 8200,

1211
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:16,240
because it was 1973 when Pat Price did this.

1212
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:22,240
And then Putoff gave me the material here after, in his opinion, things quieted down out there.

1213
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,240
And people weren't talking about this anymore.

1214
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:30,240
So he handed me these and see if I would run challenge targets on them.

1215
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:40,240
And so the Project 8200 is those challenge targets of asking Stargate remote viewers,

1216
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:48,240
giving them coordinates to go to and have them describe what's there.

1217
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:54,240
And so these bases, were they part of the challenge targets?

1218
01:39:54,240 --> 01:40:02,240
I gave them the coordinates that Price had said, this is where I was looking.

1219
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:09,240
So I took those coordinates and I told them to go look at these different coordinates and see what they found there.

1220
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:13,240
The Stargate remote viewers.

1221
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:20,240
So before we get into what they saw, what did Pat see at these bases?

1222
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:30,240
He described them as inside areas where four different kinds of groups of people who had different duties

1223
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:34,240
had inside places that they were inside these mountains.

1224
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:37,240
What do you mean four different types of people?

1225
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:41,240
Races, genders, what are we talking here?

1226
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,240
Just different projects that they're on?

1227
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:47,240
Yeah, these four bases had different stories.

1228
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:49,240
I can read them to you what they were.

1229
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:57,240
They had different jobs that they did in four different bases.

1230
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:04,240
And so he would talk about, well, I'm going to go over to Mount Inyangani now and I'm going to look at Mount Hayes.

1231
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:10,240
And so this is another thing that we talked about before.

1232
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:14,240
He just would go to this place as well.

1233
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:20,240
This is very interesting over here on Mount Perdida, but I think I'll go back up to Hayes and then his thing would change.

1234
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:23,240
And we had to go through the transcript very carefully.

1235
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:26,240
Where is he supposed to be talking about now?

1236
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:32,240
And then going back to the discussion we had a minute ago.

1237
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:38,240
How did he know which one to go to and might be more interesting and so forth?

1238
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:42,240
And that's just in the back of my mind now, so to speak.

1239
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:47,240
Silly the way I talk one way one time and say then in the back of my mind, which I know it's not in there.

1240
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:56,240
Anyway, so.

1241
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:59,240
The main thing.

1242
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:05,240
That there was some interest in when some people would read this and say, oh, my goodness, they're terrible.

1243
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:10,240
They're invading us. They can do this and they can monitor what our radio things are.

1244
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:17,240
And they do this and.

1245
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:21,240
The single thing.

1246
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,240
That.

1247
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:34,240
Seemed joking up with this is first he was worried about this whole thing in terms of him being a military man and wondering about what's all this going on here.

1248
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:39,240
But by the time he got through with going through all the targets, he says, you know.

1249
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:41,240
They just don't want to be discovered.

1250
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:45,240
They don't want.

1251
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,240
People around the planet.

1252
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,240
To know that they're there.

1253
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:53,240
We don't want people hiking up the mountain and saying, hey, you guys, what are you doing here?

1254
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:55,240
Who's they?

1255
01:42:55,240 --> 01:43:00,240
The it depends on which thing you win.

1256
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,240
And I don't believe all of it.

1257
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:05,240
In other words, there's lots of things that they say.

1258
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:08,240
And like one of them is their home base is Mars.

1259
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:11,240
And I don't necessarily believe that.

1260
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,240
But other people have said something like that.

1261
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:21,240
So I'm looking specifically at the material I have and not adding in things that other people have said.

1262
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:26,240
So let's so what is the material that you had on these four different locations?

1263
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:29,240
What were they?

1264
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:36,240
So we're moving to the next phase.

1265
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:51,240
And let me try to make sure I understand the question you're asking is that the only thing I had to start with was prices transcript that put off gave me.

1266
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,240
Right.

1267
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,240
And I changed them into questions.

1268
01:43:54,240 --> 01:44:00,240
So what was what was Pat's transcript specifically?

1269
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:03,240
What was going on at these four different locations?

1270
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:10,240
The one in Australia, Alaska, Spain and the location in Africa.

1271
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:22,240
Joe started out his thing and he usually lays down and then he gets up and comes to the desk and draws for me and explains the drawing.

1272
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:25,240
Meanwhile, I'm tape recording the whole thing.

1273
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:33,240
So he says this is for Mount Hayes in Alaska says, OK, before I describe these pictures here, I have to make a statement.

1274
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:39,240
You have to bear with my descriptions and everything, what they lack, because I can't find a lot.

1275
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:47,240
I find a lot of difficulty in describing this because I've never seen anything that remotely resembles this part of the target.

1276
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:53,240
Now, he doesn't know he's looking at prices stuff.

1277
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:56,240
Sealed envelope and all that stuff.

1278
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:57,240
I've never seen anything like it.

1279
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:59,240
Just have no familiarity with it.

1280
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:03,240
I mean, I don't even recognize the screws and bolts of this thing.

1281
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:07,240
It's just completely off the wall as far as the target.

1282
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,240
So I have nothing to relate to.

1283
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:14,240
So I have to present it as I envisioned it.

1284
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,240
And I ask him, what do you mean by off the wall?

1285
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:17,240
It's brand new.

1286
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:19,240
It's never existed before.

1287
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:24,240
This is a prototype of something, something completely new concept.

1288
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:34,240
It's like asking an aborigine who has never seen an automobile to crawl inside the automobile and then describe in his terms.

1289
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,240
What's an automobile?

1290
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:38,240
What's an automobile?

1291
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:51,240
When he has no terms for screws and bolts and seat covers and windows and glass and metal, even the most rudimentary parts of this thing have no meaning whatsoever.

1292
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:57,240
And so we kind of knew he was in trouble.

1293
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:02,240
Let me see here.

1294
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,240
This is the kind of position I'm in.

1295
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:07,240
I've seen something.

1296
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:14,240
I have not even a rudimentary term to explain as far as other than a gestalt concept.

1297
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:17,240
And you're really asking me to draw this.

1298
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:23,240
So how and why my drawings are not going to be very good.

1299
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,240
Skip a little bit.

1300
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:27,240
Given that's true, here's page one.

1301
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:34,240
I have a bunch of water, land, ice, all these general things written here, my sketch.

1302
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:41,240
This is generally a very desolate area and drew a mountain range, road mountains.

1303
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:45,240
This whole range of mountains extends for thousands of miles.

1304
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:52,240
So I'll give you an idea of the scale of which I'm drawing and sort of put an X here where I perceive the target to be.

1305
01:46:52,240 --> 01:47:07,240
So, you know, he goes on in his full transcript about Mount Hayes, an icy covered mountain and so forth and so on.

1306
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,240
He has a lot of them.

1307
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:13,240
I want to read you.

1308
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:19,240
You've heard of different types of remote viewing.

1309
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,240
Joe just lays down and talks.

1310
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:34,240
But then Ingo Swan tells this story about you have to put them right across this way and then go down here and go down here and write that.

1311
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:45,240
It's Ingo's technique of trying to keep thoughts and ideas organized, which makes me wonder about this whole idea of you're everywhere,

1312
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:47,240
every when.

1313
01:47:47,240 --> 01:48:00,240
And Ingo, although didn't speak of it that way, tries to get you to organize these different things so that you'll stay focused on something and not try to display everything.

1314
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:17,240
Anyway, this coordinate remote viewing here, there are the whole point of this exercise other than challenge target is to say that thing that price did in 93 and underground UFO bases, everything.

1315
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:26,240
Is that a bunch of garbage or is there any idea that maybe some of the things that he said were really true?

1316
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:33,240
And so the result of my thing is like, that sounds pretty darn good.

1317
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,240
Ten years later.

1318
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,240
So this I'm going to read.

1319
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:44,240
This is a summary of one of those people that did the remote viewing by Ingo Swan.

1320
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:47,240
He didn't do it, but one of our trainees.

1321
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:54,240
His name was Bill Ray.

1322
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:57,240
Sight is a mountain.

1323
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:03,240
It is bitter cold and windy.

1324
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:07,240
Much snow, much wind and snow.

1325
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:15,240
There may be partly or completely frozen body of water nearby.

1326
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:18,240
The mountain is hollow.

1327
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:22,240
It is a large cave or crater.

1328
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:29,240
This has huge rooms and walls, curved high ceilings.

1329
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:33,240
There is an opening into the caves.

1330
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:36,240
The cavern is clear, sterile.

1331
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:44,240
There's equipment and different points there in the corridor.

1332
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:51,240
Some of the equipment is for monitoring, other support may be for life support.

1333
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:57,240
There are silver metallic ships, which are very quick.

1334
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:03,240
They are durable and are large and small.

1335
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:08,240
They are used to transport people and equipment.

1336
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:10,240
There are some people here.

1337
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:20,240
They are thin, emotional, unemotional and have programmed feelings.

1338
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:29,240
They are strange and have a pre-designed mission.

1339
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:34,240
They are freezing and coiling semi-isolated.

1340
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:37,240
They feel unearthly.

1341
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:45,240
The site has a research feeling, the feeling like security.

1342
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:54,240
The people are benign and serious and are interrelated.

1343
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:57,240
Site end.

1344
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:59,240
There are several of those.

1345
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:06,240
I only brought one because of time.

1346
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:18,240
What I did in 8200 to find out about what Price did in 1973,

1347
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:23,240
some people have said to me, that matches perfectly.

1348
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:30,240
I'm not ready to go that far, but it sure sounds like you have two people

1349
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:33,240
and they describe what it was like when they went to the football game.

1350
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:37,240
This one describes what it was like going to the football game.

1351
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:40,240
They're not going to be exactly the same.

1352
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:43,240
I think that's what's playing into it here.

1353
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:46,240
These are all different people trying to explain this strange thing

1354
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,240
that they're seeing while remote viewing.

1355
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:51,240
Programmed thoughts.

1356
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:53,240
What is that?

1357
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:56,240
Did he expound upon that at all?

1358
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:10,240
There is a different concept that these programmed thoughts people

1359
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:16,240
can use telepathy to tell you to turn left instead of to turn right

1360
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:22,240
or you don't see anything here, some sort of programmed telepathy.

1361
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:33,240
One thing that was an interesting thing I was asked,

1362
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:39,240
people have gone up there, people that are UFO type people

1363
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:42,240
have gone up there and looked around,

1364
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:45,240
but they can't find how to get into the mountain.

1365
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:53,240
My wife said, what makes you think they have to get into the mountain?

1366
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:58,240
There's lots of things on different things that are being proven now.

1367
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:05,240
They can walk right through them or they can use this programmed thing

1368
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:13,240
and not let you see where the cave begins.

1369
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:18,240
That was one of the things people were certainly worried about.

1370
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:25,240
Somebody said, wouldn't some investigators, some intelligence people

1371
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:30,240
go up there and find out if this is true because there's all this going on?

1372
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:40,240
I said, I don't know, but I don't think they'd tell me if they did.

1373
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:49,240
You just mentioned maybe they use the programmed thoughts to conceal the entrance.

1374
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:56,240
What are you speaking of when you say people can walk through things?

1375
01:53:56,240 --> 01:54:08,240
Well, first of all, what is the name of that place that they're showing on TV now

1376
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:14,240
where they're studying that place in the mountains where they're watching?

1377
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:17,240
I'm sorry, I just can't remember right now.

1378
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:22,240
But they see lights coming down and going in here

1379
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:26,240
and then going through the mountain and popping out over here.

1380
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:32,240
So we have these days physically watched that happen.

1381
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:39,240
The idea that, it was just my wife's comment,

1382
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:44,240
is what makes them think they couldn't go through the mountain?

1383
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:49,240
A softer way of saying that is they can be controlled

1384
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:52,240
so they can't see where they go in the mountain,

1385
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:59,240
but there also are real films now that show that happens.

1386
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:04,240
How do you articulate that?

1387
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:07,240
What's happening there? How is that happening?

1388
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:12,240
I watch it on TV like everybody else does and I see it come down

1389
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:15,240
and it's been going on for quite a while.

1390
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:18,240
I think you must have seen the programs.

1391
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:23,240
I just can't remember the name of them right now.

1392
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:30,240
How would I, what do I think about that and how they do it?

1393
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:33,240
I don't have an answer.

1394
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:35,240
I know that it's been videotaped,

1395
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:37,240
that it's been documented by a lot of different people

1396
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:40,240
and they bring in experts in to try to figure it out.

1397
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:43,240
And what you see in the films that they make

1398
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:48,240
is it goes through over here and it goes out over there.

1399
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:52,240
And when I watch it, I'm saying, well, look at that.

1400
01:55:52,240 --> 01:56:01,240
I don't have the wherewithal other than whatever they're doing,

1401
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:05,240
something we don't know about and that's what they're investigating.

1402
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:09,240
Well, what about the, so this was Mount Hays, correct,

1403
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:11,240
that we were just speaking of?

1404
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:15,240
We're talking about Mount Hays in that situation.

1405
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:23,240
What are Pat and Joe saying about the other three locations?

1406
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:28,240
Were they identical? Were there any variations?

1407
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:31,240
Yes, I don't have that here in my notes.

1408
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:33,240
I have it all written down at home.

1409
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:35,240
Do you remember any of it?

1410
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:40,240
It's well documented in my books too.

1411
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:45,240
If we're talking about this particular set of beings

1412
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:50,240
in the 8200 beings, I remember that they

1413
01:56:56,240 --> 01:57:02,240
would, reportedly, would interfere with

1414
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:07,240
one of our aircraft that would go over

1415
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:12,240
and could take satellite pictures in that range

1416
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:16,240
and that satellite would have some problems

1417
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:20,240
because they didn't want anything to be photographed.

1418
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:24,240
They didn't want, it was very important for them

1419
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:28,240
not to be discovered.

1420
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:30,240
Interesting.

1421
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:36,240
And again, they don't seem to be

1422
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:41,240
dangerous or concerned with hurting us in any way.

1423
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:45,240
Just don't get discovered.

1424
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:48,240
But they got discovered.

1425
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:52,240
Well, in this particular case, with the help of Pat Price

1426
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:56,240
and ten years later with a follow-on of these

1427
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:59,240
remote viewers looking at it.

1428
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:02,240
Had anyone else other than Joe and Pat remote viewed

1429
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,240
these locations?

1430
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:18,240
Yes, they, I had seven, six, Joe and,

1431
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:21,240
Joe did all four places, Pat did it, but then I had

1432
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:27,240
these other coordinate remote viewers or controlled

1433
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:28,240
remote viewers.

1434
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:31,240
I had six of those and that's what I read you

1435
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:32,240
when I read you this.

1436
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:33,240
Okay.

1437
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:34,240
Okay.

1438
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:38,240
So with everything that you know about this

1439
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:41,240
and, I mean, you set up Project 8200.

1440
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:44,240
I mean, what is your conclusion?

1441
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:46,240
What are these?

1442
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:53,240
We have to ask the question softer.

1443
01:58:53,240 --> 01:59:00,240
My job, I was an army officer at the time and my job

1444
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:07,240
to do these kinds of remote viewing things, not,

1445
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:11,240
this wasn't tasked by anybody but me just for

1446
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:14,240
training purposes.

1447
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:19,240
My results are these look very similar to what

1448
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:22,240
Pat Price did.

1449
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:26,240
I think that there's a validity to the Pat Price

1450
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:28,240
work and the work that they did.

1451
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:32,240
But when you take one step further is, well, what do

1452
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:33,240
I think about them?

1453
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:34,240
What are they doing?

1454
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:35,240
And how can they do that?

1455
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:36,240
And what this is?

1456
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:38,240
That wasn't my job.

1457
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:41,240
That wasn't something that I know about.

1458
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:48,240
It's pretty weird stuff.

1459
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:50,240
But it was a project.

1460
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:51,240
It's pretty weird.

1461
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:56,240
Project 8200 was about checking out what Price

1462
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:57,240
said.

1463
01:59:57,240 --> 02:00:01,240
And my remote viewers said, well, interestingly,

1464
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:03,240
it matches pretty interestingly.

1465
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:06,240
So we're talking six to seven different remote

1466
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:09,240
viewers all remote viewed these locations and had

1467
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:11,240
something very similar to say.

1468
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:12,240
Yes.

1469
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:15,240
And has there been any reported activity from

1470
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:20,240
civilian population, news, media, anything from

1471
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:22,240
any of these locations?

1472
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:28,240
Apparently it is a common thing in those type of

1473
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:34,240
people that are UFO people or running around.

1474
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:36,240
There's many, many, many people who have big

1475
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:39,240
opinions about UFOs and want to talk about them

1476
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:41,240
all the time.

1477
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:45,240
Those people seem to know about this too a little

1478
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:46,240
bit.

1479
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:51,240
And I don't deal with talking to them.

1480
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:55,240
What is your opinion on UFOs?

1481
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:57,240
Are they real?

1482
02:00:57,240 --> 02:01:00,240
I don't know how to answer that question isn't part

1483
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:01,240
of my job.

1484
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:06,240
And I hear you trying to suck things out of me in

1485
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:08,240
terms of, well, what do you think?

1486
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:09,240
Well, what do you think?

1487
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:13,240
And it's like, I think I did a pretty good job

1488
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:17,240
organizing how to find out what price did.

1489
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:23,240
Do you believe in UFOs?

1490
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:29,240
You're really good in your questions.

1491
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:31,240
I wanted to read you a little bit of this later.

1492
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:39,240
But if I try to sidestep you like I'm doing right

1493
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:41,240
now, then you're going to draw a conclusion.

1494
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:44,240
Ah, I know what he's doing there.

1495
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:46,240
He really believes in him, but he doesn't want to

1496
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,240
tell me.

1497
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:54,240
On the other hand, I can say it's an interesting

1498
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:59,240
subject or I can talk more about it or I can say I

1499
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:01,240
can either confirm nor deny.

1500
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:04,240
And so there's lots of different things.

1501
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:07,240
Do you want me to tell you some stories?

1502
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:08,240
Absolutely.

1503
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:09,240
Absolutely.

1504
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:16,240
When I was a very small child living in California

1505
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:21,240
as a kid, I was out in the front yard with my mom

1506
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:26,240
walking around the ivy that my dad had planted instead

1507
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:27,240
of grass.

1508
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,240
So they didn't have to cut the grass all the time.

1509
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:31,240
They just had the green ivy out there.

1510
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:33,240
Big, huge field of green ivy.

1511
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:35,240
And I looked up there and said, Mom, one of those

1512
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:40,240
five silver things up there, what are those things?

1513
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:43,240
And she just said, oh, they call those UFOs.

1514
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:44,240
Don't worry about them.

1515
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:46,240
They're fine.

1516
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:54,240
And another story from my weird family.

1517
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:59,240
Ingo Swan had some encounters with a UFO on the

1518
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:01,240
ground and he snuck over a mountain and watched him

1519
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:03,240
and so forth and so on.

1520
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:09,240
And I asked Padoff, do you trust what Ingo says?

1521
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:11,240
And he says, yes, absolutely.

1522
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:13,240
Ingo will never lie.

1523
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:17,240
He'll have mistakes and look at this and look at this.

1524
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:20,240
But if he says he was there, he saw one.

1525
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:31,240
When Joe and I both worked in Stargate together, same

1526
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:38,240
office, I had an incident where I was on top of a

1527
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:49,240
grassy knoll, which I now use to explain as, again,

1528
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:51,240
forgetting the name.

1529
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:53,240
I actually have a picture of it.

1530
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:55,240
It's important to say this name.

1531
02:03:55,240 --> 02:04:01,240
There it is.

1532
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:04,240
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

1533
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:06,240
Do you know what that looks like?

1534
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:07,240
I don't.

1535
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:09,240
It's outside of San Francisco.

1536
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:15,240
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

1537
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:17,240
Anyway, so.

1538
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:20,240
Do you mind if I text this to myself so we can put it on

1539
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:22,240
the screen?

1540
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:26,240
The story that I'm not telling you is about my actual

1541
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:28,240
encounters with UFOs.

1542
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:35,240
So Joe and I are both working in Stargate.

1543
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:43,240
And one night I have this very strong, I'm standing on a

1544
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:49,240
grassy knoll area.

1545
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:54,240
And I'm looking around and there's lots of people, just

1546
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:57,240
regular Joes and Janes.

1547
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:00,240
Is that a good way to do that?

1548
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:02,240
Regular people there.

1549
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:05,240
And I'm looking around.

1550
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:12,240
And there's a sense of sort of being hypnotized during this

1551
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:13,240
zone.

1552
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:15,240
I wish I knew that name.

1553
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:19,240
Do you know when the healers down in South America go

1554
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:23,240
around and fix your ears and fix your eyes and stuff?

1555
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:28,240
They're all kind of mesmerized.

1556
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:29,240
And a trance.

1557
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:30,240
Mesmerized, right?

1558
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:33,240
Well, these people that I was standing around with on the

1559
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:38,240
grassy knoll area were all sort of mesmerized.

1560
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:41,240
And they were like looking around.

1561
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:49,240
And there were aliens in between them, like interviewing

1562
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:53,240
them or talking to them and so forth.

1563
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:58,240
And I lost my composure.

1564
02:05:58,240 --> 02:06:06,240
Because I was doing training in remote viewing and out of

1565
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:09,240
body stuff and all that.

1566
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:12,240
And I spoke in my thing.

1567
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:17,240
I spoke up and said, well, I teach people how to get out of

1568
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:19,240
their body.

1569
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:23,240
And the aliens looked over at me and I said, oh, shit.

1570
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:25,240
Why didn't I keep my mouth shut?

1571
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:31,240
And they came over to me and they brought over to me a

1572
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:35,240
little, this is too big.

1573
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:39,240
It was just a little tiny thing that was round like this

1574
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:41,240
and had a needle thing here.

1575
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:48,240
And in here there was a, filled with fluid of some kind

1576
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:57,240
that was the color of kind of brownish color.

1577
02:06:57,240 --> 02:07:00,240
And it was much smaller like this.

1578
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:03,240
And they came around to me and circled me.

1579
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:06,240
And I'm still probably a little mesmerized again by that

1580
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:10,240
time, but I was like, I realized I said something that

1581
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:13,240
I shouldn't have said.

1582
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:21,240
And they stuck it in my leg and squeezed the brown part.

1583
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:24,240
And I floated up into the air.

1584
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:27,240
And they said kind of like that.

1585
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:31,240
And I was like, the other people and other aliens in

1586
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:32,240
care.

1587
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:35,240
They looked up and said, hey, what is he doing floating?

1588
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:36,240
No, they didn't.

1589
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:39,240
It was, you know, they didn't because of their

1590
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:44,240
mesmerization, they didn't seem to care too much that I

1591
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:47,240
was floating up in the air and so forth and so on.

1592
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:51,240
Now, this is a dream or this is real or?

1593
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:56,240
Let's just say this is an experience that I had.

1594
02:07:56,240 --> 02:07:58,240
This is an out of body experience.

1595
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:03,240
So you had an out of body experience in a grassy knoll.

1596
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:06,240
Is that correct?

1597
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:10,240
No, that's not jump to conclusions until I come to

1598
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,240
the end.

1599
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:14,240
And then I'll say I give up.

1600
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:19,240
So I had an experience and my experience was I was on a

1601
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:27,240
grassy knoll and the next morning I wake up and I go

1602
02:08:27,240 --> 02:08:30,240
to work at Fort Meade and Joe's in the office with

1603
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:35,240
everybody else and I walked by Joe, well, I'm sorry,

1604
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:40,240
Joe was there amongst the other people, Joe was there

1605
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:42,240
and I saw him there.

1606
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:44,240
In the experience?

1607
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:46,240
Yes, I saw him in the experience.

1608
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:49,240
So I, with all the other people and the little

1609
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:50,240
aliens.

1610
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:54,240
So I went over to Joe and I said, Joe, can I ask you

1611
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:55,240
something?

1612
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:58,240
He said, sure, what do you want?

1613
02:08:58,240 --> 02:09:02,240
And I said, I was wondering if anything happened to

1614
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:03,240
you last night.

1615
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:07,240
He said, no, just all those aliens that you and I were

1616
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,240
with.

1617
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:09,240
I said, okay, thanks.

1618
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:12,240
And I turned around and walked out of the office and

1619
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:15,240
Joe and I to this day have never spoken of it again.

1620
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,240
Why?

1621
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:18,240
Why have you not spoken with him about that?

1622
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:22,240
I don't know the answer to that, but we hadn't talked

1623
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:23,240
about it.

1624
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:29,240
Now I did talk to Pudoff about it, sidebar, Pudoff

1625
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:32,240
really believes in UFOs.

1626
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:33,240
Okay.

1627
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:39,240
Coming back to Pudoff, I said, I told him about my

1628
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:40,240
experience.

1629
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:42,240
Didn't tell him about Joe, I don't think.

1630
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:48,240
And he says, was it up at, what was the name of that

1631
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:49,240
place again?

1632
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:50,240
Mount Hays?

1633
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:51,240
No, no, no, no, no.

1634
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:52,240
This.

1635
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:57,240
Oh, I don't know.

1636
02:09:57,240 --> 02:10:04,240
Okay.

1637
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:07,240
He said to me, was it at the Lawrence Livermore

1638
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:08,240
Laboratory?

1639
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:12,240
And I said, really?

1640
02:10:12,240 --> 02:10:14,240
You think it was there?

1641
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:16,240
Because I know where that place is.

1642
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:20,240
And he said, well, there's a lot of incidents up

1643
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:22,240
there that get reported.

1644
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:25,240
And that's all he told me.

1645
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:28,240
But he knew about the Lawrence Livermore thing.

1646
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:31,240
So I started looking up pictures and I said, that

1647
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:35,240
looks like a pretty darn good grassy knoll.

1648
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:37,240
Very, very interesting.

1649
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:42,240
So when you asked me about that, I was reluctant to

1650
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:47,240
say anything about that.

1651
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:57,240
And I have had a discrete out-of-body experience.

1652
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:05,240
And found myself in the, it's hard to talk about

1653
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:09,240
dimensions, but I was standing behind an alien in a

1654
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:16,240
spacecraft, just a small one, which I understand

1655
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:20,240
get bigger and smaller depending upon.

1656
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:25,240
At any rate, he said, you shouldn't be here.

1657
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:27,240
And I said, I know.

1658
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:29,240
I realize this is a strange place.

1659
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:35,240
But before I go, could I ask you a question?

1660
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:45,240
And this is really a very strong memory in my head.

1661
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:47,240
I don't remember what I had for dinner last night, but

1662
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:50,240
this is in there.

1663
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:52,240
I'm telling myself I'm silly again.

1664
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:54,240
Dude, it's not in there.

1665
02:11:54,240 --> 02:12:00,240
At any rate.

1666
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:02,240
And he said, OK.

1667
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:08,240
And I said, how do you get from here to Alpha Centauri?

1668
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:10,240
We can't do that.

1669
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:14,240
The only thing that we think about is I have to go really

1670
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:17,240
fast for a really long time.

1671
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:20,240
How is it that you can go to Alpha Centauri without any

1672
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:22,240
problem?

1673
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:25,240
And essentially, he said, you wouldn't understand.

1674
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:30,240
So I said, I agree that that's a problem.

1675
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:36,240
However, I know that you have access to my mental thoughts.

1676
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:38,240
You're not talking to me with your mouth.

1677
02:12:38,240 --> 02:12:40,240
You have access to my mental thoughts.

1678
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:42,240
And I understand that.

1679
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:45,240
Can you use what information I have in my head and try to

1680
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:47,240
explain it to me?

1681
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:51,240
And he said, well, do you know what a Rubik's Cube is?

1682
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:54,240
And I said, oh, yeah, my son can do them in two minutes.

1683
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:58,240
He says, OK, so imagine a Rubik's Cube, but not

1684
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:00,240
necessarily just the six sides.

1685
02:13:00,240 --> 02:13:02,240
Just imagine the concept of a Rubik's Cube.

1686
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:04,240
And I said, OK.

1687
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:12,240
Now imagine on each one of the tiles on the Rubik's Cube has a

1688
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:17,240
chart of the elements, an elemental chart.

1689
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:19,240
And he said, oh, yeah, I know what that is.

1690
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:21,240
I've had science in school and everything.

1691
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:25,240
He says, now, on each of the other five surfaces, there's

1692
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:29,240
also elemental charts.

1693
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:33,240
And I said, so, OK, but what's the deal?

1694
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:38,240
And he said, well, you're thinking about going that way

1695
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:42,240
very fast for a very long time.

1696
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:46,240
What he didn't say to me, which I'm thinking right now,

1697
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:48,240
there's no space and time.

1698
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:50,240
I'm only thinking that right now.

1699
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:52,240
That wasn't part of the explanation.

1700
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:57,240
And he says, so what you do to get up to Alpha Centauri is you

1701
02:13:57,240 --> 02:13:59,240
just twist the cube.

1702
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:06,240
And I said, what do you mean?

1703
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:08,240
He said, well, I told you you wouldn't understand.

1704
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:14,240
And he said, when the periodic table occurs in a different

1705
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:17,240
place, you're at that place.

1706
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:20,240
And that's just a very crude explanation.

1707
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:25,240
But you have to stop thinking about go that way for a long

1708
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:28,240
time very fast.

1709
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:30,240
It doesn't work.

1710
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:36,240
And so the Rubik's Cube and all that nonsense is probably

1711
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:40,240
just trying to mess with my mind and everything.

1712
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:45,240
And because that doesn't make sense.

1713
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:47,240
How many Rubik's Cubes do you have to have?

1714
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:48,240
It's a stupid question.

1715
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:53,240
It's just an explanation for me to try to get my thinking

1716
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:56,240
straight because he was very strong when he said.

1717
02:14:56,240 --> 02:15:00,240
So it has to be utilizing some type of a consciousness,

1718
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:01,240
correct?

1719
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:04,240
I think that that's absolutely true.

1720
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:06,240
It's a consciousness act.

1721
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:12,240
And so you're talking about quantum, what was it, quantum

1722
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:14,240
locale, correct?

1723
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:15,240
Yeah.

1724
02:15:15,240 --> 02:15:18,240
And so it has to be some kind of a connect.

1725
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:25,240
If you heard of if you heard of what is they call it?

1726
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:29,240
And now I'm now I'm having problems.

1727
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:32,240
Quantum entanglement.

1728
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:35,240
It has to be something like that.

1729
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:36,240
Work.

1730
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:40,240
I mean, we did the entire our entire conversation.

1731
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:43,240
You've been talking about everything is one connect.

1732
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:46,240
How everything is connected.

1733
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:48,240
And so it had in.

1734
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:52,240
And I mean, even even the Chinese have claimed to be able

1735
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:56,240
to communicate with their satellites now via quantum

1736
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:58,240
entanglement, whether that's real or bullshit.

1737
02:15:58,240 --> 02:15:59,240
I don't know.

1738
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:03,240
But supposedly the premise is every atom is connected.

1739
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:06,240
And, you know, we've talked about this several times on the

1740
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:07,240
show.

1741
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:11,240
We split an atom in half and you vibrate this half no matter

1742
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:16,240
where in space and time.

1743
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:17,240
Exactly.

1744
02:16:17,240 --> 02:16:22,240
The other half is it will mimic the exact same vibration that's

1745
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:24,240
being manipulated on the other half.

1746
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:28,240
And so that has to be that has I guess doesn't have to.

1747
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:31,240
But I would think that that would come into play.

1748
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:37,240
Well, we're trying very hard to think about it as humans in

1749
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:39,240
our little brains.

1750
02:16:39,240 --> 02:16:44,240
But then there does seem to be help coming along like this.

1751
02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:54,240
Just to end this part of the story, there is no end.

1752
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:57,240
There's no space time.

1753
02:16:57,240 --> 02:17:02,240
Time passed and it occurred to me, wait a minute.

1754
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:04,240
I don't have to twist the cube.

1755
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:09,240
If I just turn the cube on the other surface is a different

1756
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,240
world.

1757
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:16,240
And this same guy spoke to me instantly in my brain saying,

1758
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:19,240
I've been waiting for you to discover that.

1759
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:25,240
And it's not like he didn't ever go anywhere because you can't

1760
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:27,240
ever go anywhere.

1761
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:32,240
So it was very interesting to me.

1762
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:37,240
Gee, why did you wait three years to tell me that?

1763
02:17:37,240 --> 02:17:41,240
There's no such thing as the three years to think about.

1764
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:48,240
But it was like sat me up like this and said, I didn't say

1765
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:50,240
anything in my head.

1766
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:54,240
I was like, well, that was pretty interesting.

1767
02:17:54,240 --> 02:18:04,240
And so getting back to your question, do I believe in UFOs?

1768
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:07,240
I have had experiences.

1769
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:11,240
So I guess it's just a matter if you trust your own experiences

1770
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:12,240
or not.

1771
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:13,240
Yes.

1772
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:15,240
Do you trust your own experiences?

1773
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:17,240
Oh, yeah.

1774
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:21,240
But there are false things around all the time.

1775
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:24,240
Green ice cream is no good for you.

1776
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:26,240
You ought to eat vanilla.

1777
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:28,240
So is that a belief system?

1778
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:32,240
Somebody told me one time you shouldn't eat green ice cream.

1779
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:38,240
So where I am right now at 77 years old and the experiences

1780
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:43,240
I've had, I have no doubt that there is something going on

1781
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:45,240
besides us on this planet.

1782
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:48,240
There's something else there.

1783
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:53,240
And maybe because the everywhere, every when.

1784
02:18:53,240 --> 02:19:01,240
And if they are all one, there's no such thing as they're part

1785
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:02,240
of us.

1786
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:03,240
They're part of our family.

1787
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:05,240
They're part of our group.

1788
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:09,240
Interesting concept that I've not heard before.

1789
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:14,240
How far down the rabbit hole did you guys go with this?

1790
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:18,240
Were there other projects other than 8,200?

1791
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:22,240
Of that time, no.

1792
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:27,240
I mean, I remember when I interviewed Joe, he had mentioned

1793
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:30,240
remote viewing a pyramid on Mars.

1794
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:36,240
I mean, I remember when I interviewed Joe, he had mentioned

1795
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:39,240
remote viewing a pyramid on Mars.

1796
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:42,240
I believe the year was 2000 B.C.

1797
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:44,240
Do you have any recollection of that?

1798
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:46,240
I sent Joe to Mars.

1799
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:48,240
You're the one that sent him there.

1800
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:54,240
Can you just kind of relive that experience?

1801
02:19:54,240 --> 02:20:01,240
Actually, let me start with a preliminary question.

1802
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:05,240
How did that pop up on anybody's radar?

1803
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:11,240
Why did you even give Joe a specific grid coordinate on Mars

1804
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:16,240
with a date?

1805
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:18,240
You know, I don't remember.

1806
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:24,240
I mean, I even have that on video and the whole thing on my

1807
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:28,240
computer, which I'll send you and you can listen to it.

1808
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:32,240
But I don't remember actually why I did that.

1809
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:37,240
You don't remember why somebody gave you a coordinate to have

1810
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:42,240
Joe McMonagle remote view Mars?

1811
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:46,240
I would rather say what I just said, and that is I don't

1812
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:48,240
remember why I did that.

1813
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:50,240
Okay.

1814
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:54,240
What did you think when Joe discovered the pyramid through

1815
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:56,240
his experience?

1816
02:20:57,240 --> 02:21:03,240
Well, I tended to believe him on a couple of things.

1817
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:16,240
I had during the thing, he might have had something to do with

1818
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:20,240
put-off because I asked some questions about it.

1819
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:28,240
Anyway, the planet is a different size than ours.

1820
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:34,240
So you had to be careful about what he said.

1821
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:38,240
One time he looked at the sun and he said, what's wrong with the sun?

1822
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:40,240
I said, Joe, we can't study that right now.

1823
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:45,240
We have to look at this coordinate here and the coordinates on Mars

1824
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:50,240
all go just in one direction, east, west, north, south.

1825
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:53,240
So we split this way in our east and west.

1826
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:56,240
But on Mars it goes the whole way around.

1827
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:59,240
I got goofed up for a while there.

1828
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:02,240
And then I remembered coordinates don't matter anyway.

1829
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:04,240
He's just doing what he's doing.

1830
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:08,240
If I say it, go check out the peanuts.

1831
02:22:08,240 --> 02:22:10,240
Okay.

1832
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:13,240
Wouldn't mean anything.

1833
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:24,240
And then he came back down and I said, you know, go over there and go over here.

1834
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:33,240
And then he said, Mars used to be a good, used to be a healthy planet,

1835
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:37,240
but it got hit by something.

1836
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:42,240
And I said, are you saying it was something exploded, something was destroyed?

1837
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:53,240
He says it was like an asteroid came and hit the planet

1838
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:57,240
and that tore the atmosphere off of it.

1839
02:22:57,240 --> 02:23:04,240
And for millions of years now, it's just been deteriorating after it lost its atmosphere.

1840
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:10,240
And then he said, and there are some people in the pyramid thing.

1841
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:15,240
I don't know if he just said building or a pyramid, but he could have said pyramid.

1842
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:23,240
And people hid in there knowing that the comet was coming.

1843
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:30,240
They wanted to create an environment where they could survive

1844
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:36,240
and then come out after the destruction of the terribleness.

1845
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:40,240
And I said, well, can you go?

1846
02:23:44,240 --> 02:23:47,240
And he was able to go back in time.

1847
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:50,240
I told him to go back in time until before that hit.

1848
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:57,240
And he described, you know, tall aliens and so forth and so on.

1849
02:23:57,240 --> 02:24:00,240
And I said, well, how about now? Can you go inside the pyramid?

1850
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:02,240
And he said, oh, no, it's been too long.

1851
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:07,240
It's been a long, long time and they're all dead now.

1852
02:24:07,240 --> 02:24:10,240
They didn't survive.

1853
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:19,240
And then he said, but some of them didn't go into that.

1854
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:26,240
Some of them took off like they had a spaceship of some kind and they took off.

1855
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:33,240
And then he described something that looked an awful lot like Earth

1856
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:44,240
before the Earth got torn apart by a young Earth with volcanoes and stuff all around there.

1857
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:49,240
Like out of the frying pan into the fire was kind of the thing I was saying.

1858
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:56,240
That's as far as they could get, but it was at least it was off Mars.

1859
02:24:56,240 --> 02:25:02,240
Now that I think back, it might be that.

1860
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:06,240
What I've had something to do with trying to get me to do that work,

1861
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:10,240
because I remember talking with him about it.

1862
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:12,240
I'll send the movie to you and you can see it.

1863
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:13,240
I would appreciate that.

1864
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:18,240
Would it be OK if we put some of the clips into this interview as we talk about it?

1865
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:20,240
Sure, because then you would have the show.

1866
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:21,240
Thank you.

1867
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:28,240
How did Pat die?

1868
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:35,240
Slowly this or not this.

1869
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:42,240
There are many, many stories about Pat dying.

1870
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:46,240
And everybody has a different story.

1871
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:49,240
Do you really want to?

1872
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:54,240
I mean, this is really, I can tell you and then you'll have the stories too.

1873
02:25:58,240 --> 02:26:08,240
There was a sense that 73 he was active and stuff.

1874
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:10,240
75 he was dead.

1875
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:13,240
CIA had bought him.

1876
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:25,240
CMI CIA got him away from SRI because they saw what he did and CIA hired him.

1877
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:29,240
Lived in the Virginia area.

1878
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:35,240
Some of the reports say he was in Washington, D.C.

1879
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:36,240
No, he was in the Virginia area.

1880
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:39,240
That's how far apart Virginia and Washington, D.C.

1881
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:42,240
Depends on whether you go to the store or not.

1882
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:56,240
At any rate, there was a rumor that came up that he was sick and that he was going to die.

1883
02:26:57,240 --> 02:27:06,240
And he collapsed in a restaurant and they took him to the hospital.

1884
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:19,240
And I'm going to tell these stories differently and you're going to get them mixed up.

1885
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:38,240
Took him to the hospital and he disappeared from the hospital when two people came to take him and said they're going to take him to the funeral home.

1886
02:27:39,240 --> 02:27:43,240
And people say, well, who were these guys?

1887
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:44,240
I don't know.

1888
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:55,240
I think when, you know, Bill was on night duty, but he's not here today and I don't really know who that was.

1889
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:57,240
Why don't you check at the desk or something?

1890
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:00,240
Nobody could identify who they were.

1891
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:07,240
I say CIA would do that because he was their employee and had lots of classified stuff.

1892
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:24,240
And so they were taken and Russell Targ tells the story that then they were they took him and they cremated him and buried him in an unmarked grave.

1893
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:32,240
And he went looking for the grave and see there's the grave that says one fifty five and it doesn't say anything about it.

1894
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:37,240
It's an unmarked grave with supposedly his ashes are in there.

1895
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:44,240
The agency just decided they were going to cremate him and bury him in an unmarked grave.

1896
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:47,240
I would suggest that something like that.

1897
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:50,240
But having you say it was much better.

1898
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:53,240
The.

1899
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:57,240
That's one story.

1900
02:28:57,240 --> 02:28:59,240
OK, second story.

1901
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:01,240
Oh, and then I'm sorry.

1902
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:03,240
After he was buried.

1903
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:06,240
They called his wife.

1904
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:11,240
OK, and that's the story that Russell got when he went looking for what happened to them.

1905
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:13,240
Russell Targ got that.

1906
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:16,240
Now, story two.

1907
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:19,240
I think there'll be three stories.

1908
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:23,240
Story two is Pat Price.

1909
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:28,240
Russell.

1910
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:30,240
How.

1911
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:36,240
How and Pat's wife.

1912
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:40,240
Fly to.

1913
02:29:42,240 --> 02:29:45,240
I think the place is Las Vegas area.

1914
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:46,240
I'm not too sure.

1915
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:48,240
And.

1916
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:52,240
Go to the hospital and they say, Oh, well, he got taken to the funeral home.

1917
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:55,240
They go to the few and we don't know who that was.

1918
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:57,240
And they go to the funeral home.

1919
02:29:57,240 --> 02:30:00,240
And there's Pat Price's body.

1920
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:05,240
In a casket.

1921
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:07,240
And they go to the funeral home.

1922
02:30:07,240 --> 02:30:09,240
And they go to the funeral home.

1923
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:11,240
And they go to the funeral home.

1924
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:13,240
And they go to the funeral home.

1925
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:15,240
And there's a body.

1926
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:20,240
In a casket.

1927
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:21,240
And.

1928
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:27,240
How tells me it looks like.

1929
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:30,240
Price.

1930
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:33,240
His wife is there and they agree.

1931
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:34,240
It looks like him.

1932
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:38,240
But it's not so hard to do that to a body.

1933
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:42,240
How tells me he's good at fixing stuff up that needs to be fixed up.

1934
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:47,240
So.

1935
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:50,240
I don't know.

1936
02:30:51,240 --> 02:30:52,240
After that.

1937
02:30:55,240 --> 02:30:57,240
There's four stories, not three.

1938
02:30:58,240 --> 02:30:59,240
I don't know.

1939
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:00,240
After that.

1940
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:03,240
Is your next question.

1941
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:05,240
Well, did they bury that?

1942
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:07,240
I don't know the story to that.

1943
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:09,240
I only know what Hal told me it was up.

1944
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:10,240
You know.

1945
02:31:10,240 --> 02:31:14,240
He was missing in there and he wound up there and there was a body.

1946
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:16,240
The other story we know is like.

1947
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:19,240
The body was burned and so forth and so on.

1948
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:25,240
This is one, two.

1949
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:29,240
Do you know the true story of what happened?

1950
02:31:29,240 --> 02:31:30,240
Well.

1951
02:31:31,240 --> 02:31:32,240
No, I don't.

1952
02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:33,240
But I know.

1953
02:31:33,240 --> 02:31:35,240
When I heard this story from Hal.

1954
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:39,240
And nobody knew what happened after that.

1955
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:41,240
What do you think I would do?

1956
02:31:43,240 --> 02:31:45,240
I would probably.

1957
02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:51,240
If I were you, I would go to the locations that people said that he was buried.

1958
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:54,240
And see what's there.

1959
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:56,240
Did you do that?

1960
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,240
No.

1961
02:31:57,240 --> 02:32:00,240
I put Pat Price's picture in an envelope.

1962
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:06,240
And gave that sealed envelope to Joe and asked Joe to describe where the person in the picture was.

1963
02:32:07,240 --> 02:32:08,240
Interesting.

1964
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:10,240
First thing out of Joe's mouth.

1965
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:13,240
This guy does something like what I do.

1966
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:19,240
I said, Joe, my task is to tell me where he is.

1967
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:22,240
Doesn't matter about.

1968
02:32:23,240 --> 02:32:24,240
He does what you do.

1969
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:27,240
Okay, okay.

1970
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:28,240
Wait a minute.

1971
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:34,240
He's in an underground office.

1972
02:32:35,240 --> 02:32:37,240
In Virginia somewhere.

1973
02:32:39,240 --> 02:32:43,240
Okay, Joe, let's start with that and I'll get back to you.

1974
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:50,240
And then he was used to me saying that because I used to take the envelope into.

1975
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:56,240
Major Watt, now Colonel Watt and say to him.

1976
02:32:57,240 --> 02:32:58,240
What do you think?

1977
02:32:58,240 --> 02:32:59,240
Should I continue?

1978
02:32:59,240 --> 02:33:08,240
I didn't really do that, but he knew Joe knew it was okay for me to say, okay, well, stop for now, Joe, and I'll get back to you.

1979
02:33:09,240 --> 02:33:11,240
I never did get back to him.

1980
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:13,240
But.

1981
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:16,240
Why didn't you get back with him?

1982
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:20,240
I didn't want to go too far.

1983
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:26,240
I was doing something outside my purview as being the guy in that office.

1984
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:29,240
And I just kept my mouth shut.

1985
02:33:31,240 --> 02:33:41,240
So you have reason to believe that Pat Price's death was false and that he may still be alive doing work.

1986
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:43,240
He'd be well over 100 years old now.

1987
02:33:44,240 --> 02:33:45,240
Well, at the time.

1988
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:53,240
So when I think about all the shenanigans that went on before, it looked a lot like, oh, I know what the fourth one is.

1989
02:33:54,240 --> 02:34:09,240
Somebody somebody said, oh, he couldn't have been killed by the CIA to get rid of him because he went and got his son this thing and got his wife this thing.

1990
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:11,240
And you could tell he was done enough.

1991
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:17,240
And I'm saying the CIA could made up all those stories so everybody would go discover those stories.

1992
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:21,240
So that's the fourth situation.

1993
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:22,240
Interesting.

1994
02:34:23,240 --> 02:34:24,240
And that's my answer.

1995
02:34:25,240 --> 02:34:26,240
Interesting.

1996
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:27,240
Very interesting.

1997
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:33,240
Well, Skip, we are we are getting close to time here.

1998
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:38,240
So I do want to ask, you know, why was the Stargate program dismantled?

1999
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:45,240
It was told to be dismantled and they created one gal who said, no, this is going on.

2000
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:47,240
And look at so many percentages of this happened.

2001
02:34:47,240 --> 02:34:48,240
This happened.

2002
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:50,240
And the other guy said, oh, no, it's a bunch of nonsense.

2003
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:51,240
So this, that's the other.

2004
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:54,240
It was time for it to be gone.

2005
02:34:55,240 --> 02:34:56,240
OK.

2006
02:34:57,240 --> 02:34:58,240
Do you think they are?

2007
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:02,240
Doing the programming in your different name.

2008
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:07,240
Why wouldn't they?

2009
02:35:09,240 --> 02:35:10,240
Say.

2010
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:15,240
They already had five other programs.

2011
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:18,240
Well, did I say then?

2012
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:20,240
What are those programs?

2013
02:35:21,240 --> 02:35:24,180
I guess NBI, we had NBI, NBI

2014
02:35:24,180 --> 02:35:27,300
what did i say then what are those programs

2015
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:39,300
i've long since not been a part of the 26 years and 12 years retirement

2016
02:35:41,540 --> 02:35:49,300
it's a long time ago and nobody would have told me anyways fair enough well skip

2017
02:35:50,020 --> 02:35:56,260
