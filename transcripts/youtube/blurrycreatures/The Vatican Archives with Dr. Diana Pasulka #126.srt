1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
So in the extraterrestrial research part of the archive, this is at the observatory,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,760
because anything that has to do with space doesn't go to the Vatican archive,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,960
it goes to the observatory, which is in Castle Gandolfo. And that's a space observatory.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:23,440
So basically, they just had from back in the day, from like 1200 onward, what people have thought

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,320
about and published about extraterrestrials. But if you look at the history of Catholicism,

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,600
and you look at like, especially people in the Vatican, they know about Emanuel Swedenborg,

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,240
who's talking about angels and people on Venus and things like this in 1750.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,520
Right? In 1750, there was a bestselling book called Life on Other Planets.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,520
There was a bestselling book called Life on Other Planets.

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,640
Yeah. Welcome back to Blurry Creatures. This is your first episode. Welcome. Welcome to the show.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,240
You might want to go back and start the beginning. This is kind of a journey podcast.

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
Exactly. We've been doing this for a couple of years now. We've heard a lot of weird stuff.

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,560
Our paradigms have been smashed and put back together several times.

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,560
Just when you think you know what you're talking about, you think you understand what's going on,

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
you hear a story or you hear another smart person come on and blow it up again. So

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,960
for those of you who have been around since episode one, thank you. Thanks for being on

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,560
the ride with us. We know how you feel because we're right there with you. Yeah. Right?

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,600
Just one is true. Yeah. Blows the whole paradigm.

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,520
Oh, look at you. Yeah, you know, you have to. I prefer just to quote Judd if I really want

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,160
to do it. But yeah, that's the most fun. But we were just talking, Luke and I were just

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,640
talking out there a little bit about just how blown away we are with the response of the podcast.

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,560
Just how it's been charting people, buying merch, people supporting the podcast and just

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,920
going places in the public and people stopping us and saying nice things. And it's a podcast.

24
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,080
You don't ever think you never know. We're just having conversations and we're putting it out

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,440
there. We don't realize like, oh, you know, this is, this is wild. This is, this is something that

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,040
seems to be needed. A lot of people need to have these weird conversations. So we're happy to have

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,640
have them for you. Right. And with you and sometimes with you as well. But I, you know,

28
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,080
I want to say this, Luke, there are a lot of people feel alone. A lot of people messages and

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
say, you know, I'm thankful for you guys because I felt alone my whole life. And it's, I'm just

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,760
thankful for your friendship, Luke, because we can have these conversations together and we don't

31
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,400
think each other is crazy. And I, sometimes I understand how they feel, but then other times

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm like, I feel lucky that I have a lot of friends in my life who don't, who don't think

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
this stuff is crazy. And, and we can have conversations about it, but a lot of people,

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,920
they tune into the podcast, they have nobody to talk to. Maybe even their spouse doesn't even

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,760
believe in any of this stuff. And so grateful for you being here though. And you're welcome here.

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,520
And I truly believe there is a quickening. I think that people are waking up, you know,

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,360
we always say like this, this is, we're just a couple of guys that ask questions. We don't

38
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,360
have PhDs behind our names, but we were looking for better answers. Most of all,

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,280
we say this almost every episode, Nate, we want people to think for themselves. So

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,720
digest the things, the experts we bring on and have spent the research time and decide for

41
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,000
yourself, think for yourself. That's what makes free speech great. That's what this country is

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,320
founded on. So made this country, made this country great was that you had a free exchange of ideas

43
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,000
and you could let the cream rise to the top. And that's, you know, I think in some ways,

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
kind of what we're doing, we want to have platform where we can talk about things and,

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,680
and then ruminate and, and marinate. Age and the fine, the fine whiskey barrel. That's right. You,

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,200
but you believe he's out there now, huh? It's just one of those people's right. He's out there.

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,280
You know, it's, listen, I mean, we've come a long way since big foot, but we need to, we know our,

48
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,520
we know what our core competency is. And so we, we, we have to talk about the big guy.

49
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,600

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,720
awesome. Thank you for all the messages. Sorry, we don't get back to a lot of them. Um, lately,

60
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,080
it's just been a ton and we're trying to have a newborn, new dads, old dads, new dads, old dads.

61
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,600
We're flying by the seat of our pants. And I thank you guys for supporting the show, putting

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,720
food on the, putting food on my family's table and helping this show get produced.

63
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,280
And it's become so much bigger than we ever imagined. And we can't say thank you enough.

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,880
And I actually put a fusion six on my wall in here when I'm podcasting now, because how crazy

65
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,960
the show's gotten, I got to like stare at it, you know, put on the armor because it feels like this

66
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,440
stuff's just, it's not only is it real, but it's coming at you and in a way that I've never thought

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,360
possible. So we're praying for us. And, um, yeah, yeah, we're grateful for this community. And

68
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,280
let's, let's bring on Dr. Diana Pasolka. Yeah, we have Dr. Diana Pasolka today. She's coming

69
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,080
on the show. She wrote a book called America Cosmic Academic, who talks about the blurry things in our

70
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,440
world, which, you know, we always love those people who are bold in their field to talk,

71
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,200
talk about the truth and not be afraid to have a bunch of pushback.

72
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,560
Cause I mean, just the pushback we get sometimes I'm like, gosh, I can't imagine being in like an

73
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,680
academic field and all this stuff they get. It's bold. You got to be bold to speak out,

74
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,760
you know, and there's a lot of people getting put in jail these days if they speak out the truth.

75
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,560
So, you know, Facebook jail, Doug van Doren goes to Facebook, Doug, we love you. Yeah.

76
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,720
Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, literal jail, some of these doctors who speak out, they're going,

77
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,640
they're getting locked up, you know, and it's crazy just false accusations and all kinds of stuff. So

78
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,880
yeah, you guys are awesome. Thanks for supporting the podcast. Thanks for features.com. Thanks,

79
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,840
Matt Maher, Matt Maher for, for the suggestion and for recommending Diana. We need a show roller.

80
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,120
You're now entering the blurry bird.

81
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,120
The history of our earth is so different from what we can imagine.

82
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,440
The Smithsonian, and if they found out about a large skeleton somewhere was to go get it.

83
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,480
I'm going to assume at least one person is right, because if one person is right, it busts the

84
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,520
paradigm. It all goes back to the fallen cherub. And the problem with the modern day church,

85
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,640
they have a very truncated view of the supernatural. This backdrop that's just pregnant with all kinds

86
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,640
of meaning associated with this Mount Herman event.

87
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,760
And this guy defects from the kingdom. That's a big deal.

88
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,120
That's right. Well, Dr. Diana, we're glad to have you. So we'll do a proper introduction.

89
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,360
Dr. Diana Pasolka, you're an author and a professor of religious studies at the

90
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,840
University of North Carolina in Wilmington and chair of the department of philosophy and religion.

91
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,480
We wanted to have you on because you wrote a book called American Cosmic, which is UFOs,

92
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,440
religion and technology really picked our interest because, and in talking to you before we started

93
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,400
recording, you're, you're also a Christian and, and then we found out you didn't believe really in

94
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,920
any of this stuff when you started researching it, which I think is a, is a fascinating journey.

95
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,600
I think with all of that, I would love to ask you about that journey from, you know,

96
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,160
a religious studies professor to, you know, to this book, like, you know, how, how did,

97
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,760
how did that process happen and how did you end up writing a book on, on, on UFO?

98
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah. And you, you and my sister are both Davis alumni. So shout out.

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,720
Wow. That is so cool. Davis is one of my favorite places, riding around on bicycles. And there's a

100
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,560
great religious studies program there, which I had taken classes in and philosophy too. Okay.

101
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,120
And I'm a Chico State guy. So we were rivals at one point. Now you guys are D1.

102
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Okay. Yeah, that's right. Wow.

103
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm Cal Poly. I'm Bigfoot on the circle. All right. So

104
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,000
California educated kids. We're all brainwashed, right?

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,640
Yeah, that's right.

106
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,360
We got out of the brainwashing, I think. That's how it works.

107
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,320
Baby, hopefully.

108
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,080
Okay. The Southerners are going to say, oh no, this is too much, right?

109
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,120
Yeah, right.

110
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,280
There's too much North Cal here in the South.

111
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:49,760
Okay. So I had, I had an idea to do what I'm doing now when I was 11. So I wanted to, I was a,

112
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,960
a kid who was, who had a feeling of being religious, like being Christian when I was

113
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:01,520
young. And so what I did was I read the Bible basically when I was about 11. And it was the

114
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,240
King James version, which is not a Catholic version of the Bible, but it's a, it's a Protestant

115
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,520
version of the Bible with, it's a red letter edition. And so I would focus on Jesus's words

116
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,720
in the Bible. And I said, you know, the Bible, once you actually read it is quite strange

117
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,640
and it doesn't make a lot of sense. It's a lot of books put together. Now, if you're a kid,

118
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,280
you don't know this. So, but I w I knew enough to know that through reading this book,

119
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,120
there were, there's a history here and there were these original languages that this book was,

120
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,200
you know, translated from. And I wanted to learn those original languages.

121
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,680
And I wanted to know about the history of the Bible and religion in general. So that was kind

122
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,480
of like a goal that I had when I was very young and I ended up doing that. So I started off as a

123
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,240
born again Christian. My, my family, my dad was Catholic and my mother was Jewish. We came,

124
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,200
you know, from eclectic California, new agey culture, and they weren't particularly religious,

125
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,200
but I was. And so I asked them if I could attend a Catholic school that was actually run by

126
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,400
sisters, the sisters of mercy. And these were great role models because they were living the

127
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,440
gospel in terms of actually helping people and, you know, doing actual work of feeding people and

128
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,520
clothing people and getting them medical supplies and things like this. They were doing this in

129
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:32,000
Central America at the time. And so this, this was my early education. And so I decided to now,

130
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,520
I grew up, you know, what it was like in the nineties in California, it was the.com boom.

131
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,520
So it was really easy to get a job doing really anything tech related and make decent money.

132
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:49,440
So I did that and that kind of kept me off my route of going to, you know, school for religious

133
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,400
studies for a while. But I kept reading philosophy and religion and I knew that eventually I'd do

134
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:02,000
that. So I did. So in my twenties, I went back to graduate school and I was applied to the divinity

135
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,400
school in Berkeley. It's called the GTU, the graduate theological union. And it is a great

136
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,120
school because you've got everybody who wants to learn academic, you know, the field of academic

137
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,560
religious studies, but also they want to either be a priest or be a rabbi. And there are schools

138
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,120
there that teach people how to do that. So that's where I went. And so I took classes

139
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,040
at UC Berkeley and I took classes from the Jesuit school theology, and I took classes from all kinds

140
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,360
of different schools. And I learned a lot about religious studies, which is different than

141
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,200
theology. So people ask me, you know, are you a minister or what do you do? No, I teach academic,

142
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,480
I teach that basically that comparative religion or the history of religions. So we learned every,

143
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,600
I learned about every sort of religion. So I teach classes on

144
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,360
Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Muslim, you know, Christianity. I teach Christianity to people

145
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,880
who are Christians and have not ever read the Bible by the way. So, so these are the things I do.

146
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,280
I had never thought of UFOs before. So how did that happen? So what happened was that I've,

147
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,360
you know, when you start, when you're in an academic program, it kind of distances you

148
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,560
from things like miracles and the reality of, of religious people and how religious people have

149
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,600
experiences that are, that they could call miraculous. Supernatural stuff, right? Yeah.

150
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,640
Exactly. Totally supernatural stuff. So it teaches you to not believe in those and it teaches,

151
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:35,840
it distances you from those things. And so I was fully distanced from these things until 2011 and

152
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,800
2012 when I had the experience of finishing a book about a Catholic doctrine, a purgatory.

153
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,520
I'd been through a lot of the archives of, you know, Catholic culture and I did a lot of research,

154
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,560
you know, I was, I was a complete academic nerd, you know, this is what I was immersed in doing.

155
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,520
I had young kids and so I was, my life was basically taking care of my kids and doing

156
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,600
research and teaching nothing else. And then what happened was that I came across all these

157
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,760
sightings of UFOs. I didn't know they were that, like I didn't, I didn't think about it in that way,

158
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:19,360
but I, I saw from like 1100 onward to like up until the present that European and North American

159
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,560
and Canadian Catholics were basically identified these flying objects in the sky, but they were

160
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,800
interpreting them as different types of things. And so I had a kind of like a breakthrough weekend

161
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,360
where I had this and, and I was done with this one book and I said, I'm, I don't know what to do

162
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,560
with all this stuff. I had kept a log of these sightings, like here's an example of one of them,

163
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:50,160
a sighting that this nun had, it was this in the 1800s and she kept seeing these orbs come through

164
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,760
her cell, you know, basically she was in a cell, right? Like that's what nuns lived in, these

165
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,320
convents and it was a stone cell that she was in and these orbs would come in and she was afraid

166
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,200
of them and didn't know what to think of them. So she told the mother superior and the priest

167
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,440
of the convent, they didn't believe her, but she kept having this experience. So finally the mother

168
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,680
superior sat with her one night, saw the orbs herself and realized that she, they thought that

169
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,720
they were souls from purgatory that needed to be prayed away. And they got the whole community

170
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,040
together and they prayed, well, this is the type of thing that I kept coming across. And so I showed

171
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,520
the log to a friend of mine and I said, I can't, I really don't know what to think of this stuff.

172
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:42,880
And he said, it looks like Steven Spielberg, like, you know, UFO stuff. And I said, you are crazy,

173
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,880
but that weekend there was a UFO conference in Wilmington and I attended it. And when I attended

174
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,440
it, I realized that people were still having these experiences and then boom, my world changed.

175
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,160
I completely, the supernatural became real. And I had an experience, I would call it,

176
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,920
it was an experience that was frightening, terrifying, and also strangely familiar because

177
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,200
I recognized that those things that I'd been studying my whole life were actually real.

178
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,800
And how now do I think about them? Like, how do I deal with this now? And I frightened a lot of

179
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,840
my colleagues, you know, they were like, what's going on? What happened to you? Right.

180
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,560
But you know what, I developed a new way of, in my field of talking about this stuff. So I've,

181
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,160
you know, I was already the chair of my department back then. So I could do that.

182
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,360
I could write a book about UFOs without being maligned. And then the US government comes along

183
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,600
this last summer and basically says, yeah, they exist. We don't know what they are. And so,

184
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,600
you know, a lot of, you know, my book came out, the timing was perfect for it. So that's what

185
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,960
happened. That's wild. There's so many things I want to ask, but I think it's fascinating that

186
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,240
you wrote this book, taking these experiences and then contextualizing it in the context of

187
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,440
a religion. I think one of the things you talk about is that there's 75% of American adults

188
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,680
believe in extraterrestrial life, right? And this is the way that you teach academic religion,

189
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,320
you make an argument this is becoming a religion. Can you unwrap just a little bit of that for us?

190
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,160
Because I think that's a fascinating way to look at it. And that's what Nate and I,

191
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,680
we've talked about in the very beginning, Diana, when we started this podcast was to try to

192
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:33,440
contextualize the crazy things people experience and see stuff that's in the Bible that doesn't

193
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,280
make a lot of sense. And then to try to make it make sense through the lens of the biblical

194
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,880
narrative with the foundation of our faith. And you're taking this experience and saying,

195
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,080
this also looks like a religion, the way that people treat these experiences. What you think

196
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,040
is a really interesting juxtaposition on this. And I know you spent what, 60 years

197
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,640
doing an ethnographic study on all of this. So I would love just for just a little bit of insight

198
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,760
to why you see it like that, and maybe even why you called it American Cosmic with the idea that

199
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,760
this happens across the world as well. Sure. Yeah. So American Cosmic. So that references

200
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,560
to a book by Henry Young called The Russian Cosmists. And so this is how that happens. So

201
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,480
along the way of doing this study, it became known that I was doing a study like this. And I was

202
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:36,800
approached by people from who were affiliates and worked with NASA, and also were involved in our

203
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:44,160
US space program. And so they came to me to understand what they were seeing basically,

204
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,160
and what they were experiencing. And they wanted me to kind of explain it to them,

205
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,080
which I thought was so strange. And so what happened was that I learned, I started to do some

206
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,760
historical work about our space programs. And I recognized that at the basis for the Russian space

207
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,960
program, the two viable space programs back in the day, right? The Russian space program,

208
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:14,160
and our space program, the United States space program. And each of them were founded on very

209
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:21,920
odd ritualistic types of things going on. You had Jack Parsons with us, and I don't know if you know

210
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,680
anything about him, but he would do these kind of a cult, not kind of, that's what California

211
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:36,400
wave sang it. Crowley stuff, yeah. Yeah, full on a cult work in order to download or bring about

212
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,560
these technologies that would help him develop rocket technology. At the same time, or a little

213
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,280
bit earlier, the Russians were doing the same thing, but theirs was Christian. Theirs were

214
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,200
ritualistic, but they were Christian. They believed that they were getting in touch with angels

215
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,680
and beings that were godly, not demons and things like that. But the rituals were very similar,

216
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:08,640
okay? Although the Russians didn't involve the weirdness that Jack Parsons was involved with.

217
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,840
But for a person who studies religion, they were rituals. And most people don't ascribe science

218
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,240
with rituals. And they don't ascribe our space program in particular. They want it to be

219
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,160
completely nuts and bolts and no paranormal stuff. But I'm sorry, at the basis of both of those

220
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:35,040
developments were ritualistic paranormal activities that kept going on. And so one of

221
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:41,040
the people that I associated with and learned from was, I call him Tyler D in American Cosmic.

222
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:48,720
He was basically kind of in the tradition of Jack Parsons, but without the Crowley stuff,

223
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,920
because he was Christian. But the space program, I just did a talk on this actually,

224
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,840
the American space program is steeped, especially when it does these certain launches down in Cape

225
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,720
Canaveral. They have to do it at certain times. Certain people have to stand in certain places.

226
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,400
They have these patches that look, you know, in special clothing that they use. I mean, it's

227
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,800
ritualistic. And so that's why I called it American Cosmic, because I wanted to identify

228
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,320
this tradition that we are completely as Americans unfamiliar with. We don't even know about it.

229
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,800
And in fact, if you ask people in NASA today about Jack Parsons, they don't want to know.

230
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,160
They're like, let's not talk about that. That's what I got back when I was doing this research.

231
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,920
It's interesting too, Nate, because the other thing is von Braun, right, was a Nazi.

232
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,080
So you have these, you know how the Nazis were so very much focused on the occult and trying to

233
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,520
harness, I mean, they had, they built rooms and castles and they had, they were, I mean,

234
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,800
they were practicing black magic. I mean, they were doing satanic type things. And then you

235
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,360
have one of those people. That's really interesting to hear. I mean, because yeah.

236
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,720
Yeah. We hear it all the time on our show, because we have a lot of, we have a huge

237
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,640
following of flat earthers who listen to the show and they get really into NASA and the

238
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,360
deceptions and stuff. And it's not really what our show's about. I mean, we talk about creatures

239
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,760
specifically, but we've heard everything from there's orbs associated with Bigfoot to actual

240
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,280
abduction stories and encounters. I mean, there's nothing weird that we've, I mean,

241
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,040
we pretty much have heard it all now after doing this for a couple of years and everything's

242
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,080
strange, but it is, I do argue sometimes with the flat earthers on our show and say, look,

243
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,120
whatever you think, whatever we think we know, it's always 30 times more complicated.

244
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,240
Like NASA is not operating what it tells the public, what it's doing. That doesn't mean,

245
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,480
it doesn't mean everyone in NASA secretly knows the world is flat and they're hiding this from us.

246
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,200
And you're the only one who figured it out. Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah. And so it's, but I,

247
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,280
but I do think you're right that there, there's a lot of occult stuff that goes along with CERN.

248
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,680
It's science, but wait, what are they doing? What are they really doing here? They tell the public,

249
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,840
oh, we're just putting these particles together. No, no, no, you're doing something else.

250
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,440
And so we hear that all the time and it's always good to talk to someone who discusses with these

251
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,120
because these debates go on in our channels all the time. Like what is that? What is NASA really

252
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,200
up to? What do they know? And a lot of this stuff happened around the thirties around Roswell,

253
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,400
suddenly all these agencies sprung up out of the ground. And I think they do obviously know things

254
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,320
that we sort of, you know, debate on our show, like what's going on? Do they have alien tech?

255
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,760
Is, did they, did they go to the moon? Did they not go to the moon? What did they find there?

256
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,400
Where do these creatures come from? So it's all very blurry, but I just think it's complicated.

257
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,400
So it's good to hear you kind of put that to words because I've always kind of associated like

258
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,560
some people know in NASA, but some people don't. And it's just this complicated dance,

259
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,760
but hey, flat earthers, that's not a dig at you. Love having you listen to our show.

260
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,200
You just got to say that. That's exactly the case. So in fact, what I did was in my book,

261
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,360
I created a framework for us to understand what was going on. And the way I did that was I used

262
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,280
a reference to this movie called fight club, which was a book. Okay. So before, and it's a,

263
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:08,240
it's, it's a very, it's a very intense movie, but what it does have in it is this idea that

264
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,960
there's this underground movement that of men basically, and they, they have a club, but they

265
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,440
don't talk about first rule. And since right. Exactly. Yeah. First rule of fight club. Don't

266
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,520
talk about club. Yeah. So, so this is what's really interesting is that the main, one of the

267
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,880
main people of my book is Tyler and I named him after Brad Pitt's character. Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,480
Just a quick pause. We love movie references or at least I do especially. So this is just wheelhouse

269
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,320
movies too. Our show is 80s themed, but any movie reference. So we're tracking loving this too.

270
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:51,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was, so it's not just NASA, but it's also aerospace and the NRO.

271
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,280
So all of these organizations that are, you know, space oriented, they have the rule,

272
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,440
which is basically you don't talk about it. Not only do you not talk about it,

273
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,680
but your boss doesn't even know what you do. Okay. So Tyler's boss didn't even know what he did.

274
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,240
His, the friends that he worked with at the places where he works, they didn't even know

275
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,920
what he did. He couldn't talk about it. He also had these constraints. He couldn't go on the news.

276
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,120
He couldn't go online and look at the news. In fact, oftentimes he would ask me, can you look

277
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,680
at this website? I want to see what it says about so-and-so, right? And I would have to look for him

278
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,880
and tell him because he wasn't allowed, he was monitored that much that he wasn't allowed to do

279
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:40,080
that. So what I did was I unwittingly, not by my own choice, found myself amidst this culture of

280
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,480
people who were so incredibly compartmentalized that oftentimes they didn't even know what their

281
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,600
mission was. He never knew what his mission was. He had to figure it out. Okay. So this is the level

282
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:59,200
of secrecy that was created in order to keep people from not knowing, even the people that

283
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,320
were doing these missions from not even knowing what they were. There was a point when I believe

284
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,160
that, in fact, I stumbled upon names for programs. I didn't mean to, but I did. And then they would

285
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:17,920
change the names to numbers. That's crazy. Yeah. So I mean, that's how it works. Yeah. It's very

286
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,720
strange. Yeah. And then people get mad because like Bob Lazar basically said this and went public

287
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,400
with it. And they're all like, well, there's no record of him doing this and that. And I'm like,

288
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,080
you don't think they could make, they could easily make someone disappear because they barely

289
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,120
have any, you know, like you said, they have, they have this, it's just the shroud of secrecy

290
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,440
that kind of flows through it. I remember my, my ex father-in-law was telling me a story before,

291
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,480
you know, he, he passed away. He was saying that his dad worked in area 51. He said that his dad

292
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,760
came home and told him a story once that his father's in area 51 with clearance, with security.

293
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,240
And yet while he's in there, they had, they were moving something from one, one part of the

294
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,160
facility to the other part of the facility. And they had a bunch of armed guards there

295
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,120
protecting inside this high security clearance area, moving things. Like his dad is like,

296
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,360
I don't know what they're moving, but I'm not even allowed to see what they're moving. And it's,

297
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,520
it was just like, and then later on years later, you hear Bob Lazar story about this and you're

298
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,600
like, they, they didn't know. And he couldn't talk with his other coworkers because they didn't know

299
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,000
what they were doing. And everyone's sort of in the dark. And then skeptics will listen to our

300
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,440
show and be like, ah, these people are all liars and this isn't true. And I'm like,

301
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,880
well, it makes a lot of sense when you hear that, you know, a lot of people don't know

302
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,880
what's going on. And I wonder if that's because if, if they find someone that they don't like,

303
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,920
they can just get rid of them real quick and, and they don't have to deal with it or they're

304
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:49,040
just afraid of it. Yeah. I think, I think that it was a, it was a really genius plan to do this

305
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,240
because then if you want to keep a secret, also they don't write, you know, people, especially in

306
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:01,040
the communities of UFO people, people who are ufologists, they really focus on textual things

307
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,880
like things that are written down by clearance people and things like that. Well, I, I promise

308
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,840
you that they're not writing these things down. So they have communities of oral tradition and

309
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,640
we call it oral tradition where they pass their information to each other in word and they call

310
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,440
it, there's a word for it called pencils up where, you know, okay, this meeting is pencils up, which

311
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,440
means you don't nothing, right? There's no written record of it at all. And so, I mean, it's a genius

312
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,520
way to keep this type of thing quiet. Another strange thing though, that happened was that

313
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,560
the man who I called Tyler, I showed him everything I was going to write about him, by the way, it was

314
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,120
cleared with everybody in my book. They read their chapter and they wrote off on it and said, yeah,

315
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:54,240
it looks good. One thing that happened was that I found out that he identified with Tyler, Tyler

316
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:01,440
Durden in fight club. He even, he even had the soap, the fight club soap, and he also had, he had the

317
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,560
robe, you know, Tyler Durden wears like this purple robe. He had the purple robe that he, he would have

318
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,600
at home that his family would make fun of him for having. I mean, so I nailed his personality.

319
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah. And well, it's not even just UFOs. I mean, it's, it's, it's all the weird stuff. It's, we

320
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,360
talk about ancient history a lot on our show. It's all the, the, the architecture around the

321
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,560
megaliths that there's, you know, this Egyptian timeline that is inaccurate. Egyptologists are

322
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,880
always arguing big foot sightings. Oh, those aren't real. You know, it's every single, and we

323
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,840
constantly go through the archives on this show. We're talking about giant skeletons were discovered

324
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,760
when we, that gets covered up or UFO reports. And this isn't a, this isn't a modern thing.

325
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,520
You can go back in news archives and read about these things and big foot sightings go back

326
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,680
a long time too. So it's just constantly shrouded in conspiracy theory. Nobody wants to look at it,

327
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,680
but it is cool that a lot of, you know, doctors and educated people do come on our show. And every

328
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,080
once in a while, the right personality who's actually applying the scientific method will

329
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,680
come on and say, look at the evidence. It's right here. You have to apply it, but a lot of people

330
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,760
are afraid. I guess they're afraid of like Jeff Meldrum, who's like the big foot guy. You know,

331
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,600
he said all his colleagues would make fun of him all the time. He was constantly being ridiculed

332
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,280
because he's like, look, I have actual evidence. I know what a, I know what a real footprint

333
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,520
looks like. This is not a human footprint. I can, this is what, this is my life's work. I

334
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,160
can prove to you, this is not faked. And yet every, all of his colleagues still laugh at him. So

335
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,360
there's something strange going on in all these areas, whether it's aliens, UFOs or all the

336
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,520
cryptid science. So it's good to hear you kind of talk about this a little bit because we,

337
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,320
we do make that point a lot on our show that no matter what rock we turn over,

338
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,560
it's always this mysterious, the bones go missing or so, so we say on our show all the time. And

339
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:56,160
we even, we even make shirts about it because it's so, I'm actually writing an article right now

340
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:03,120
for a folklore edition for my field that talks about why, you know, why this stigmatized

341
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,240
knowledge, like it's called stigmatized knowledge in my field. Like, and so, you know, people who

342
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:15,680
seemingly are above suspicion in terms of their scholarship, like John Mack, who studied UFOs,

343
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:22,320
he was a Pulitzer prize winning research scientist at Harvard and you know, his own university

344
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,040
put him under investigation for studying UFOs in a way that was, that was, you know, he

345
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:36,240
conformed to the scientific method, you know? So, I mean, I was, you know, I, I was certain

346
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,720
things had changed by the time I started doing this work. And this was, you know, in 2012 on up,

347
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,160
and then my book was published in 2019. But when I would, when I would be asked by usually grad

348
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:54,400
students to speak at their universities, a lot of my colleagues would be horrified by what I was

349
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,800
talking about. And they were sure that I had been misled by people who were not actually who they

350
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,200
said they were. Well, I knew who they were was actually accurate, right? One of those people is

351
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,880
Gary Nolan from Stanford University. He's James in my book, but I couldn't say so at the time,

352
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,840
because the government hadn't yet come out. But then when the disclosures of UFOs started happening,

353
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:21,200
you know, now those people want to write about UFOs. And, you know, and so I just think that

354
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,000
that's disingenuous, you know, because they didn't follow the data then, how are they going to follow

355
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,720
the data now? Yeah, no, that actually has kind of piggybacks on the question I want to ask you about

356
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,840
all this, because your book, like you said, your book is timely, right? In 2019. And now we have,

357
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,800
we talked about before, we have the government, they're holding meetings now Congresses have is

358
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:48,320
holding, holding meetings about UAPs, they're now talking about it. And they even renamed the whole

359
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,920
thing to destigmatize it, right? But do you think that we are in the middle of another like

360
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:01,840
Copernican sort of revolution where, where we're sort of reorienting because because we have this

361
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,360
new, we have this thing that people have been talking about for a long time, but now it's being

362
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,840
talked about in the mainstream narrative, you think that we're in a bit of a revolution in the

363
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,320
same way that like Copernicus in his, in his revelations changed the way people thought about

364
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,280
earth and man and where we, where we said, do you think the things that happen right now,

365
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,360
and we're kind of in the midst of this? Yeah, so I do think that, okay, so first,

366
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:31,200
that Copernicus analogy is really good, right? And I actually did use that in a proposal that I was,

367
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,600
you know, putting together for a book that I'm writing right now. But after assessing it,

368
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,280
I also see that we're in a completely different era in terms of our infrastructure.

369
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:49,120
So, you know, when Protestantism and Catholicism split, there was, it was because of technology,

370
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,600
it was because of the Gutenberg press, right? So the printing press allowed people to read the

371
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,000
Bible on their own without it, you know, being in the hands of priests and such. Right now,

372
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,880
what's happening, this disclosure is not, is not on the timeframe of those who are disclosing,

373
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,120
it's on the timeframe of the people. Because right now you have other space programs,

374
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,600
you have a Chinese space program, and you have other countries that are putting things up into

375
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,920
space, and they're beginning to see what's up there. And so we can't, they're not going to

376
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,440
keep the lid on all these things that are flying around. And by the way, once people see these

377
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,080
things that are flying around, their worldview is open so that they can see other things too,

378
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,680
okay? So they see that reality is not what we've been told it is.

379
00:34:33,680 --> 00:35:02,880
Now, when this happens, I think that, and will we have enough people? I think that we're at a

380
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,320
really interesting point in human history, frankly, and I can't predict what's going to happen.

381
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,920
But I can tell you that, that people have been here before. And if you look pre-Christian even

382
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,960
to like Plato and Plato's Republic and, you know, the cave, the allegory of the cave where people

383
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,280
are like, hey, you know, when Jesus was killed by Rome, a lot of his followers called him this,

384
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,040
called him Socrates. They said, you know, you're like Socrates from back in the day, you know,

385
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,360
you were killed by your government for trying to get people to see what is real, right? And so I

386
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,720
think that we're in that kind of place right now. And I think that we're getting a lot of narrative

387
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,480
framing and we need to be aware of that. And, but I don't think with that, honestly, I don't have a

388
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,920
lot of hope that I think that communities like yours and communities, you know, that I feel like

389
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:00,480
I might be a part of our, we can help each other to identify the BS, right? And the framing that,

390
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,480
you know, no, this is how it is kind of thing. And we're like, no, that's not how it is. We have

391
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,760
brains, you know, we can figure it out, but a lot of people will just go for the bread and circuses

392
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,680
instead. And we, and we can't fight that because technology, this is a good part of my book actually,

393
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,840
is physiologically addictive. So, you know, when you have like, you know, TikTok or something like

394
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,120
that, and I see this, the changes in students because I'm a professor. So the people I see

395
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:33,040
are 20 year olds and I see 20 year olds from 10 years ago, 20 year olds from 20 years ago

396
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,920
and 20 year olds today. And they're different. And the reason they're different is because they

397
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,080
have this thing that they're like sucked into and they're addicted to it and it is changing

398
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,120
their behaviors and everything. So, yeah, I think it's a scary time to tell you the truth.

399
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,040
Yeah. Yeah. And we hear that a lot. I mean, and it's, it's amazing how, you know, when you,

400
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,920
everyone seems to have some sort of experience, whether it's, you know, they see a Bigfoot

401
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,440
and you typically it's people that are the most skeptical who see something like this

402
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,960
or they see a UFO. We had several people come on our show and say these things fly right over their

403
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,880
head. 10, 15, 20 feet and they're silent and they're huge. They're like the size of buildings

404
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,400
and they're doctors. You know, we had a doctor come on and tell us his experience. And I think

405
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,480
that for the most part is that more and more of these things are happening. Bigfoot seems to be

406
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,360
the most cited of the creatures, but the UFO phenomenon is ramping up more and more and more

407
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,640
people are seeing this. And so eventually, you know, they've got to get on top of the story

408
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,440
is kind of the narrative that we hear a lot is that it the, because of the cell phones,

409
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,840
because of the tick tock videos, because of all these things, more and more is coming out

410
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:53,280
every single day. And eventually it's going to be undeniable. And sort of this fake history that

411
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,120
we've all been taught. Someone's got to tell us, you know, the new fake history, I guess you could

412
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,840
say like the aliens seated us on this planet, you know, and they're the ones who did it all. And

413
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,640
it kind of feels like we're, we're being built up to something like that, some sort of ultimate

414
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,680
reveal, some sort of close encounter where it finally happens and everyone can see it.

415
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,880
There are a lot of channels like us who just trying to tell Christians like, Hey,

416
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,840
this stuff's been going on in the Bible since Genesis, wake up. You know, it's, it's right

417
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:25,120
there in the pages. The weird stuff happened. We had encounters with, with angelic realms. They

418
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,120
came in, they messed with us, they gave us technology. And it's like, it's crazy how many

419
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,680
people just don't know this. They've been going to church their whole life and they're like, man,

420
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,680
you know, like we bring on a doctor, he talks about Genesis six and some of the weird,

421
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,280
weirder passages of scripture. And then all of a sudden they're like, I'm in, I get it.

422
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,360
It makes sense. You know, it's not hard. And so what do you think was the moment for you when you

423
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:51,040
were, you, you weren't a skeptic anymore. You, you believed you knew something was going on,

424
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,720
something changed. Like you sort of had your epiphany, I guess.

425
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:04,160
Yeah. Okay. So that's why I'm really always tolerant of people because of my own history.

426
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,800
Right? So as a child, I was, I had super, I had experiences of things and I was a believer,

427
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,200
right? Complete believer in the supernatural aspects of religion, which is by the way,

428
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,400
ironically, why I wanted to study religion. And then when I became a graduate student,

429
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,600
I mean, that's a very intense training that you go through. And I started to study it from

430
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:34,480
a distance, right? It was an evolution that I never acknowledged. It just literally happens

431
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,760
to a person because you're so immersed in communities of like-minded believers. Like

432
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,520
they believe what you're, you know, they're being taught what you're being taught. We all are on,

433
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,440
it's almost like you share their frequency. And so when something weird happens, you don't even see

434
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,400
it because you're not trained to see it. And then what happened was it was, it hit me so hard in one

435
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,000
weekend that what I had been studying my whole life from a distance was actually real because

436
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,080
I heard these people talking about it. And then I, then this happened to me and then this happened

437
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,840
to me. And I was like, Whoa, wait, wait. So I went back and I looked at some of the major,

438
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,320
what I call contact events in Catholic history, where literally people are being

439
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,840
absconded by angels. And I read the original sources. So I looked at them in their original

440
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,080
languages and they didn't look at all like how they'd been represented in art. So we tend to

441
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,080
look at the art and we're like, Oh yeah, that looks pretty, right? This angel encounter looks

442
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,320
really nice. Well, this angel is beating the heck out of this person, you know, it's like,

443
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,880
or this or that is happening. And I was like, wow, no way. And I just went back and said,

444
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,680
this all happened in 2012 during a whole weekend. And it, it, it stayed with me for a whole year,

445
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,880
this feeling of being disoriented because of this. Now, strangely enough,

446
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,400
I was working with these two screenwriters who were the, they're Christians, this Chad Hayes

447
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,400
and Carrie Hayes, and they were the screenwriters for the Conjuring. And I was, I was actually a

448
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,040
consultant on the first Conjuring, the movie. And so I was, and my expertise was in traditionalist

449
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,040
Catholicism, which is what Ed and Lorraine Warren were, you know, they were traditionalist Catholics

450
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:29,680
who believed in demons and they were helping people get rid of, you know, they were exercising

451
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,360
people, helping people. And so those guys who were from California, and I felt like,

452
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:42,080
kind of like akin to them, they were identical twins and they were like Christian and they really

453
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:49,120
wanted the Conjuring to come out with a very intense supernatural message. And in fact,

454
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:54,560
if you look at the last, you know, the quote that Ed Warren says in the last, in the Conjuring,

455
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,640
the first Conjuring, the last scene, you know, it's real, you know, it's real. The supernatural

456
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:09,520
is real and evil is real. Okay. So they were with me that whole time. They lived in Wilmington doing

457
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,440
the filming for the Conjuring. And so I had them to basically, they wanted to know, because they

458
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,680
could tell something was going on. And they said, what's going on with you? You know, are you going

459
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,720
through some kind of like research spiritual thing? And I said, yes, I am actually. And I told

460
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,160
them about the UFOs. And I said, I've become convinced about this and it's changed my whole

461
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,880
worldview. And so, so that's, they, some, they helped me through, you know, we helped each other

462
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,840
actually, because then I showed them what I was doing and I introduced them to some of the people.

463
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:48,800
And so this was my year. It wasn't a moment. It was a whole year in 2012 of waking back up

464
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,320
to the reason why I studied religion. That's basically what it was.

465
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:00,000
Was it, was there any, any moments where you getting outside of that? Like you felt like

466
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,160
maybe it challenged your conventional beliefs that were you, were your faith, were you like,

467
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,400
maybe question your faith and then how did you, how did you sort of traverse that?

468
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,480
Okay. So I never questioned my faith. It made me more faithful in fact, but what it did do is it

469
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,600
scared me a lot. And there was a point where I said, I'm not going to do this because I

470
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:29,280
perceived so much darkness, like so much darkness. I went to a, I went to a conference and this

471
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,560
conference now in retrospect was, it was a conference with CIA. It had some CIA affiliations.

472
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,040
Yeah. And the people there, you know, there were people who believed they were hybrids and things

473
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,120
like that and everything like that. I wasn't, it wasn't that it was the ideas in the conference

474
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:54,400
that were so challenging to me. And this sounds very strange, but I'm just going to tell you how

475
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:03,120
it felt. I felt the dark. I felt darkness. It wasn't that the ideas were dark. I literally felt

476
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:08,880
it. And after that, I said, I'm not going to do this anymore. This is very bad. It's very negative.

477
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,400
And then your amongst your amongst friends here that says that doesn't surprise us too.

478
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,880
Yeah, it was like harsh. It was like, this is really negative stuff and I'm,

479
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,880
I don't want to bring that into my life, but I was, so there were, there were enough good people

480
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,800
who to kind of are in my position who were doing kind of similar things that they kind of helped

481
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:38,400
me come back to why this is important to do right now and why, in fact, I get, I was harassed. I get

482
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:46,080
a lot of harassment. I've, you know, a lot of times I, Gary and I both were harassed and we

483
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:52,240
reported this to, he reported it to the Stanford police, you know, university police, and I reported

484
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:59,760
it to my university police. I'm meeting with a detective this week tomorrow, in fact, about it.

485
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,080
So it's not like you can just go out there and do this research and not and think that, oh yeah,

486
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:11,280
it's going to be all fun. It's not, it's, I don't know why people are doing this, but I do know that

487
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,200
if they're doing it, there's a reason for it. There's, you know, so I have a follow-up question

488
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,920
to that because something I wanted to, because I think this actually fits into that, but you talked

489
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,200
about all the aerospace stuff, right? And the space programs and the ritualistic basis on that

490
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,520
in your research, do you believe that those institutions or people within those institutions

491
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:40,000
believe that they are getting information from ETs or, you know, what we would assume to be maybe

492
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,880
like even demonic stuff, like they are, because there's that thought too that like, and I know

493
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,320
that something that you talked about with Tyler was that he believed that he had this extraterrestrial

494
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,960
knowledge downloaded to him. And when I hear that, to me, it sounds like you're kind of accessing

495
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,120
the spiritual realm. And of course, this is not a new thing. This is as old as Solomon said,

496
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,680
nothing's newer than the sun. But the fact that some of these things are based on ritual,

497
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:08,560
it just got me thinking, like, how much did you run into that where either the technology

498
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:17,360
or the ideas and the idea of technology as well was coming from somewhere else? Like, or,

499
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,640
I mean, I don't know. I'm just, that just was something that-

500
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,960
Yeah, yeah. Well, I think this is an ongoing question. Okay. Definitely many people that I

501
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,080
met who were within those programs that we talked about, believe that they were in touch with ET

502
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:38,560
presences, just like Konstantin, Konstantin Tchaikovsky from Russia believed that he was,

503
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,520
but he thought that they were angelic. Jack Parsons did, but he thought that they he didn't

504
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,880
know what the heck they were, frankly. And, but they looked pretty evil to me. Like, I thought

505
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,000
his whole program was pretty twisted. It was Babylon workings, right? It was all, it was really

506
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,160
like gnarly mystery school, satanic stuff. Oh, it definitely was, but it was efficacious in the sense

507
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,480
that it definitely got us off of earth into space. You know, it did work, I guess is, you know,

508
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,040
for better or worse, I suppose. But- Sounds a lot like, sounds a lot like Gen 6 though.

509
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,560
Sounds a lot like the trading of technology and ideas for, in that case, women, right? It's the

510
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,960
idea that there's this transfer of knowledge, you know, if you ascribe or you look into Enoch,

511
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,840
right? And you talk, which is, you know, just a big exposition on Genesis 6, there's the idea that

512
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:33,360
all of the Watchers taught humans how to cut roots and practice magic. It was all technology. It was

513
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,320
learning the father of animal husbandry and all, you know, all these things that all of a sudden

514
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,200
you have the explosion of technology. So that's what I hear in the space too, is like that they're

515
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,200
tapping, they're getting, they're getting knowledge from something else. Yes. So I mean, yeah,

516
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,240
in the introduction to my book, I basically said that there's a myth of Prometheus, right? Which

517
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,560
is the giver of technology to humans. And he's kind of an, he gets punished for it by the gods,

518
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,080
right? So he's not a god, he's a half god. And he's a Titan. And he's like this, you know, he's the

519
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:10,160
one who gives technology to humans. So it's not, it's a, it's a myth that's been around, but it's

520
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:17,280
no longer mythological. When we get into my book, you know, it appears to be a reality is what I was

521
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,120
trying to say was that how do I talk about this academically when the people that I'm interviewing

522
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:29,840
believe that they're getting technology literally from, you know, ET or some external source.

523
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:35,600
And I, there were various ways of doing that. One was to talk about creativity and what that does

524
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,440
and that possibly makes your brain think that you're actually getting it from an external

525
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,240
source, but you're actually in a certain state of vibration in your brain. So, you know, there's

526
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,680
lots of different, there are different frameworks, not lots, but there are different frameworks for

527
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,080
looking at this. And a lot of people go with the literal framework of, you know, this is a living

528
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,480
myth, this is not a myth, actually, this is real kind of thing, like Tyler does in my book. And a

529
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,600
lot of the scientists do, they're more literally minded than people in the humanities, I guess.

530
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,840
Okay, but let's get back to this idea of feeling that the darkness of this. So,

531
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,120
you know, when you look at Werner von Braun, right, and you look at his, how he created his

532
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:19,040
technologies, we have to acknowledge that he had a concentration camp, you know, where people,

533
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:25,440
there were more people who were killed in the creation of his technologies than actually by

534
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,400
the weapons that came out of his technologies. I mean, could anything good come from that kind of

535
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,000
creation, you know, where people are literally slaves?

536
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,160
Sounds like a ritual too, like you're, it's the letting of blood, it's a sacrifice.

537
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,480
In a macro form, it's a human sacrifice, right? It's, which is really crazy to think about.

538
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:50,560
It's absolutely true. Yeah. So again, in my field, we talk about ritual studies, and there is

539
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,840
René Girard is, I don't know if you know the work of René Girard, but he basically makes the case

540
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:02,160
that, you know, religion came up, especially he's Christians, he's Catholic, and he basically said

541
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:10,400
that Christianity is the religion that recognized that all human progression seemed to happen from

542
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,080
sacrifices, from, you know, ritual sacrifices. And he said Christianity was the one that basically

543
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:22,560
said, let's make this the last sacrifice, let's make Jesus the last sacrifice, and then acknowledge

544
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:29,040
our innate desire to kill each other over things, you know, over basically scarce resources.

545
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,880
Yeah, I mean, I, you know, did the space program, I don't know. That's a lot of stuff that you'd

546
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,560
have to like look into. Yeah. But I can say that all of that stuff is quite disturbing, you know,

547
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,200
and that these are the kinds of things that I worked with when I was writing that book.

548
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,080
And I ended in a pretty negative, like, I wouldn't say I was optimistic at the end of that book.

549
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,920
In fact, I ended it with Martin Heidegger's idea that only a god can save us now.

550
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,760
Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. Luke and I talk a lot of off show about how dark it gets on our show,

551
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,240
just people coming on and sharing their stories. And then it's funny, we were talking in the day

552
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,480
about, man, the last couple of episodes have been dark. And then we get an email from one of the,

553
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,560
our recurring guests who says that she has somebody who's been, came out of the occult,

554
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:19,120
was, was, was a satanic ritual abuse survivor and wants to come on the show, but we have to

555
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,840
disguise her voice and all this different stuff. And it's like, wow, we were just talking about

556
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,360
this loop. I was just telling Nate, I was like, I can't do any more heavy episodes for a while.

557
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,600
Cause it's just, it's a lot. I mean, it's a lot. It is. It's heavy. You know, in the art of war,

558
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:39,200
you need to know your enemy. And so part of, of us being Christians in, in, in understanding

559
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,000
the gospel is understanding that we're also at war. We are, we are caught up in a cosmic war.

560
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,520
You know, we're not fascinated by the darkness, but we want to expose it. We, people need to be

561
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,280
aware. It doesn't serve anyone to put your head in the sand or you're obviously there. You wrote

562
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,320
a whole book on, on traversing the space and yeah, it gets heavy. Nate's, Nate made a great point.

563
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,400
Like, and you, I can see it through, you know, six years of studying this, you ran in some,

564
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,480
as you say, very dark places.

565
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,480
Well, what I think is the one thing that I've learned a lot in the show is just how many people

566
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,760
have carried these burdens, these supernatural burdens, I would, I would say, or something

567
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,280
like that where they don't understand why would God flood the world? You know, they've carried

568
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,160
these, these they believed, but they haven't believed with their whole heart because they've

569
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,960
questioned the Old Testament, a lot of things in the Old Testament, which are very blurry,

570
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,120
like why, what was going on then? And then when you just, when you, when you work backwards from

571
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,880
like some of these creatures that people see today, and it goes all the way back to the

572
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:41,280
corruption of all creatures, you go, Oh, okay. So there's, there's been this occult stuff that's

573
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:48,000
been going on forever. It's not a new thing. The scientists in NASA are doing occult practices.

574
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,440
They were doing this all over the world. They were building the same pyramidal structures

575
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,560
everywhere. They were all worshiping their gods. What happened the last 300 years where we all

576
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,720
just put our heads in the sand and we're like, we were trying to analyze the world inside the

577
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,760
matrix and it doesn't make any sense. It's like, well, yeah, but then somebody will get pulled out

578
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,680
of the matrix and everyone gets pulled out in a different way. And they see something or they

579
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,720
have an experience and they come out of it and they go, wow, everybody is clueless. The hardest

580
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,760
part is the church is clueless, but then you plug in some of these, these things we've discovered

581
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,640
on our show, like Genesis six and such. And then you can, you, you let those burns go like, Oh,

582
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,520
now I get why God needed to flood the world. Human beings were almost went extinct. If you,

583
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:36,480
if you take it literal, you know, and, and we try to apply the scientific method on our show,

584
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,320
we don't, we like, when you say the myth of Prometheus, I almost wonder if like,

585
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,160
I, I, I, I'm going to the belief now that those people that those stories were real,

586
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,360
they just preserve them in a, in a way that we can understand them throughout time. But I,

587
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:56,720
it seems as though those demigods fits right into the Nephilim walks the earth at one point.

588
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's what I was doing. I was trying to open it up from

589
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:09,040
what we consider to be a myth to, I am now in this Smith. That's what I say in my introduction.

590
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,320
I am now in this Smith and I'm going to write this book from being within it and deal with it.

591
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:20,560
Academics, you know, because this is it. You were, you said you were, you were reading about these,

592
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:26,000
these, these original Catholic miracles, right? The, or these, these. Yes. Yes. Did you find

593
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,520
anything crazy in, in, in the Vatican archives? Did you get, did you come? Yes. Yeah. Tell us

594
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,720
because this is. Yeah. I mean, you think. It's a whole, yeah, it's a whole treasure trove of

595
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:44,000
blurry creatures. Yeah. That's what we're talking about. Yeah. Miles and miles and miles. So I saw,

596
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,480
I mean, there were so many things I, we were there to do specific study of Joseph of Copertino,

597
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:58,480
who is a Saint who is said to have flown around, right? Levitated and a lot of UFO abductions have

598
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,760
levitation aspects to them, right? People are levitating up and doing this. I posted on my

599
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,520
Twitter account, a picture of people going into purgatory and it literally looks like a flying

600
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,920
saucer, beaming people up into it. Right. So I wanted people to see that these images were,

601
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:22,480
are so similar and these representations are similar. The interpretations are just different.

602
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,600
You know, they call them souls from purgatory. Then we call them UFOs now kinds of things like

603
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:33,040
that. Right. In the Vatican archive, we came across a lot of things. We came across a woman who's

604
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:40,720
called the woman in blue. She lived in the 1600s in Spain and she believes that she was being taken

605
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,680
by angels kind of flown up above earth into space where she could see the spinning earth. And she

606
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:52,320
described it and taken to what she called the new world, which was basically New Mexico and around

607
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:58,880
that, this, the Southwest, Arizona, all these areas. And she was put down and then she actually

608
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:05,760
interacted with indigenous tribes there. And in fact, one of the leaders, the chief of that

609
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,680
indigenous tribe just called me the other day and I have to return his phone call because he said,

610
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,400
come on, tell me about the lady in blue. Like we really want to know because they have statues of

611
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,400
her and their whole oral tradition goes back to this time period. So there were missionaries from

612
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,240
Spain who happened that they were evangelizing. Right. And so they happened upon this indigenous

613
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:33,360
tribe who already knew the gospel already knew that Jesus's name already knew all of these things.

614
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:38,080
They were like, how did you know, you know, and they said, this lady came, you know, and they were

615
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:43,840
like, what did she look like? And so it, so this is a, so we came upon her records and looked at

616
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:51,280
her records and then my whole episode itself. It was crazy. So I, I had already, I thought I'd

617
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,400
finished my book, but I turned it into my editor. And then once I saw this stuff, I realized I opened

618
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:03,440
my book with going to New Mexico to this specific place. And I recognized that this sister or none

619
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:09,280
believed that she had been at this place that I had been to too, with this guy, Tyler, who I was

620
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:16,080
now at the Vatican Observatory with reading this woman's documents. It was pretty weird.

621
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,360
And so, I mean, how much of that stuff is under lock and key though?

622
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,760
Oh yeah. You have to have special credentials to get in. It's not something you can't get.

623
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,000
Did you see anything about the Nephilim in there or any of that kind of stuff? Or was it?

624
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,680
There's a lot of stuff like that. Yeah. I mean, the thing is, is that you have to understand a

625
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,440
lot of people think that the Catholic, okay. So for one thing, I'm a, I'm a Catholic. I'm a

626
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,640
historian of Catholic thought. I'm Catholic. I was let in because that's what I do. And I

627
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,640
have a PhD. You have to go through a whole series of checkpoints in order to get in.

628
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,920
Okay. So yeah, it is under lock and key and barely anybody could get in there to read these

629
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,320
documents. These documents are really old. Some of them would disintegrate, right? If you touch

630
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,240
them. So you have to be careful with them. The thing is about it is this, and this is to stop

631
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:04,080
any kind of conspiracy theory about Catholicism and Catholics. Like the Vatican is trying to

632
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,480
hide the truth about them. They know what they have. They know that they're weird.

633
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,600
They look at it within their theological worldview that this, these beings existed

634
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:20,080
or exist. And that's okay. That God created everything, right? And that these beings are

635
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:25,440
just part of God's creation. And they don't view them as like, you know, that they're trying to

636
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,400
keep the world from knowing about, you know, these beings, these, you know, the thing is,

637
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,600
is that those, the Catholics right now at the Vatican are doing their hardest right now,

638
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,640
their darnedest to basically digitize those documents because those documents are basically

639
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,280
going away. Like they're disintegrating. Yeah, they really are. Yeah.

640
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,280
What do the Vatican think about, what do they, what do they think about your project?

641
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,120
Did you get any resistance talking about UFOs and then writing a book about you?

642
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:58,720
No, no, not at all. No, I have a lot of friends at the Vatican and a colleague is brother Guy

643
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,680
Consolwanyo, who's the director of the Vatican Observatory. In fact, we were given quarters at

644
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:09,600
the Vatican Observatory to stay. So we lived in those quarters for like a week to do our research.

645
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:17,280
We were given lattes and I mean, it's pretty awesome. I actually lost an original Kepler,

646
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,560
an original book by Kepler. Yeah. So they were, they basically look,

647
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,080
they probably changed the rules after I was there because I went there and I'm like,

648
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,640
they go, yeah, just look at whatever you want, you know? And I was like, are you sure? And they're

649
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,440
like, okay. So I did. I looked at everything. I'm like, okay, they have a whole wall of something

650
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:41,120
that's called extraterrestrial research, research into extraterrestrials. And I was like, I'm starting

651
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:45,520
here. And so, you know, you go through the whole thing, every single day we wake up and we go in

652
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,880
there and we wouldn't leave except for like a latte, right? Or like, you know, or lunch or

653
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,760
something like that. And we go right back. It was awesome. And we go right back and we do the study

654
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:01,440
again. And so I kept a lot of the books out. One of them was Kepler, you know? And for some reason,

655
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,520
this was really fascinating to me because he was talking about magnetism and a lot of these kinds

656
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:10,160
of things. And sadly, I misplaced that book. And so when I got back to the United States,

657
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,600
I got a frantic email from Brother Guy and he said, do you know where the Kepler is? You know,

658
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:23,120
it's priceless, right? And I'm like, oh gosh. Wow. No, I actually remembered, believe it or not,

659
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,520
where I put it. And I said, yes, I do. I do. And they probably, like I said, changed the rules

660
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:32,480
after that. I felt really bad about it. So what, I mean, what did you read in there?

661
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,800
Because, I mean, it's difficult because I feel like something that we talk about on our show a

662
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,840
lot and it gets heated in our channels. It's just like every institution is compromised somewhere,

663
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,000
every institution. It's not just like, oh, this institution is good. This institution is bad.

664
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:53,200
It's just like, there's, there's good cop, bad cop and everything. And so it's hard to identify

665
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,240
because like some of the things you said earlier in the episode, and that's a whole nother rabbit

666
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,600
hole. They're just like, when spiritual entities appear to you and tell you something, and there's

667
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,920
a lot of historical accounts, I mean, how do you know which team they're on? You know, and you don't

668
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,720
and you don't know. It's not that we don't believe it exists. It's just, how do you not be deceived?

669
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,440
And so, but in terms of the Vatican, we've never really talked to anybody who's been inside of it.

670
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:22,000
And we know they have answers, but there's got to be some people in there that are probably not

671
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,800
wanting certain things to get out. I mean, it can't be like a hundred percent across the board.

672
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:32,560
Everyone's, well, there's a lot of people who, who are angry at Catholics and the Vatican for

673
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:38,240
good reasons. You know, I mean, the, the, you know, the priestly pedophile thing, all that kind of

674
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,800
stuff, terrible, right? And the whole, you know, it's been around for a long time. The Vatican was

675
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:48,880
the Roman Empire. I mean, it became the, the, you know, Roman Catholic Empire. I mean, it's like,

676
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,720
when you go through Rome and you look at the, and you go into the Vatican and you go through

677
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:00,320
their museum and everything, you basically see a history of colonization and war. And that wasn't

678
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:06,240
pretty for me to watch or see, you know, it was a lot of carnage. Okay. And, you know, taking of

679
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:13,360
other culture stuff. So yeah, so we're talking about an empire, not just a religion. Okay. So

680
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:19,280
I talked to Peter Gumpel, who some of your listeners should check out. He's super interesting.

681
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,720
He is in his nineties and he was, he was supposed to be a Cardinal, but he didn't want to be because

682
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:31,760
he enjoyed being, he was a Jesuit and lives in the Vatican. And basically he is, he reminded me of

683
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:37,120
Tyler because he had several, he had rules that were very much like Tyler's where he couldn't go

684
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:42,400
online. He doesn't have email. He couldn't see the news. You know, he had to keep his, his own

685
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,280
worldview separate from the world's because you have to understand that they're taking their faith

686
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:55,120
seriously. Christians are in, but of, but not of the world. So, right. So that's where that's how

687
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:00,080
they live. They believe that they're in the world, but they're not part of the world, right? The world

688
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:05,920
lives with different values than like Father Gumpel. Now, does that mean that everyone at

689
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:11,680
the Vatican is like that? No, there's like such corrupt people there, but he wasn't one of them.

690
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:18,880
And so, you know, I, I did my best to find those people and to talk to them. And he was a papal

691
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,400
advisor to the last, how many popes, you know, as long as he's been 30 years old, he was almost

692
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,160
killed by Hitler. His nephew was killed by Hitler. His mother was almost killed by Hitler.

693
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:37,360
He intervened to, to save her. So, you know, he's like, he knows so much history. What does he think

694
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:43,520
about UFOs? What do they think about? There's a great book by brother Guy Consulmano and his

695
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,800
friend who's a Jesuit, who's a father Mueller, and it's called, would you baptize an extraterrestrial?

696
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,680
Would the Pope baptize an extraterrestrial? And that goes along and talks about the whole history

697
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:00,960
of extraterrestrial belief within the Catholic church, basically. So to them, it's not as big a

698
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:07,840
deal as it is to people in the United States, because people have been talking about extraterrestrials

699
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:13,440
in religions for a very long period of time, right? Just like you all say, you know, that it's back

700
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,720
there in the Bible. I mean, brother Guy says, look, you know, just look through the Bible and

701
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:22,640
you'll see reference to beings from other places in planetary intelligences and things like that.

702
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,160
So it's different terms now, right? Like, I mean, literally like angels,

703
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,560
extraterrestrials means not of earth. And so we can think of semantics, which I think is interesting

704
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:35,120
the way, but it's manipulated though, which is very interesting. That's how in most people's minds,

705
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:40,160
those are very different things. Yeah, in most people's minds, they're very different things.

706
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,280
But if you look at the history of Catholicism and you look at like, especially people in the Vatican,

707
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,040
they know about Emanuel Swedenborg, who's talking about angels and people on Venus and things like

708
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:57,600
this in 1750, right? In 1750, there was a bestselling book called Life on Other Planets.

709
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,560
Wow. Well, it's just like, it's like the whole, it's, I think it's why there's so much traction

710
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:05,760
with ancient alien theory is that it just takes all of that and puts it in an alien bucket and then

711
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,760
just says, oh yeah, aliens did this. Aliens came here. Aliens did that. And it's like,

712
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,280
if you described what people will do, that's not, that's not how you would interpret it.

713
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,080
Like it would be. No, no, no. So the Vatican doesn't, this is what they don't want.

714
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:25,360
They don't want, and this has happened in the ufology community a lot. A lot of people who are

715
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:30,400
what I would call UFO influencers, they're not necessarily researchers, but they're influencers.

716
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,520
And they, they like to talk about the Vatican a lot and they say, we're going to go to the Vatican

717
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,280
and we're going to bust open, you know, this thing. Well, guess what? They're not, they're on

718
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,920
the outskirts of the Vatican. Like anybody who's been in the Vatican knows you can't just go into

719
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,400
the Vatican. The guards are different. Like, you know how the guards look really nice on the outside?

720
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,280
The Swiss guards, right. They have special uniforms and everything. When you get in the Vatican,

721
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,640
they're actually scary as heck. I mean, these people have like machine guns and they're wearing

722
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:04,240
full fatigues and you don't go anywhere unless you have, you're with someone in the Vatican.

723
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,520
It's wild. Like I was like, you know, I was terrified of these guys.

724
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:12,080
Yeah. I was lucky to go there. I went there and went to St. Peter's and went around, went

725
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:18,480
to the Sistine Chapel and it was definitely, it was, no, I mean, it was, it was an experience.

726
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,680
I just remember being like, well, there was a lot of people there trying to,

727
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,360
trying to sell you something. They were trying to convince you, trying to sell you tickets to

728
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,440
something that was free. That's what I noticed right away is everyone's trying to like, wait a

729
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,360
minute, that's free. I know that's free, buddy. It's difficult. It was just, but everything's

730
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:38,400
so amazingly old. I think that is sometimes on our show, obviously, yeah, the Vatican does get,

731
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,440
it sort of gets just, everything's blamed on the Vatican. Why isn't here? It's, it's at the Vatican.

732
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:51,040
And I do think that, like I said earlier, there's just, there's so many people that have infiltrated

733
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,760
all these systems and they all have their own agenda and it's, you can't, it's not, there's,

734
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,240
nothing is easy. Nothing is as easy as a lot of the people listening to our show. It's this easy.

735
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:05,120
It's just this one deception. I'm like, no, it's not. It's very complicated. Satan's not going to

736
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:11,680
leave any crumb trail if he doesn't have to. And I just can't get, I just can't get past, Nate,

737
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:17,520
that there's a whole wall, Diana, that you said that was going to ask her that dude, this is insane.

738
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,160
Yeah. Give us a little rundown. What are some of the talking points to that? What was some of the

739
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:31,680
Yeah. Yeah. So in the extraterrestrial research part of the archive, this is at the observatory

740
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,160
because all the, anything that has to do with space doesn't go to the Vatican archive. It goes

741
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:43,280
to the observatory, which is in Castle Gandolfo. And that's a space observatory. And so, so basically

742
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:51,920
they just had from back in the day, you know, from like 1200 onward, what people have thought about

743
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,280
and published about extraterrestrials. And so when they get, when you get into the seventies

744
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:02,880
and when you get like the sixties and the seventies and eighties, it just took off and it got super

745
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,480
interesting. And I could, I didn't have enough time to go through everything, but what I noticed

746
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:12,320
was that the terminology changed. So when you, and this is another way to do archival research is

747
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:17,440
that you don't just look at what's in there. You look at how things are categorized. All right.

748
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:22,480
And if, and if there's a shift in the way things are categorized, you know that something happened.

749
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,640
So I wasn't there long enough to figure this out, but I did have Tyler with me and Tyler was part of

750
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:31,680
the U S space program. So he was able to fill in some of these blanks. But what I found was that

751
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:38,720
when they got to the eighties and certain space missions, they stopped, they were actually funding

752
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:47,600
programs that were in search of intelligent extraterrestrial life. Right. But yeah. But after

753
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:54,000
that, they stopped funding that and they started to search. They did microbiology. Like they wanted

754
01:08:54,320 --> 01:09:01,680
to find like, you know, traces of biological things. Like bacteria meteors and stuff. Yeah.

755
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,320
Yeah. They weren't looking for it. They took out intelligence.

756
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,520
And I was like, why did they do that? That was after the Apollo, one of the Apollo missions.

757
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,440
And so that's what Tyler looked at me and said, think about that. Yeah.

758
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:20,720
Maybe they got the question answered. Yeah. Yeah. So the funding and the funding for the

759
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:26,080
research changed. Absolutely. Yeah. But they tell you, you know, these, these things you can't talk

760
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:31,440
about or you had free access to write about whatever you, you found. There were certain

761
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:37,360
times when I was told to not talk about certain things and in no uncertain terms, basically,

762
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:43,680
like sounds like fight club fight club thing going on here. Talk about it. Right. And I,

763
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:49,200
I didn't. And then what happened was that all of this stuff happened where the government started

764
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:54,320
talk about it and all of those things changed and nobody told me to not talk about it anymore. So

765
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:59,360
I'm talking about, except for referencing people who want to be anonymous, I'm talking about all

766
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,800
kinds of things that I was told not to talk about. And what do you think aliens and UFOs are? I mean,

767
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,200
what's your, what's your take if you had? Yeah, sure. So I think that people have been seeing

768
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:14,080
things in the sky for a very long period of time, as long as humans have existed, it appears that

769
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:18,880
they've been having these experiences. I don't discount these experiences. I believe that people

770
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,720
have them, what they are. I have a professorly view and then I have a personal view and I

771
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:29,440
separate those. So my university won't, you know, so I can say this has nothing to do with my

772
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:35,440
colleagues or my graduate student professors. Yeah. Yeah. I do think that there are,

773
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,720
which is very fight club. Yeah. I'm not in flight club. I'm not. Yeah. So I'm just a professor.

774
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:48,400
I'm not bound by those rules. So I think that there are a variety of these things.

775
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:55,120
And I do believe that we can like, you know, I do believe in these angelic presences and I also

776
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,960
believe in demonic presences. I feel like I felt these before. This is me not as a professor talking.

777
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,400
Okay. So this is just as a human being and being alive and having these experiences. I've always

778
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,240
wanted to know what they were about. I feel like I know I have a better understanding of what they're

779
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:16,800
about now. I feel like we make choices in our lives to open us up to various experiences.

780
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:24,000
And I think that I've, I know people who've had very bad experiences, either drinking a lot or

781
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,520
doing drugs and feeling these, feeling these things, you know, these presences or whatnot,

782
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:37,200
and even without those, you know, and I feel that I try not to go to places that where UFO activity

783
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:43,600
is identified. I do not call any type. I'm not a CE5 person, you know, a close encounters five

784
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:49,360
person. I don't want to be, I don't want to hook in with any other, you know, I, I just don't want

785
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,480
to do that. I don't want to advocate that to anyone. And I believe that, I believe that human

786
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:00,160
beings are made to, like we have kind of like a, some people would call it a God gene. I think we

787
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:07,280
have a predisposition to want to, to know about the spiritual component. You could call it God,

788
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:12,480
Jesus, whatever you're, you know, right. So I believe in that. And I believe that people,

789
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:18,320
if they want, can, can do that. I also have been studying the protocols that people have done,

790
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:23,600
like monastic communities, communities of monks and nuns, and, and the ways in which they've

791
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:29,120
cultivated having experiences of peace and love and goodness and things like that, what you would

792
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:35,040
call, you know, God and prayer and contemplative prayer and things like that. So I think that these

793
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:40,720
things are very real. I think some of them perhaps could be extraterrestrial. I do believe that some

794
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:45,440
of them are interdimensional. So yeah, I believe in a variety of different ones.

795
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:52,000
Yeah. It seems like it gets more complicated the more, the more we rocks we turn over and the more

796
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,240
things we find. And it's not easy. It's not an easy answer. You know, I think a lot of people want an

797
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:01,840
easy answer to a lot of these complicated topics. And it's, it's just not, I mean, it's just human

798
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,520
beings have been given a little bit of information, but we haven't given enough. We've almost been

799
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:11,040
given enough information just to carry on. And we're so, we're so curious. Yeah. The fact that

800
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:16,640
these sightings do go back and the alien, the alien encounters do go back. And I'm surprised as

801
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,400
that there have been more academics involved in this topic than I originally thought when we

802
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,840
started the show. It seems like when you go there, there, there are always a few outliers of people

803
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:34,400
who, you know, apply the scientific method to these blurry topics and, and found some interesting

804
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:41,280
stuff. And I didn't know that there was an archive in the, uh, the Vatican. I've got, I've got one

805
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,640
last question here because I'm curious, do you, having studied the UFO phenomena and then also

806
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,680
having sort of laid that over a religious infrastructure, because that's, that's where

807
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
that's where your expertise is and your study is. Most UFO people probably don't describe to

808
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:02,560
religious beliefs per se. Like you talked about, there's a lot of, like it or not, there's a lot of

809
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,880
spiritual supernatural element to this stuff. There's probably, there's a very physical aspect

810
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:12,560
to a lot of people's experiences and to, there's also a very supernatural. So do you think that

811
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:18,960
there is the UFO in, in this UFO religious space, as you might define it, do you think that they are,

812
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,920
there is a, like almost a come to Jesus moment that could be waiting at the end of that as

813
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,320
people dive deeper into, into this. And then the reason, the reason, yeah, okay. The reason I asked

814
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,200
this is we've, we've talked about this before, Nate, about how in certain communities, and this

815
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:35,040
is in different, not the UFO, but maybe in the Bigfoot community. And I believe this was Duke

816
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,920
and I brought this up on another episode, but I think it's fascinating that people that have

817
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:43,040
encounters, according to some of the people that are doing the research, Bigfoot encounters that

818
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:48,080
a very, a significant portion of those people get saved, which is a really interesting,

819
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:55,440
like reaction to having an encounter. And so my question then is, do you think that for a lot

820
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:00,960
of these people that could end up with, you know, finding their answers in sort of a come to Jesus

821
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:10,240
moment? Yeah. So my, one of the things that I do is I look at people like classic examples of UFO

822
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:16,480
events, right? And I think we could all agree that Kenneth Arnold's 1947, you know, where he's a

823
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:22,400
pilot and he's going over a mountain Rainier and he is the envy, we get the term flying saucer from

824
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:30,400
this encounter that he has. So he has, he's a pilot, he is a smart engineered guy. And his

825
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,440
identifying these things and people calling them flying saucers, he called them flying plates,

826
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:40,480
right? They look like flying plates. We all think that's a nuts and bolts kind of, you know,

827
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:46,880
spacecraft type thing, right? But if you actually go back and you look at what happens to him after

828
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:53,440
his encounter, you realize that he's, he describes these things as beings, as like living things.

829
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:58,400
He also says that he thinks that they're like Ezekiel's wheel. And he also begins to make these

830
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:04,960
prayer cards, like any Christian would know what a prayer card was, right? So he, he has the picture

831
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:11,120
of the flying saucer and on the back of it, he has his philosophy where he identifies this as

832
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:18,000
spiritual and he gives it to anybody who he, he meets. He says, have you heard of this? And he

833
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:25,760
gives it to them because he's become evangelical about his spiritual experience of having a UFO.

834
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:33,120
So my point is this, is that I'm not overlaying a religious framework on UFOs. What I'm doing

835
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:38,480
is I'm looking case by case at UFO events and I'm saying, this looks weirder than you think,

836
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:44,080
everyone. Like this is a paranormal event. This is not just a nuts and bolts craft. You know,

837
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:49,520
you can have all these, you know, pilots in the sky and like, you know, saying, oh, this and that's

838
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:55,440
happening and we take, and, but, you know, you go to the very first pilot in the sky and he's freaking

839
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:01,920
out because now he's had this experience that leads him back to the Bible. And I would, I'd

840
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,520
love to ask you, like, my last question is like, is there a story in your life where you've had

841
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,840
it like a skeptical colleague or someone in your life that has, you know, you've had a conversation

842
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,560
with and they've come full circle? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Can you talk and tell about that a little bit?

843
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:21,520
Yes. So this was actually a colleague of mine who you would think shouldn't be skeptical because

844
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,920
he's at Rice University and his name is Jeff Kripal and he's a friend of mine. And at the

845
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,880
beginning, this was in 2012 when I had just written my book about purgatory and he was

846
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,560
blurbing it. I met him through my, he's in my field. He does religious studies

847
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:41,120
and his background is similar to mine. He was, he wanted to be a monk and then he kind of ended

848
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:48,320
up at University of Chicago in religious studies. Okay. So he's going to blurb my book on purgatory

849
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:53,840
and we both know people in the UFO scene, right? And I start to tell him about my experiences

850
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,640
and he thinks it's really interesting, but he doesn't buy, he buys that UFOs happen,

851
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:04,400
but he doesn't associate them with our tradition of Catholicism at all. He doesn't. And so I say,

852
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:11,040
wait a minute. He did his master's thesis on Teresa of Avila, who has had what looks like

853
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,760
a classic kind of abduction experience, right? That's made into, if you've been to Rome,

854
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,720
you may have seen the statue of Bernini statue of Teresa. It's called the ecstasy of St. Teresa.

855
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,560
And you see this angel kind of with a dart that's going like this to her. And it looks like a

856
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,200
chara, but if you read the original account, so when I had my experience of that weekend,

857
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,360
I looked back at hers and I reread her account of it cause she wrote it down in her diary and

858
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,960
I subsequently had published about it and I read it and I said, my goodness, like she's having this

859
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:45,040
experience that John Mack talks about in his book. So I wrote to Jeff and I said, Jeff, look,

860
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:50,480
you know, Teresa had this experience. He said, no, no, no, no. He said, she didn't Diana. He said,

861
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:56,560
that's Freudian. That's all like Freudian and clearly nothing to do with UFOs.

862
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:03,840
And so I, I did a translation where I, I kind of emphasized like that this being was, she really

863
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:09,040
saw it. It was short. It wasn't like a big angel. It didn't have wings. It had a dart, which she,

864
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,160
which, you know, did like the examination on her and everything like that. And I sent it back to

865
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:19,040
him and it freaked him out. He was like, Oh my gosh. He said, it's, it's like UFOs all the way

866
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:26,000
down. That's wild. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard. I mean, it's, it's, and it feels like that's to me,

867
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:32,720
some of the extent of the, the, the way that religions and the Bible is taught is, is it's

868
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:38,080
like all that stuff is edited out of the story. All those characters are omitted. So we're all

869
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:44,720
kind of confused. And then eventually if we take some of the like verses in Matthew 23, Jesus says,

870
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,480
you know, like the days of Noah, when I'm going to come back, I mean, what does that mean? It

871
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:53,280
feels like those realms that were once interacting with human beings. You know, we, we didn't have

872
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,880
this problem of disbelief. We didn't have this problem of, Oh, I don't believe in any of that

873
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:01,760
stuff. You know, I don't believe in creatures. I don't believe in UFOs. And it was, it was more

874
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,640
like, which side are you on, you know, in ancient history. And then, and then we've kind of gone to

875
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:12,080
this, this, this era where we spend all our time debating if these things are happening. And then,

876
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:17,760
right. And it's, it's such a waste of time because once you get out of that and you realize, man,

877
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,240
this phenomenon is not just in one of these camps, there's so many camps of weird stuff happening.

878
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,320
And we have to spend some time actually figuring out like, what is going on? Because

879
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,040
clearly there's going to be a deception. Like you said, you didn't end your book with like

880
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:37,520
positive note because it sounds like what you hear is what we hear is like, it's going to, to be such

881
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:44,880
a grin, a mine grenade on too many people at once where people aren't going to know what to think.

882
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,280
Because the church is in educating people as a whole. There are some churches that talk about

883
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:56,000
the weird stuff, but as a whole, most people have no idea that our government's trickling this out,

884
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:02,480
that there's this ancient history you don't know. And, you know, a lot of this stuff is undercover.

885
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,800
So I guess we try to be hope dealers on the show and say, you know, this is why you need,

886
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,680
this is why you need a savior. This is why the son of God came to save you, because this, this

887
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:17,280
kingdom of darkness is deceptive. It's big. It's, it's gnarly. So we try to talk about that a lot

888
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,960
on our show and it's really encouraged my faith. It's just like, yeah, you know, I do need a savior.

889
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,200
I do need someone to put my hope in. It sounds like some of your colleagues are coming around

890
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:30,640
when you're, when you're shooting them over some info. They've come around a lot of people. I was,

891
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:36,000
I honestly thought maybe 10 people would read my book, but it seems like it resonates with a lot

892
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:42,080
of people. And people do want to know, and they are wake, there are wake, you know, I hate to use

893
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:46,160
that term waking up, but yeah, they are waking up to the fact that just, that is supernatural.

894
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:52,480
And as much as the, and that the people who are most angry are the people who want it to be

895
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:58,320
spaceships, you know, with technology, they don't want the supernatural stuff because it's too weird

896
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:03,520
for them. But, you know, it's like, you have to go where the data takes you. Yeah. I mean,

897
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,000
that's the same thing. We thought 10 people will listen to our podcast. Yeah. I was going to say

898
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,400
the same thing. Nate and I are just going to do this because we like to have a good time and talk

899
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:16,000
to each other. Right. Yeah. But, and then, yeah, we, we, we hit some of these charts and I'm like,

900
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,920
oh no, this is crazy. I don't know if I want it to get any bigger. No, I know. I know that feeling.

901
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,000
It's like, whoa, we get trolled. Yeah. A lot of people troll us and a lot of people from different

902
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,240
camps and everyone has their, you know, like I was saying, I don't pick on the flat earthers,

903
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,920
but you know, they love our show and they listen to our show and they really, really want us to get

904
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:38,160
into these, these areas. And we're, we're talking creatures, you know, where that's the fences we

905
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:42,640
put up on this show. And sometimes we get out of those lanes, something like a big foot encounter

906
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:48,000
can bring you, can bring your faithful circle. You can, it's almost like it, it's not related,

907
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,680
but it is related. It gives you permission to believe all the strange stuff. Right. And,

908
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,960
and I love all the academics who are giving people permission in these spaces. Hey,

909
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,880
you can believe the weird stuff. It's everywhere. It's out there. And there's metrics for it. I think

910
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,600
that's the other thing. It's important, right? That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Diana, it's been,

911
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,760
it's been a pleasure. Yeah. Do you want to? Yes, it has. Thank you so much. Thanks so much. And

912
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:14,320
do you want to tell people where they can, they can find your work or, and the stuff you're doing?

913
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:22,160
Well, I do have an, an Amazon author page and all my books are there. I have a lot of free stuff

914
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:27,680
that's on academia, edu, and people can look at that too. And it talks a lot about how technology

915
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:33,120
and us interface, you know, and what that means for the way that we believe stuff. But yeah. Oh,

916
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:38,320
and I have a Twitter account that's, um, I try to stay off of a lot of social media because of the,

917
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:44,080
the trolling that goes on, you know, it's just not good for anyone. Yeah. But I do have a Twitter

918
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:50,240
account, D W Pasolka. And, um, I post stuff there and there are a lot of supportive people there

919
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:55,360
too. So, yeah. Well, if you ever want to come back and do like a deep dive on the Vatican.

920
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:01,280
Oh, I will. Yeah, absolutely. That would be fun. Cause yeah, I feel like it's, it's shrouded in

921
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:05,840
mystery a lot. We're, we're trying to get someone who knows a lot about the Vatican and someone

922
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:11,200
who's been inside the Smithsonian knows a lot about that, that, that institution as well.

923
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:16,080
If you know anybody who's willing to spill the secrets on the Smithsonian, we'd love them.

924
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,320
Oh, that would be a good one. I'll get one of my colleagues who does that and I'll do the Vatican

925
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:24,160
and he or she could do the Smithsonian. That would be a cool show. Disguise your voices,

926
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:30,800
who you are so we can tell all the secrets. Yeah, exactly. We're always trying to figure out what's

927
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:35,200
going on in the, in the blurry, the blurry versus what we call it. Oh, that's cool. I like that.

928
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:40,880
We're grateful for your time and you know, you have, you have five teenagers. So, um,

929
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:45,280
we know you're Andrew, the chair, your, your academic chair of your department and you're

930
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:49,680
writing books. So grateful spending a couple, you know, spend some good time here with a couple

931
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:54,640
knuckleheads and just, just want to ask questions. Thank you. And so, yeah, everybody check,

932
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:01,680
go check out American Cosmic. Uh, big shout out to Matt Maher, uh, who recommended we reach out to

933
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:07,040
you and, uh, and actually did, did some show notes for this. So Matt, you're, you're appreciated.

934
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:13,040
Oh, cool. Yeah. But we, uh, now we're, and my sister, Jim Davis alumni, Davis alumni.

935
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:18,720
That's right. Yeah. So we got North Cal here. Yep. Yeah. And, and thank you for praying for us.

936
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,360
And I don't know if that'll end up on the episode, but you know, cause we started,

937
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,680
I don't know if we'd start recording already or not, but appreciate that. And, uh, thank you for,

938
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:29,440
just thank you for, thank you for taking time as value and time is, is valuable and we just

939
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:33,200
appreciate your time. So, oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Take care. Thanks so much. Thanks,

940
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,000
guys. You bet. Take care. Good to meet you.
