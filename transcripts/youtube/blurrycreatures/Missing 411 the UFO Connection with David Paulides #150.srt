1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,800
Some locations, the answers for the conundrum is easier to explain and others, it's not.

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Now, the biggest cluster of missing people that fit our profiles is Yosemite.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,400
Now, the biggest location for the most condensed granite in the world, Yosemite.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,200
Now, I knew that right away, but I didn't know until other people much smarter than me

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:39,400
started to explain that granite has certain elements about it that no other stone or rock has.

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,300
And the way it conducts itself, the amount of quartz in it, et cetera, et cetera, it's just different.

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,000
So is that the reason that all of these things are happening around Yosemite or is it something else?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,800
Is it that between these giant, giant pieces of granite, there's a river that runs right in between them, or said river.

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,600
Well, there's water and there's granite.

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,100
Is there something about that that opens a portal or opens up something that we don't understand?

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,400
It opens a portal, opens up something that we don't understand.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,600
The history of our earth is so different from what we can imagine.

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,600
The Smithsonian, if they found out about a large skeleton somewhere, was to go get it.

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I'm going to assume at least one person is right, because if one person is right, it busts the paradigm.

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,800
It all goes back to the fallen cherub.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,200
And the problem with the modern day church, they have a very truncated view of the supernatural.

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,500
They have a very truncated view of the supernatural.

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,400
This backdrop that's just pregnant with all kinds of meaning associated with this Mount Hermon event.

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,300
And this guy defects from the kingdom.

20
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,500
That's a big deal.

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,400
Welcome back.

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,000
Welcome back.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,800
It's Blurry Creatures.

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,600
That's where we are, dude.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
Blurryverse, welcome.

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,200
And today we have a really good one for you.

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,900
We have David Politis from Missing411 coming on the show.

28
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,400
Finally, we have been emailing Dave since the show started.

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
We wore him down.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
It's an honor.

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I think you and I both have been fans of Missing411 and Dave's work.

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
We've predated this podcast by a ton.

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,200
One of the things we talked about initially was, even when we were talking about the Bigfoot realm,

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,000
we wanted to get Dave to come on the show and talk to him about the phenomena of these missing people

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,700
because he's such a measured, empirical, and really law enforcement approach to eliminating plausibility for these cases.

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,800
And he came out with this film this year, Missing411, the UFO connection.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I mean, it's just the right time, I feel like, in our story, too.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,000
And really in this day and time to talk about the connection between missing people and UFOs.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
And we've done a bunch on the show.

40
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,700
We've had everyone from Tim to actual people that have been abducted,

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,400
to members' episodes of being offered the blue drink by the grays,

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,100
to this subset of cases that is just phenomenal in every sense of the word.

43
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,600
Yeah, it's funny because when you think about a podcast,

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,400
you think about where your mind is when you start a podcast and where your mind is after episode 150.

45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,400
And this is going to be episode 150.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
I was just thinking about that, Luke.

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
150 episodes of Blurry Creatures, and we got David Paulides on.

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,200
And I think it's taken me 150 episodes to even understand some of his work.

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,700
He's been doing this for a long time, two decades.

50
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,800
He's been in the space.

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,700
He's been, you know, part of MUFON, which is the UFO stuff.

52
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,100
And when we started the show, I didn't know a whole lot about aliens.

53
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,300
I didn't know a lot about abductions.

54
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,100
I didn't know a lot about these things.

55
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,900
And so it's really good to, you know, have 150 episodes to prepare for an interview like that.

56
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,700
So pretty pumped.

57
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,600
Like this one's going to be a good one.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,900
Really lucky to get Dave on the show.

59
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,700
You know, he's been on Coast to Coast radio and he's been on the Had His Own History Channel show.

60
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,100
So Dave's done some pretty big stuff.

61
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,800
He's got three documentaries out.

62
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,300
Yeah, we're just super thankful that he gave us some time.

63
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,400
He's a busy guy.

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,700
So I love it.

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,400
Let's get Blurry.

66
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,900
We stay Blurry all day, Luke.

67
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,100
You and I are just Blurry 24 now.

68
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,200
Never turn it off.

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,100
Just a fire hose of juice.

70
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,600
Yeah, and if you want to get the extra juice, go to BlurryCreatures.com

71
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,600
slash remember to get the extra juice and you can get access to all the bonus material,

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,300
chat rooms, chats, all kinds of things.

73
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, extra content, extra episodes.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
Discounts on merch.

75
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,500
And one of the big things too, Nate, is the first crack at event tickets, right?

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,600
So we've got BlurryCon coming up in less than a month and a matter of weeks at this point.

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,900
And those went directly to our members.

78
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,300
So there are going to be more events and we've kind of alluded to that.

79
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:16,700
And this gives you really an inside track to join us as we get super 80s and super Blurry

80
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,400
and talk to the experts in person.

81
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,700
And we're doing that here in Franklin, Tennessee at the end of February.

82
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,500
And those will be things down the pipe that you are going to want to have a first shot at.

83
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
And in addition to everything we've talked about,

84
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,400
membership allows you to have the first shot at that stuff as well.

85
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,200
Sure does.

86
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,000
All right, well, let's get Dave on the show.

87
00:05:50,400 --> 00:06:00,300
So welcome to the podcast, The Legend of David Politis.

88
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,700
You're a former San Jose police officer and we are NorCal natives.

89
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,700
So we know I grew up in Sacramento and Luke was in Chico.

90
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
So we know the Northern California area.

91
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,700
You're a best-selling author and now a documentarian, released several films.

92
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,800
A lot of them I've watched and love these films.

93
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,100
You've been investigating missing person cases for over 20 years

94
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,600
and you've researched over 7,000 cases and your new movie Missing 411,

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,800
the UFO Connection is right where we are with our show, Dave.

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,700
Thank you for coming on Blurry Creatures and talking about this film.

97
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,900
Hey guys, it's an honor to be on and I appreciate the interest very much.

98
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
We were kicking off like how to start this conversation.

99
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,900
I think one of the one of the questions we Luke and I had before you got on was

100
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,000
when in your investigations did you start noticing there was a UFO connection

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,800
and has the government sort of disclosure and some of these things that are happening now

102
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,100
kind of allowed you to be more vocal about some of your theories

103
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,700
in terms of the UFO being connected to the Missing 411 phenomena?

104
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,400
So I've been a MUFON investigator for almost 17 years.

105
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,500
So I've always had an interest in the UFO topic, abductions, what people are saying

106
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,000
and once something is definitively pointing to a cause,

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,100
I'm not going to take that big leap and say, oh, you know, it is.

108
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,200
So we just kept accumulating data, kept going through cases

109
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,900
and developing these things called profile points

110
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,100
and profile points are something that are found in the majority of the cases that we research

111
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,900
and the most common one is that you bring a canine to the scene

112
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,900
and they can't pick up a scent or you bring professional trackers to the scene

113
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,300
and they won't be able to track the person from the point that they were last seen.

114
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,700
Now thinking along those lines, the first 50 I saw like that,

115
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,400
it baffled me because I worked on a team that the canines were attached to

116
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,400
and I'm not kidding a hundred percent of the time the canines were now we got the person.

117
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,300
So when I started to read about these things, it didn't make any sense at all.

118
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,200
And then the more I got into it, the more I found out how prevalent this is.

119
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,700
So keeping that in the back of your mind, as we went forward,

120
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,300
we started to look at all the commonalities that these things had.

121
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,900
So weirdly, let's say two hunters go into the woods and they're coming up to a mountain.

122
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,700
They say, hey, you go left, I'll go right.

123
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,500
I'll meet you on the backside of the mountain.

124
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,700
Well, between that point and the point that the other hunter reaches the backside of the mountain,

125
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,100
the other hunter disappears.

126
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,800
And the point of separation is two people together separating,

127
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,200
going their own separate ways for whatever reason.

128
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,200
A lot of times it's just, hey, we're going to go explore different places.

129
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,100
A lot of other times it's somebody feels ill and they're going back to the car.

130
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,200
And it's when that happens, something odd goes on.

131
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,100
A person disappears and it's unexplainable.

132
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,400
And it's almost as though something is watching and waiting for this point of separation.

133
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,900
It's very, very, very rare that two people disappear

134
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,800
and it's almost non-existent that three people disappear together.

135
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,100
But in the vast majority of these cases, it's one person hunting alone,

136
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,400
or fishing alone, or hiking alone.

137
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:29,000
And in the movie, we had information about a certain area of Wyoming

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,800
where there was a lot of people missing and nobody ever put it together.

139
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,100
But just looking at the names, I could see that they were all German, which is odd.

140
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,000
And we kept backing up and we went into Idaho.

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
And we knew that a case we worked on in the first movie was in Idaho.

142
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,500
And then we found some hunters that observed a UFO hovering above them in the middle of nowhere, Idaho.

143
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,200
And then we found a case where there's a group of workers for a warehouse or corporation

144
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:07,300
and they're planting trees in the ground up on this hillside, just outside of Mount St. Helens.

145
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:15,600
There's 15 guys on this ridge and they see a UFO fly up this valley, hover over some elk.

146
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,100
All the elks dispersed except one.

147
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,600
It goes down, it picks up the elk, carries the elk away.

148
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,200
All of the hunters that we talked about were all elk hunting and they were all German.

149
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,800
We talk a lot about on our show, Dave, about we talk about the DNA aspect of ancient history

150
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,100
and sort of we joke a lot that our show could be called DNA Wars.

151
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,700
And as I was watching this documentary, I kept thinking about the German descent.

152
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,900
You have these abductions, whether it seems like it's reproduction, it's DNA oriented.

153
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,100
What are your thoughts? How has your thoughts progressed about what they're doing?

154
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,200
Are they doing breeding programs?

155
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,600
Because we brought on people who've been abducted and they've been pregnant and then they go up

156
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
and then they come back and they're missing pregnancies.

157
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,600
I know the elk was pregnant.

158
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,300
You said you found the elk or they found the elk and then they found out it was pregnant.

159
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,700
So there's some similarities between reproduction, bloodlines and in this whole UFO abduction phenomenon.

160
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,500
Yeah, and then Carl Higdon comes back and says he doesn't, he thinks that they,

161
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,700
well his abduction story comes back and says he doesn't think he was kept,

162
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,500
which is really crazy like to think that the people are getting kept because he had a vasectomy.

163
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,100
Yeah, exactly.

164
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,500
What do you make of that?

165
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,700
So, God rest his soul, Carl has passed on since we interviewed him.

166
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:38,400
And he was a super smart guy, sharp for being as old as he was.

167
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:45,800
And when he said, yeah, you know, I think the reason they didn't keep me is because I had a vasectomy.

168
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,600
And I said, well then the implication being that they would have kept you had you not had it.

169
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,400
And he said, yeah, I think so.

170
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,300
And then the other hunters that we talked to their families about, they did not have vasectomies.

171
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,100
We interviewed one on film about that.

172
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,700
But I don't know, it's a pretty odd coincidence that works along the lines of your thinking.

173
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,200
And then the elk thing is bizarre too, Dave.

174
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,900
It's like, I mean, you know, no Carl's testimony was that they were you know,

175
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,100
they're coming to get deer and elk and then fish for food.

176
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,700
But I mean, I just think it's what you put together is fascinating.

177
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,400
Like I don't it's more than coincidence, right?

178
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
They're all German.

179
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,700
They're all elk hunting.

180
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,500
It's just like mind boggling.

181
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Keep this thought that back in the 70s, Colorado State was doing a study on chronic racing disease

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,700
and a couple of elk got loose right near the Wyoming border.

183
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,100
That's kind of what started chronic wasting disease in the United States, believe it or not.

184
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,300
And it's essentially in every county now in Wyoming.

185
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,800
Wyoming has some of the most vast coverage of it in the North American properties.

186
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,300
And chronic wasting disease, it's a prion disease, same as mad cow disease,

187
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,800
very similar to mad cow disease in that it's always fatal.

188
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,400
And mad cow disease was told by the government in Europe that would never cross over to man.

189
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,900
So don't worry about it.

190
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,100
What eventually did is it did cross over and it killed hundreds of people.

191
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,900
So they killed 14 million cows in Europe because of this.

192
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Now here, if you read like Wyoming, Montana, any of these fishing game sites

193
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:39,000
and they talk about chronic wasting disease, it says do not eat the animal

194
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,400
if it comes back with the disease.

195
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,800
But then there's another paragraph that says it's never been known to cross over to humans.

196
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,600
But why would they say don't eat it if it didn't cross over to humans

197
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,400
or if they weren't distinctly afraid it was going to?

198
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:03,000
Now in the elk case in Washington, these workers see this elk taken by this UFO

199
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,600
and Mufon comes out, does an investigation.

200
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,600
And then they're told by a warehouser that their property has been identified

201
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,700
as a point by the Washington fishing game as an area that has many animals

202
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,300
that are infected with chronic wasting.

203
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,000
That's pretty unusual because Washington isn't claiming at this point

204
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,100
that they have any chronic wasting at all, but they privately tell warehouser this.

205
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,400
And there's this elk being taken by this UFO.

206
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,800
Now in the biggest area with the most chronic wasting disease in the United States,

207
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,700
the area of where Higdon was taken in Southeast Wyoming,

208
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,400
we have this huge number of hunters, all elk hunters that have been taken.

209
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,000
Now is something monitoring our food sources and how that affects us?

210
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,100
That's the question I have.

211
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,100
Because the multiple accounts of people being on craft with the elk,

212
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,100
or at least in Carl's case, he says he's there with them

213
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
and then he comes back and that's what he's saying.

214
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,500
He's concerned about the elk when he's coming too.

215
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,600
Do you think that when I was watching that, are you trying to build a case

216
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,100
that maybe this is how the humans are being abducted

217
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,400
the same way that this elk was taken, maybe that's how they're taking people?

218
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,200
No, I just kind of report the facts that are supported.

219
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,500
In Carl's case, one of the few abduction cases

220
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,600
where there's any physical evidence at all of it happening,

221
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:39,800
namely, Carl had lung lesions before he was abducted.

222
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,200
He comes back and his doctor looks at his lungs and they're completely clean.

223
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,300
Then he had a bullet that he shot at some elk while he was hunting

224
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,100
and it says that it hit this invisible barrier.

225
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,600
When it hit the barrier, he went down and picked up the bullet.

226
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,300
He still had the bullet.

227
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,400
It was analyzed by the Wyoming Department of Natural Resources.

228
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,800
You have his lungs, you have the bullet, you have him missing.

229
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,500
One thing we couldn't fit in the film is the location where he parked his truck

230
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,600
was moved and they found his truck in the middle of a swamp in that forest

231
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,500
with no tire tracks going in and no tire tracks coming out.

232
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,200
That's something we hear a lot on the show, as abductees will say,

233
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,700
they come back and they're on a different side of the room

234
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,400
or they're in the bed upside down or they'll say to us,

235
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,300
they don't feel like they're being put back in the same way.

236
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,100
It almost feels like when these people are taken,

237
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,600
they're dropping stuff out of this craft as they're going to and from

238
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,500
or they'll put it back almost and it's scattered around.

239
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,500
They don't even care.

240
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,600
Do you feel like something like that is happening?

241
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,000
I know you like to stick to the facts, but it seems like they're almost

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,100
dumping garbage out.

243
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,800
It has that feel.

244
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,000
There was a huge epiphany moment to the crew and myself

245
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,300
when we were talking to Carl and I said, so what happened next?

246
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,100
That's always my question.

247
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,200
What happened next?

248
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,500
And they said, well, next thing I remember is getting the feeling of falling

249
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,200
and I hit this mountainside and I rolled down and I hurt my shoulder.

250
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,600
He goes, that's how they got rid of me.

251
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,400
Now in these stories that I've written, I've written about 12,

252
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:33,300
1400 people, a lot of times there's somebody is claimed to have fallen

253
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,600
to their death or they fall in an area that doesn't make any sense

254
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,500
or the angle of the hillside is so small that it doesn't make sense

255
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,900
that they would fall and get that seriously injured.

256
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,200
Yet if I dropped you say 20 feet above that very small angle,

257
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,300
it would have looked like you fell and you died to hit your head, whatever.

258
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,000
But there's a lot of these cases that I've written about in the past

259
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,700
that don't make any sense.

260
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,400
When Carl explained how they got rid of him,

261
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,600
it's like a light bulb went off in my head.

262
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Dave, there was the one you pointed out in the film was the boulder field

263
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,900
where, I can't remember who was found there, but they found...

264
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,400
It was like 50 years later, right?

265
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,200
Or a number of years later, they find the body in a space that they...

266
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Was his name Ray? His name was Ray, I think, right?

267
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes.

268
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,200
Was that Ray Salmon? Was that his body?

269
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,600
No, Ray Salmon has never been found, but Ray owned a gas station in Idaho.

270
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,900
He went out bow hunting and he disappeared.

271
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,800
And the hunters that saw the UFO in Idaho actually knew Ray

272
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,900
and their dad knew Ray.

273
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,900
And every year that they went out hunting, they would look for him.

274
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,000
So when Ray disappeared, there was a massive search by the sheriff

275
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and friends of his in Salmon, Idaho.

276
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,700
And every year for 50 years, people went out into this area,

277
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,200
he disappeared and looked.

278
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,600
And then last year or two years ago, the same place,

279
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,700
it's been searched a thousand times.

280
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,600
All of a sudden his body was remains turned up at the bottom of this boulder field.

281
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
So weird.

282
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,800
Dave, I had a question on that.

283
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,600
In your previous films, in the hunted and in the original,

284
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,300
after doing this film, are you looking backward

285
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,100
and seeing a lot of these same earmark things in those cases?

286
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,400
Or is it that you've thought this,

287
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,100
you talk about being a part of MUFON for 17 years,

288
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,500
you've thought about this all along

289
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,500
and this film was the culmination of those two pieces of work

290
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,000
and then presenting new cases you hadn't talked about.

291
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,700
But you think you've drawn pretty much the same sort of conclusions now

292
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,500
in like the hunted and in the original?

293
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,400
Because it seems a lot of the same,

294
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,000
like you people find backpacks and folded clothes

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,800
and bodies are showing up places, you know, it's the same thing.

296
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,000
And I know you talk about, you know,

297
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,900
1500 or so cases over the last 10 years that fit all these profiles.

298
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,600
Are you looking back and saying this could be UFO

299
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,500
or is this one saying, hey, this is what on the body of work

300
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,800
in the first two films, I think there's a possibility in most all these cases.

301
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,000
So in the first film, Missing 411,

302
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,200
you highlighted a series of disappearances of small children

303
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,800
that covered phenomenal distances.

304
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,600
I know it's hard for people who've never had kids

305
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,300
to appreciate the disappearance of a child

306
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,700
when they say are found nine miles later in 12 hours.

307
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,800
The kids just can't do that at two or three years old.

308
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,700
And in the years prior, I had met Les Stroud,

309
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,500
survivor man and Les and I had worked together on some things

310
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
and he said, Dave, your work is phenomenal.

311
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,600
You know, if you ever have a documentary or something

312
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,000
and you want me, I'm there for you.

313
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,900
So we had this case where a child in Oregon had vanished

314
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,400
and they needed searchers.

315
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,100
They got in there.

316
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,300
They search for 12, 14 hours

317
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,200
and accidentally they find this child nine miles away

318
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,000
from where he was last seen in 12 hours.

319
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,600
And everyone says it's impossible.

320
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,200
Well, that is impossible based on him going over two mountain ranges

321
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,900
over barbed wire fences and being found face down in the snow.

322
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,500
So I call up Les and I say, Les, this is the case.

323
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,900
The number of miles you have to maneuver through during the dark

324
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,800
because he went missing at 4.30 in the afternoon

325
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,900
and he's found the next morning real early.

326
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,000
I said, can you do it?

327
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,500
He goes, let's do it.

328
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
So we put a film crew with Les

329
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,300
and we start off where this boy disappears

330
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,600
and he's heading towards where the boy was found

331
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,300
and at about midnight he stops everybody and he says,

332
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,200
hey, we're going to kill ourselves.

333
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,800
We're going to step off a cliff.

334
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,500
There's no way this kid did this.

335
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,600
So you stop right there for a second

336
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,400
and there's only a couple of options.

337
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,700
And, you know, this family lived in the middle of nowhere.

338
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,100
So is it a crime?

339
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,100
Somebody, a neighbor chased him and take him.

340
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,800
Well, if that was the case, then, you know,

341
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,100
they'd probably dumped the kid next to a road, you know,

342
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,500
in from a car or truck.

343
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,300
They wouldn't dump him in the middle of nowhere.

344
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,600
This boy was found in the middle of nowhere.

345
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,100
So the first movie was kind of to get the idea out there

346
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,800
that something phenomenal is happening

347
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,800
because it'd be easier for people to understand kids

348
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,600
traveling these phenomenal distances doesn't make sense.

349
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,500
The second movie dealt with a series of hunters

350
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,500
who disappeared and some of the unusual qualities

351
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
that were associated with these hunters.

352
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,800
And then this movie, I've said it in a couple

353
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,000
of conferences that I've attended.

354
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,200
I swear guys, it felt like Dave was being led around

355
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,300
by the nose to these different cases

356
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,700
and the storyline was almost given to me in my brain

357
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,000
somehow, I have no idea.

358
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,100
But what we started to do and what we ended up doing,

359
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,000
entirely different.

360
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,100
Wow, yeah, I was gonna say that.

361
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,800
I mean, I've watched all the films several times

362
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,000
and it felt like you, I like the way you do it

363
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
because you give people the data and you let people

364
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,400
come to their own conclusions in a way

365
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,900
so they can rule out everything in their mind,

366
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,200
all the weird stuff.

367
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,700
I mean, obviously this is a weird phenomenon

368
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,600
but they can, all the rational things that your mind says,

369
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
well, this could happen or a bear did it or this and that,

370
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
you know, you wrestle yourself

371
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,400
but I like the way you do the films

372
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,000
because it leads you to, you rule out all the options

373
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,400
and then your mind is ready for this film

374
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,500
which has some really weird stuff in it.

375
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,800
Like Carl, you know, he's shooting at this invisible

376
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,300
force field, this entity called Ozo, right?

377
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,000
Comes out and offers him these pills,

378
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,300
these pills like float at him

379
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,200
and Dave, we get real weird on our show

380
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,400
so this is nothing that our listeners can't handle.

381
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,300
But then, you know, he takes this pill

382
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,500
and then he's in this craft

383
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,800
and basically they find out, oh, well, you're, you know,

384
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,500
you're not fertile, you can't,

385
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,900
you don't have the reproductive thing that we need

386
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,400
so they dump them off and I think it's taken me

387
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,900
a long time, Dave, just to accept a story like that

388
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,000
but I mean, doing the show, watching your films,

389
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,800
years and years and years, do you feel like sometimes

390
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,100
you have to slowly take people along

391
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,200
because the cognitive dissonance kicks in

392
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,000
and they don't wanna, they can't deal,

393
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,300
you can't just dump it all on them in one film kind of thing.

394
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Well, I think that if somebody watched this film first

395
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,300
and they really didn't know anything about me,

396
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,000
it may be a hard one to swallow

397
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and if you didn't really know that I follow this hard line

398
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
of, you know, hey, look for the facts,

399
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,300
it has to have evidence, people have to be credible

400
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,800
and if it's not, then I'm not doing it

401
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
and there's a lot of cases that we've done,

402
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,400
that we filmed that never made error

403
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,800
because in the end, after we thought about it,

404
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,000
it's just not credible.

405
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,100
Carl's case to me was 100% credible

406
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,300
just because there was all this

407
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
supporting factual evidence too.

408
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,100
Every time Carl went hunting, every time he went

409
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,000
with his wife, the first time he ever went hunting

410
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,500
without his wife and I suppose I didn't make that case

411
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,300
hard enough but his wife explained this

412
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,500
and again, it's that point of separation

413
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
so really this is the first time Carl was ever alone

414
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,300
in the woods without his wife

415
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,200
and as he's walking along and he says,

416
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,600
this thing comes along and kind of tosses him these pills

417
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,500
and he takes them, of course my first thinking is,

418
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,000
what are you doing?

419
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,700
You know, this odd looking thing walks in

420
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,200
and you know, speaks with you

421
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,800
and all of a sudden you're taking the pills.

422
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,000
We talked about it as a crew later.

423
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,800
Carl described this thing as not having real hand,

424
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,500
it had like a strange hand and it didn't have real hair,

425
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,100
it was almost like straw hair and then we thought,

426
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,800
this almost seems like it's some kind of robotic thing.

427
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,800
It's not really human because it doesn't come across

428
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,600
in his descriptions as human even though it's speaking

429
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,000
to him in a response like human way.

430
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,200
It's very strange.

431
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,800
And I know that they did a lot of after the fact,

432
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,300
they would do some hypnosis and try to get some of the facts

433
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,500
because a lot of people come on our show

434
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,200
and say that these people get screened memories.

435
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,700
They're not, they don't, a lot of times

436
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,500
they don't remember exactly what happens.

437
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,900
These memories are put in their minds

438
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,000
and so it's really hard to get past those screen memories

439
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,500
to get to the actual story of what happened.

440
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,200
And I like that you, you know, you show that a couple times

441
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,300
in the film where these people were, you know,

442
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,900
they weren't just, hey, let's just tell me your story.

443
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,400
They're actually trying to get to the behind those memories

444
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,100
and figure out exactly what happened.

445
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,500
And I remember, you know, I was thinking in Mark's case,

446
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Mark, is it strip, strip, strip mater, stripe mater?

447
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,340
How do you say that?

448
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,180
Strip mater.

449
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,100
Strip mater, he, he said that you have,

450
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,700
that the UFOs were following him multiple times

451
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,900
and it sounds like that this wasn't just a one

452
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,500
and done moment where the UFOs were kind of doing

453
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,300
scouting missions almost, like they were seeing them

454
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,700
before the actual abduction took place.

455
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,100
Do you think that that's something they do

456
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,900
like scouting missions and then they picked their moment?

457
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
Good question.

458
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,800
That was another huge moment in our filming

459
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,600
when his girlfriend said that to us.

460
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,500
We couldn't believe it.

461
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,200
And she, she didn't know really anything about the crew,

462
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,200
the film project, me, what we were doing,

463
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,100
what we were after.

464
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,600
I just told her, hey, we're here to film the story

465
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,600
of your boyfriend who disappeared.

466
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,800
But she didn't, I told the crew,

467
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,400
I don't even think she knew my last name.

468
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,600
So when she said that, it was stunning to all of us.

469
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,600
And the thing about Mark is that he was,

470
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,800
wasn't just a normal weekend hunter.

471
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,100
I mean, he was a guide, an outfitter.

472
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,600
He knew the area.

473
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,500
He had hunted thousands of times since he was a kid.

474
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
He probably felt more comfortable in the woods

475
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
than you and I would in our own neighborhood.

476
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,900
So for him to disappear, not be found,

477
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,100
or search and rescue people to say on camera,

478
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,400
it was a strange search.

479
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,000
We couldn't find any scent trail and we should have.

480
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,900
The whole thing was strange.

481
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,600
And that's what their words were.

482
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I thought it was interesting too, Dave, in that story

483
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,300
that she sort of nonchalantly, maybe not even,

484
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,800
like you say, not knowing the arc of your story

485
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,600
was like when we go hunting together, we do this.

486
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
We put the key in the gas tank.

487
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,300
When we go hunting together, again, he's now alone.

488
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,600
And you can think back to the Ray Salmon

489
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,500
who would be the two hunters in Idaho

490
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,700
who had that crazy encounter with that really huge craft

491
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,900
and they're both together.

492
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,100
And they see it and they draw it and they tell the story.

493
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,300
It's almost like, hey, you don't want to see a UFO

494
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,900
by yourself, you want to be with a pal.

495
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,200
Yeah, you know, in that case where those hunters in Idaho

496
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,700
were seeing that triangular craft above them,

497
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,600
I said, I also said in the premier party

498
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,900
that in hindsight, when the guy walked out to his truck,

499
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,300
stepped up on his wheel and saw this thing up above him

500
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,700
and his buddy was in the woods taking a pee.

501
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Yeah, whizzing as he said, yeah.

502
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,100
Yeah, maybe it was a really good thing

503
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,300
that his buddy came back quick.

504
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,900
Yeah, yeah.

505
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,600
Hey, on that note, I had a thought.

506
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,000
Dave, what are your thoughts on when kids like the Dior

507
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,300
or when kids disappear or when they're standing

508
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,900
next to their, because it seems like if you're an adult

509
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
in these cases, if you're adult and you're alone,

510
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,300
you disappear, if you're with, you know, in these cases,

511
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,800
if you're with another adult, it doesn't happen.

512
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,600
But sometimes kids, is it kids just getting out of view

513
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,700
or kids, it's almost like it's a little different.

514
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,300
Like a kid could disappear almost next to someone.

515
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,100
Is that something you're seeing

516
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,400
or am I just kind of reading between the lines there?

517
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,300
No, there's several cases where parents said,

518
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,900
hey, I just turned around for a minute

519
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,100
and I turned back and they were gone.

520
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,600
I didn't hear anything.

521
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,000
And it's hard for me to understand how my son

522
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,800
or how my daughter got away from me that quick.

523
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,800
So there is this almost in your presence kind of thing,

524
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,400
turn your back and they're gone.

525
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,100
So in the movie, there's a retired FBI agent

526
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,900
who actually got a series of cases

527
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,700
that supported the first year of the X-Files.

528
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,200
They used his case book to write the first year

529
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,700
of the X-Files, if you can believe this.

530
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,300
And named John DeSouza.

531
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,200
And I met John a couple of years ago

532
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,100
and what he says is exactly what makes sense,

533
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,200
but it's things that people would have a difficult time

534
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,100
even understanding, let alone believing.

535
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,000
So a couple of years ago,

536
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,800
I did a show called Vanished for the History Channel.

537
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,900
And you can watch it on Amazon right now,

538
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,200
History Channel still owns it.

539
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,100
But the point of it was,

540
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,000
they sent me around to these different locations

541
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,900
where these people disappeared.

542
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,500
And we're looking for answers

543
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,200
and there was a physicist in Wisconsin named John Brandenburg.

544
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,800
I went up and met with John all day

545
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,500
and he's a theoretical physicist for NASA.

546
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,200
And we'd sit around, we just talked

547
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,400
and they use snippets of those conversations in the segment.

548
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,600
Most of it didn't make it, unfortunately.

549
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,600
But John said, Dave, number one, portals, 100% real.

550
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,900
We have multi-dimensions in our world.

551
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,600
Maybe the dimensions are endless,

552
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,900
but portals are obviously controlled.

553
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,400
This is his words.

554
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,300
He says, there's a group of us,

555
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,000
theoretical physicists that we meet regularly

556
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,200
and discuss how a control mechanism

557
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,000
could be placed on that portal.

558
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,100
And so the questions I had for him was,

559
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,500
a guy's climbing up the side of Mount Shasta,

560
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
just like a Sunday hike.

561
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,000
He's in the middle of nowhere on this hike

562
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,700
and nobody's around.

563
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,700
There's no crevices, there's no anything.

564
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,540
Where did he go?

565
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,100
And he goes, well, Dave,

566
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,900
if a portal can be directed and we think it can

567
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,200
and it could be pointed at that man,

568
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,700
then he's gone and there's no evidence of him ever being there

569
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,100
other than his tracks going to that point.

570
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,800
Now keep that same thought,

571
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,100
go back to John D'Souza

572
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,700
and John saying essentially the same thing.

573
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,900
We have these multi-dimensions

574
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,900
and people can cross over dimension to dimension.

575
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,400
And he's explaining all this.

576
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,000
And then in the end I go, John,

577
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,200
I meet a family.

578
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,600
They lose their child in the woods.

579
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,300
Now all the evidence posts to this,

580
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,400
how can I ever explain this to him?

581
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,100
And then not to think I'm nuts.

582
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,100
He goes, Dave, 100% right.

583
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,200
Portals, 100% right.

584
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,600
We have multi-dimensions in our world.

585
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,100
We have multi-dimensions in our world.

586
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,100
We have multi-dimensions in our world.

587
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,600
Why do you think when people do go missing

588
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,100
that they put some,

589
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,100
it's almost like they take the time to put some things back,

590
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,100
you know, because you see them scattered all over the place.

591
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
If someone just gets taken,

592
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
they go through one of these dimensions or portals,

593
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
why even bother coming in?

594
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,600
Because it doesn't make any sense

595
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,100
why you'd find a shoes here,

596
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,100
a gun over here.

597
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,100
Folded clothes.

598
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Yeah, why even bother coming in?

599
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,100
Because it doesn't make any sense

600
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,100
Yeah, why would they even bother to put some of these items?

601
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Is it trying to like mess with us or what do you think?

602
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,100
So I heard something pretty brilliant

603
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,100
is that what piece of clothing on you

604
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,100
has the most bacteria?

605
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Shoes.

606
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,600
Well, why would they want a bacteria-ridden device

607
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,100
on their sterile ship?

608
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,100
That's a good answer.

609
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,100
That sounds like a good answer.

610
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,100
I don't know if it's true,

611
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,100
but it was a theory that somebody had

612
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,100
and I thought, hmm, that kind of makes sense.

613
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,100
You know, that's pretty good.

614
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,100
Now, the folded clothes,

615
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,100
do you read enough about abductions

616
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,100
that a lot of people end up on,

617
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,100
let's say, an aluminum-type table naked

618
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,100
and they do weird things to their body

619
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
according to abductees?

620
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Well, where'd the clothes go?

621
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
No.

622
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
And why they're folded?

623
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
I have no idea.

624
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,100
And the biggest question I have,

625
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,100
and I think that it would be,

626
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
hindsight's always 20-20,

627
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
but I would have loved to have been in law enforcement

628
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,100
walking up on the scene

629
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
and a missing person's gone

630
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,100
and there's their folded clothes.

631
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,100
I'd be sending that out for forensic analysis.

632
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Yeah, it's just such a strange phenomenon

633
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
that it's like they took the time

634
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
to fold these things up and then place them.

635
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,100
I think it was, was it Ray Salmon

636
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,100
where it was just on a log

637
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
and they were folded neatly near the river,

638
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
right near the beach in the river there,

639
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,100
and it's like, I don't know what it is.

640
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,100
It's kind of like a nephew or something to people.

641
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
It's like, we're just gonna fold your clothes up

642
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:27,100
and leave them here and take the guy with us.

643
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
What do you think about,

644
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,100
it sounded like when I was listening to Carl's story,

645
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Dave, that they were,

646
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,100
these entities were almost harvesting the elk.

647
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,100
They were hunting them as well, eating them as well.

648
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,100
That's kind of the impression that I got.

649
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
What do you think about that?

650
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,100
My personal thought is, no, they're not eating it.

651
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:50,100
I think that they're taking the elk out to test them

652
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,100
for chronic wasting.

653
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Because, again, that area of Wyoming

654
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
has the highest concentration of CWD

655
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,100
probably anywhere in the U.S.

656
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,100
And then that elk that was taken in Washington

657
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,100
by that craft was in a cluster of chronic wasting disease.

658
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Supposedly, Washington doesn't have any,

659
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,100
but Fish and Game in Washington admitted to Warehouse

660
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
or that this one area did.

661
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
And then they see this craft taking that elk.

662
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
That's too coincidental.

663
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
And it was pregnant too, right?

664
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Yeah.

665
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,100
Crazy.

666
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,100
So, I mean, if they are doing experiments,

667
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
and we hear about this a lot on our show

668
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,100
that it has to do with some sort of reproduction,

669
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,100
some sort of, do you find things after the fact?

670
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,100
Because it's almost like you have to be,

671
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
almost to be like a doctor and look like,

672
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,100
are there specific blood types?

673
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,100
How deep into the physical anomalies

674
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,100
of the person themselves being taken?

675
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
Because it seems like there is,

676
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
there's a reason certain people get taken

677
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,100
and other people don't get taken.

678
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,100
And I know you can't know everything about this person,

679
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,100
but it seems like there's more to do with bloodlines

680
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,100
and things like that

681
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,100
and some sort of reproduction experiment

682
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,100
or it's in that arena.

683
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,100
You touched on something that's a trigger point to me

684
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,100
when you talk about blood types.

685
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Because there's some people in the UFO arena

686
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,100
that are really pushing this.

687
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,100
There isn't one ounce of factual data to support this.

688
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,100
And the reason being is that your blood type

689
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,100
is protected information under HIPAA.

690
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,100
Federal law says that a government agency

691
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,100
can never figure out or try to figure out

692
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,100
or get from you your blood type,

693
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
because that's protected.

694
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
So it's never going to be listed on any reports.

695
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,100
A coroner is never going to do your blood type.

696
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Search and rescue is never going to list it.

697
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
So it's nowhere to be found.

698
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,100
The only person who knows your blood type is you and your doctor.

699
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,100
And to get it from your doctor is going to take a court order.

700
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,100
And it's going to have to be some really hard stuff to find it.

701
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
So people always ask me,

702
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
well, Dave, in the thousands of reports,

703
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
how many times has this blood type come up?

704
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
No, no, no.

705
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,100
I've never seen a blood type in thousands of reports.

706
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Dave, you touched on something I was going to ask you,

707
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,100
and I'm going to want to go back to it real quick.

708
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
The Mount Shasta incident I think is one of the ones

709
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
that I was always like, man,

710
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
that he had to walk into a portal.

711
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
And you said that, which I think is unbelievable.

712
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
The Reinhard Kirchner in this film,

713
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
when you told that story,

714
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,100
I immediately thought of the Mount Shasta incident.

715
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Do you think that maybe the same thing happened to him?

716
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,100
So in my work, I've identified six physicists

717
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,100
around the world that have disappeared.

718
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
That's wild.

719
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
That's wild in the first place.

720
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
Truly bizarre.

721
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,100
All six are German.

722
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100
I worked for a month

723
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,100
trying to find a case of a missing physicist

724
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
that wasn't German,

725
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,100
and I just found another one that was German.

726
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,100
So there are no physicists in the world missing

727
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
that aren't German.

728
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,100
That's so weird.

729
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
So in Reinhard's case,

730
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,100
I think something really bizarre happened.

731
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,100
He, a smart, healthy guy

732
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,100
in an area on Navajo property,

733
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,100
going to study this gorge area

734
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
that he had been to before,

735
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,100
and as the Arizona state police

736
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
and the sheriff were there

737
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,100
working up his truck and camper like a crime scene,

738
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,100
some people that are running sheep out there in the area

739
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
came up and said, hey,

740
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
this truck's been parked here.

741
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,100
There's been some UFOs flying over it.

742
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,100
And they thought it was so credible.

743
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,100
They put it in the report.

744
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
Yeah.

745
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,100
And again, I've never seen that in a police report before.

746
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,100
Yeah, that's a big one.

747
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,100
If you're going to stick it in there as an officer,

748
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,100
you're an ex-cop.

749
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,100
You know, to put that in there

750
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,100
and then sort of have to answer for that.

751
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,100
Well, you know, I had another question.

752
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Go ahead.

753
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,100
It seemed like there was a theme in the movie

754
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
that, you know, you were talking about

755
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Pat McGuire's story when the aliens told him to dig the well

756
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,100
or the entities told him to dig the well.

757
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,100
And then, you know, because there might have been a cataclysm,

758
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,100
and then you kind of alluded that

759
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,100
maybe they're taking the elk because of this disease,

760
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,100
that maybe these entities are in some way

761
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,100
like helping humanity in some way.

762
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,100
I mean, I know those narratives are very dicey

763
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,100
because they can pretend like they're helping us, right?

764
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
Or they can make it look like they're trying to help us

765
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
and then be our friends, you know?

766
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,100
But it seems like there's a little bit of theme like there.

767
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,100
What do you think about those stories and those ideas?

768
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,100
A lot of theories about this.

769
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:04,100
One of them is a lot of UFOs exist underwater,

770
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,100
underwater submerged objects.

771
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,100
There's a lot that are in the ocean that are seen by Navy

772
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,100
and Coast Guard and maritime people.

773
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,100
And there's a map that I have that I made up

774
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,100
of all the missing cases in the United States.

775
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,100
And north to south, right through the middle of the United States,

776
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,100
there's this huge barren path there.

777
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,100
And I have hundreds and hundreds of cases plotted on this map.

778
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,100
And I've heard a million theories about why this area

779
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,100
in the middle of the U.S. doesn't have any cases.

780
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
That's a great question.

781
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,100
So I get this email one day from this guy who says

782
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,100
that he worked for a U.S. Geological Survey.

783
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,100
And he goes, Dave, you know what's in the middle of that?

784
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,100
And he says, it's the Ogawala aquifer.

785
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:56,100
And damn, it's like a perfect match over that area.

786
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,100
Well, then I'm sitting in the office of the city attorney

787
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,100
of Rock Springs, Wyoming.

788
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,100
And he's telling the story about Pat McGuire.

789
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,100
He says it's an offshoot of the Ogawala aquifer

790
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,100
that goes into Wyoming, this little tiny arm

791
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,100
that the aliens tell McGuire to dig and get water.

792
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,100
I'm one of these people who thinks, you know,

793
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
they're not doing anything to help us.

794
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,100
There's some reason.

795
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,100
Well, what if the Ogawala aquifer was their maritime base underwater?

796
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
They could survive underwater.

797
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,100
They have bases underwater, supposedly.

798
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
So what if that is where they're at?

799
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:35,100
And they need these exit points at certain time to come out of.

800
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,100
That was one of the theories that kind of rang true

801
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:43,100
because the Navy and other armed forces around the world

802
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,100
have seen these UFOs come up out of the ocean.

803
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,100
In fact, the submarines have seen objects past them

804
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,100
like 200 miles an hour under the water.

805
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,100
So they have these special abilities that water really isn't an object

806
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,100
to them to live in or live under.

807
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,100
But it's an excellent point of concealment.

808
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,100
And everyone likes to think, well, you know,

809
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,100
maybe all these entities coming from eons and eons ago

810
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,100
and traveling through space.

811
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,100
No, what if they're right here and they're underwater

812
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,100
and they come out when they want to?

813
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
I like that theory.

814
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,100
Yeah, I think that's fascinating.

815
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,100
We talked to a guy that was on the Nimitz

816
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,100
when they had the famous Tic Tac episode.

817
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:29,100
And he had said that actually the Naval pilots also reported

818
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,100
seeing things in the water, moving at high speeds under the water

819
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,100
then coming out and going back in.

820
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,100
So I mean, that's what you said, that the people in the Navy have seen this.

821
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,100
There's one thing I wanted just to ask you about this

822
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,100
because this is one thing when I was watching the movie,

823
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,100
when you had John DeSouza on,

824
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,100
and he specifically said something that I think is very interesting

825
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,100
onto that comment you just made as well about maybe they're coming from here,

826
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,100
is that he said that they were extra-dimensional.

827
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,100
It wasn't extraterrestrial, which of course means not of Earth.

828
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:05,100
It was extra-dimensional when you guys were having a discussion

829
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:10,100
about UFOs and then his role in reporting those

830
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,100
and overseeing some of that stuff at the FBI.

831
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,100
I thought it was pretty profound because in the UFO space,

832
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,100
there's all kinds of thoughts about where planet do they come from?

833
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,100
But to have him say he's extra-dimensional,

834
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,100
and you mentioned before about the fact that we live in a dimensional world

835
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
and the physicists talk about portals,

836
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,100
but was that surprising or was that right in line with what you expected

837
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,100
as far as his conclusions about that?

838
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:42,100
I've had a lot of meetings with somebody who spent a ton of time at Skinwalker Ranch.

839
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:48,100
In fact, this person was the head of Bigelow's investigative team at the ranch for years.

840
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,100
His name was Colm Kelleher, and I met him through George Knapp.

841
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,100
Kelleher and I met several times in Las Vegas where he lives,

842
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,100
and we talked about the similarities in the research.

843
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,100
In one of George Knapp's books about what Kelleher's team saw at the ranch,

844
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,100
they observed like 20 feet above the pasture,

845
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:17,100
a window frame open up and this creature crawl out,

846
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,100
jump down onto the land and run off,

847
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,100
and essentially kind of sounded like a Bigfoot.

848
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,100
And then the window or whatever closed and it went away.

849
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,100
So is that another dimension opening, another portal opening?

850
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:37,100
But then there's also talk at the ranch that that same team had seen animals

851
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:44,100
that they had seen before in school that they'd identify as dinosaurs running along,

852
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,100
and then they'd run into the bush and they'd just disappear.

853
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,100
So there's something happening,

854
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,100
and if it wasn't Bigelow's team of ultra-credible people,

855
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,100
I wouldn't have believed it,

856
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:02,100
but knowing who they were and their backgrounds, it's all believable.

857
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,100
So when John DeSouza said this,

858
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:10,100
it fell right in line with what I knew was happening at the ranch too.

859
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,100
That's awesome.

860
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:18,100
Because they say there's a ton of stuff that the Bigelow and that research team discovered as well.

861
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,100
It's all under lock and key,

862
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:26,100
which is always fascinating to think about what they haven't told people about that place

863
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,100
and about what they discovered there.

864
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,100
But yeah, I just thought that was super, super profound to say extra-dimensional.

865
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:39,100
So remember the beginning of this movie starts off with I'm on coast to coast with George Knapp.

866
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,100
Yeah, yeah.

867
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,100
And George kind of, it's near the end of the show.

868
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,100
I didn't know what was happening, but he says, hey, let me tell you something.

869
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,100
He tells this story.

870
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:55,100
Well, what the person was who he went to Washington to meet was a defense intelligence person

871
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:00,100
who ran a DIA project at Skinwalker Ranch.

872
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:07,100
And this was given to him by Harry Reid, a Senator from Nevada, to make this connection.

873
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,100
But George goes out there and at the end of the meeting,

874
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,100
this DIA rep goes to George, hey, you know, Dave Politis.

875
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
This is the story George told.

876
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,100
And he goes, yeah, I know him really well.

877
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,100
And he says, well, we think the work at the ranch has something to do with Politis' work.

878
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:29,100
And this is the first time anybody outside of the ranch research has ever been tied to the ranch,

879
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,100
which is important, I think.

880
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,100
When are you getting your invite?

881
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
When are you going?

882
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,100
You know, you got to really ask yourself, after you do the research there,

883
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,100
and they have these things called hitchhikers that follow you home.

884
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,100
Yeah.

885
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,100
I don't want any of that.

886
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,100
That's like a smart, that's actually a smart one.

887
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,100
Well, that's what I was going to just say.

888
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,100
Like a minute ago, Dave, you were talking about the water.

889
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,100
And I just watched something that was relating to,

890
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,100
I don't know how into the spiritual aspect of these things you get,

891
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,100
but the fact that when Jesus walks on the water was so much more profound

892
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,100
and then he claimed dominion over the water.

893
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,100
And the water in the ancient days was connected to sort of a portal to the underworld or the,

894
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
you know what I mean?

895
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,100
It was this, not only was it a miracle in that he's walking on water,

896
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,100
but that's why Peter got so afraid because he was,

897
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,100
it was like he was sinking into the abyss.

898
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,100
It was so much greater.

899
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,100
And do you think about those things at all?

900
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,100
How does the spiritual aspect kind of cross your mind in some of these cases

901
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,100
when you're looking into it?

902
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,100
Oh, it's front and center.

903
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:42,100
I think that there's a lot of crossover in many of these things.

904
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:48,100
I mean, if you look back at a lot of the drawings that are even thousands of years old,

905
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:53,100
there's strange things in the sky on some of these drawings and art.

906
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:58,100
And we've talked about the Nephilim in the Bible,

907
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:04,100
talked about how that can be related to Cain and Abel

908
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:08,100
and how that could be related to what's happening.

909
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,100
Did we lose him?

910
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,100
Davey there?

911
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,100
I lost him.

912
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,100
Oh man, just when it was getting good.

913
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,100
Let me call him again.

914
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,100
I saw you with him at Cain and Abel.

915
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,100
Of course.

916
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,100
I know, right?

917
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,100
That was weird.

918
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,100
Somebody didn't like us talking about that.

919
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,100
Yeah, I guess so.

920
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,100
Hey, David, cut out at Cain and Abel.

921
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,100
Yeah.

922
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,100
Did you guys hear that click before that?

923
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,100
No.

924
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:43,100
There was like a double click and then like a two second pause and then it went dead.

925
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,100
Who's listening?

926
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:54,100
We always joke on our show whenever we talk about the Giants, the Nephilim, that audio just doesn't work.

927
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,100
It's kind of a running joke.

928
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,100
Things just don't happen again.

929
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,100
I know, right?

930
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,100
It's wild.

931
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,100
We get into a lot of that on our show.

932
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,100
That's really kind of what our show is.

933
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,100
That's where we lived.

934
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,100
And so we're all ears for any of that.

935
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,100
Whenever you want to talk about that, we'd love to.

936
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:23,100
But anyhow, yeah, the Bible aspect and not just the Bible, but just the spiritual side of things as well.

937
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:29,100
All of that stuff comes into play and we think about it all the time.

938
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:38,100
Dave, on that note, this could be absolutely just a no, but have you had any experiences yourself being out in these places and going into these interviews?

939
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,100
You're actually going to these places where this stuff happened, right?

940
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:48,100
There's these epicenters as you put those casings on the map and you make these triangles and you actually go out there.

941
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,100
I mean, did you have any experiences?

942
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,100
How did it feel?

943
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,100
Does it have a different feel or just feel like you're in the woods?

944
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,100
I've told this story before, but I'll say it again.

945
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:07,100
There was a girl who disappeared outside of Lander, Wyoming, and Angie and I went out there.

946
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:12,100
And I like to go to the place for a multitude of reasons to understand the circumstances, the topography.

947
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:18,100
And you get there and the area she disappeared in is this giant swampy area in the mountains.

948
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:23,100
I've always said, you know, people seem to disappear more around water, especially in swamps.

949
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:28,100
Well, there's this one dirt road that goes through the middle of this giant swamp area.

950
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,100
I said, okay, let's just take it.

951
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:33,100
We go about four or five miles down this dirt road to the end of this swamp.

952
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,100
And it kind of ends up in this small hill and then a valley behind it.

953
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,100
And it's in a gorgeous area of the high mountains of Wyoming.

954
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:50,100
And we get out and next to us, and I didn't know how far it went because I didn't have a map and I didn't have a drone.

955
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,100
But I'm guessing it probably went two or three miles to the east.

956
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,100
It was more swamp.

957
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:06,100
And I said, you know, I remember talking to Native Americans and sometimes an opening to that other world is you clap your hands real loud.

958
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,100
Angie goes, yeah, just try it.

959
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,100
So I clap my hands real loud twice.

960
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:18,100
And there was probably 20 feet between our car and where the swamp started, and it was just all dirt.

961
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:32,100
And from the swamp, it sounded like there was a herd of 50 elephants coming at us all at once, super loud, angry.

962
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:38,100
And I'm looking at the tops of the treetops out there because I figured they're going to start falling.

963
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:45,100
And we just got behind the car and probably 20, 30 seconds it went on.

964
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:49,100
And it didn't sound like it was getting closer or it was going away.

965
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:55,100
It was just like this constant sound of this giant, giant, rumbling herd coming at you.

966
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:02,100
Then it stopped and there was no dust out there, obviously, because it's water and one of the weirdest things I'd ever seen.

967
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,100
And this is exactly where this person went missing, too.

968
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,100
Wow. That's wild.

969
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,100
Just doing a show, you know, just getting into the paranormal space.

970
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:20,100
I mean, most people say when the closer you get to the truth, the more that the truth doesn't that's like it doesn't want to be exposed.

971
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:25,100
And so it's going to fight back from keep people, keep people asleep, keep people sheep.

972
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:30,100
And if you do shows like this or you do work like you do, there's a price to pay.

973
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:35,100
I mean, in some capacity, everyone who's trying to get the truth out there is dealing with something.

974
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:41,100
And I can't imagine going to some of these locations and just and it's hard, too, because you're dealing with lost people.

975
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:51,100
And I like how you like you start this film to keep a warm and compassionate heart for the missing because it is these family members are losing somebody and they don't they don't have anything to go on.

976
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:57,100
And they're kind of lost. And it's hard for them to accept maybe some UFO craft is involved.

977
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:02,100
It seems like some of the people you interview, they've they've come to that conclusion already, though.

978
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:08,100
You know, if they have ninety five percent of them would never say it.

979
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:12,100
And I'm not going to be the first one that's going to broach that topic.

980
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:16,100
Now, you guys have an open mind. You're willing to listen.

981
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,100
You're willing to look into areas that most people wouldn't.

982
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:23,100
But think about Ma and Pa Kettle in the middle of the U.S.

983
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:29,100
And let's say they come out to Yosemite with the family for the first time and all of a sudden somebody disappears.

984
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,100
So if we start to broach this topic with them, it'd look like you were nuts.

985
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:37,100
And they just tell you to take off and bother me.

986
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,100
Right. Yeah.

987
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:45,100
So it's it's one of those topics that you have to walk carefully with.

988
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,100
Yeah, I think there was there was something that I think you said toward the end.

989
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:54,100
It was that our way was John de Souza talking about it's not provable solely in a physical world.

990
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,100
And I think that's it's so true in these cases.

991
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:03,100
Right. Is that you just when you get to a point where you can't you can't find any plausible conclusions,

992
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:08,100
you're not left with a whole lot of other options other than the fact that these people potentially being abducted.

993
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:14,100
And I had one question like these cluster in this one thing you talk about, there's 64 clusters.

994
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:22,100
Why do you think that these particular places you have you have broken bow in that area and then the area in Idaho and you put them on the map?

995
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:26,100
Other than its its proximity to to the aquifer, we talk about overlaying that.

996
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,100
Why do you think it happens in clusters? I just kept thinking that like, is it the same?

997
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,100
Is it because this is like certain areas for that same?

998
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,100
I don't know what you call it ship or entity or whatever.

999
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,100
Or do you think that that's their territory perhaps where they are?

1000
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:44,100
I hate to say like they are, but they're hunting or they're looking for for a victim to snatch.

1001
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,100
It's just it's weird. Right.

1002
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:50,100
If you had these all spread out sort of randomly on a map and there wasn't any correlation,

1003
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,100
I know correlation doesn't always equal causation and all that.

1004
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,100
But in this case, it's like they there was one.

1005
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,100
I can't remember which one when you were talking about Dave in the movie where the disappearance happened on the same day.

1006
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:06,100
It might have been strip matter on the same day, essentially 30 years from at the same time that I think it was Carl was taken.

1007
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:16,100
And this is just the locale kept getting like what is happening in these very specific locales that these things continue to happen or happen in bunches.

1008
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:24,100
Some locations, the answers or the conundrum is easier to explain and others it's not.

1009
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,100
Now, the biggest cluster of missing people that fit our profiles is Yosemite.

1010
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:35,100
Now, the biggest location for the most condensed granite in the world, Yosemite.

1011
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:43,100
Now, I knew that right away, but I didn't know until other people much smarter than me started to explain that

1012
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:50,100
granite has certain elements about it that no other stone or rock has.

1013
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:56,100
And the way it conducts itself, the amount of quartz in it, et cetera, et cetera.

1014
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:00,100
I won't go into it now, but it's just different.

1015
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:05,100
So is that the reason that all of these things are happening around Yosemite or is it something else?

1016
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:13,100
Is it that between these giant, giant pieces of granite, there's a river that runs right in between them, the Merced River.

1017
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,100
Well, there's water and there's granite.

1018
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:21,100
Is there something about that that opens a portal or opens up something that we don't understand?

1019
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,100
But why Yosemite?

1020
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,100
Yeah, it's like Sedona.

1021
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:31,100
The only experience I have is Sedona is very much, I think it was two years ago.

1022
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,100
David and they have like a UFO tour, right?

1023
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,100
And I was like, let's do this.

1024
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,100
I thought it was going to be kind of hokey, but there's a bunch of weird stuff I saw.

1025
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:45,100
And on that tour, of all things, they told us that the mountain there in Sedona they call Thunder Mountain is like,

1026
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:50,100
I forget the percentage, but it's super, super high percentage of quartz.

1027
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,100
And on this, there was light phenomena.

1028
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:57,100
There was, I mean, it literally looked like ships coming up and down as we're watching.

1029
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,100
And this is the experience I had.

1030
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,100
And it sounds just like that.

1031
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,100
And I don't know, I don't know what the missing people, if there are that sort of thing in Sedona.

1032
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:09,100
Sedona is a weird place, but it sounded exactly like what you were saying with Yosemite,

1033
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,100
which granted, that's fascinating.

1034
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,100
I don't know the answer either, but.

1035
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:22,100
Do you think, Dave, some of these missing clusters, do you think that there are permanent portals in certain places?

1036
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,100
They're just always there.

1037
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:30,100
And that might relate to why people go in and out a lot in these areas.

1038
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:35,100
Because we hear like Mount Shasta, for example, we talked about on the show, talked about on our show a lot.

1039
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:41,100
It seems like there's something up there that seems to be like, it's like a permanent hotspot.

1040
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:50,100
Yeah, I don't know if there's any place in the world that has a permanent open portal.

1041
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:56,100
But I think that there's a lot of places that are more likely to have the incident happen.

1042
00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:02,100
And when we talk about portals, people say, well, yeah, if it was, you know, if it was random,

1043
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:07,100
then we could be walking down the street in San Francisco and somebody disappear in front of us,

1044
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,100
because it'd be just a random occurrence, a portal hits it.

1045
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,100
But nobody sees this happening.

1046
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:17,100
And because of this point of separation, and then something happens,

1047
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:24,100
it makes it appear as though there's something of intellect behind it that controls it so nobody can see it.

1048
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,100
Yeah, it's really strange.

1049
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,100
And we get into a lot of the spiritual aspects on our show, like I said,

1050
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:33,100
and a lot of times people will just say, oh, it's just demons, it's just demons, or it's just smoke and mirrors.

1051
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:37,100
And you try to explain to these people, Dave, like, no, no, they're taking specific animals.

1052
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,100
They're doing almost science experiments.

1053
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:45,100
So why would, if it's all deception and smoke and mirrors, they wouldn't be doing these experiments.

1054
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:52,100
The forensic evidence wouldn't suggest that they're not just trying to buzz by us and freak us out.

1055
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,100
They're doing things.

1056
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,100
They're performing science.

1057
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:03,100
Do you have those conversations with people and try to convince them that it's way deeper and crazier than just demons?

1058
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:08,100
So there was a couple of guys that were working on this project with me.

1059
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,100
They were camera people, producers, things like that.

1060
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,100
They worked on the project for a long time.

1061
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:19,100
And when we got near the end and the movie was essentially put together, these guys said,

1062
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,100
hey, we don't want our name associated with this.

1063
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,100
Interesting.

1064
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,100
A couple other people said, well, why?

1065
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,100
Because you make aliens look bad.

1066
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,100
So I didn't say anything bad about aliens.

1067
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,100
I didn't incriminate or indict aliens in any way.

1068
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:39,100
No, you're making it look like whoever's taking these people are doing bad things.

1069
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,100
We don't want to be associated with that.

1070
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,100
And they pulled their name and they didn't want any credit.

1071
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,100
Wow.

1072
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,100
Yeah.

1073
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:54,100
Do they think that was going to have some causation, like these entities were going to come after them?

1074
01:00:54,100 --> 01:01:01,100
Or was it just like they have some sort of ambivalent or amicable alien sort of worldview?

1075
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:06,100
I don't know, because they worked on the project a long time.

1076
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,100
They saw everything we saw.

1077
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:15,100
And because these are people that, you know, like you and me who have open minds and

1078
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,100
took us out of left field.

1079
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,100
I thought, wow.

1080
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,100
We've heard it on our show, Dave, that like a lot of people say there's we've interviewed some people that we've

1081
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:28,100
I don't think we've agreed with them at all, but they think the aliens are here to help us help humankind,

1082
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,100
help us with all our problems.

1083
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,100
And there is a narrative out there.

1084
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,100
A lot of people do believe that.

1085
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,100
But obviously, people are going missing.

1086
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,100
People are being taken against their will.

1087
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,100
And you have to push.

1088
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,100
But you have to push back.

1089
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,100
Hold on to that thought for a second.

1090
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,100
And let's pretend that there is this belief out there.

1091
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,100
Well, there is that these aliens don't do anything to anyone.

1092
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:57,100
But then the question comes of the thousands, tens of thousands of abductees that have claimed that things

1093
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,100
have been done to their body by these people.

1094
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:04,100
What are you going to call those people liars?

1095
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,100
Yeah.

1096
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,100
I mean, yeah.

1097
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,100
Yeah.

1098
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:14,100
I mean, horrible, horrific burns and, you know, and I mean, missing pregnancies like like horrible stuff.

1099
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,100
Yeah.

1100
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,100
That's that's a big leap.

1101
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,100
Yeah.

1102
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,100
And physical injuries.

1103
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:24,100
We've interviewed several people who've said they've had health issues their whole life because of it.

1104
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:30,100
Yeah, I mean, just think of the psychological scars.

1105
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,100
Yeah, exactly.

1106
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:36,100
You're living with always wondering if you're looking over your shoulder, if that's coming back or if you're going to it's going to happen again.

1107
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:42,100
And a lot, you know, I'm sure you run across this, too, that there's a lot of people that claim to have been abducted,

1108
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:48,100
that also claim it happens multiple times over the course of their life and maybe happened to their parents and runs in their family.

1109
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,100
It's that is it's it's a bizarre.

1110
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:55,100
And yet, you know, there are volumes.

1111
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:01,100
Of accounts, you know, you fill books and books with accounts of these people that have claimed that happened.

1112
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,100
There's crazy similarities.

1113
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,100
So you can these people don't know each other.

1114
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,100
They're not they're not, you know, repeating what Hollywood's telling them.

1115
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,100
They're none of that.

1116
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,100
It's I love what you're doing.

1117
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,100
I think this is such important.

1118
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:19,100
So important, honestly, to open just to open people's eyes because it's such an empirical approach, I think, which is which is super important in this.

1119
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:30,100
And the way you approach it, obviously being, you know, an ex an ex cop and an ex detective, like the cases they lay out, it's just there's no way to say that you know, it really poke holes in any of this,

1120
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:36,100
which I love because it makes people confront a reality that a lot of people don't want to confront.

1121
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:41,100
And and I think maybe the irony in that is that our government is making acknowledgments now.

1122
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,100
You know, and I know that John D'Souza talked a bit about this, right?

1123
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,100
They're acknowledged to an extent, but most times it's a nothing burger.

1124
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:53,100
And he believes it's because if you can't, they're not going to acknowledge it if they can't control it.

1125
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:57,100
But there is a sense of that because I think you can't keep a lid on all this.

1126
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,100
You've got phones and phones of cameras.

1127
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:08,100
And and we have this, you know, we're the day of instant communication and massive network networking that people are going to find out.

1128
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:12,100
So, yeah, I mean, I think the work you're doing is so important, Dave.

1129
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:17,100
So, yeah, thank you for thank you for the film and thanks for walking us through some of the stuff.

1130
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,100
I think it's fascinating.

1131
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:27,100
Yeah, I appreciate it, guys. And you can if you want to watch the film online, you can watch it on Amazon, iTunes, Vimeo, Canada.

1132
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,100
It's Vimeo and iTunes.

1133
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:34,100
And also our website is NA like North America, NABigFootSearch.com.

1134
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,100
Go to the store there if you want to get a DVD.

1135
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:45,100
And on the DVD extended version, we have the entire interview with John DeSouza, which is worth the price of admission right there.

1136
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:50,100
But then you can follow me on Twitter at David Politis at Can-Am Missing.

1137
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:54,100
And that's our YouTube site, Can-Am Missing Project like Canadian American.

1138
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,100
I love it. Thanks so much, Dave.

1139
01:04:55,100 --> 01:05:01,100
I've been I've been I started listening to you in 2012 when I was listening to the Dennis Martin case here.

1140
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,100
We're in Tennessee.

1141
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:06,100
So I remember that just kind of hit home in the Smoky Mountains.

1142
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,100
And since then, I've been following your work.

1143
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,100
And I did have one last question for you.

1144
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:15,100
And I know you probably want to wrap it up and appreciate your time.

1145
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,100
I know it's valuable.

1146
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:24,100
Do you think that these when I was listening to Carl's story specifically, it sounded like they asked him permission.

1147
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:29,100
And one of the things we hear a lot on our show is that these entities have to ask permission.

1148
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:34,100
Do you think that everyone that goes missing, they're sort of that there's a transaction.

1149
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:38,100
There's a like, take these pills or they do something.

1150
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,100
They don't just randomly snatch you.

1151
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:43,100
You have to be kind of lured in somehow.

1152
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,100
What do you think?

1153
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:53,100
I don't know if I'm thinking back in the case, if I've heard that theory and I don't think I have.

1154
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,100
I'm not saying it's not true.

1155
01:05:55,100 --> 01:06:03,100
I guess one of the main conclusions here is if you're German, don't go hunting alone, especially if you're hunting elk, right?

1156
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:08,100
I think if I was German, I'd be looking for another sport.

1157
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,100
Yeah.

1158
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,100
What do you tell people, Dave, before you go?

1159
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:18,100
Like, what do you, a lot of people they say, you know, I'll never go camping again and I'll never go in the woods again.

1160
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,100
Just don't go alone, right?

1161
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,100
You know what?

1162
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:28,100
The number one thing I tell people is that if you have a friend or relative that goes hiking or camping alone, buy them a personal locator beacon.

1163
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,100
I don't sell them.

1164
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,100
You can find them on Amazon.

1165
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,100
They're about $280, $300.

1166
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:37,100
And what they are is they send a, you activate it, send the message to a satellite.

1167
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:41,100
Satellite goes to the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration.

1168
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,100
They look on the map, see the coordinates.

1169
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,100
They call search and rescue for that area.

1170
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,100
They can find you within 10 feet of that signal.

1171
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:55,100
And I've always said that maybe I'm just being optimistic with 90% of the cases that I read about.

1172
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,100
I think would have been solved if people had been carrying one of those.

1173
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:03,100
I think they know, they probably know you have one, so they're not going to take you so that they can't.

1174
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,100
Otherwise, you're not going to find another dimension, right?

1175
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,100
I don't know.

1176
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,100
Yeah.

1177
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,100
Well, thanks, Dave.

1178
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,100
I love it.

1179
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,100
Yeah, thank you so much, Dave.

1180
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:16,100
Hey, guys, I appreciate being on your show and thank you for your time.

1181
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,100
Thanks so much for your time.

1182
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,100
Yeah.

1183
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,100
We'll let you know when it comes out.

1184
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:24,100
And if you ever want to come back and talk about the weird stuff, Dave, you're always welcome on Blurry Creatures.

1185
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,100
Appreciate it.

1186
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,100
Thanks, Dave.

1187
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,100
Yeah.

1188
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,100
Okay.

1189
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,100
Big fans, man.

1190
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,100
This has been an honor.

1191
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,100
Yeah.

1192
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,100
Hey, no, no, I appreciate it.

1193
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,100
Hopefully you'll get me some bookings out of it, right?

1194
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,100
Come on.

1195
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,100
Yeah.

1196
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,100
Oh, yeah.

1197
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,100
Sounds good.

1198
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,100
We'll see you on your cruise, huh?

1199
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,100
Oh, yeah, for sure.

1200
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,100
That looked awesome, man.

1201
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,100
Maybe so.

1202
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,100
Okay.

1203
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,100
Thank you so much.

1204
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,100
Take care.

1205
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,100
Bye.

1206
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,100
Bye.

1207
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,100
Bye.

1208
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,100
Bye.

1209
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,100
Bye.

1210
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,100
Bye.
