1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Everybody is waiting for the government to come out and say aliens are real, UFOs are

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,600
real.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,720
What's interesting is that there's a whole different thought about it here on the reservation.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,600
Native Americans as a people all across the United States, they've known that these things

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,360
are real for centuries.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:38,280
I actually determined who these skinwalkers were by identity.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,800
I mean, they're actual flesh and blood people.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,600
They do singing, they do chants, they have to have the skin of an animal that they're

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
going to change into.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,560
We're talking about Navajo witchcraft.

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,320
For Christians, it seems like there's a disconnect because if you talk about that kind of stuff

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,920
in church, well, that's demonic.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,800
That's something that you should stay away from.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,920
Don't even talk about it.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,760
Don't go near it.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:22,120
And if it's happening to you, then what are you going to do?

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,480
The history of our earth is so different from what we can imagine.

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:34,760
The Smithsonian, if they found out about a large skeleton somewhere, was to go get it.

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm going to assume at least one person is right because if one person is right, it busts

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
the paradigm.

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,600
It all goes back to the fallen cherub.

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,400
And the problem with the modern day church, they have a very truncated view of the supernatural.

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,200
This backdrop that's just pregnant with all kinds of meaning associated with this Mount

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,680
Hermon event.

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,200
And this guy defects from the kingdom.

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,080
That's a big deal.

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
There's something strange in the Navajo reservation.

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
Who are you going to call?

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,200
You're going to call John Dover, who is a paranormal ranger and he has a whole history

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,840
of dealing with the weird stuff on the reservation.

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
John is also a born-again Christian and he comes on our show and talks about all of his

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,280
experiences through the lens of the Navajo and how they see things, which is obviously

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,320
a lot of different than we see things.

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,200
But he's been all over the place.

35
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,480
He's been on all these TV shows and his careers, him and his partner's career have really taken

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
off.

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
So he's been on the show before.

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,840
I think it was 113, 115, somewhere in that range.

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,320
And but he's coming back.

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,040
It's been a long time coming.

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,400
And Luke loves to reference this.

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
I do.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I love this.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I loved our first episode with John.

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm very excited to have him back.

46
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,880
Shortly after we had him on, there's an episode with John and his partner Stan on Unsolved

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Mysteries.

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,920
He's been on the show Skinwalker Ranch a number of times and the spinoff show.

49
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:08,640
So John and Stan, his partner, they were both rangers on the Navajo reservation for a really

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
long time.

51
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,760
And as you know, if you listen to the first episode, a lot of crazy stuff happens on the

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,440
Navajo reservation in this 27,000 square miles of...

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
Blurriness.

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
A blurriness.

55
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Yeah.

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,680
So really excited to have John back on to talk about some more of his stories, experiences,

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,520
his thoughts on a lot of the phenomena and then a very fascinating piece on Skinwalkers.

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,120
It's always something that's interesting in our space because it combines the dark arts

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,800
and witchcraft, shape-shifting.

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,680
It's about as blurry as you can get and it's very specific to the Navajo culture.

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,640
And he dealt with these things, these critters.

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,960
And that's why I made the joke in the beginning because he shows up.

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,100
People don't know who to call.

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,400
They call the police.

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Sometimes they come.

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Sometimes they don't.

67
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
They call the fire department.

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
They call whoever.

69
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,620
But if you run out of options, you call John and John would show up.

70
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,480
And a lot of people quit this job right away because they realized how strange and weird

71
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,560
it was.

72
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,800
But John's a great dude and he comes on and shares his experiences and firsthand account

73
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
with these people and interviewing them.

74
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,680
Everything from Bigfoot to UFOs, like Luke said, Skinwalkers and aliens and all the other

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
stuff.

76
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,640

Thank you guys.

82

All right.

83
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,240
Welcome back to Blurry Creatures, John Redbird Dover of the Paranormal Rangers.

84
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,320
You guys have blown up since our last interview.

85
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,880
You've been on Netflix, you've been on TV shows.

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,680
Your partner has a book deal and that's out now and it's selling well on Amazon.

87
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,100
And everyone's talking about your guys' history of your career as Navajo Rangers, 2,700 square

88
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,920
feet.

89
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Square miles.

90
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Square miles.

91
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Square feet.

92
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,600
It's a small ranch home otherwise.

93
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,080
You know, in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

94
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,000
And we brought you on the first time, you had a bunch of wild stories and we've been

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,280
wanting to get you back on again.

96
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,080
But you guys have been, you guys have blown up.

97
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,560
So it's hard to get you on the schedule, but we're happy for you guys.

98
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,380
Congratulations on all the success and everything going on.

99
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,080
And I'd love to get back into some blurry stories here now in the Blurry Basement.

100
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,520
Welcome back to the podcast, John Dover.

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,560
Well, thank you very much.

102
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,680
We've got a lot of information, a lot of stories.

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,920
You said we did blow up.

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:44,080
My book so far has 47 chapters and it goes basically through my entire career.

105
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,440
I was a technical accident investigator.

106
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,440
I was an EMT.

107
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,040
There were hazardous materials response, technical rescue instructor, things like that.

108
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,200
So I'm getting into the whole thing and the paranormal is just a part of it because in

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,600
actuality, the paranormal stuff only intruded less than one percent of our actual duties.

110
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Yeah, which is a lot.

111
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600
I mean, because I think some people spend their whole life and they never get to see

112
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,040
some of the blurrier things they're looking for.

113
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,840
You know, if you're like some of these Bigfoot enthusiasts spend their whole life trying

114
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,640
to figure out how do I prove this thing exists and they never get to see it.

115
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,840
Well, you tracked one.

116
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,360
And yeah, you tried.

117
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,560
I love that story.

118
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
John, it's great to have you back from just like a personal standpoint.

119
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I think our first episode was one of my favorite ones we've done.

120
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:41,360
I knew so little about, you know, things that go on on the Navajo reservation.

121
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,000
I know that reservations in general, I have a few Native American friends are often places

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
that where weird stuff happens.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,640
Just sort of it's part and parcel with the territory, if you will.

124
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,920
But I'm so it's so cool to see what's happened with your story.

125
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,440
I remember you talking the last time about how people would show up for the job you had

126
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,720
for 30 something years and they would they'd last a day and be gone.

127
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,880
But you persevered and you have all kinds of wild, wild stories.

128
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:15,320
We talked about skinwalkers, Bigfoot, aliens and coins coming out of nowhere.

129
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,320
It was this if you haven't listened to it and you're you're tuning into blurry creatures

130
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
here, go check out our first episode with John.

131
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,080
It'll be a lot of groundwork for where we pick up today.

132
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,120
It's yeah, it's it's great to have you back.

133
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,840
It's so cool to see your stories are getting out there and resonating you and standard

134
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,680
doing you're doing the rounds and people are really interested in what you're working on.

135
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,000
You've been on Skinwalker Ranch a number of times, the TV show, also the the spinoff.

136
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,840
So you've been a busy man and we appreciate you taking out.

137
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,840
Yeah, that's episode 115 we had you on.

138
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,720
Yeah. So if you want to go back and listen to episode 115, where are you at now, John?

139
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
What's what's been some latest sightings and some some paranormal stuff that you've been

140
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,760
hearing about and some recent things?

141
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,960
One of the things that and and by the way, we've got our own podcast here.

142
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,520
It's it's called Native Paranormal Crossroads with Paranormal Rangers.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,320
And we have a new member that's working with us.

144
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
Her name is Michelle.

145
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,480
She has a journalist background and an investigator background.

146
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,360
And she's she's Native American, also from Utah.

147
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,720
One of the things that I wanted to state right up front, and

148
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,680
this is what we've been talking about on our show, is that the government,

149
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:43,320
everybody is waiting for the government to come out and say aliens are real, UFOs are real.

150
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,760
And what's interesting is that there's there's a whole different

151
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
thought about it here on the reservation.

152
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,000
Native Americans as a people all across the United States, we're talking five hundred

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,480
and seventy four different recognized tribes just in the states alone.

154
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,480
They've known that these things are real for centuries.

155
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,720
And, you know, it's kind of funny because we don't trust the government, right.

156
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,880
Out of out of six thousand treaties that were made since

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,560
1992, not one of them was ever kept.

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,040
So we've got a pretty good track record going with the government.

159
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,920
And we don't need the government to tell us that these things are real.

160
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,280
People just know they're real and and live with it.

161
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,160
So there's a really big difference in attitude when we work with people

162
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,480
and we talk with them about these subjects.

163
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,040
I think that's good, John, because I think if you you come with this with no skepticism

164
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,880
of the sense that I think a lot of people think the government's going to lie to us

165
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,400
if they tell us these things are real.

166
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,160
They think that's going to be a lie.

167
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,800
And when you look into the data, you're like, they're they're covering it up more.

168
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,040
It seems to be the answer.

169
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,320
Right. And and one of the things that we did, both me and Stan were trained law enforcement

170
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,480
officers. I was trained at the in criminal investigations at the Federal Law Enforcement

171
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,800
Training Center in Glencoe, Georgia.

172
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,760
And, you know, it's a whole separate class, you know, just just for investigations.

173
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,040
And what we did is we used the laws of legal evidence

174
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,840
in investigating these things.

175
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,400
We were being skeptical.

176
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,720
We didn't go in and said, oh, I just believe, you know, because belief is having faith that

177
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,760
something is real.

178
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,840
We went in and we said we want evidence that we could take to a federal court.

179
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:57,440
And that's that was our goal is trying to get proof that this thing was actually happening.

180
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,960
And we got it hands down.

181
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,360
We got a lot of proof that this thing is real.

182
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Talk about talk about that, John.

183
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,360
Talk about some of the some of the things that you, especially in this in this realm of the

184
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,120
UFO phenomenon that you guys did some of the investigations.

185
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,000
I know there was one we talked about last episode about this craft going up back up a

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
hill when you were you got a call and investigated that.

187
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,480
But talk a little bit about that. And then maybe before you get to that, let me ask you

188
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,160
this. So you talk about five hundred seventy four tribes that know this phenomenon is

189
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,760
real. What is the.

190
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:40,600
What is the overall overarching belief or understanding of what what this UFO phenomenon

191
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,840
is when it comes to comes to the tribes and to the Native Americans?

192
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,040
Well, a lot of Native American tribes have this idea of star people that have come to

193
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,440
them in the past and have imparted knowledge.

194
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,600
We started taking a real critical look at this thing, you know, in in in the United

195
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,720
States, the government says, oh, these are myths.

196
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,320
These are just legends.

197
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,160
These are stories that have a moral value if we're teaching little kids.

198
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,240
And, you know, we look beyond that and we started saying, is it possible that these

199
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:31,160
because Native Americans have what they call an oral tradition, history is passed down

200
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,880
through their oral teachings.

201
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:45,720
And what we found out is that in just just the Navajos, you have a ceremony called a

202
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:53,720
enemy way dance, and that enemy way dance is over three different nights.

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,840
It has about two hundred and forty different songs that you have to go to the medicine

204
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,080
man has to recite.

205
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,760
They have to be done in a very specific order and they can't you can't mess them up and

206
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,800
they're done by memory.

207
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,360
And if any of that is messed up, people are paying thousands of dollars for these

208
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,160
ceremonies. That ceremony is completely negated and the medicine man can't charge you.

209
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,840
So, you know, you better believe people are watching for any little mistakes.

210
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,960
And these things are done.

211
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,440
Two hundred and forty songs are sung without error.

212
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:50,920
And we saw this in a UFO landing investigation where Bigelow Aerospace Research investigators

213
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,720
came in and interviewed an old man.

214
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,320
We had MUFON investigators interview him and we interviewed him.

215
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,520
So three separate interviews, sit down interviews with him that were recorded.

216
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,960
And in four years that he did these interviews, every one of them match up.

217
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,440
He didn't embellish.

218
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
He didn't leave things out.

219
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,800
He just stated them exactly as they happened.

220
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:26,520
And each investigation over four years had the same information in them.

221
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,120
So that's pretty amazing when you consider that the guy was in his mid 80s.

222
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,560
Right, it's precision.

223
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:39,000
You're talking about the idea of remembering 240 songs in a row is an oral tradition,

224
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,840
but it's precise.

225
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,160
It's the same every time.

226
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,160
And the same thing with this guy's interview.

227
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
So what is that story though, particularly?

228
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,040
What is this guy's interview?

229
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,880
Because if it's Bigelow and it's you guys, I figured you said the third party was,

230
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,600
this had to be a pretty significant encounter.

231
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
We call it the old man case.

232
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,120
This elderly man was at home.

233
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:09,240
His wife and his daughter had gone to Phoenix, and Phoenix is maybe a four hour drive for them one way.

234
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:18,280
So they're living in this remote area, and they're nearest neighbors, probably a half mile away.

235
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:28,120
And about one o'clock in the morning or so, he sees lights coming through the house.

236
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:35,560
He sees lights coming through his front window, and so he thinks, you know, that looks like a car coming.

237
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,080
He goes to the window and doesn't see a car, you know, with the headlights on.

238
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:51,640
So, you know, he starts looking and what he sees is this ball of light about 25 feet in diameter

239
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,200
circling around his house.

240
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:02,840
And as he watches it, it goes up on the hill behind his house, about a quarter mile away.

241
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,160
And he says he doesn't know if it lands or if it just covers up there.

242
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,200
Something comes out from underneath.

243
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,520
It goes down.

244
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,000
He sees this thing go down toward another house near where he lives

245
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,480
and go back up to the craft and then come down toward his house.

246
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,240
He has a small blue healer pup that's maybe about six months old.

247
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,920
And it runs out barking in the night, you know, toward where these things are coming in.

248
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,160
And he says that he hears the dog yelp.

249
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:48,120
Dog comes running back to the house, lays down in the front, you know, by the steps.

250
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,360
And doesn't move, you know, just curls up in a ball.

251
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,360
So about then he's getting kind of nervous.

252
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,880
He goes inside the house.

253
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,800
He locks himself in and starts looking out through the windows.

254
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,640
And his description is that in Navajo, there's no word for alien.

255
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,200
So he's describing because Navajo is a very descriptive language.

256
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,360
He's describing to us that he sees what he calls four small children

257
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,400
walking around the outside of his house.

258
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,120
And they have big heads.

259
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,800
They have big black eyes that kind of wrap around.

260
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:42,360
They're wearing skin tight, metallic or white colored, light colored, you know, outfits.

261
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,600
And as you're walking around, they're shining these collimated beam lights that

262
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,600
look like what you would see out of a laser, but they're about a half inch in diameter.

263
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,160
Each light is a different color, red, blue, green and yellow.

264
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,640
And they're searching, there's four of them, they're searching the ground

265
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,000
like they're looking for something.

266
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,080
They're fascinated with these solar lights around his house.

267
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,480
You know, just average solar light that you would buy say at Walmart or Costco

268
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,760
or something like that.

269
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:25,160
And as they go around these lights, he says the lights would dim and go out.

270
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,520
And then they'd back up and the light would come back on.

271
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,400
And he says they were just fascinated with these lights.

272
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,200
They'd keep leaning in and the light would go out.

273
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Pretty soon he's getting upset.

274
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,680
He says, what are these little kids doing at my house at this hour?

275
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,120
So he went out the front door, they're in the back and he's going to sneak up on them.

276
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:59,480
He takes this square flashlight, the old dry cell flashlights and takes that out with him.

277
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,200
As he turns the corner at the back of the house,

278
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,520
he tripped on the back step, their concrete steps and falls.

279
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:16,360
Now, you and I know that at 80 plus, when you take a fall, that could be serious.

280
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:26,200
And he remembers looking up and he sees these things sitting in a row one after the other,

281
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,480
kind of like you're sitting on a tube or something.

282
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,480
And they're gliding back up the hill making no sound.

283
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,600
And they got back in the craft and the craft took off.

284
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,720
So, you know, this is the story that he related.

285
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,440
We did radiation readings on the surrounding area.

286
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,840
We tried to find where the thing possibly landed or hovered, but we couldn't locate anything.

287
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,080
No radiation readings up there, no ground impressions.

288
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,360
Ground impressions.

289
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,080
The dog we found out later when we went to investigate,

290
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,920
the crew that was doing the background radiation readings were wearing Tyvek suits.

291
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:20,200
And one of the girls that was in the crew there, she was a dog lover and she saw the puppy.

292
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:26,600
And before that, we had showed up in uniform and the thing was jumping all over us,

293
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,040
trying to lick us to death.

294
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:35,400
And when you're in a muddy environment, you don't want dogs jumping all over you

295
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,000
because you're in uniform.

296
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,920
And this girl, she was actually calling the dog.

297
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,160
She was wearing one of these white suits.

298
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,600
The dog saw the white suit and it ran to the corner of the steps

299
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,520
and crawled up in a ball and stayed there.

300
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,480
John, do you think that those suits that they're wearing are

301
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,600
protection from the technology they have?

302
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,120
I don't know.

303
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,520
I can speculate.

304
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:10,520
And that they wear clothing at all indicates that, yeah, it could be

305
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,000
that there's some kind of a field there.

306
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,680
And we do understand that there are fields at work based on Bob Lazar's statements

307
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,200
that there's a whole gravitational field at play here.

308
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
What are they wearing or not wearing?

309
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,320
It's not something I know a lot about.

310
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,360
Are they described not wearing anything sometimes?

311
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,720
Sometimes, yeah.

312
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,480
The grays are said that sometimes they're not wearing anything.

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,120
And in this case, they were wearing some kind of a skin tight outfit.

314
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,880
So what he saw was different than the grays.

315
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,600
These aren't grays.

316
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,720
These are different.

317
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,800
Yeah, but they had the big head.

318
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,480
They were light colored and they had the big black eyes

319
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,840
that are commonly associated.

320
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,440
And he said that they were three and a half to four feet tall.

321
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,400
Let me ask you this.

322
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,320
You talk about how Navajo is a descriptive language

323
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,920
and there's all of this oral tradition of the star people.

324
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,600
Are the descriptions of the star people the same as what this man's seen

325
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,360
or the same as what we would consider to be a gray?

326
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,120
Or does that sort of description not come through in the old traditions

327
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,240
just sort of generally speaking?

328
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,040
There are these beings called star people that visit and impart knowledge.

329
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,840
Yeah, in the past, there have been beings in a different world.

330
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,280
The Navajo talk about coming through a series of different worlds.

331
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,400
And in this world, depending on who taught you,

332
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,280
could be five worlds or four worlds.

333
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,400
And Stan goes into a lot of that description in his book.

334
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,680
There's a world of darkness.

335
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,560
There's a world of aquatic life.

336
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:02,520
There's a world with insects, with giants, with other creatures.

337
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,440
And then there's a hole in the sky that they climb through

338
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,440
and come out into what they call the shining world or this world.

339
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,760
And so, you know, we started looking at that and we started saying,

340
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,680
maybe it's not just a fable.

341
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,680
Maybe what they were describing is coming through a dimensional gate of some type.

342
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,400
And we started looking very closely at that idea.

343
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,480
Now, today, this idea of multiple dimensions,

344
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,000
there could be 10 or 12.

345
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,760
There could be an infinite number.

346
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:50,920
And actually, time is considered a dimension, according to physicists.

347
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,840
So, we have this situation where the Navajos themselves may be describing

348
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:05,160
coming through dimensional gates into different places of being.

349
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,000
And if that's true and their descriptions are accurate,

350
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,360
they may have come through a series of dimensions to get here.

351
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:25,880
And that may be why, you know, other tribes have very similar origin stories,

352
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,360
so to speak, that where they came from.

353
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,960
That they came from under the ground or from the earth or different places.

354
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,760
And in those other realms, there were monsters, there were other creatures,

355
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,480
and some of them were enemies, some of them imparted knowledge.

356
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,960
So, you have this whole civilization, so to speak.

357
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:59,160
And so, we started thinking maybe that's what links everything together.

358
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,680
This idea of UFOs just popping into existence and then they fade out.

359
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,760
We've had people tell us that when they appeared,

360
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,080
the pop was so loud that the sound hit them like a solid blow.

361
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,120
They could feel it through their whole body.

362
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,960
Then you have Bigfoot is a dimensional creature.

363
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,480
He actually fades out.

364
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,160
We've tracked him and his footsteps just disappear.

365
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,400
An intracable ground.

366
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,000
And we've talked to people up in the Pacific Northwest

367
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,280
that tell us that they've watched Bigfoot sitting behind a tree stump

368
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,880
and watched him fade out and disappear.

369
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,800
And that's why we haven't found a body.

370
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,200
We haven't even found their poop.

371
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,760
We haven't found any part of them aside from their hair.

372
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,360
That's one of my favorite stories, though, John, the one that you just told about.

373
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,320
I stuck with me from our first episode about you tracking the Bigfoot

374
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,280
and then the footsteps disappear.

375
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,160
And I think because what I love about your work is because you are,

376
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,280
as you've talked about, you're trained law enforcement, trained forensic investigators.

377
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,160
You treated all of this paranormal stuff, paranormal ranger stuff,

378
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,120
in an empirical way, measuring, collecting evidence.

379
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,440
And the Bigfoot stuff is crazy.

380
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,040
As you said, this thing, there are lots of stories about phasing out

381
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,000
or looking like the predator cloaked or people just,

382
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,960
or people in the missing 411 space, like with David Paulides.

383
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,800
But that feels very different than a portal to me.

384
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,400
That's the interesting part.

385
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,400
If Bigfoot can just slowly phase out versus these UFOs,

386
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,480
sound like they're coming through some kind of gate.

387
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,280
Can you describe that popping, like what that is?

388
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,320
Is it coming through like a sonic boom?

389
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,760
Yeah, like is it using its tech to open up something and go through?

390
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,840
Because it still needs a vehicle once it's here.

391
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,240
So there's a lot of weird questions.

392
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,920
If they can just open these gates wherever, why do they need a vehicle?

393
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,560
If they can just kind of phase in and do all that?

394
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:13,720
That's the stranger parts of these conversations is why do they still need tech?

395
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,800
One of the things that I did when I was at Skinwalker Ranch,

396
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,120
I was able to sit down with Travis Taylor.

397
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,440
And as you know, he's an astrophysicist.

398
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,800
And I asked him if he was familiar with Nikola Tesla.

399
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,840
And he said, well, I did Nikola Tesla as my thesis.

400
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,880
So, you know, he knew he had reconstructed some of his experiments.

401
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,880
And I asked him, are you familiar with Nikola Tesla's 369 theory?

402
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,600
The 369 theory says that the numbers 3, 6, and 9 are magical.

403
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,400
If you knew how to manipulate those numbers, you could literally do anything.

404
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,640
Tesla was so enamored with these numbers that he would not stay in a room

405
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,680
that the room number wasn't divisible by any of those numbers.

406
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,640
He would get to work in New York and walk around the city block

407
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,720
three times before he entered the building.

408
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,320
So, you know, you have this whole idea.

409
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,960
And he gave each number an attribute.

410
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,320
He said 3 stands for energy.

411
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,680
6 stands for frequency.

412
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,480
And 9 stands for vibration.

413
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,160
And what I told them up there at Skinwalker Ranch is you guys have energy.

414
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:53,640
You have something buried in the ranch that is emanating energy.

415
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,160
You think of it as a battery.

416
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,840
I says, I think of it as more of a capacitor

417
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,400
that it can store energy and release it suddenly.

418
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,000
And that's why people get injured.

419
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,640
For digging in the ground and stuff.

420
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,440
You've got frequency that 1.6 gigahertz thing that keeps popping up in the series.

421
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,040
I says what you don't have is vibration.

422
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,560
And so they brought a drum group up, the Blazing Bear drum group from Oklahoma.

423
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,000
And had them do some drumming and they had some really strange things happen

424
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,480
during that time in that episode.

425
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,160
So, they're still searching.

426
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,280
There's all kinds of frequencies.

427
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,560
And they're finding out frequencies can be used to heal.

428
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,440
If they had the right frequencies, they could make a Klingon disruptor

429
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
and cause your atoms to fly apart.

430
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,240
So, you know, science is looking for ways to weaponize this stuff.

431
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,800
Oh, yeah.

432
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,000
Go back to that story about the old man story.

433
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,480
The old man story was the UFO turning into a ball of light and going around the mountain.

434
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,640
Or was he just perceiving it as light because it had bright light?

435
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,720
Yeah, it had bright lights because this is what people are describing

436
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,200
right now with this whole drone phenomenon.

437
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,840
And we didn't talk.

438
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,160
We just released an episode on this, but we didn't really talk about how

439
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,040
the theory is that these drones are looking for a nuke.

440
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,960
But we know that UFO show up when there's a nuke around.

441
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,880
So, there's like this whole, you know, it's like all these things happening at once

442
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,640
because people are describing, oh, I'm just seeing drones.

443
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,640
And then people are saying, no, I'm seeing these balls of light.

444
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,760
These orbs go around.

445
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,840
And it reminds me of what you just described with this old man.

446
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,880
This ball of light moving didn't sound like it.

447
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,800
He saw a clear UFO.

448
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,560
He saw something that was like a UFO.

449
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,360
I don't know.

450
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,280
He describes it as a ball of light, which could be an orb.

451
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,880
You know, I've seen orbs.

452
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,840
I had one follow me for about 40 miles and, you know, at 2 in the morning.

453
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:14,440
And that kind of gave me a real uneasy feeling that, you know, having this green ball of light

454
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:21,640
following your vehicle right behind you 100 yards to the rear and just merrily following you along.

455
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,760
And I'm watching it.

456
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,160
At one point, I thought, okay, I'm armed.

457
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,640
Should I turn around and confront it?

458
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,760
And I thought, no, that's not the thing to do is be confrontational or get violent,

459
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,200
you know, because man, we are a violent species.

460
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,840
You know, we poke it with a stick.

461
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,520
We shoot a rocket at it.

462
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,560
We do all kinds of things, throw rocks, you know, and that's just our mentality.

463
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,040
You go to the pond and you poke frogs with a stick.

464
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:02,360
You know, so I thought maybe the best thing to do is just keep just watch it and observe.

465
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,920
And at the end, it faded out.

466
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,240
It just just flat, slowly dimmed and disappeared.

467
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,000
Is that a way UFOs travel?

468
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,240
Like they do they turn into orbs or is orbs a separate thing from like a traditional UFO?

469
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,800
What do you think?

470
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,040
Well, traditional UFOs were saucer shaped.

471
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,720
And I've seen those, you know, disk.

472
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,040
We've seen them as triangles.

473
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,280
We've seen them as cigars.

474
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,920
Back in the 1800s, there were a lot of cigars flying around.

475
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,040
It's almost like they're in some way they're evolving.

476
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,560
And then, you know, we started seeing orbs.

477
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,880
And we've seen others that are not there.

478
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:59,080
You know, you see shadow go across the ground and you look up and there's nothing up there.

479
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,640
But you see a round shadow on the ground.

480
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,800
And we've had a lot of those be reported to us.

481
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:15,480
So and when we go to conferences and we mentioned that people come up to us afterwards,

482
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,640
you know, I was mowing my lawn and a big shadow went over.

483
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,200
And I looked up in the sky, nothing there, you know, between me and the sun.

484
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,280
So yeah, there's a lot of weird technology out there.

485
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:36,520
There's the big delta wing craft that are like the Phoenix lights.

486
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:44,520
Something went over that was, you know, supposedly a mile wide and silent.

487
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:52,920
And I talked to Peter Davenport with the UFO Reporting Center.

488
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,920
He said that the pilots encountered that craft.

489
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,720
They call it Angels 10.

490
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,200
Angels 10 is a military reference to 10,000 feet in elevation.

491
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,640
They said that when they encountered it at 10,000 feet, people were reporting.

492
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,920
They would say it was from here to here.

493
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,720
And so they started doing, you know, these guys, you're scientists, they're doing calculations.

494
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,680
And they said, based on the angles, it wasn't a mile wide.

495
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,840
That thing was 10 miles wide.

496
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:35,240
The pilots that came down, one of the, you know, one of the pilots that came down,

497
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:41,000
one of the airmen contacted the National UFO Reporting Center and spoke to Peter.

498
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,880
And said that one of the pilots was so shook up that he had to be carried out of the airplane

499
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,400
after they landed.

500
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:56,760
And he says, I'm telling you this now because they're going to lock down the base and they're

501
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,240
going to tell everybody you can't talk about this.

502
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,920
And so I don't want to be in violation orders.

503
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,840
I'm calling you now ahead of time.

504
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,400
Yeah.

505
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,440
It's like Independence Day.

506
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,880
They saw a Star Destroyer.

507
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,920
Well, it's like Independence Day where these things roll out and they're like big,

508
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,400
you know, these big cities and they park over, you know, which of course is cinema.

509
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,040
That would be hard.

510
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,680
That would be like a scientist seeing a Bigfoot that doesn't think that it exists.

511
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,520
And then you have a pilot seeing this massive, huge craft.

512
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,840
Are they sending out these orbs, you think?

513
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,880
There could be motherships and they've been reported in the past.

514
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:39,480
The big UFO flap in the 60s, I think were the late 50s, where the UFOs appeared over

515
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:46,280
Washington, D.C., they were said to be coming out of a mothership that was off the East Coast.

516
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:54,280
So that description came from a book called Shoot Them Down,

517
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,480
where the military had active orders to shoot everything inside that was in the air,

518
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,640
shoot it down and see if we can capture it and get the technology.

519
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,920
It's like War of the Worlds.

520
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,880
So yeah, because these four little alien children that go into this ball of light,

521
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,360
so it has to be some kind of craft of kind.

522
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,480
You can get inside of it and drive it around, obviously.

523
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:22,920
Yeah.

524
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,600
But is the ball of light a way for them to sort of go from point A to point B without

525
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,680
being suspicious?

526
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,040
Because a lot of people describe these balls of light right now,

527
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,760
but they're also saying they're moving like UFOs.

528
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,880
They're like going, they're just like shooting up and they don't,

529
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,200
this whole drone thing is only a part of the puzzle of what's happening on the East Coast.

530
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,320
I just don't understand the orb thing.

531
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,600
And people describe orbs with Bigfoot all the time.

532
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,320
What is the connection between UFOs and creatures like Bigfoot?

533
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,920
What we saw when we were doing the investigations,

534
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:07,160
we're taking 60 to 70 investigations a year at its peak.

535
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,200
And what we saw was that every time there were increases in Bigfoot sightings,

536
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,960
there were corresponding increases in UFO reports.

537
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,560
And they would come in what the UFO community calls flaps,

538
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:32,760
which is periods of time where there's greater sightings.

539
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,760
And then there would be gaps where there would be nothing going on.

540
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,600
And then all of a sudden a whole rash of sightings again.

541
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:47,000
And so we saw the corresponding links between Bigfoot sightings and UFOs.

542
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,840
We even had one case where a Bigfoot showed up with the UFO.

543
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,000
Tell us that story.

544
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,640
What's that story?

545
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,000
This happened up near Crown Point, New Mexico.

546
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,680
A young man had brought a college professor home to see what Navajo life was like.

547
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,920
There's a small group of houses.

548
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:21,400
And in these houses, the reality is when you live out here,

549
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,680
it takes maybe 10 years to get a homesite lease.

550
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,880
And you get a 99-year lease for your house, a one-acre plot.

551
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,240
So you don't own it.

552
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,920
But if you build within a quarter mile of a relative, you don't need a homesite lease.

553
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,920
So you'll see groups of houses cropping up together.

554
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,000
And they're usually related family that live there.

555
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,400
So they're all at this little hogan.

556
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:01,400
And they hear coming up the canyon there where they live what sounds like cannon fire.

557
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,640
Just says boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

558
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,080
You know, it has a staccato sound to it.

559
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,280
Like there's just random, you know, sounds.

560
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,720
And as it comes up the canyon, they describe it as a disk.

561
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,640
And it starts circling their little group of houses.

562
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,080
So immediately everybody goes and runs inside because they're afraid of it.

563
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,040
They said that as this thing flew over the pinion juniper trees in the area,

564
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,400
the trees would literally be pushed down like there was a force pushing them down.

565
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,920
And then they'd stand back up after the thing passed.

566
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,000
So they're describing this.

567
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,360
It's already getting dark.

568
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,600
The thing obviously landed or let something out.

569
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:02,360
And they said that there's all these little green creatures that look like something out

570
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,840
of a TV movie running around.

571
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,480
They're small.

572
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,720
They're like these little gargoyles, I guess.

573
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,480
Maybe about two, two and a half feet, three feet tall.

574
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,280
And they're scrambling.

575
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,360
They're running over the roofs of houses.

576
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,880
They're doing all kinds of stuff and everybody's locked in.

577
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,800
And then a Bigfoot showed up and they said that they saw the Bigfoot.

578
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,720
And it actually pushed on the door.

579
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,640
And if you can imagine your front door, you know, just like out of a movie,

580
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,640
something pushing at it from the outside and the door is bowing.

581
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,000
So they were getting shook up.

582
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,680
They called the state police, New Mexico State Police,

583
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,160
who said that's not our jurisdiction.

584
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,760
They called the county and they told them you need to call Navajo police.

585
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,600
They called Navajo police.

586
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,480
Navajo police told them we don't have any officers that can respond to that right now.

587
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
And so they called the fire department.

588
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,360
Fire department actually responded.

589
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,000
They got about a mile away and saw this craft circling

590
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,960
and turned their fire truck around, shut the lights off and went back.

591
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,520
So obviously there's something there.

592
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,760
Oh, obviously volunteer fire department, right?

593
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,200
Is there a yeah, we didn't sign up for this.

594
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,720
You got to call the little gargoyle leprechaun department.

595
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,400
They'll come out and handle it, you know.

596
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:44,040
So one of the relatives over there starts perhaps an AK-47 and just starts shooting.

597
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,040
And the next morning he's telling everybody, I think I hit one of them.

598
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,800
So the next morning, of course, Navajo police finally shows up.

599
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,840
State police showed up.

600
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:07,160
They're all doing what officers do, stand around, smoke cigarettes and talk in a group.

601
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,960
And they're just all standing there.

602
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:19,800
And the people report that a black Cadillac Escalade with government plate showed up.

603
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,120
And the guy that got out is wearing a battle dress uniform, armed to the teeth.

604
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,720
Goes to the back of the vehicle or he goes over and talks to the group of people,

605
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:42,920
goes back to his vehicle, opens the rear hatch and takes what is described as an ice chest

606
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,120
out of the back, goes out in the field, maybe about 50 yards away,

607
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,080
opens this ice chest up and they said smoke came out of it.

608
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,760
So that tells me something like dry ice.

609
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,440
And pick something up off the ground, put it in the chest, closed it, goes back to the Escalade,

610
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,720
puts it back in the back and then drives off.

611
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:16,360
Now, I've driven GSA vehicles, government service administration vehicles before.

612
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:23,640
And I can tell you from personal experience, the government does not buy Cadillac Escalades.

613
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,440
They go with the lowest bidder.

614
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,440
So when you see a government vehicle, that's the absolute lowest bid that they could get on a

615
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,240
vehicle.

616
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,240
And we've got four Tourists this year.

617
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:35,960
Come on, everybody.

618
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,440
Yeah.

619
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,960
The men in black have a little higher, higher budget is what you're saying.

620
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:50,280
So for this guy to be driving a Cadillac Escalade tells me that it could have been one of Bigelow's

621
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,520
people that were out there.

622
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,960
How do you think they hear about this?

623
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,840
Are they listening to scanners?

624
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,680
I always wonder how it seems when we have a lot of these stories like you're telling

625
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,760
and whether it be like a big-footed shot or there's some sort of encounter where there

626
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,040
maybe is biologics.

627
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:14,040
This is the word they use now in the Oversight Committee stuff that somehow these unmarked

628
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,000
vehicles show up and they recover the evidence.

629
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,880
How do you think they know?

630
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,000
Are they listening to police scanners?

631
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,520
How do you think they find out about these things?

632
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,320
How do they know?

633
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,920
With enough urgency to get there.

634
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,640
I don't know.

635
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,680
I speculate that, yeah, they're monitoring everything.

636
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,080
We know that there are supercomputers out there.

637
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:40,760
We know that the government monitors for certain words that are used involving explosives,

638
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,040
involving plots, different things like that.

639
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:51,160
And so these computers actually have some sort of artificial intelligence where they're

640
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,240
looking at all this stuff.

641
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:01,320
So, you know, they pick up on these keywords and if UFO comes out, I'm pretty sure that,

642
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:07,000
you know, it runs an algorithm and looks at it to see if it's something.

643
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,520
In this case, Stan was assigned to investigate this case and he went out there.

644
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,600
Now, understand that we actually know these guys, these officers that are out there.

645
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,360
A lot of them we've worked with before.

646
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,800
We know a lot of them by name.

647
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,080
And he went out there and none of the police officers would talk to him.

648
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,760
I mean, just flat out cold shoulder and that was unusual.

649
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,520
And he went to the fire department, the fire department personnel, same thing.

650
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,160
They would not talk to anybody.

651
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:43,960
Yeah.

652
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,840
And, you know, really, really weird.

653
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,520
It's just like they were told, you know, you better keep your mouth shut or else.

654
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,360
And I've talked to an officer that was retiring back.

655
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,640
This is 1983.

656
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:10,280
I talked to an officer that said he saw a UFO go down in a canyon and it looked like it might

657
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,880
have been disabled in some way.

658
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,600
There were two small beings that were walking around outside of it.

659
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,720
Another UFO looked exactly like the first at another disc,

660
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,480
came down and picked up the two occupants and flew off.

661
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:32,360
Shortly after, the government came by with a low boy trailer and a bunch of soldiers

662
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:41,000
and loaded this thing up on the low boy and covered it with a tarp and hauled it off.

663
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,360
And they were told, you keep your mouth shut or something bad could happen to you

664
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,320
or your family.

665
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,120
Well, he told me he was ready to retire.

666
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,760
And, you know, he told me that this happened about 1977

667
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:02,440
between Pinyon and Chinle in one of the canyons up there.

668
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,960
So, you know, I have no reason to doubt him.

669
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,520
You know, he's he'd been doing his work for 20 plus years.

670
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,360
How strategic are they in picking locations where maybe there's like you said,

671
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,400
that one guy was living out there and he doesn't have any neighbors around?

672
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,200
Is it very isolated places where they can do what they want to do?

673
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,320
Because it doesn't sound like they want to be seen.

674
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
And it seems like they're looking for something a lot.

675
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,840
And they have a task and they're trying to perform that task.

676
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,600
And they just want as minimal involvement with humans as possible.

677
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,800
Sometimes it's strange.

678
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,560
They're like they don't care.

679
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,560
And then other times it seems like they really care.

680
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,360
What's your take on the stories you've heard over the years and the locations

681
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,480
and if there's any connection to isolated areas?

682
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,920
The government itself has put information out there

683
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,960
that there could be as many as 54 different species of alien.

684
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,000
And, you know, I find that amazing.

685
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,600
I mean, we usually only think of, you know, three or four,

686
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:18,200
you know, Nordics and reptilians and, you know, the grays and tall grays.

687
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,640
But the government has actually came out and said,

688
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,440
yeah, there could be about 54 different species that we're dealing with.

689
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:36,360
If you look at the New World back in 1492, when people started coming to the Americas,

690
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,360
they came for a whole bunch of different reasons.

691
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,760
Some came for potash.

692
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,440
Some came for mass timber.

693
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,200
Some came for gold, silver, jewels.

694
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,840
Some came for tobacco.

695
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,280
Some came to spread religion.

696
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,200
So you have all this stuff going on all at once.

697
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:04,600
And I think that's what we're seeing with these extraterrestrial or interdimensional creatures

698
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,640
coming, is that they're coming for different reasons.

699
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,120
And we can't put our finger on any one and say, oh, this is it.

700
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,560
It's just too hard to comprehend.

701
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,400
Sean, can I ask you just maybe a real general question?

702
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,120
Ranger on the Navajo reservation for, you know, 30-ish years, right?

703
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,120
Why do you think there's so much activity?

704
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,200
You think, is it the locale in the southwest, in your mind?

705
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:38,120
Is it the fact that it's such a vast territory that you just sort of,

706
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,040
by numbers, would have more weird things happen?

707
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,200
Or do you think there's something associated with the reservation itself as far as Native Americans?

708
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,960
Maybe there's more paranormal activity around reservations because Native Americans are there.

709
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,400
What is your thought process?

710
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,920
Because it's like you have this, even though it's 1% of your job, as you talked about,

711
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:07,080
you have these wild stories that seem to happen more with more frequency or more often

712
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,840
on the Navajo reservation.

713
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,800
Have you thought about or do you have any sort of hypothesis on why that is

714
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,560
and what's going on in that space?

715
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:24,040
I think that there's a greater freedom out here for UFOs and any other species to come here

716
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:31,800
because we have talked to Navajo families over and over and over and we asked them,

717
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:39,000
why don't you report this to a group like MUFON, you know, mutual UFO network,

718
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,760
you know, and have them do an investigation?

719
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:49,000
And they tell us, and this isn't just one person, this is everybody tells us,

720
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:57,160
if we report it, they will send a bunch of people up here.

721
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:02,600
They say Belagana, which means white person, a whole bunch of them will come up here

722
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,640
and they'll all stand in a big circle and hold hands and sing Kumbaya.

723
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,800
And these holy beings will no longer come here.

724
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,240
And we don't want that.

725
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,240
Because they consider them sky gods or holy people.

726
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,680
The Navajo have a dance called the Yebeche dance.

727
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:37,720
There's masked figures, they have a black head, you'll see a poster of it on Skinwalker Ranch.

728
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:44,920
And I told them that this is not a skinwalker, this is a holy person or holy being

729
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,240
called a Yebeche.

730
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,840
And they do a dance every winter.

731
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,880
There's usually 10 or 12 of them.

732
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,760
The last one in the line is always called the clown.

733
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,360
He does everything wrong, he does everything backwards, he doesn't listen,

734
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,400
he clowns around all the time.

735
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:14,920
And in Navajo culture, the clown represents the five-fingered people.

736
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,360
So he represents you and me, because we don't listen.

737
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,240
We don't listen to the teachings of the gods.

738
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,240
We do our own thing, we get in trouble, we go our own way.

739
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:34,600
And so that's, you know, a very elegant way of looking at it that, you know,

740
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,600
these gods are trying to teach us things.

741
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:45,000
And we just, we would rather war with each other and have violence and rape and murder,

742
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,920
you know, rather than listen to teachings that could actually benefit us.

743
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,240
Yeah, it's wild.

744
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,960
That's the feeling.

745
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,440
Plus, there's a lot of empty land.

746
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:09,880
I mean, you know, we have 450,000 plus Navajos that live on, you know, 27,000 square miles.

747
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,640
So there's a lot of areas where there's nothing out there.

748
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,480
Houses might be miles apart from each other.

749
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,200
And there's no, we don't have lighting.

750
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,920
A lot of places don't have electricity.

751
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,520
So it's pretty much dark all the time.

752
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,680
And you're able to go out and look up.

753
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,560
If you live in the city, you don't go outside and look up.

754
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,160
You know, you're looking at what's going to come at you, who's going to rob you or something.

755
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,480
So you're looking around you, but you're never looking up.

756
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,840
Well, it seems like they're moving into the, you know, people are looking up now in the

757
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,680
cities trying to figure out what the heck's going on.

758
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:57,400
And I think it's become like a talking point amongst peoples, obviously, since 2017,

759
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,480
when we started talking about this in the public space.

760
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,080
You know, this 54 different species is interesting to me.

761
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,240
Do you think Bigfoot is on that list?

762
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,120
Is Bigfoot a terrestrial creature or is he extraterrestrial?

763
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:09,960
What do you think?

764
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,240
My feeling is that he's interdimensional.

765
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,960
And like I said, a lot of these things, UFOs, I think, are

766
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,080
dimensional craft that are coming in.

767
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,800
I use the Hopi as an example.

768
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,280
I really think that in times past, we were able to travel

769
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,040
to different dimensions and visit other peoples.

770
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,520
This would have been done by the priests or the religious leaders in each tribe.

771
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:49,800
One of the first things that Spanish did in the 1600s when they came to the Pueblos

772
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:56,840
was to destroy the religious centers, which were the kivas, and build a church on top of them.

773
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:04,040
After that, they killed most of the priests that were doing a lot of this stuff.

774
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,480
And so I think that knowledge was lost.

775
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,800
Now, in the case of the Hopi, as in the case of a lot of other Pueblo tribes,

776
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,440
they have kachinas.

777
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:27,480
And everybody says, oh, these are representations of legends or stories of these different gods.

778
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,480
In the case of the Hopi, if you're going to collect kachinas, they have

779
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,480
240 different kachinas representing different gods.

780
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:47,480
And if you had millennia to travel an infinite number of dimensions,

781
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,800
it's possible that you could come back with 240 different descriptions

782
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,640
of what you were seeing in these other places.

783
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:04,440
And so we think that they had this contact.

784
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:12,920
You look at the skinwalker, and he can run as fast as a vehicle.

785
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:22,920
And we think that the way they travel vast distances is to slip into another dimension.

786
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,920
Remember, dimensions are considered time as a dimension.

787
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,880
And if you can manipulate that timescape,

788
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:38,040
you can slow time down, so to speak, for us and move very quickly,

789
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,760
which is what has been described to us.

790
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,520
I've interviewed people that were skinwalkers, that used to be.

791
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,360
And they tell me that when you affect the change into an animal,

792
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:57,160
that your vision gets blurry, and there's a redshift in the color spectrum,

793
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,040
which indicates to me accelerated movement.

794
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,840
Can you talk about that a bit?

795
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,280
I remember when we had our first interview, you had one story about

796
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,640
a skinwalker that was a man turned into a coyote, and he was shot.

797
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,320
And then, of course, that man turns up at a hospital next day,

798
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,160
and he's shot in the same spot.

799
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:24,520
But are there any other skinwalker encounters, you talk about interviewing him,

800
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,640
that you had on your 30-year tenure?

801
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,800
Fascinating idea there, because when we talked about this before,

802
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:41,880
there's a certain ritual that is done in order to become a skinwalker to shapeshift.

803
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,760
And you're talking about that in scientific terms, which I think is interesting.

804
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,360
You have this sort of shift in the ability to maybe

805
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,920
manipulate time or dimensionality.

806
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,640
Obviously, if you're turned into an animal and that happens, something's going on.

807
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:09,080
What did you see in your tenure when it came to this really enigmatic creature,

808
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:13,000
shapeshifter that, of course, everybody knows about now, skinwalker ranch, and this thing?

809
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,200
And I know a lot of native peoples won't say them by name, but what other stories

810
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,400
do you have encountering that kind of stuff on the reservation?

811
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,840
Well, there's lots and lots of stories.

812
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:32,760
In one of the episodes of Beyond Skinwalker, which is a spin-off of Skinwalker Ranch,

813
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:42,760
the crew came out and we went out to a place where this woman had encounters with skinwalkers.

814
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:49,640
The encounters got so bad, she was seeing deformed people walking upright

815
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:57,160
that just looked like they were melting, animals coming by that were skinwalkers.

816
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,560
She was having poltergeist activity in the house.

817
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:11,160
In one case, this black figure, one of her son-in-laws was fighting with something in

818
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:18,680
the room. I mean, it was an all-out fight. And he came flying out the door and fell onto the floor.

819
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:25,720
From the room. And she said when they looked inside, there was something of dark figure

820
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:33,880
standing there and it had antlers, like a deer. And it jumped up through a hole in the ceiling

821
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:41,960
and disappeared through the hole. The hole in the ceiling was one of these access

822
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,000
hatches. So it jumped up into the attic and disappeared.

823
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:54,120
And she says that this poltergeist activity, pianos playing by themselves,

824
00:59:54,120 --> 01:00:01,240
some things moving and Venetian blinds, you know, rattling and stuff like that, it got so bad,

825
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:07,400
her and her family literally picked up and moved out. I mean, right then,

826
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:15,560
they didn't take anything with them. They left everything and they moved. They moved to Colorado

827
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:23,640
and this thing followed them and kept torturing them. They moved to Phoenix and it followed them

828
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:33,560
there too. And she came to me, she was so desperate that somebody look into this and help her.

829
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:40,600
And so we took it on as an investigation. As a result of that investigation,

830
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:46,120
we found that there were two skinwalkers involved. We actually encountered them during

831
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,840
the filming. We saw one of them, but the film didn't pick it up.

832
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:58,840
But they were in the area around midnight. It was 15 degrees, so it was freezing.

833
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:05,000
And we kept hearing these calls or hoots or whatever from two different directions.

834
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:13,320
And we saw one of them standing on top of a mesa nearby that jumped down on the backside.

835
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,200
What did it look like, John?

836
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:23,080
In this case, we just saw the figure of a person, maybe 200 yards away. So we couldn't really tell.

837
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:29,160
And it being in the dark and we focused a light on it and that's all we could see.

838
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:37,080
So we didn't get an accurate look at it, just a glimpse. But we knew something was there.

839
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:46,760
Hardy was with me. He is a Navajo medicine man. And he said that that's what it was,

840
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:53,080
was a skinwalker. As part of the investigation and looking into this thing, I actually determined

841
01:01:53,960 --> 01:02:00,760
who these skinwalkers were by identity. I mean, they're actual flesh and blood people.

842
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:08,920
And I put word out in the community that if they continued to bother this family,

843
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:15,080
that I was going to out them to the community and let the whole community know who they were.

844
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:23,320
And I happened to know both of them. And everything stopped. A month later,

845
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:30,040
after the episode aired, this lady came running up to me in Walmart,

846
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:37,080
and she had the biggest smile on her face. And she says, everything stopped. I'm doing good.

847
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,160
So, you know, there was something good that came out of that.

848
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:48,520
John, why do you think these two individuals were doing this?

849
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,320
I mean, like, because there's-

850
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,200
Targeted.

851
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,960
Yeah. Why do you think they were targeting this family? What is the, if you will,

852
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:01,000
what's the purpose of becoming a skinwalker? Because it's like, it's dark. It's dark arts,

853
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,720
right? It's dark magic. It's this, I can't remember that. Maybe you could tell us last

854
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,160
time what sort of what you have to the process, I guess, you don't have to murder someone in

855
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:14,280
your family, or am I misremembering? Like, there has to be some sort of like blood sacrifice,

856
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,520
isn't there to be to get the ability to shape shift to become a skinwalker?

857
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:25,960
Yeah, you have to choose somebody who you love dearly to be sacrificed, to be killed,

858
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,360
for you to attain this type of power. And then you're brought into basically, you call it a

859
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:42,120
coven or a group of people that practice this, and they will teach you how to affect, you know,

860
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:49,000
just affecting the physical change into an animal is where it starts. And, but there's more,

861
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:55,720
it goes into poisons, it goes into how to do curses and plague people.

862
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,400
Sounds like witchcraft.

863
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:02,040
You know, yeah, witchcraft, basically. But you know, we're not talking about

864
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:14,840
the witches that we know about. We're talking about Navajo witchcraft. And it gets into what

865
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:23,480
is classified as frenzied witchcraft, which is a very serious thing, because now you're concocting

866
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:30,520
poisons to blow at people that can kill them without, and doctors don't know what it is.

867
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,360
They don't know how to treat it. They don't know the first thing about it. They can't even diagnose

868
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:44,040
it. But medicine men are able to cure it. I had a grandfather who was trained to be a medicine man

869
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:51,240
later on, became a preacher. And he told me that when you're taught as a medicine man,

870
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:58,840
you're taught everything. You're taught even the dark stuff. And he says, you have to know

871
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:05,960
that stuff in order to affect the cures. Because if you don't know what the witch is doing,

872
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,680
you don't have any basis to affect a cure for that person.

873
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:17,400
If you get outed as a skinwalker, as you threaten these individuals to do,

874
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,040
what does the community do? Do they kill that person? Do they respond? What happens?

875
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:29,240
In Navajo culture, it is said that if you find out the identity of one, go there and knock on

876
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:35,320
their door and tell them, I know who and what you are, that within three days, they will die suddenly.

877
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:43,160
So they try to keep that, you know, like a superhero, you know, you have to keep your

878
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:50,840
identity secret. If anybody knows who you are, you're going to die. And I have actually seen that

879
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:57,800
happen in two cases where people just that were suspected of being skinwalkers passed away

880
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,120
suddenly. No discernible reason. They just died. They were outed.

881
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,200
Is that? Yeah, somebody discovered who they were.

882
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,040
Is it like even those stories of werewolves were like, there's certain time they turn into an

883
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:17,640
animal. Like, what is the ratio between? Do you know more about how they transform into

884
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:24,120
a creature and then when they're a human being? It's my understanding that they have a whole

885
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:32,680
ceremony that they do singing. They do chance. They have to have the skin of an animal that

886
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,760
they're going to change into. Usually a coyote skin. We think that they're using the DNA

887
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:46,440
out of the skin. So we're not talking about chemical processed skins. We're talking about,

888
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:52,440
you know, just skin it off the animal and tan it and dry it, you know, and make it supple

889
01:06:53,880 --> 01:07:01,400
and then carry it with you. So we've they can we've been told that they can change into birds,

890
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:10,280
into ravens and owls. They can change into different types of animals, bears, deer,

891
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:16,280
what have you. Depends on what you have the skin and they can change into people

892
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:24,680
that look like you and me. And if they get your DNA, they can change into somebody that looks

893
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:29,800
just like you. That's terrifying. That's why we've had a couple stories. Yeah,

894
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:36,120
we actually had some people email some stories where they were reported in two places at once.

895
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:42,280
And I wonder if there was something like that going on where, you know, and just a lot of I

896
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:48,440
think these stories are important because a lot of connection between like UFO sightings and

897
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:53,960
government showing up or, you know, people seeing these skin walkers walking around or

898
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,760
people saying I wasn't there, but I was there. People saying there's time slippage,

899
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:03,240
like a UFO showed up and then I can remember where I was. And then suddenly I'm at my house

900
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:10,440
or suddenly we're like, and we're driving the wrong direction or, you know, I lost four hours.

901
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,200
I don't know where they went. I went from point A to point B. I don't know how I got there. I got

902
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:20,040
there in a few minutes. So many strange things that like all kind of tie together where there

903
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:25,240
seems to be a body of knowledge that they're operating on that we don't, we're sort of going

904
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:29,960
on our merry way and have no idea. You know, it's a different physics

905
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:36,520
that we're talking about. You know, we've looked at physics and we said, okay, this is it. This is

906
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:48,520
canon and this is all there is. And yet we see UFOs, we see these other technology that's

907
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:54,840
controlled with the mind. And we're just barely taking baby steps in that direction

908
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,640
and haven't gotten there yet.

909
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,920
Let me ask this, 30 years you're dealing with skinwalkers and UFOs and did you ever,

910
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,440
aside from the time that the orb followed you home, were there other times you really felt like

911
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:11,320
you feared for your own safety? Like your life might be on the line because of the work you're

912
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,920
doing investigating these things?

913
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:22,360
In taking skinwalker cases, you have to be very, very guarded. And you know, I'm born again

914
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:33,720
Christian, so I have my faith. On top of that, I smudge myself and use different Navajo things

915
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:45,160
like bitter medicine and lightning-struck tree medicine and things like that. It's all put

916
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:53,480
together and the intent is there. So I do pray and I've been protected. But for Stan,

917
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:59,720
he's been attacked. He's been psychically attacked. He told me one time it was like somebody

918
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:06,520
was stabbing him in the back with a knife and twisting it. And then they took that invisible

919
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:13,400
knife and stabbed him in the back of the head and just twisted it around. And he was literally

920
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:20,280
dying. I mean, he was out of it, hurting so bad. And we had a friend that was a

921
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:28,680
psychic healer and the friend decided to work on him and brought him out of it.

922
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:35,480
And so they've had quite the relationship ever since where the friend will get contacted and

923
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:42,760
he'll do remote healing for him. We had a situation in 2016 where we spoke up in Oregon

924
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:50,920
at McMinnville. And we spoke there about Skinwalkers for the very first time.

925
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:58,440
When we came back the very next weekend, between Stan and my families, there were

926
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:07,240
nine near intersection accidents or head-on collisions that occurred in our families

927
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:13,320
just over one weekend. Stan almost got hit head-on by another vehicle

928
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:19,960
and I got run off the road by an 18-wheeler. Wow. Did you attribute that protection to your

929
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:24,840
faith? Like the fact that God's protecting you from the darkness?

930
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,880
I rely on that.

931
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,000
Yeah. Where was your faith when you started your career?

932
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:38,280
It was the same. I was raised in church and similar to what you would call a

933
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:47,320
Baptist denomination, but it was interdenominational. And then I studied

934
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:57,480
for two and a half years a Bible school. So, I do have a background in religious studies,

935
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,560
I guess is what you could call it.

936
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,320
You are like a Swiss army knife, John.

937
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:07,400
You're a favorite person. That's what we do on our show all the time is sort of marry these

938
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,920
paranormal ideas with our faith and trying to figure out where they intersect and how we can

939
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,760
make more sense of them. And I love that you were not afraid of these topics because I think a lot

940
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:22,120
of people will explain away everything, but you seemed to hold that. Did you pray for a lot of

941
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:27,400
people when you were there on site? Did you have those conversations with people when they were

942
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:27,800
spooked?

943
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:37,960
No, we just talked to them. We try to give them direction as to what they can do. A lot of times,

944
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:49,000
just being there and listening to them helps. We've had people come to us in tears after we spoke

945
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:55,000
and told us that just by speaking about these subjects and bringing them out,

946
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:59,800
they were able to talk to their families and tell them about encounters that they've had when they

947
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:08,280
were children. And it's like this big emotional release that you see. We saw a 90-year-old woman

948
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:14,680
tell her kids, her grandkids, and her great grandkids about experiences she had when she

949
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:22,520
was a little girl. And she had tears running down her face, thanking us and hugging us. And her

950
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:29,000
family was just standing there with their jaws on the floor because she had never told anybody

951
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,640
these stories.

952
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:36,440
That's amazing. You give people permission to believe what they've seen and that you believe

953
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:44,520
them. And I think there's healing in that, right? I know you walked in this, but I think so many

954
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,960
people compartmentalize the weird things that happen to them and they put them away because

955
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,360
it's easier to do that than to deal with it, right? But if you tell them, I believe you,

956
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:59,640
I'll listen to your story, it's permission for them to accept that maybe it's not me,

957
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,600
I'm not a weirdo. This has actually happened and I can deal with this now.

958
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,840
You're like you're a part-time ranger, a part-time counselor, right? You're just

959
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,320
helping people realize it's okay, what you saw is real. What happened to you is real.

960
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,600
I've seen this and there's so much power I think in that.

961
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:23,640
I'm going to get really controversial here. Believe it or not, both me and Stan truly believe

962
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:28,920
that the job of a law enforcement officer is to help people.

963
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:41,240
So that said, it's not about, oh, I got a gun, I can shoot you, I can beat you to death with a baton

964
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:47,560
or pepper spray. It has nothing to do with that. That's just authority and that authority is only

965
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:55,960
as strong as the government behind it. You don't have personal power. The old commercial

966
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:01,880
of the Volkswagen, they all look the same from the bottom up. Volkswagen's going to run over you

967
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:09,000
and you're going to see the bottom. So you don't have personal power. You have that delegated

968
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:15,560
authority by the government to do what you're doing. When I used to stop people for speeding,

969
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:22,520
I'd explain to them, you're out here in the middle of nowhere. If you run off the road and crash,

970
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,960
it's going to be an hour before an ambulance can get to you. So I'm just looking for your

971
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,920
voluntary compliance to slow down and if I can get that, I'll have done my job.

972
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:41,720
Yeah. John, do you have any stories of people having these experiences and then finding faith,

973
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:50,440
like figuring out maybe there is a one above all of this, encounters with Christ or anything like

974
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:58,440
that? For most people that we talk to, a lot of them are traditional and it's just an affirmation

975
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:11,640
for them that the holy beings are still there. For Christians, it seems like there's a disconnect

976
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:19,080
because if you talk about that kind of stuff in church, well, that's demonic. That's something

977
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:25,080
that you should stay away from. Don't even talk about it. Don't go near it. And if it's happening

978
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:31,400
to you, then what are you going to do? You just button it up and all that stress builds up and

979
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:39,720
you feel like you're going crazy or why are these demons after you? On the demonic side,

980
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:47,560
what we do advertise or what we do talk about is we tell people, don't let your kids play

981
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:57,240
with Ouija boards. I don't know if you know this, but the Ouija board was actually the,

982
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:05,240
what was that famous movie with the girl, her head spinning around the exorcist. That whole

983
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:13,880
story actually started because of a Ouija board in reality. And every young person that we talk to,

984
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:22,360
and every young person that we talk to has told us that a Ouija board has ruined their life

985
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:28,760
and they wish they had never seen it. I've never heard a story that said,

986
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:37,000
oh yeah, we have a Ouija board and it's great. So one of the things that we tell people is don't

987
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:45,000
use these things because we've been told that a Ouija board is actually an unfiltered portal.

988
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:52,920
And you open that portal up, you don't know what's going to come through. It might be something

989
01:17:52,920 --> 01:18:00,120
fairly innocent, or it could be something really scary. And once you let it out,

990
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:06,120
you can't close that door. I think there's probably more ways that they're figuring out

991
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:13,080
how to get these portals into people's hands. And obviously that's what we find in our show too,

992
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:18,920
is that there is this disconnect with Christians who seem to be afraid to talk about this stuff,

993
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:28,520
seem to be afraid to name it and have a discussion that's difficult, right? That we don't know a lot

994
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:33,000
and for some reason, I don't know why the church has sort of put a lid on a lot of those

995
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:39,880
conversations. And I think that's what we try to talk about them here, is, you know, it exposes

996
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:45,960
that, exposes the darkness. And you were kind of hinting at that earlier, when you were talking

997
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:51,480
about the medicine man, is that he needed to know so he could help people, right? And I think in some

998
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:57,400
ways, people need to understand this whole kingdom of darkness, if they're going to fight against it,

999
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:02,040
right? They're going to do anything about it, that it's after you, it's going to get you,

1000
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:05,160
and you could stumble into it accidentally because of naivety. You just

1001
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:10,840
make a naive decision and then you fall into it, you know? And I think that more context,

1002
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:15,080
more knowledge isn't a bad thing, but for some reason, the church seems to paint it that way,

1003
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:20,280
you know? If you know about it, it's fine. The church, the organized religion, okay? I'm not

1004
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:29,800
talking about individual faith. I'm talking about the big church. You run into the situation where,

1005
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:35,800
well, I'm this denomination, and if you're a different denomination, you're a heretic,

1006
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:42,520
or, you know, you're going to hell. My way is the only way. You know, we look at it

1007
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:56,440
as good energy, you know, positive energy and negative energy. And they have to coexist,

1008
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:04,600
really. You know, you can't have one and not have the other. You're going to make a Star Wars

1009
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:14,760
reference, you know? You have the force and you have the evil side. And the thing is, is that

1010
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:22,040
they both, in order to have that yin and yang, that balance in nature, you have to have both of them.

1011
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:31,400
And it's up to you to make a conscious decision of what you're going to do. In Navajo, they have,

1012
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:39,960
you know, something called ke, or, you know, this idea of hojo, which is balance. And you're trying

1013
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:47,160
to live in a balanced life. You understand that there's bad things out there. You have

1014
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:55,160
the responsibility of deciding for yourself which direction you're going to go and keep that in

1015
01:20:55,160 --> 01:21:05,560
balance. In religious studies, you try to have so much faith that there's no chance that the evil

1016
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:13,000
is going to come up against you. And we do this in semantics. We have names for it. So we say

1017
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:21,400
demons and the devil. And, you know, demons, they're not little red things running around

1018
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:30,840
the landscape with little horns and tails and pitchforks. They are fallen angels that look

1019
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:39,240
just like a regular angel. And they're strong. They're powerful. And they can appear as angels

1020
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:48,280
of light when they're actually demonic in nature. So there's room for a lot of confusion.

1021
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:53,720
And you can go down the wrong rabbit hole and end up somewhere that you don't want to be.

1022
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:58,920
Yeah, in the wrong portal, if you will, John. Yeah, there's so many of those conversations

1023
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:04,280
we have. And a lot of people come out of those things. And when you give them a context and more

1024
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,160
clues of, hey, that's probably not a good thing, you know. And it's hard because humans are

1025
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:15,480
impressionable. And we listen to things. And if it feels good, we go with it, right? And as we know

1026
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:19,640
that there are a lot of ways that we can be manipulated, especially those who are more

1027
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:25,160
empathetic. All these good parts of us can be easily hijacked. So, John, thank you for coming

1028
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,680
back on our show. Thanks for coming back on Blurred Creatures and talking about this. We'll have to

1029
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:34,760
do this again, hopefully in person. Yeah, there's so much more. We'd love that. Especially when your

1030
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,680
book comes out, John, you have to come back and sit with us here and we can talk about the book

1031
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:45,960
and jump into this so much more. But grateful for your time. This is fun to do it the second time.

1032
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,280
Of course, I'm the biggest fan of our first episode and those stories. And I love hearing

1033
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:54,360
about your work and then the intersection between your faith and your work, I think,

1034
01:22:54,840 --> 01:23:00,600
really the fasting juxtaposition of your life story. And we're grateful. So thanks so much.

1035
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:05,160
And looking forward to the book and let the folks know if there's somewhere they can interact with

1036
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,960
what you're doing, maybe when your book may come out, if they want to see

1037
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,280
places you've been doing interviews, et cetera. And your podcast. Yeah.

1038
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:23,400
Dan's book is The Paranormal Ranger. And my book is still in the works. And then our podcast is

1039
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:30,040
Native Paranormal Crossroads featuring The Paranormal Rangers.

1040
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,200
Well, thanks, John. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for having me again. Yeah. Great to see you.

1041
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:42,440
Yeah. Thanks for being a guest and coming back. And we'll do it again. I know we will. And I

1042
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,520
appreciate you being honest and vulnerable about your faith and where it all ties in and just your

1043
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:51,480
whole career. And we need more people like that in this space, especially with all the weird stuff

1044
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:56,520
coming down the pipe. We need more and more Christians who've had experience with these

1045
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:03,800
things to kind of give it sort of a more context so people can have a better interpretation of

1046
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:08,760
what's happening and not be afraid and not come up with their own conclusions and come up with

1047
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:16,360
wild ideas of what's happening. But we'll talk soon, John. Thanks again. Yeah. OK. Thanks.
